The Prague Stock Exchange fell to a minus by the end of the trade
After the early morning collapse, the Prague Stock Exchange corrected the losses.
Transactions with <0xC4><0x8C>EZ shares reached almost half of the normal daily trade.
The Prague Stock Exchange has continued to fall by almost six percent since the start of Tuesday’s trade on Monday.
This time, there is a decline in Wall Street stocks.
This is how the market reacts to the result of the vote of the U.S. House of Representatives, which refused to support the plan to stabilise the financial sector there.
Fall of stocks in Asia
A dramatic fall on Tuesday saw stocks on stock exchanges in Asia, although the indices eventually wiped out some of the losses over the course of the day.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng stock index declined nearly four percent during trading, but later erased some of the losses and reduced the decline to around 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, which tracks the movement of Chinese stocks on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, fell by 3.8 percent, with markets closed in Shanghai.
Shares on the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than five percent, but eventually lost 4.3 percent.
The storm in Taiwan, according to the index, fell by 3.6 percent.
“The timing of the US bailout is uncertain and will affect financial markets around the world,” said Joseph Yam, the head of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.
Hong Kong, although part of China, decides its monetary policy independently, i.e. without dependence on the Chinese central bank.
Hong Kong has interest rates at the same level as the United States.
U.S. lawmakers, according to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, should quickly return to negotiations and approve a proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, the impact will be felt by other countries as well.
The Bloody Bath of U.S. Stocks
The U.S. House of Representatives on Monday rejected a plan to support the financial system, which was to be spent up to $700 billion (almost CZK 12 trillion).
Lawmakers ignored President George W. Bush’s call to back the plan.
According to Bush, the plan would address the underlying causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
U.S. stocks suffered a bloodbath on Monday and major stock indices recorded the biggest drop in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones index fell by almost seven percent, and a similar decline was the last time in 1987.
The index dropped before the vote, but once it turned out that the bill was not passed in the House, the index was in a free fall.
Congress Resigns: U.S. Government May Pump $700 Billion Into Banks
U.S. Congress and President George W. Bush’s government have agreed on a broader form of financial aid agreement for the U.S. financial system.
Voting on it will be at the beginning of next week.
U.S. lawmakers have made a breakthrough in talks to approve a bailout plan in the form of $700 billion in financial aid to the U.S. financial system (approximately CZK 12 trillion).
However, it is not yet won.
Congressmen must complete some details of the agreement before they can publish the final form of the law and vote on it.
The plan to support the financial system will be discussed at the floor of the House of Representatives on Monday.
On Sunday, Barney Frank, chairman of the Banking and Financial Services Committee, told Reuters.
According to sources, the Senate could vote on the plan at the earliest on Wednesday.
According to economists, the announcement that the bailout plan will be approved should be the first significant psychological factor for the recovery of financial markets.
Then, however, there will be a "simplification" thanks to the complexity of the mechanisms, such as helping the markets to reach even in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
“We have made great progress.
We have resolved our differing views on what the shape of the package to stabilize the market should look like," Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, told Bloomberg.
She said the final vote could be held on Sunday.
Lawmakers met with U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson on Sunday night to give a definitive look to the government fund.
It should buy off unsold mortgage assets from financial companies that drag financial firms into heavy losses and endanger the stability of the entire system.
“We are on the verge of a definitive agreement on a plan that will work and must also be effective in the market.
We still have to go on with the recovery plan, but I think we're there," Paulson said.
Signal for Asian Commerce
The global financial crisis has a significant impact on stock markets, which are declining sharply.
According to Democratic Senator Harry Reid, lawmakers are trying to get a definitive deal in Congress on Sunday.
They want to reassure investors before trading in Asian financial markets, which are the first time zone where Congress’s decision could affect Monday’s trading.
It is not yet clear, however, when the two chambers of the U.S. Congress will vote on the bill, nor whether the last-minute negotiations will be able to fix a problem.
The legislature hopes it will be approved in the next few days.
However, the law still recognizes a number of changes.
The total amount allocated for assistance to the system shall be divided into two parts.
The initial $350 billion is to be made available as soon as possible, as President George Bush has demanded.
However, Congress can block the release of the remaining amount if it feels that the program is not fulfilling its function, followed by another $100 billion and later the final $350 billion.
Bush Appreciates Progress in the Negotiations
The president may veto the decision, but Congress may override the veto.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of the program, which was to obtain funding for the purchase of bad mortgage securities, whose value has collapsed, because hundreds of thousands of Americans are unable to repay their mortgages, remains.
"We worked out everything.
"The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the bill on Sunday and the Senate on Monday," Republican Senator Judd Gregg said.
U.S. President Bush is also pleased with the progress in the negotiations.
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, said Bush was satisfied with Saturday’s progress and praised “the bilateral effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economies.”
Restriction of gold parachutes
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd, the chief negotiator, said legislators agreed on responsibility for the money program, protecting taxpayers from losses, closing relief, timing funding the plan.
The new law also aims to limit so-called gold rushes for directors of companies participating in the program and establish a committee to oversee the fund.
It should be run by the Ministry of Finance.
“We have worked very hard on this and have made great progress towards an agreement that will work and be useful for the market and for all Americans,” Paulson said.
The plan also counts on help for homeowners who have problems with repayment.
The government should negotiate new repayments on the mortgages it buys, in order to reduce the monthly repayment costs for debtors and allow them to keep their homes.
Mark: Psychological assistance
According to the chief economist of Patria Finance, David Mark, the proposed plan is a good idea, but its implementation will be very difficult.
“It’s because we don’t know what mechanism and at what price the problem assets will be redeemed.
This will determine how the financial sector and the government will divide the losses among themselves," Marek told iHNed.cz this week.
Whether the plan will be approved now, or early next week, Mark says it's not that significant.
"It is much more important that this week Congressmen agree to support this plan and to sanction it as soon as possible.
The psychological significance of the agreement on approval is the most important at the moment," Marek stressed.
Battle of the Blades: MP3 Players Against Mobiles.
We will advise how to choose
While almost every mobile phone can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can make a phone call.
From this, it seems clear that it is better to just buy a phone.
However, there are plenty of reasons why a person should buy a separate player.
The choice depends entirely on the method of use and the claims of the future owner.
It’s hard to get a high-end, expensive gramophone at home to listen to Maxim Turbulenc’s latest album.
However, such music products on LPs do not originate and there is no objective reason for this, from a qualitative point of view.
However, if your shelves are squeezed by vinyl with art rock, jazz or blues, you probably at least dream of such a gramophone.
The same is true with music on the go, that is, music compressed, simplified - music in MP3.
There are also price and quality categories.
For someone, it can be unacceptable to spend $8,000 on a player, just as a Pink Floyd fan might hardly bite the headphones for $20 off the market.
Two extremes, between which there is enough space for everyone.
The choice is wide.
It also determines the battery life
Some state-of-the-art music players can do much more than just play music, but what most mobile phones don’t do by chance.
No current device is as versatile as a phone.
In addition to its primary functions, telephony and texting, it can play music and video, both record, have a better, a worse camera and maybe even navigate.
And when you consider smartphones and communicators, you will have a small computer in your pocket.
It's a little miracle, because no refrigerator can grill, and no TV can photograph anything.
The universality of the mobile also brings disadvantages.
The more features you use on your mobile, the sooner the indicator on the display will send you to the charger.
And playing music is one of the biggest energy chips.
A handful of mobile phones can play music for more than ten or twelve hours, usually much less.
In this direction, the music players (especially the simplest ones) are significantly more powerful.
For cheap phones, you should expect that they won’t be playing for more than a few hours.
If you still call here and there, get another charger to work for safety - this also applies to more expensive devices.
With MP3 players, you won’t have this problem, even the worse ones will last at least 9 hours of continuous operation on a single charge.
Another problem arises when recording music to a mobile phone.
Unfortunately, only a limited part of the devices has a universal USB connector, and not all of them can be connected directly to the computer without special software.
Of course, music can be recorded directly to the memory card, but only a handful of card readers can cope with the miniature memory cards that are used in mobile phones without any reduction.
You don’t need any special software for players except for iPods.
Just fill the device with music via USB from your computer.
Most mobile phones and players will create a music library by themselves, sorted by the name of the performer, the name of the album, the genre or, for example, the user’s rating.
Some devices only display the tree structure of directories similar to Explorer in Windows, and some can do both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smartphones with an operating system).
Players are easier to operate, mobiles are more capable
When choosing a particular device, be particularly interested in the battery life, memory capacity, quality and type of audio output and, of course, the comfort of control.
If your music is primarily a backdrop and if you listen to it every day just for a short time on the tram, you just need any phone that plays MP3.
This is something that almost any mobile phone can do.
You don’t have to monitor too much what music formats your mobile phone or player can.
MP3 will handle all and the vast majority of the music that comes to you will be in this format.
It is one of the most widely used and in addition to it, the vast majority of instruments can also handle music in WMA format.
There is less AAC (the format used by Apple and its iPods).
Better mobile phones also make it possible to buy music online, for example.
All you need to do is visit the relevant website of the operator (or other provider) and purchase a song or album via the mobile internet.
This service in itself could already be a good argument for the purchase of a music mobile.
Unfortunately, the offer of operators is poor and is usually limited to fast-tracked radio hits.
Prices are also not the lowest.
In general, however, this method of selling music (whether via GSM, internet or wireless internet) is expected to dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people carry their mobile phones with them.
Whenever you get the urge to listen to something, you record the phone in your pocket, while the MP3 player lies forgotten at home.
However, it still depends on whether you are always wearing headphones or at least a wire-free.
If not, you can use an integrated speaker that has almost every mobile phone, but only a minimum of MP3 players.
Probably the biggest advantage of music phones will be the price for many.
The cheapest ones are usually under 3,000.
For three and four thousand kroner you already get a very decent walkman.
Most of the time, however, you will be limited by the absence of output to regular headphones.
The best and technically the most equipped phones even with a 3.5 mm headphone jack cost up to fifteen thousand.
The advantage of the players is, among other things, easy to operate.
The simplest - not necessarily the cheapest (see our selection) - the players will be able to really control everyone.
The minimum of features, the similarity of the controls to the previous standard cassette player or even the gramophone is obvious.
There is no risk of collision in the form of an incorrectly turned on mobile internet and subsequently a huge account for data transmission.
What kind of device to touch
Even the cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have slots on memory cards (type M2, microSD, etc.).
Even with the purchase of the corresponding card, you will fit in to two thousand kroner.
Be careful, though.
For basic models, only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB are supported.
Only the most expensive ones can handle 8GB of memory.
If you already have a mobile phone and still want to buy a cheap MP3 player, touch on Cowon, Creativ, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB) you do not have to spend more than 1,100 kroner.
If you’re one of the more demanding listeners, you’d rather reach out to specialized mobile phones – walkmanets (Sony Ericsson, some Nokias and Samsungs).
These devices have separate control buttons for MP3 and the comfort of the operator is thus closer to a separate MP3 player.
Next up is Sony Ericsson, whose walkman phones have the same user interface as the separately sold MP3 players.
The same service and in the same price category up to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>4,000, but with a larger memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery life (usually 15 hours, up to a maximum of 35 hours), MP3 players will take you away from the above-mentioned brands.
The first virtual operator will arrive in the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe.
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite advanced and our operators offer practically all services as their partners in Western Europe.
Still, we're missing something here - a virtual operator that would force the classics to be discounted.
Maybe it won't be long.
About the fact that Czech operators are one of the most expensive in Europe, we have written many times on Mobil.cz.
This was confirmed by the Czech Republic, which pointed out that the price of SMS is higher in our country than in the rest of the Union.
After the last steps of the European Commission in the field of regulation of roaming charges, there may be a paradoxical situation - for some customers of Czech mobile operators SMS from abroad will be cheaper than at home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic are kept so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is no competition that really wants to get into the fight.
Maybe it sounds paradoxical, because we have three mobile networks here and penetration is well over 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to bet that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this, they are often invited by the Chairman of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Authority (<0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>), Pavel Dvo<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xA1>k, who has stated several times in the past that there is no place for another operator in the Czech Republic.
It’s probably true that the classic operator with his own network probably doesn’t have too many chances anymore (by the way, it would probably be hard to look for the frequencies).
But there is another option – a virtual operator.
It was the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market that brought about a significant reduction in prices, to which the classic operators had to respond.
Even before the launch of Tesco Mobile and Virgin Mobile, similar voices were heard in the UK as in the UK.
However, it turned out that the place for such operators is and can be really successful.
We don’t have to go too far for examples.
In February this year we informed you about the launch of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland.
In just six months, this operator managed to acquire more than 100,000 customers and become the fifth-largest operator there.
At the same time, behind Mobilking is the financial group Penta, which owns, among other things, U:fona in the Czech Republic.
The advantage of virtual operators is the ability to focus on a much more specific target group.
In order for them to function effectively, they have far fewer customers than a conventional operator.
They do not entail relatively high costs for the construction, operation and maintenance of the mobile network.
In the world, virtual operators usually profile themselves as low-cost – they offer cheap calls and SMS, which is often balanced by a narrower offer of services.
For example, Tesco Mobile in the UK offers SMS at least half cheaper than its competitors.
But as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can be quite good to bet on a non-triggered target group.
This is because the operator focuses specifically on men.
“Administrative men choose Mobilking – an operator they like and can trust,” says David Seibertz, CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, which operates this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say whether a similar concept as in Poland could be captured by us.
Vodafone spokesperson Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> said: “The Czech market is relatively small for a segmental approach on which most virtual operators are based.
In addition, it is relatively saturated in terms of service offerings."
In the Czech Republic, no chance, mobile operators say
However, it seems almost certain that if there is a virtual mobile operator in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
"We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, but the negotiations in the Czech Republic do not look too hopeful.
Rather, Mobilking will be launched in other countries of our region," Jana Studni<0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1>, a spokesman for the financial group Penta, told Mobil.cz.
Indirectly, she confirmed that the existing mobile operators in the Czech Republic are definitely not inclined to this idea.
On the contrary, he is trying to do everything in his power to prevent any potential competitor from forming.
Interest in launching a virtual mobile operator has not been hidden for a long time by the GTS Novera group, which would like to take the next step towards becoming a real competitor of Telef<0xC3><0xB3>nica O2 in the field of corporate customers.
“We have a strong interest in being able to offer our customers not only solid, but also mobile telecommunications services.
And the sooner, the better.
We have repeatedly negotiated this option with all Czech mobile operators.
We have already made progress in the negotiations with some of them," says Pavel Kaidl, a spokesman for the group.
So maybe he's blinking for a better time.
From unofficial information, it seems that we should expect the first virtual operator perhaps by the end of the year.
For now, however, its formation is accompanied by an impenetrable wall of silence.
"At the moment, we do not think that there is room in the Czech market for the creation of a full-fledged virtual operator.
The Czech market is very specific compared to other markets.
So far, no subject with a comprehensive and serious project in this area has contacted us," Vlastimil Sr<0xC5><0xA1>en, from the press office of Telef<0xC3><0xB3>nica O2, said in his statement to Mobil.cz.
Other operators are also referring to the specificity of the Czech market.
T-Mobile spokeswoman Martina Kemrov<0xC3><0xA1> adds in a rare way to the O2 statement: "We have not yet recorded any viable and bilaterally beneficial business project on which it could be further built."
He adds: “It’s hard to find a virtual operator on the T-Mobile network by the end of the year.
At this point, we would already have to have a specific agreement on the table in order to be able to think about it in this short term."
Vodafone is reluctant to meet the requirements of its own 3G license.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> says: “By negotiating with potential virtual operators, we are open, especially in the area of cost-sharing and infrastructure.
This is what we consider to be the most profitable from the point of view of customers.
Vodafone’s main strategy in this area is to find a partner to build a shared network for fast mobile internet.”
Responsible authorities - with operators one hand
The procedure of mobile operators can be easily understood, the entry of another operator would mean increased competition, would lead to a decrease in prices and thus a decrease in their profits.
So why make it easier for such a competitor?
The fact that when the operators are about something, they are able to pull a rope, also testifies to the formation of the U:phone.
Probably the greatest pressure towards the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> was at the time of the creation of the U:phone from T-Mobile.
This is evidenced by publicly available information from the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> website.
Now, however, U:phone is suitable as an argument why not allow a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrov<0xC3><0xA1> added: “The competitive environment of the mobile market has recently been reinforced by the entry of the fourth mobile operator into the market.
Given the nature of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is clear that the entry of another player would place high demands on him and especially on his services."
However, in view of this approach of mobile operators, the absolute disinterest of Czech regulators is directly striking.
This is not just about the attitude of the Czech Republic, which, unfortunately, in the Czech Republic – unlike the UK and other developed countries – does not have the power to interfere in competition.
They belong exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Competition (OECD).
But he took his typical stance on the whole issue.
“A virtual operator’s entry into the mobile market would be possible after the conclusion of a contract between the mobile operator and the virtual operator for the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
No such contract has been concluded so far, as the offer of potential stakeholders was probably not interesting enough for classical operators," Kristi<0xC3><0xA1>n Chalupa from the Department of External Relations of the EEAS said in answer to our question.
From the representatives of the operators, the expression thus formulated is probably not surprising.
From an authority to represent the interests of consumers and, among other things, to ensure that no one exploits their position on the market, this is more than considered.
Especially when Kristi<0xC3><0xA1>n Chalupa adds: "Overseas, where virtual operators operate normally, we can observe that their entry into the market has contributed to the reduction of prices for mobile phone services."
However, it seems that the pressure on the proper functioning of the market environment and the fall in prices are not in the interests of the OCTs.
In fact, shocking to the whole case is the tangible convergence of the three mobile operators, which results from their reactions.
The question, if it is really just a coincidence, is offered entirely by itself.
Just like the exact same price of gasoline at the pumping stations, it is certainly just a matter of chance and a tough competitive fight.
“The Office has not found any signs of anti-competitive conduct in this case and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the operators has a dominant position and therefore does not have a corresponding increased responsibility for their actions on the market.
The tools needed to open up the mobile market for virtual operators are likely to meet the telecom regulator,” Chalup said in a statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position in the market is one of many controversial points.
Of course, there is an analysis of relevant markets developed by <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>, according to which telecommunications is the only market from the point of view of competition.
In such a market, of course, none of the Czech operators have a dominant position.
However, some legal experts offer a different view - the creation of a virtual operator always requires the consent of the network operator.
And the mobile operator - quite logically - has a monopoly on its network.
So in a certain segment it must necessarily be dominant.
However, even if we do not allow this argument, it should be at least a warning for the EEA that the three mobile operators are acting in a conspicuous manner.
However, the complaints of a number of interested parties (including the aforementioned company GTS Novera) show that they encounter very similar obstacles when negotiating with all operators.
The exercise of responsibility for the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> is then a fairly common trick in telecommunications, which the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS gives away from the whole matter.
We've met him in a couple of similar cases.
Unfortunately, until the recently adopted novel of the telecommunications law, the extension of the competence of the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> to the field of competition in telecommunications failed to promote, although a number of experts promised an improvement in the situation.
The UOHS representatives need to know this more than well, but apparently their interests are elsewhere.
It works when no one is looking
However, the operation of some pseudo-virtual operators remains unnoticed, of which there are several in Czech mobile networks.
They are companies issuing their own price lists of mobile phone services, which are public only in part.
This is usually the case for companies that are engaged in multi-level marketing.
Own mobile phone services such as Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others.
The price lists of these companies usually only reach the selected ones.
The magic lies in the fact that the company acts against the operator as a classic corporate customer who orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As a significant customer, you will then receive special price (and other) offers.
The problem is that the commercial conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit similar resale.
"If there were cases you are talking about, it could be a breach of the terms of the contract that we would deal with and could result in the termination of cooperation with the company in question," said Martina Kemrov<0xC3><0xA1>.
However, it is quite unlikely that such activity would not be tolerated by responsible people from mobile operators.
Especially in the case of the three companies mentioned, it can be thousands of customers.
However, none of the operators will stop this process.
In fact, these companies have immeasurable profits from their activities and, unlike real virtual operators, they do not threaten their own official marketing.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> points out the possible problems: "The law allows similar speculation, but only a negligible percentage of customers use the services of these companies.
In addition, they must accept that the SIM card on their phone is not in their name, so they cannot have it in full as regular customers of mobile operators."
But that’s what should be at least strange.
In addition, another question is being raised for <0xC3><0x9A>ohs.
If mobile operators close their eyes to a similar procedure, why are they blocking the creation of a virtual operator?
It should be added that the UCITS has relatively strong powers to disclose similar activities and, if it does not wish, does not have to be satisfied with the operator’s explanation that they have no knowledge of such activities and their commercial conditions prohibit it.
When we won't be the most expensive
As it has fallen several times in the text, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market has brought a noticeable drop in prices for services.
Virtually in all countries where virtual operators were created, the classical operators tried to defend their creation more or less.
The arguments they used were virtually identical - too small, possibly too saturated market, problems with the quality of services, etc.
In developed countries, however, it was at this very moment that regulators intervened, which defended not the interests of mobile operators but their customers.
Whether through formal measures or informal pressure, the first virtual operator was created and another one was added to it.
Unfortunately, Czech regulators are throwing the whole case over like a hot potato.
From our experience, we cannot get rid of the impression that the ambiguity in competencies is more than suited to them in these cases.
But let's not put the flour in the grain.
If the background information is correct and the virtual operator will really soon appear with us, the Czech mobile market may be expanding again.
If one of the operators has agreed to the creation of a virtual mobile operator, it will be difficult for the OHCHR to remain ineligible to refuse (discriminate) other interested parties.
And we must stop calling the rails than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to four versions of the new version of the Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek on the occasion of the Czech State Day ceremonially presented new recordings of the national anthem Kde dom mie.
The anthem was recorded by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> B<0xC4><0x9B>lohl<0xC3><0xA1>vk.
There are four versions available - with male or female solo singing, in choral performance and instrumental lyrics.
The song was performed by Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Kn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD>nkov<0xC3><0xA1> and Adam Plachetka.
The song was edited by Otakar Jeremiah and Jaroslav Kr<0xC4><0x8D>ek.
On iHNed.cz you can listen to all four versions.
B<0xC4><0x9B>lohl<0xC3><0xA1>vek considers the Czech national anthem to be one of the most beautiful anthems.
He told Czech Radio earlier that he deliberately chose singers with young representative voices, which are prominent and popular, for the singing of solo variants.
“From the beginning, I tried to take care of both, and then the congregation, so that they had a clear dictation, so that the text was well understood, so that they could sympathize,” he said.
The Czech national anthem will celebrate its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Where My Home was first played in 1834 on the boards of the Stavovska Theatre in the original Czech play Fidlova<0xC4><0x8D>ka Josef Kajet<0xC3><0xA1>n Tyla supplemented by music by Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek <0xC5><0xA0>kroupa.
It gained popularity and people spontaneously took it for theirs.
The first verse of the song became a natural part of the national anthem after Czechoslovakia was formed in 1918.
One of the seven state symbols remained after the creation of the independent Czech Republic.
What is the “new” anthem?
Prague MHD on Wednesday for the first time on a chip
Wednesday, October 1, 2008 will be entered in the history of the Prague Transport Company as the date when the first passengers to enter the metro, tram and buses will have an electronic voucher in their pocket instead of a paper ticket.
At the moment, it can be purchased by about a hundred thousand people who own an Opencard chip card.
Passengers can purchase a 30-day and 90-day and annual voucher (this will be valid from 1 January 2009) and at the same time have it uploaded to their chip card in the infocenters and workplaces of the Transport Company at the metro stations Museum, M<0xC5><0xAF>stek, N<0xC3><0xA1>dra<0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD> Hole<0xC5><0xA1>ovice, And<0xC4><0x9B>l, Roztyly, Ko, Ra<0xC5><0x88>an.
Coupons can also be purchased online from yesterday on the website of the Transport Company www.dpp.cz.
The service was used by more than four hundred customers by the afternoon.
Those who start using the online store can definitely forget about the outlet windows at the subway stations, where they have so far had to regularly post on long fronts on paper tickets.
The coupon will be purchased online and uploaded to the Opencard card at one of the thirteen branches of the City Library.
"In these places, passengers have a ticket with a trained service, which will help those interested in online shopping and also upload the purchased coupon to their card," said project spokesman Martin Opatrn<0xC3><0xBD>.
In addition to the libraries, it will be possible to upload electronic coupons on the Opencard also in self-service vending machines, which are mounted in several subway halls.
What do these machines look like?
They are red, they remind ticket markers and passengers may have noticed them at the subway stations Roztyla, Budejovice, I.P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavsk<0xC3><0xA1>.
"There are now five of them in the city, but by the end of the year there should be eighty of them," added the Guardian.
Coupon checks the location of the ATM driver
The operation of the machines that will start working tomorrow is simple.
Simply insert an Opencard chip card into them and the previously paid voucher will be loaded on it itself.
Electronic coupons from tomorrow are valid not only in the capital, but also in its surroundings.
That is, in suburban trains and bus lines with numbers 300 to 499, which travel to the capital mainly by the inhabitants of the Central Bohemian municipalities.
"On trains included in the Prague Integrated Transport, the guides are equipped with card readers, with the help of which they determine the time and band validity of the vouchers," explained ticket inspection Filip Dr<0xC3><0xA1>pal of the organization Ropid, which composes the timetables of the Prague public transport.
City buses have card readers built into the cash register next to the driver.
It is therefore necessary not only to show the chip card to the driver at the entrance, but also to attach the Opencard to the designated location on the side of the cash register.
This way the driver checks the validity of the uploaded coupons.
"If a passenger needs to verify the validity of the uploaded coupons, there is nothing easier than asking the driver for this information," Dr<0xC3><0xA1>pal added.
Passengers who do not ride the suburban buses and will not remember when the coupon expires can go back to the self-service vending machines, where the coupons are uploaded to the card.
Here, information about the validity of their documents is displayed on the display of the device.
The U.S. wanted a referendum.
The Sudeten Germans in 1945 asked for the inclusion of <0xC5><0xA0>umava into the United States.
It comes from a letter that is stored in the collections of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
If we can’t be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live under the patronage of the United States.
With such a wish, some groups of Sudeten Germans reportedly turned to the President of the United States in 1945.
This is due, among other things, to a letter that was kept in a private archive and is now stored in the collections of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
The Germans from Czech Krumlov are asking in a letter to the US president not to allow the return of the "Sumava county" - taken by Hitler on the basis of the Munich agreement - to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation correctly and want to be really sure in words that American troops are coming to German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," the letter reads, signed with the words "People whose fate lies at the heart of the forest".
Because the connection to Czechoslovakia is supposed to give the Sudeten Germans - with knowledge of the Czech national character - only hope for brutality, recklessness, misunderstanding, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter of the American president ask that he take over <0xC5><0xA0>umava as a more conservative protectorate.
"We cannot believe that, regardless of the opinion of a quarter of a million people, you would admit this territory to a foreign state that is repressing and repulsing minorities and nothing at all contributed to the victory of the Allies," the letter reads.
The reason why the authors are unable to sign is supposedly the fear of revenge by the "Czech oppressors".
If the U.S. president was supposed to question the thinking of the Schuman Germans, it would suffice to hold a referendum in Schuman County on whether its residents want to be part of the U.S. or live under the patronage of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may sound a little naive in the knowledge of post-war history today, according to some memoirs it appropriately reflects the expectations of the Sudeten Germans at the time.
Although the Czech Germans had at least to know that it would be their withdrawal from the republic, few of them had ever conceded such an opportunity.
Some expected the United States and the United Kingdom to negotiate some kind of autonomy for the Sudeten.
Others believed that they would just stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is also confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice.
During the wars, he was a Budejovice German assigned to the Baltic navy.
When he was captured by the British at the end of the war and placed in a captive camp in Holstein, dozens of other Czech Germans followed him to teach them Czech.
"They believed that when they came home, the Czech language would be good for them," Chalupa said.
None of the German prisoners who lived before the war in Czechoslovakia, according to him, did not expect to be expelled from the republic on the basis of Bene<0xC5><0xA1> decrees.
You don't think you'll pay!
Emotional campaign will attack drivers.
The most expensive action focused on road safety in Czech history.
Even so, it could be characterized by an emotional media campaign, which the Ministry of Transport intends to launch on Wednesday.
Minister Ale<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0xA0>eb<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ka’s office promises to warn drivers of dangerous driving behaviour.
The $150 million campaign will appear on television, radio, cinema, on the Internet, but also on the fly.
It should discourage drivers from fast driving and alcohol behind the wheel.
And also remind them to join before they leave.
He wants to reach out to young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and, last but not least, professional drivers.
What will appear in the spots?
Mainly human stories that attack the emotions.
And this is evidenced by the "bloody" slogan of the entire campaign:
You don't think you'll pay!
The word "don't think" is written in capital letters.
And in the blood clot, there is the word "you pay."
This is meant to symbolize that a person can pay his own life in a moment of inattention.
The spectators will "fear" the spots until 2010.
The ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where images with drastic images of the victims of the accident can commonly be seen.
It promises that this will reduce accidents and the death toll on Czech roads.
The spots were prepared by Euro RSCG.
Sugar and punch on the driver
"The system of sugar and whips pays the driver.
Sugar for them is that, for example, when they go to the red, it saves time.
A beating is a threat of punishment or an accident.
Drivers must be reminded of the risk," says transport psychologist Na Homolce hospital Martin Ko<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xA1>n.
And that is why there is a need for information campaigns in the press and, above all, negative advertising, says the psychologist.
According to him, already less effective are the boards that warn drivers of the danger.
"If a static hazard warning board is installed, it will probably soon merge with the environment and drivers will not devote themselves to it," Ko<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xA1>n said.
Olmert would return almost all of the occupied territories in exchange for peace
Provisional Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert expressed his support for the return of virtually all of the territories occupied in 1967, including the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with the Palestinians and Syria.
He did so in an interview published by Jediot Achronot on Monday.
"We need to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that almost all, if not all, of the (occupied) territories will have to be returned," Olmert told the newspaper.
“We will keep a certain percentage of these territories, but we will have to give the Palestinians a similar percentage [Israeli territory], because without it there will be no peace,” he added.
He admitted that a possible return would include East Jerusalem as well.
"Anyone who wants security in Jerusalem and especially does not want tractors or bulldozers to cross his feet, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up part of Jerusalem," Olmert noted in a note on the two July attacks, and would have been among those behind them.
According to the prime minister, it will be necessary to find "special solutions for the Temple Mount, sacred and historic sites" that lie inside the Old Town.
“Whoever wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
It won't work," he continued.
Departure from the Golan Heights
Olmert also spoke out for Israel’s departure from the Golan Heights, which he believes is an indispensable condition for the conclusion of a peace agreement with Syria.
But it would also require some effort on the part of Damascus.
"I do not propose to conclude peace with Syria solely on the basis of leaving the Golan Heights," he said.
"The Syrians know very well what they will have to give up in order to win the Golan.
They will have to give up their current relationship with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship with (Shiite) Hezbollah; they will have to give up the permanent support they provide to terrorism (Shiite) Hamas," the premi<0xC3><0xA8>re of Hamas, (Terrorism Network) Al-Qaeda.
Questions after the accident: Are the stewards on the bus illegal?
The law is not known, you must not walk in a long-distance bus
In connection with the tragic bus accident of Student Agency near Padua, Italy, the question was raised whether stewards and passengers could move around the bus.
“If we want to strictly and formally comply with the law, the steward’s activity is in violation of the road traffic law,” says Ministry of Transport spokesman Karel Hanzelka.
The accident, in which a twenty-year-old steward died last week, was apparently caused by a truck driver who crossed the bus.
Unfortunately, the girl was sitting next to the driver in the least secure place in the car at the time, although she had two more seats reserved.
However, the bus can crash or slow down sharply, even when the stevard distributes coffee or newspapers.
The role is whether the bus is equipped with parking spaces according to the technical document.
If it is not approved on the bus, passengers must sit.
Remote buses Student Agency do not have space for parking; which Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz confirmed also the director of the company Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura.
"This was discussed with the ministry and initially the movement of passengers was not allowed.
After that, they called back and we came to the conclusion that passengers are allowed to ride to the toilet if they have their own seat,” he said.
The Steward does not know the law.
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of a steward - no legislation does not solve this role.
However, no legislation prohibits carriers from providing services.
The law on road transport only knows the term of the driver of the vehicle; its rights and obligations do not define it," says the spokesman Hanzelk.
On the contrary, Josef Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD>, Director of the Department of Road Vehicles Operations of the Ministry of Transport, believes that the law takes adequate care of the issues.
“It depends on whether the bus has allowed parking spaces in the approval.
That's how it ends," he says.
Buses are divided into urban buses, where parking spaces are limited and maximum speeds are limited, intercity buses with parking spaces with higher permitted speeds and remote buses with no parking spaces with maximum permitted speeds and seats equipped with seat belts.
Just like on a plane, an expert says.
BESIP traffic safety expert Jaroslav Hor<0xC3><0xAD>n does not see a fundamental problem in the movement of stewards on board the bus.
"There are not many dangers when driving, the situation can be compared to the service in airplanes.
Even here, it is not certain when the turbulence will come and the pilot may fall into the head."
"But if the bus was to be stopped sharply, of course the laws of physics apply.
Just like in the city bus or tram.
The safety of stevards must be handled by the carriers by internal regulations," he says, and also thinks, from the point of view of the law, the issue is unresolved.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura is willing to cancel the service
Student Agency offers stevard services as the only bus carrier.
He employs two hundred of them.
Even after an accident, the director does not consider their profession risky.
“But once I get the impression that the career of stewards is risky, I will cancel them.
Coffee and newspapers can be obtained at check-in.
It would also save costs,” he says.
As an interest in safety, the absence of stewards in his cars was justified by the director of Asiana Alexej Litvin, who runs a fraction of the lines compared to SA.
“We don’t have a stevard, we’ve been against it since the beginning.
Sooner or later it will end up with some fatal blow," he told T<0xC3><0xBD>den.cz less than a year ago.
It has become an immense tragedy
A young stewardess from Pilsen, who worked for the company for two years, died in an accident of a line connection to Naples.
The Slovenian truck probably bounced off without using a guide from the runway and blocked the bus route.
His driver tried to avoid a harsh manoeuvre, but he slammed the right front of him.
That the two seats reserved for the stewards' rest would be sold out, Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura refuses.
"These places cannot be reserved for remote connections, they are blocked."
The company is going to sue the truck drivers.
With the compensation of the girl's family, the agency will not wait for the court's verdict, but financial compensation is also expected from the culprit.
Amendment of the law?
In the Invisible
The clarification of the movement of stewards on board the bus could bring about the amendment of the law, on which over a year the thirty-member expert group of the Ministry of Transport works.
“But there was no concrete conclusion to be drawn.
Buses do not solve too much, rather the point system, the maximum speed on the highway and the use of mobile while driving," says expert Hor<0xC3><0xAD>n.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of the stewards to be anything that would significantly jeopardize the safety of passengers," Hanzelka said, adding that the bus safety checks are under the authority of the police and occupational safety authorities.
The Hope of Dusseldorf is Frankfurt
The great words in the letter of the Board of Directors of WestLB to the employees of this bank are not lacking.
The merger of the units of this Düsseldorf financial institution with the Frankfurt Deka-Bank will create "the central financial institution of the savings group for trading on the capital markets," read the letter, which was received to the public on Monday.
According to the letter, WestLB will enter into this transaction a "competence set" that will ensure long-term returns.
And it is said that such a merger can be a decisive impetus for further mergers in the sector of the country’s banks.
Such texts arise when the Board wants to demonstrate its ability to act in a problematic period.
The unstable WestLB is still under considerable pressure.
Not only on the part of the European Commission, but also on the part of the Federal Office for the Supervision of Financial Services, whose announcement to the Land Government in North Rhine-Westphalia that it is time to find a solution for the future is still fresh.
However, the connection between Deca-Bank, which customers know about its investment funds, and WestLB, whatever its type, has been talked about for a long time - even on the Frankfurt side.
When Deka-Bank CEO Franz Waas presented the half-yearly results at the end of August, he was told that the merger of his Mainzer Landstraße bank home with some of the country’s banks, such as Helaba Bank or WestLB, made no sense.
However, the Board of Directors of Deka-Bank, which is owned by one half of the country’s bank and by the other association of savers, has commissioned the board to conduct talks with WestLB about joint business activities.
It could be trades in the capital market or part of them.
However, the talks have only just begun, say the financiers.
The Deka-Bank, which with its 3,000 employees is one of the most important employers in the financial market in Frankfurt, is not the first time in terms of consolidation in the savings sector.
In 2003, it seemed that a merger of Deka-Bank with Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and Helaba could take place.
In the end, there was nothing of this trilogy.
Shortly after the plans for the merger came to the public, the Hessian government spoke out against the participation of Helaba Bank.
Neither of the other banks have joined in this way.
The Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz instead acquired the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg from Stuttgart.
Still, there have been repeated speculations about the connection of Deka-Bank with the country’s banks.
Recently, however, Günther Merl, chairman of Helaba’s board of directors, has spoken negatively about speculations about the merger of his financial house with others.
However, it seems that, independently of this, there is a growing belief that the rapprochement of the various banking houses of the public sector is a necessity.
BayernLB and Landesbank Baden-Württemberg could be the first to start a merger with the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg after the elections to the Bavarian parliament.
That's not good news for Helabu.
If the pressure for further mergers is to increase, the potential partners for such mergers are gradually lost.
In the south, only the second violin would be played, despite the fact that the financial crisis is so far facing significantly better than the banking houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
At the beginning of the year, the Association of Hessen-Thüringen Savings and Jury Banks, which owns an eighty-five percent stake in Helaba, banned its connection with WestLB.
This is the case with Nord LB.
However, geostrategic considerations of this kind are only one side of the problem.
On the other hand, it is a question of how much the business models of individual institutions fit together.
In June, Merl said that the crucial question of what business model should ensure the future competitiveness of the national banks, the German Savings and Jury Banks Association has not yet answered.
It could also end up with a WestLB deployment, which, of course, no one wants in this institution.
That is why the letter of the board of directors also mentions that it is seeking a “complex solution” for the entire banking house.
Whether and how it will be possible to connect the individual components with Deka-Bank, time will show.
The second weekend of the Oktoberfest is known as the “weekend with Italy”
It's the first time for Elena, the third or fourth time for Luca.
But this time Elena's going to be his girlfriend, so she says everything's going to be different.
Behind them, at the Kaiser’s five-litre barrel, stands a stronger beard and two hundred tourists at the Oktoberfest prove how deep the tones can make his throat.
Elena Lucu blinks first and then kisses him.
They came to Verona from Bologna.
From here, from the bus parking lot next to the Puorta Nuova station, this evening at 23:45 four buses marked "destinazione Monaco, festa della birra", expected arrival 6.30.
The three buses are mainly Italian, and in one bus only Brazilians.
In one corner of the parking lot, these South Americans are already singing their flag, they were already celebrating at night.
And so loud, Marco Guarda says, it's nothing for Italy.
Marco, who wears a long coat with a lining made of leather and glasses with wide silver rings, belongs to the three buses.
He has been travelling with them for five years to Oktoberfest, only this year he organizes three expeditions.
At night there, through the day between the beer booths, at 10.30 a.m.
Overnighting would only mean unnecessary costs, Marco says.
The trip costs <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>75 including a welcome drink of Kaiser beer, cooked exactly according to the Bavarian Beer Cleanliness Act, health insurance and the German-speaking guide - Marco took a language course in Frankfurt.
Buses leave at night, on the highway towards "Brennero".
No beer, not yet.
The bus is quiet, the passengers are asleep.
They're doing well, they'll still need their strength.
It is located in Brixen and Holzkirchen, where on the 8 motorway just outside Munich there is another stop and many other buses with the Italian badge.
When Marco’s group finally arrives at the parking lot near Theresienwiese at 7:00 a.m., there are about 50 more buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco has his final speech, explains the plan of the attack.
First, put on a yellow cap.
On the left side of it is written "Oktoberfest", next to the Internet address of Marco's travel agency: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Secondly, "When the door to the beer tent opens, run away!" calls Marco into the morning air.
"Go!" Go and occupy the seats in the back of the tent.
"Not forward so that you don't obstruct, and not all the yellow caps on the same bench, move around the space!"
It costs 8 euros, 25 cents.
And don't forget the booze.
"Show the security guards that we're being polite.
As soon as you leave your places, they're gone!"
Third, "Just be here at half past midnight tonight!" Do you understand?
And up to Wiesn, a space with beer tents.
Along the way, one member of the group hangs yellow caps as markers on trees, cedar trees and even on the electoral poster of a large Bavarian party.
We need to prepare for resignation.
As "weekend with Italy" is known the second weekend of the Oktoberfest.
Precise data on the number of visitors is not available; there are talk of fifty thousand of those going on a journey through the Alps and entering beer tents, ten percent of all visitors said arrived from Italy this weekend.
The Munich police ranks will reinforce seven police officers from South Tyrol, Italian volunteers will support the Bavarian Red Cross, which holds national statistics, in which the Italians before the British (about 60 interventions) and Raku<0xC5><0xA1>any (about 80) with about 200 medical first-aid eyewitnesses.
Especially popular with Italians is the tent Hofbräu.
Free nights for Hypo Real Estate creditors
Last week, Federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück stressed that the German banking system is relatively stable.
It is good that this politician used the word "relatively" and also involved in his claim that the German banking sector would not remain spared from the crisis development.
Because the one that happened last weekend.
The Dax-controlled financial house specializing in real estate financing Hypo Real Estate (HRE) will receive a multi-billion-dollar loan from a consortium of German banks to protect against market turbulence.
A person familiar with the situation on Monday told Reuters that the said loan assistance will go up to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>35 billion.
The interest will have to be paid by Hypo Real Estate (HRE) only from the actually exhausted amounts.
The money comes from both private and public-sector banks.
In the background are the losses of the Deffa subsidiary.
According to a news report, this state financier refinanced the long-term projects on which he borrowed money for an extremely short period of time, which is no longer possible due to lack of confidence in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank’s reserve increased by 95% to EUR 2.37 million and the share of equity decreased slightly from 1.6 to 1.45 per cent.
Regular and net earnings from financial trades fell to zero compared to last year, yields from the increased value of debts and certain securities and also from the abolition of reserves for credit trading fell by more than 70 per cent to EUR 5 million.
Only thanks to the higher revenues from the compensation for subsequent accounting costs in the restructuring of the former Depfa group and from the reimbursement of interest under the tax regime and for the mediation of trade for group companies, the decrease of sixteen percent on the revenue side was still moderate.
A former state financier burned himself on mortgages for businessmen after his privatization in 1990, which were then deducted from the portfolio of services and further managed by Aareal Bank.
Since there was too little profit in conventional state funding, Depfa was more involved in infrastructure projects and in financing joint projects between private investors and the state (Private-Public-Partnership, PPP) and diversified internationally.
From the value of their subsidiaries, Hypo Real Estate now has to write something down, and these write-offs will have a “substantial material effect” on the calculation of the profits and losses of the entire group, as some have been indefinitely heard.
There will be no dividends.
In 2007, it was reduced by two-thirds.
Hypo Real Estate has been a significant funder of state and infrastructure projects since the acquisition of Deffa.
Stronger than other institutions, they rely on refinancing in the interbank market because they have no customer deposits.
After the collapse of the U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago practically wiped out the source of interbank loans because the banks are keeping liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs short-term refinancing funds for part of Depfa’s loan portfolio – approximately <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>50 billion – annually.
According to a report by Hypo Real Estate, the group’s financial needs are covered by this loan for a prudent period and the company is protected “from the influence of international money markets currently to a significant extent by default.”
Other sources have made it clear that this money ensures refinancing by the end of 2009.
On the other hand, HRE CEO Georg Funke said that the Hypo Real Estate Group will not have to use the money markets in the near future.
The Federal Bank and the Federal Institute for the Supervision of Financial Services (BaFin) assume that the competitiveness of the Hypo Real Estate group on the market is now ensured.
This is what the bank’s shareholders and creditors expect.
But given the dynamics and inaccessibility of the crisis, there is probably no certainty.
It is not even entirely excluded that the loan should not be exhausted at all.
However, the opposite cannot be ruled out.
After the bank apparently faced insolvency late Sunday afternoon, it cannot, if it were preliminary, reassure the passion.
The stock price fell 75 percent to 3.30 euros.
On the contrary, bond rates were well maintained.
While preferential debts have practically not moved, secondary bond rates are losing more significantly.
This concerns in particular bonds of the former subsidiary of Württemberg Hypo and, logically, bonds with maturity after 2009.
Hypo-Real-Estate bonds originally looked like an alternative investment opportunity for speculators, but their stability needs to be understood depending on the stability of the international financial system after a significant escalation of the banking crisis and the crisis of the institute itself, which brought it into the company by taking over Depf.
As long as issuing banks, governments and less-affected commercial banks are willing to support the system, it is possible to expect the payment of securities within their maturity.
But it can also happen what almost no one at the moment dares to hope for – the financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months.
However, in view of the reports coming at the same time as this partial nationalisation, the probability that borders on certainty has now become just a legitimate hope.
This is especially likely to prepare long-term creditors for a number of sleepy nights when they will decide whether to give up their commitments.
Short-term investors may use the threshold at least to create a transfer of losses from previous accounting periods to later years’ exchange rate returns for the purpose of future payment of capital gains tax.
Sylvana and the secret of the bento box
When sixteen-year-old Sylvana Hiltropov<0xC3><0xA1> introduces herself on her first day of high school in Ta<0xC4><0x8D>iban, the girls start to move: the German is completely "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows this word from the manga. In her new blog about the exchange stay she talks about Japan.
"The first day in Japan.
Sir, I was nervous.
I was already naked on my way to school.
I live on the edge of Tokyo in the direction of Kawasaki and I drive 40 minutes by train to high school in Ta<0xC4><0x8D>iban.
I had to find the way myself, fortunately I didn't get lost.
It seems that the beginning of teaching in Ta<0xC4><0x8D>iban is not given as strictly as at home in Lower Saxony.
The students begin to meet after 8:00 and twenty minutes before 9:00 begins a short session with the teacher, the so-called 'home room'.
But even before I started teaching, I had to introduce myself.
I’m not the type of person who likes to talk in front of people, let alone in front of a class of 40 students.
Because I hadn’t yet had a school uniform, I took on my host mom’s old dress, including a blouse, blue leggings and black leather shoes.
So in this way, I stood in front of the bench and tried to pronounce everything correctly: 'Saj<0xC3><0xB3>nara Wo and Sylvana...' - my name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and I have my birthday in a week.
At the time, I was so happy that I started learning the language two years ago.
All 31 of the girls in the class were sniffing, sniffing and barking, and I always heard the word 'kawaii'.
I already knew that from my manga.
It belongs to the basic vocabulary of Japanese girls necessary for survival and means 'sweet, sweet'.
Then I quickly moved into my place.
The girl next to me smiled quite broadly, considering it an honor to have a foreign student sitting next to her.
The rest of the hour was pretty quiet, but when the gong was ringing, I was literally suffocated.
They spoke to each other and chirped and asked me about the possible and the impossible – and at the same time it was really hard to understand Japanese English.
At the break, they all packed up their bents.
My host mom also made me such a lunch box - and that's something other than boring German snacks.
I had rice with herbs, small pairs, salad of cucumbers and algae, fruit and some fish in tofu pastry.
I don’t know what I’m doing here in Japan.
These things look strange and taste quite new.
I'm sure everything's really good.
Well, maybe up to the salty plums, bro!
Benta in Japanese schools is not just a lunch.
Sometimes it happens that the girl gives the boy a self-made bento, which in this case is especially artistically adapted, and hopes that the boy will get to know him more about the break at the snack.
I read about it in my manga comics.
I wonder if I'll see it here, too.
'Why Japan?' my friends asked me when I told them I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
Then I always said,
'Cause it just fascinates me.'
I have loved to read manga for years.
And to get a better understanding of these comics and their culture, one day I started learning Japanese.
It was clear to me that I would have to come here one day.
Because I also have a weakness for traditions, customs, and customs.
And they are highly valued here.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends, on the other it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I’ve never felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the largest city I’ve ever seen.”
Even rats have feelings.
When rats or squirrels run away from danger, does that mean they also feel fear?
The neurologist Joseph LeDoux is convinced that many animals also have feelings.
But how could it be verified that they feel the same when they behave in the same way as we do?
In the online magazine "Edge" for several years, contributions of well-known scientists have been published.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents selected answers to the question "What do you consider to be true without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have feelings and other states of consciousness, without me or anyone else having been able to prove it so far, when we can’t even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case, we can at least hope, because all the human brains have the same basic configuration.
However, once we begin to engage in a different kind and open up the questions of perception or general consciousness, we enter unprepared territory because the hardware does not agree.
When a rat is in danger, it will do the same as many other animals: it will pretend to be dead, run away, or attack.
People behave in a similar way, which some scientists consider to be a comparable subjective experience.
I don't believe it, though.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to transfer our subjective experience to the experience of animals.
This is because the circuits associated with human consciousness almost always include the lateral prefrontal cortex (due to its share in short-term memory and performing or controlling functions).
This vast area is much more developed in man than in other primates, and it seems to be completely lacking in other creatures.
At least for those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, including the knowledge of who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, there is reason to believe that a person is even different from other primates.
Another dramatic peculiarity could be hidden by the language essence of a person: because so much of his perception is associated with language, it is often said that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, we could exclude the animals.
But even if consciousness did not matter to language, it would certainly be influenced by language, so that animal consciousness, no matter how constructed, would probably differ from most states of our consciousness.
Therefore, it is difficult to determine what consciousness might look like in other animals.
When, as something internal and subjective, it is not even possible to measure or, because of special hardware, to analyze on the basis of our own experience, we are confronted with great problems by its exploration.
Most of my conclusions relate to the content of conscious experience, but in addition there is another aspect of consciousness that should be more scientifically accessible.
It would be possible to investigate processes in the consciousness of animals regardless of their content, and this is exactly what happens in the studies of short-term memory in primates, especially on the example of visualization.
But this approach, devoted to Christof Koch and Francis Crick, focuses on the neural correlations of consciousness rather than causal mechanisms: both may be identical, but may not be either.
Interestingly, this approach also highlights the importance of a non-frontal cortex for the realization of visualization.
What does this mean for feelings?
I deduce them from the fact that the emotional system, such as the fear system, is activated in the brain conscious of its own activities.
So what we call “fear” is the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its consequences, such as bodily reactions) utilizes operative memory.
Seen from this angle, the feelings are closely associated with those areas of the cortex that are characterized by primates, and especially people.
In connection with the linguistic nature, there is a subtle degradation of perception, because with the help of words and grammar we can distinguish and categorize states, so that we can assign them to others next to ourselves.
Antonio Damasio, on the other hand, believes that feelings arise from more primitive activities in the cortex and brain stems dedicated to bodily sensations, similar to Jaak Pankseep, who, however, focuses more on the brain stem.
Since this network has not changed much in the course of human evolution, it could easily participate in the feelings perceived by several animal families.
In theory, I can’t deny it, but I consider it unproven.
Pankseep argues that what appears to us as fear in rats and humans is likely to feel both organisms alike: But how is it possible to verify, Pankseep continues, whether rats and humans feel the same when they behave similarly?
The swab flees from danger - does he also feel fear?
From my point of view, the mere similarity of behavior cannot prove the consistency of experience.
It is true that the neural comparison moves us further: rats and humans have similar brain stems, on the other hand, no brains.
But is the brain stem responsible for feelings?
And even if it could be proven in humans, how would we want to prove it in rats?
I think rats and other mammals, maybe even swabs (who knows?), have feelings.
But I really don't know how to prove it.
And because their feelings are probably fundamentally different from ours (because human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I prefer to explore emotional behavior rather than the emotional perception of rats.
In any case, in this case, we can expect progress at the neural level if we measure the same in rats and humans.
Just as in a rat, I don’t study language and consciousness, I don’t even examine feelings, I don’t know if they exist.
It is possible to consider it short-sighted, but I prefer to move forward rather than repeatedly toss myself against a wall.
I'm a practical emotionalist.
UEFA President Platini: Deadline for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Vasjunyk said that the preparations will soon be directed directly by the president and the prime minister.
"The government sees the decision of UEFA in Bordeaux as evidence of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organize ME together with Poland," Vasjunyk said.
"For our country, this is not an amnesty.
The work has just begun and there is still much to do in both countries.”
In the early implementation of the timetable for the construction or reconstruction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, both hosts crawl.
It is even possible that the number of stadiums for ME will be reduced from eight to six.
“We can’t waste time anymore.
We need to work now as quickly as possible," said the president of the Ukrainian Federation Grigory Surkis.
"Uefa will keep an eye on us."
An even more radical move was agreed in Poland.
After numerous scandals, the leadership of the Polish PZPN was revoked by the National Olympic Committee and replaced by the independent administrator Robert Zawlock.
The committee met at the request of the Minister of Sport Miros<0xC5><0x82>aw Drzewieck<0xC3><0xBD>.
There is a "serious risk that the PZPN will not be able to act according to the rules," Drzewiecki told Polish news agency PAP.
UEFA President Michel Platini said in a letter that this step would neutralize the preparations for the 2012 World Cup.
Several teams from the first league were only sentenced to a forced descent last season due to manipulation, eventually having to move the start of the league even quickly.
Dennis Quaid is back on strike
She wanted to make an advertisement for a new film, she spoke in private talk – and now she’s having trouble with her ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan talked about her former Dennis Quaid as a marriage breaker.
He's angry and he's coming back.
A late war rages on the ex-husbands Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: seven years after their divorce, these two Hollywood actors are having an unpleasant quarrel – in front of the public.
In an interview with American magazine InStyle last week, Meg Ryan for the first time commented on the reasons for the collapse of her marriage: "Dennis has been unfaithful to me for a long time, and it was very painful."
The extent of the fraud was not known until after the divorce.
The motivation for this mental stripper was Ryan's PR work for her new film "The Women" - it tells the story of a broken marriage.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his presentation as an unfaithful husband was pronounced: "She's crazy," the forty-year-old New York Daily News actor said, "Meg is repeatedly reviving the history of our relationship and adjusting it."
In addition, it is “sorry” that the joint sixteen-year-old son Jack is again “publicly reminiscent of the pain and radical changes that divorce is for every child.”
While Ryan has been living alone since the divorce, Quaid is remarried and recently became the father of twins.
He concludes his thoughts on avoidance as follows: “My life goes on anyway.
I think I’m happy to have an amazing family that’s doing great.”
Prices of flights and hotels are falling
In the first half of 2008, flights and accommodation in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, flights were even as cheap as 50 percent, according to one recent study.
Flights and hotel accommodation have again been reduced - this is the result of a study by travel and financial services provider American Express.
The company analyzed its data on the bookings made in the first half of 2008 and after the price increase in the first quarter found their significant decline in the second quarter.
After several years of rising prices in the hotel market, accommodation in many places has already been reduced.
From January to March, prices in 41 of the 48 European cities monitored increased by an average of 6.9% compared to 2007.
However, from April to June, prices were already 3.6 percent lower than in the previous year.
This trend was most noticeable in Paris and Rome, where passengers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than the previous year.
The reason for this trend is considered by American Express to be a weak dollar exchange rate, which has caused “declining desire for American tourists to travel.”
The decline in hotel prices also affected financial centres more strongly than industrial centres such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In this Norwegian city, hotel prices, with their growth of 26.3 percent, even set a European record.
Airline prices also showed an upward trend in the first quarter:
Because of the cost of kerosene, Economy class passengers had to pay an average of 7.1 percent more than in 2007, fuel-intensive long-haul flights cost up to 29.2 percent.
From April to June, Economy class airfares fell by an average of 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, but in Business and First-Class classes, knowledge changes were less significant.
In Germany, prices have fallen even more sharply than in other European countries:
From January to March, they grew by 11.9 percent, in the second quarter they fell by 23.6 percent.
In the German national years, prices have even fallen by half, according to the study cited.
One of the reasons for this price drop is slowing economic growth, the company explains.
Demand in many segments of the air transport market is uncertain.
On the other hand, due to the Open Skies agreement, which liberalized air traffic between the US and Europe, there is increased competitive pressure.
A sign of the tense situation is the disruption of non-profit airlines and also the high number of airlines that declared bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 - in Europe alone, there were 24 airlines.
HSV defeated Gladbach 1:0
Thanks to a single goal and simple methods, the Hamburger SV gets to the top of the table.
In Borussia, Luhukay is still unable to assemble the working eleven.
Written by Kristoffer Klein - Enlarge the Failed Landing for Representative Marko Marina.
This Gladbach player got involved in the game until late and failed with a balloon pushed out on the stick.
His report was precisely formulated and came out of his mouth convincingly.
He just knew he was right.
"We need a second goal," Hermann Rieger whispered in the hallway to the cabins of the Hamburg Arena.
Not much was done in the catacombs, the break between the half-hours was over, and most people were sitting in their seats again.
Rieger has been an HSV physiotherapist for nearly three decades and enjoys greater respect than many acting moments.
And so his request was also heard in a responsible place.
Coach assistant Cornelius Jol pulled in and raised his thumb on the sign of the match.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg head coach Martin Jol.
His command probably sounded the same: here with the second goal!
There was no execution.
"It didn't look good today," Marcell Jansen later admitted.
Bastian Reinhardt would have said, “I wish I was more relaxed.”
For 1:0 (1:0) the Hamburgers thanks the head of Mladen Petri<0xC4><0x87> (11th) and the fact that the very weak Hunger Games could not hurt the weak Hamburgers.
"It was a dirty victory," Martin Jol summed up.
Hamburger SV celebrates its 121th anniversary on Monday.
On Saturday afternoon, the spectators celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the arena, and a lively updated table on the video wall, in which their team was presented as a prizewinner.
It'll be a birthday without a big party.
"We know how to evaluate it," Marcell Jansen said.
He realizes that the continuous table result symbolizes the incalculability of the league rather than the dominance of its HSV.
The team with the late arrival of the new players - the Brazilians Nevese and Silva, the goalkeeper Petri<0xC4><0x87>e and the FC Bayern won Jansen - is slowly located, but cannot yet flash.
"We need more feeling and more dribbling," Jol said emphatically.
After the defeat in the vote
Fear is spreading on Wall Street.
The first reports of the sinking of the rescue package caused the Dow Jones index to drop by 700 points.
It was the biggest loss of points in a single day in his history.
Later, Dow added something else.
At around 8:30 p.m., the world’s most important stock market barometer showed a five percent decline to 10,579 units.
The Nasdaq technology exchange was down by more than seven percent at 1548 points.
Worst of all was in Dow at the time American Express, which lost almost 14 percent, and Bank of America with a loss of about twelve percent.
None of the titles could be reinforced.
The shares of Goldman Sachs have lost almost 10 percent.
A few days ago, Warren Buffett was a big investor in the company.
As part of the bailout plan, funds are to be made available for the purchase of so-called damaged mortgage securities.
However, the entire amount should not be paid at once, but in several stages.
In return, the state is to receive stock options of financial companies that could be repaid if the exchange rate is favourable, thus reducing the burden on the state budget.
Stock prices in Europe are falling sharply
The billion-dollar aid to banks in Europe and the US does not dissuade investors.
The stock exchange rate of the large German bank Hypo Real Estate is strongly declining and brings with it the Dax index.
The Dow Jones index is losing despite the planned bailout of the financial market by the state.
The spectacular exchange rate losses of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank have smashed the German stock index (Dax) deep into the minus.
The Munich property financier’s shares have lost up to three quarters of their value despite a bailout by the federal government and private banks, and Commerzbank has lost more than 20 percent.
Dax clearly slipped below the psychologically important 6000-point limit and scored 5,839 points with less than 3.7 percent.
All over the world, stock markets are on their knees.
In New York, the Wall Street business day began with significant losses.
Investors fear that a $700 billion bailout package by the U.S. government may not be enough to revive events in the financial markets.
During the first hour of trading, the Dow lost 334 points, or 3.3 percent, to 10,809.25 points.
The U.S. House of Representatives is set to vote on a bailout plan, and the Senate could make a statement on October 1.
The other European exchanges were also moving in one direction: in London, the FTSE index weakened by 3.2 percent, while in Paris, the CAC-40 lost 2.9 percent.
In Asia, Japan’s leading Nikkei index fell by 1.26 percent after initial earnings to 11,743.61 units.
In Hong Kong, the Hang-Seng index fell by 2.1 percent to 18,286.90 points.
In India, the leading Sensex index lost 506.43 points or 3.9 percent and trade ended at 12,595.75.
In MDAX, they lost after the announcement of an increase in Arcandor’s equity.
Sal. Oppenheim Private Bank has registered 23 million new shares.
The business and tourism group has also announced that it will not sell its shares in Thomas Cook.
Dark Matter Affects the Years of Space Probes
For years, scientists have been unaware of one mysterious phenomenon: dark matter affects the speed of space probes during the so-called swing-by maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity may not be entirely correct.
For nearly 18 years, the Ulysses spacecraft has flown through space.
The fault of the fuel pipelines, which will soon freeze, is now threatening to die in the winter.
For years, one mysterious phenomenon among scientists has been causing confusion - an anomalies of the gravitational beam.
Gravitational force is an aerial maneuver of space probes in which they gain additional motion in the gravitational field of a space object, such as Earth.
This allows the probes to save a lot of fuel.
The European-American Cassini-Huygens research probe used this physical trick as well as the Ulysses solar probe.
But what the scientist has been saying for years in this case is that flying bodies do not behave 100% as one would expect under the old good law of gravitation.
On the contrary, there are irregularities in speed.
The probes will speed up or slow down unexpectedly.
So far, physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
He was baptized by gravitational cord anomalies.
Several experts fear that even Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity, which describes the attraction of matter by curvature of space, may not be entirely correct.
Stephen Adler, an American physicist at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, continues to believe that Einstein was not mistaken, and tries to explain the gravitational anomaly using the so-called dark matter, whose presence in the universe was discovered by astronomers.
"The cause of this anomaly could be dark matter, which could also be very close to Earth," he writes.
The existence of dark matter has only been known by space researchers for about ten years.
It is obviously based on the gravitational force, the effect of which on other cosmic bodies can be observed.
On the contrary, it is completely invisible, which means that it does not emit or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, not even visible light.
Scientists estimate that this dark matter is about one-fifth of the total mass of the universe.
In Egypt, the kidnapping of tourists is free
After ten days in the hands of their kidnappers, according to the Italian foreign minister in Egypt, tourists are again abducted.
The Sudanese kidnappers demanded a ransom of several million euros.
Six kidnappers were reportedly killed in the shootout before being released.
Five Germans were kidnapped in the south of Egypt.
Redemption negotiations are said to be ongoing.
The Germans have repeatedly become targets for kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE brings you the most important cases.
European tourists stranded in the Sahara are said to be free.
This was reported by Egyptian state television, Arab television stations Al-Arabiya and Italian media.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release, according to reports on the Italian television station Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and other hostages have been released.
We're just checking their health," Frattini said.
According to an Egyptian state television report, five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian, as well as their eight Egyptian guides, are safe and sound.
All 19 participants of the desert expedition are reportedly already on their way to Cairo.
The background of the shooting before the release of hostages remains unclear: according to an Egyptian security official, the kidnappers were ready to end the kidnapping before the Sudanese army surprisingly killed six kidnappers.
"The problem has been solved.
They agreed to the ransom," said the quoted worker.
He said that “it was only about taking the hostage,” when suddenly “this surprise” came.
Sudanese soldiers on Sunday shot six kidnappers in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt and captured two of them.
The kidnappers asked Germany for a ransom of six million euros; the money was to be handed over by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The newspaper El Masri El Jom, referring to one of the German intermediaries, said that the release of hostages is being extended because the hijackers are concerned about their safety.
According to this report, the kidnappers wanted to release a female hostage after paying the ransom.
The men should be held until the hijackers have a safe escape route.
The German Embassy in Cairo has declined to comment on this report.
Abuse of the father "leads to suicide"
Several years of abuse by his father led the woman to commit suicide, it was heard in court.
After admitting to eight cases of sexual harassment, seventeen-year-old Michael Treris of Stithians in Cornwall was sentenced to six years.
The Crown Court in Truro has heard that his daughter-in-law, Stephanie Randle, had been regularly bonded when she was between five and seven years old.
"I feel responsible for her death," Trerise wrote in a statement.
The court also said that Ms. Randle committed suicide at her home in Mutley, Plymouth on April 1, 2007, aged 34.
When she lived in Coventry as a child, Trerise tied her up and tied her eyes and then sexually abused her while her mother worked in a pub.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s and returned to Cornwall.
His daughter-in-law went to Plymouth.
However, it was heard before the court that Ms. Randle, who had spent a substantial part of her time volunteering for the National Trust, was pursuing a specter of abuse that had been perpetrated on her twice a week.
Prosecutor Ramsey Quaife said in 2006 that friends of Miss Randle, who was also very involved in surfing and cycling, said she was "emotionally dead" and that she "gave up life".
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
She's thought to have drowned herself in an igelite bag.
Randle stood in the face of his daughter’s father-in-law, who wrote a confession that ended with, “I bound her and bound her eyes.
"I didn't abuse her.
I feel responsible for her death.”
Judge Christopher Elwen Treris said: “You are an extremely strange fetishist and it must have been horrible for your victim when she was only seven years old.
"This unpleasant story ends with the victim taking his own life.
Even more terrible is the fact that if she hadn’t done so, the case would have probably never been brought to court.”
"In particular, I would like to stress the consequences that, according to Stephanie's parents, your crime has had on their daughter over the years," he added.
"Obviously she would otherwise be a promising, successful and happy young woman."
An official who has lost his data will be indicted.
The BBC has learned that a government official who left the strictly secret documents on the train in June will be charged under the state secrets law.
The man in question left two top-secret documents on a train to Waterloo at a time when he was temporarily assigned to the Department of Defense.
The documents were handed over to the BBC before they were handed over to the police.
It is the least serious violation of the above-mentioned law and does not indicate a criminal intent.
BBC correspondent for Defense Affairs Frank Gardner said such a move would be surprising for many in Whitehall.
"They probably thought that the matter was being dealt with internally between the ministry and the Government Office," he said.
An employee who may not be appointed is charged under Section 8.1 of the Act concerned, which is a clause dealing with the protection of information.
The Crown Prosecutor advised the Metropolitan Police to indict the official on the basis of the very sensitive nature of his work in the Joint Intelligence Committee.
The documents, which he forgot, contained secret analyses of al-Qaida and the capabilities of the Iraqi security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was moved from home to an unknown location.
Social Security Faces Debt B&B
Britain’s cooperative bailouts may have to pay more than <0xC2><0xA3>80m in debt after the rescue of Bradford & Bingley.
The government has provided 2.6 million clients at Bradford & Bingley with <0xC2><0xA3>14 billion to protect deposits.
The interest on this loan will be paid by all companies that receive client deposits, including 59 cooperative deposits.
Adrian Coles, Director General of the Association of Cooperative Backups (BSA), said it was "seducating" that backups and their members must pay.
The 14 billion-dollar debt will eventually be repaid by saving the Bradford & Bingley mortgages.
However, the interest, which is being raised in the meantime, will be paid each year by all 700 financial firms that receive client deposits.
The Compensation Money Services Plan Fund for the BBC confirmed that all 59 cooperative deposits are included in this number.
It's humiliating that these institutions that have behaved prudently... now have to pay off some of the accounts of those institutions that have not been so considerate.
Adrian Coles, BSA
He said that every company should pay in proportion to the deposits it held, and that backups of that should pay about 18% of the price.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that interest on debt will increase to <0xC2><0xA3>450 million in 2009.
This means that the depositors will have to find <0xC2><0xA3>81 million to pay interest on the first year.
Adrian Coles, CEO of the Co-operatives’ Trade Association, told the BBC that he was convinced that it was not fair.
"It is humiliating that those institutions that acted prudently during the expansion of the housing market now have to pay off some of the accounts of those institutions that were far from being so prudent."
According to the BSA, no backups have fallen since 1945, when they appeared.
"We will have to explore all aspects of this matter over the next few weeks to see what are the opportunities to protect cooperative backups and their members from an account that could be substantial," Cole added.
The interest due in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September to the end of March.
In 2010, interest will be paid for the whole year, and that could be almost twice as much.
Since cooperative deposits are non-shareholders’ shareholders, this account will ultimately be paid by their members through higher fees or lower interest rates on their accounts.
Milk costs five pence per liter
People in Jersey may have to pay more for their milk.
The Jersey dairy company has announced that it will increase the wholesale price of its milk by five pence per litre from Monday.
This is the second increase in prices this year, after a two-penny treason in February, and comes after research carried out by the consulting company.
Retailers have to decide for themselves whether they want to reflect the treason in customer prices.
Prior to the February increase, the wholesale price of milk from Jersey last changed in 2002.
The bailout for the Bangladeshi Prime Minister has been rejected
A Bangladeshi court has rejected former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Vajid's request for bail, meaning she could be arrested if she returns to her homeland.
Her lawyers said the court refused to release her on bail in connection with the charge that she had obtained more than fifty million dollars from a certain businessman by blackmailing her when she was prime minister.
The case is one of several allegations of corruption that have been brought against it.
Ch<0xC3><0xA1>lida Ziy<0xC3><0xA1>, a long-time political rival of Shaikh Hasina, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina is set to return to Bangladesh in the next few weeks, but her party, the People's League (Awami League), has called for the local army-held government to give her complete freedom first.
The correspondents say that while she was released on her own behalf in order to undergo a medical procedure abroad, under the terms of her release, it is not clear whether she will remain free until she returns to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers say that she is now appealing to the Supreme Court against the order of the Supreme Court.
"The Supreme Court has rejected Shaikh Hasina's request for bail with the fact that he does not need bail when he is already undergoing an investigation released on an honest statement abroad," said her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
"We are appealing against the Supreme Court's order."
Her lawyers claimed she needed bail so she could return to the country from abroad in preparation for the December elections.
The High Representative of the People's League said that Shaikh Hasina is due to return home after October 17.
She was detained last year after the army-held interim government took over power, but was released from prison in June to be able to go abroad for medical treatment.
Both Shaikh Hasin and Khalid Ziya reject all charges against each other.
Fear of rabies vaccination in Afghanistan <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
According to the United Nations, nearly 200,000 children have not been vaccinated against bullying due to the violence associated with the Taliban.
Last week, the United Nations carried out vaccinations in six provinces.
However, she says she could not reach the children in the south in parts of Helmand and Kandahar for security reasons.
A U.N. spokesperson said this happened despite the Taliban's promise not to attack or prevent thousands of vaccine workers at work.
BSkyB loses ITV litigation
BSkyB lost the dispute over the review of the Commission’s competition decision, which ordered the company to reduce its share in the competitive broadcasting company ITV.
The Court of Appeal for Competition of BSkyB ordered it to reduce its share of ITV from 17,9 % to 7,5 %.
The Commission has previously stated that BSkyB’s share has sparked a competitive struggle and disproportionately influenced ITV.
BSkyB bought a share in 2006 in a deal that as a result prevented NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Fair Trade Authority announced that the acquisition of a stake in ITV by BSkyB gave rise to doubts about the independence of ITV and called on the Competition Commission to initiate an investigation.
The head of the Virgin Sir Richard Branson consortium, the consumer organization and regulator of Ofcom were all against the purchase.
BSkyB argued that the forced reduction of its share in ITV was unreasonable and disproportionate as a solution – mainly because BSkyB had previously said it was willing to give up its voting rights.
New Investigation of the Affair of American Lawyers
The U.S. Attorney General has appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the release of nine U.S. attorneys in 2006.
He came in a situation where the report on the affair prepared by the Supreme Inspector of the Ministry of Justice criticized the activities of government officials.
The report criticised White House officials, lawmaker and former Justice Minister Albert Gonzalez.
The investigation was prompted by concerns that the lawyers had been removed for political reasons.
Special Prosecutor Nora Danney will now investigate whether the officials interrogated during the investigation lied to the investigators in an attempt to undermine justice.
Inspector General Glenn Fine said in the report: "Serious allegations including potential criminal conduct have not been fully investigated or clarified."
The appointment of a special prosecutor with the power to compel witnesses to testify was one of his key recommendations.
The dispute began when the U.S. Department of Justice stripped nine U.S. lawyers of their duties in December 2006.
At the time, the ministry said the lawyers had been fired due to poor performance.
However, it later turned out that the dismissals of the lawyers were not rated any worse than many of their colleagues, which led many observers to conclude that the dismissal was politically motivated.
Some of the lawyers were involved in the prosecution of high-ranking Republican MPs and senators, while others refused to investigate allegations of voter fraud raised against the Democrats.
U.S. attorneys are investigating and running lawsuits in court cases for the government.
They may be released at any time, but they may not be removed for political reasons.
The then head of the Justice Department, Minister Alberto Gonzales, was fired for dismissal and eventually resigned.
A number of other representatives of the Ministry of Justice have also resigned.
The Inspector General's report was very critical of Gonzales' role in the affair, saying he was "mainly responsible" for the dismissal, "abdicated" from his leadership position and "remarkably not involved in the incident".
Other officials, including former senior Bush adviser Karl Rove, have been criticized for not cooperating in the investigation.
The Meat Loaf Prize will be awarded
Rock star Meat Loaf will receive one of the Q Awards for his epic anthem Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will come to the ceremony next weekend in London for his special gold award, said he was "honored" by the award.
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title track of Meat Loaf's 1977 hit album.
This year’s nomination is led by the Coldplay group, which has been narrowly selected in four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q Magazine, said: "There are some songs that stand above things like time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is definitely one of them."
The song, written by Jim Steinman, needed the big vocals provided by Meat Loaf.
It started with an instrumental part that lasted almost two minutes.
The song was released in the UK in 1979 as a single and peaked at number fifteen.
But Meat Loaf's album Bat Out Of Hell has been in the charts for about nine years and has sold more than forty million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - real name Marvin Lee Aday - suffered from health problems in recent years, and in 2003 he was also operated on due to an irregular heart rhythm after collapsing on stage.
In 2007, an acute laryngitis forced him to cancel concerts.
Later, it turned out he had a cyst on his vocal cords.
Obscure streets, often forgotten and perhaps soon for sale
New York City has thousands of roads, streets, highways, and other terrestrial roads, some famous, others only utility.
But even many taxi drivers-veterans and long-time locals have trouble finding an Extra Place, mostly because they have never heard of it.
This small alley is in the East Village district and leads north from First Street - without getting to Second Street - between Bowery and Second Avenue.
At a width of about ten and a length of forty meters, it resembles a dusty passage rather than a traffic jam.
There are no signposts with street names.
In a normal atlas, it is virtually invisible.
However, the street has an admirer.
For example, Avalon Bay, a developer of recently built luxury buildings on First Street.
Extra Place wants to redevelop and create a cleaner passage to the shops and boutiques that are to open in new buildings.
Other admirers are long-time neighbors who say they were fascinated by a narrow street simply because it was one of the last remnants of the time before the block was acclaimed.
However, the City Office for the Protection and Development of Buildings, which has the street in its power, has no interest in sticking to it.
At a land committee meeting of the municipal community, representatives of the city authority and Avalon Bay company have devised a plan according to which the developer should buy the street.
However, according to Suzan Stetzer, District Manager of Community 3, the committee prefers such a variant when the street will remain in the hands of the city, and asked for a new plan to be submitted next month.
“The city already owns very few land, and we would like Extra Place to remain in its possession,” she said.
"There could be proposals for repairs and administration, which could be done by Avalon, but we also want to ensure public accessibility."
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that it wants to repaint a small street and set up seating areas, several of which would be used by a café whose interest in renting space the developer expects.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy a street was first announced at a meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, spokeswoman for Avalon Bay, said that while the company wants to take advantage of the street, it does not necessarily want to own it.
"The main intention of Avalon Bay is to repair this abandoned alley and make it a beautiful place for the public," she said, adding that the sale was designed by the city.
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the Building Preservation Office, said the city wanted to sell the street, and said it was his office’s job to develop the property rather than manage it.
Compared to its more colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place has left a flat mark in history.
Some people think that the street got its name in 1802, when Philip Minthorn’s large farm was divided among several of his children and no one claimed that narrow strip of land.
The back door to Extra Place was led by the CBGB, a punk rock monument that closed in 2006, and the street is perhaps best known as the background photograph on the Ramones album "Rocket to Russia".
“This place was amazing,” says Danny Fields, manager of Ramones, who took the photo in November 1976.
"It was full of rubbish, torn clothes and pieces of barrels, posters, sheets and ropes."
Some locals, including bloggers who write about aggravating the East Village neighborhood, oppose the idea of selling the Extra Place and claim that that piece of public property, though modest, should remain public.
Others consider Extra Place a rarity – an almost unchanged piece of town that should be left as it is.
Jeremiah Moss, who writes a blog called Jeremiah's Missing New York (subtitled "The Book of Crying: A Burning Nostalgic View of the City in the Extinction Process"), raised part of the story of Extra Place from the section Talk about the City, which appeared in The New Yorker newspaper in 1952.
The author of the article, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a narrow, blind alley, dark even in the day and bounded by razor-iron gates of warehouses and stained windows, where a week of old newspapers run through the stoves."
With a few exceptions, the street of one recent evening looked exactly the same.
Krysa passed through the blind end of the street near the door that once led to the CBGB, where today there is an expensive clothing store.
There was graffiti on the walls, and next to a fresh batch of newspapers, there was an empty bottle of beer.
A few passers-by said he rarely thinks of Extra Place, but suggested that he could use some kind of boost.
Fields, on the other hand, said that he thinks that some people underestimate the street’s impact in its current state.
"The best years of my life," he said, "were in places of dark, wet and ugly."
Debate on Bilingualism: Immersion in English
In this edition of Focused on Education, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi will discuss the position of candidates for bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, a Californian academic and education director at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is a co-author of the book “Worse Than You Think: Why Middle Class Needs to Choose Schools.”
Efficiently appealing to Spanish voters is an ominous matter.
Barack Obama’s education agenda only proves that.
Obama’s campaign points out that “African-American and Hispanic students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students,” which is true.
In order to combat such performance differences, Obama’s education agenda promotes, among other things, “transient bilingual education” for those who are just learning English.
The question remains, however, whether Barack Obama’s commitment to bilingual education, which emphasizes the use of languages other than English in the classroom, is stronger than his interest in reducing performance differences.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, a charter primary school in the East Los Angeles district.
The pupils of this school are in the vast majority of cases Hispanics from low-income families.
More than a third of students, many of whom have just recently arrived, are still learning English.
Yet in the state math tests in 2008, an incredible 100 percent of fourth graders got to the highest level.
Nearly ninety-three percent of the astonishing fourth-grade students have reached the highest level in the state tests of English language and literature.
This incredible success has been achieved by a method other than the one Obama prefers.
Sixth Street emphasizes control and exercise, continuous assessment of abilities, and unapologetic access.
Furthermore, and this Obama should note, according to Linda Mikels, the director of Sixth Street, the school’s pedagogical approach to those who are just learning English, is “complete immersion.”
The immersion in English emphasizes the almost noble use of English in the course of teaching.
Ms. Mikels, who is against bilingual education, told me, "We had a tremendous success with an entirely new student from Mexico - after twelve months you would go into class and not know who it is."
"It's fun," she said, "it works for us."
Would Obama take the Sixth Street Prep school as an example of what other schools with large proportions of Spanish and English learners should look like?
The results achieved by the school should make the answer to this question self-evident, but the educational agenda of its own party (the National Education Association is a long-standing supporter of bilingual education) and its own consistent support of dual-language education.
While Obama agrees that immigrants should learn English, he recently trivialized the matter when he said that people should stop worrying about “only English” laws.
Instead, "you should make sure your children speak Spanish," he said.
If Obama really wants to erase performance differences, he should rather think carefully about the educational patterns that work, rather than ridicule them and trivialize them.
Oil is declining sharply due to renewed economic concerns.
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday because of fears that even the U.S. plan to save financial markets would not have to revive the economy.
The prices of futures oil trades fell by 7 percent in the early morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange to $99.80 per barrel.
Since last Monday, prices have fallen by more than $20 per barrel.
Over the past two weeks, commodity markets have been shaken by financial turmoil on Wall Street and also by double strong hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After reaching a peak of $145.29 per barrel in July, prices fell to nearly $90 per barrel earlier this month, buzzing back into a wave of huge uncertainty in financial markets.
Investors re-emerged on Monday, even after the congressional presidency announced that it had reached an agreement on the biggest rescue plan in history over the weekend.
This report has been overshadowed by recent concerns that the financial crisis is far from over.
In the latest episode of the ongoing breakdown, the government announced that Citigroup would buy a banking division of Wachovia Corporation.
Meanwhile, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalized the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Analysts at Barclays Capital said the horrific weekend talks that led to the plan to save the economy "show themselves as unable to revive the mood in the market."
As the economic situation worsens, demand for commodities, including oil, is expected to decline.
“Global stock market outlooks, interest rates and exchange rates have greatly deteriorated,” Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a report to investors.
"We believe that commodities will not be able to escape infections.
“From a commodity perspective, our greatest concern is the extent to which the American virus is spreading to the entire world and especially to China.”
Analysts have narrowed their expectations for next year, as oil consumption has fallen due to slower economic growth, and have lowered their 2009 gasoline price forecasts by about 20 percent.
The wild ride in the second quarter surpassed the team's record
After spending more time in the Jets than anyone else in the last eight seasons, defensive player Shaun Ellis thought he had seen it all.
Then on Sunday, he watched the development of the second quarter, in which the Jets turned a pointless game into a sleepy ride.
"I've never seen anything like this," Ellis said.
The second quarter began after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals with their sluggish game offset the gloomy clouds above them.
Then quarterback Brett Favre sent Laveranues Coles on a 12-yard touchdown sprint, perfect for an afternoon in which their progressive collaboration moved a mile ahead.
Favre sent Colese in this quarter for two more touchdowns, including the one in which he fell cornerback, and another 10 seconds before the half-match.
"It was nothing extraordinary," Favre said of all his notes to Coles.
"He's a damn good player.
“We communicated very well, no matter what people think.”
While Favre and Coles were chasing, the defense attacked quarterback Cardinals Kurt Warner.
Cornerback Darelle Revis caught a misguided shot and returned it 32 yards to a touchdown.
Safety Eric Smith typed another note and captured it.
Linebacker David Bowens donated Warnera to the fumble.
The last loss of the ball, the fumble Bowens forced, was perhaps the best.
The Cardinals reached the ball 10 seconds before the end, and after the Jets got the ball back, Jay Feely kicked a twenty-yard goal from the field, earning a lead of 34-0.
That's the most Jets ever won in a quarter.
The Jets coach Eric Mangini, when asked to describe the madness, said, "A second quarter, or a third quarter?"
When he was told that both - the Jets allowed 21 points in the third quarter without an answer - Mangini said: "I can tell you I enjoyed the second quarter a lot more than the third.
A lot of points fell in a short period of time.”
Resting Gebreselassie Improved Its World Record
Haile Gebreselassie of Ethiopia once again showed why many consider him the best long-distance runner ever when he broke his own world record at the Berlin marathon on Sunday and became the first person to race 26.2 miles in a two-minute race.
By winning on a pleasantly flat track in time 2:03:59, he beat his previous time by 27 seconds in 2:04:26, which took place last year in Berlin.
Gebreselassie, 35, has set the 26th world record of his career, which is really incredibly wide - he has broken the world record or at least is a world champion at all distances from the metric mile to the marathon.
Last month, Gebreselassie missed an Olympic marathon in Beijing because he feared — from a backward glance perhaps too scared — that polluted air would irritate his asthma problems.
Instead, he promised to run in Berlin.
In almost perfect conditions – sunny and 48 degrees at the start, 55 degrees at the finish – he won Gebreselassie Sunday with a lightning-fast average of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
As track runners like Gebreselassia and Paul Tergat from Kenya focused on the longer track, the marathon record in the last decade fell by more than two minutes, since Brazil’s Ronaldo da Costa won in Berlin at 2:06:05 in 1998.
After Sunday's victory, Gebreselassie told reporters that he had cramps in his elbow two weeks ago and missed a week of training.
The pause, of course, raised him rather than delayed.
"I'm so happy," Gebreselassie told reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I started again a week ago and I was a little doubtful today, but everything was fine."
He was also criticized - especially in Kenya, East African rival Ethiopia - for saying he was overly planning his races, generally avoiding world marathon peaks, relying on conductors, as if it were a race on track, and building the world.
But this criticism can hardly reduce Gebreselassie’s enormous running quality.
Maintained at the pace of four Kenyans, Gebreselassie reached half time in 1:02:04.
After the leaders dropped, Gebreselassie was constantly chased by two elite knights, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi.
Just over three miles ahead of Gebreselassie's goal, he last took and escaped to Kwambai, who then finished second in 2:05:36, improving his personal maximum by almost five minutes.
Kamathi finished third in time 2:07:48.
In the women's race, the excellent year ended with the seventh fastest time in history 2:19:19 Irina Mikit<0xC4><0x9B>nkov<0xC3><0xA1>, a native of Kazakhstan, who is now a citizen of Germany.
A record time of 2:15:25 is held by Paula Radcliff from the United Kingdom.
Sixty-six-year-old Mikit<0xC4><0x9B>nek won the London Marathon last spring at 2:24:14.
She missed the Beijing Games because of something that was described as a back injury, but recovered and won in Berlin, and in the third marathon she ever ran, she improved her personal maximum by almost five minutes.
She ran the race smartly and thoughtfully: she let four Ethiopian and Kenyan runners escape to the big jump and then reached them for about 18 1<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 miles.
Askale Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia finished second in 2:21:31 and Helene Kiprop from Kenya finished third in 2:25:01.
The Pride and Obstacles of Black Lives in a Separate City
Hidden among the sprawling amusement parks of greater Orlando, a few miles from everything shiny, noisy, and huge, lies a quiet city where the pride and the ardour of African-American life comes to life.
Eatonville, the first fully black town to be incorporated into the state and where Zora Neale Hurston spent her childhood, is no longer as simple as she described it in 1935: "a city of five lakes, three croquettes of turfs, three hundred turrets of turquoise, three hundred turrets of brown leather, three hundred turrets of good."
Now it's a pilgrimage site.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the annual Eatonville Festival Zora! to pay tribute to Hurston, the most famous female writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
The city she described remains side-by-side, though it has made it a stop for tourists by including it in a Florida travel guide created by the Federal Writers project from the time of the economic crisis.
It is still as independent, worthy and private as it was in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resisted and did not share their real feelings with a white man who "knows so little about us that he doesn't even know what's coming."
Even today, in a year when Black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, is calling for an open debate on races, many locals remain wary of the views of foreigners.
“We pay great attention to how our story is being told,” says 59-year-old Hortense Jones, who lives here from birth and is a member of the oldest parish in the city.
"It must be right."
Eatonville has long been characterized as a paradox of triumph and effort.
It is both a historical model of Black rise and a community of nearly 2,400 people, where the poverty rate is twice the national average.
It is a center of literature, but also a shadowed oak by the example of Southern rural Negro culture – sometimes despised, sometimes praised – that originated from American slavery.
It’s not surprising that the locals are both proud and protective.
And concerns about the idea of Eatonville really started with Zora, which is the only way the Hurstons are called here.
She introduced her hometown to the world through heart-wrenching books such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
The five paragraphs of the Florida tour guide have changed the city a little bit to the 17th Street, which leads through the often-passed center of Florida, into the stage of Black history and human drama.
With the defeat of the great drum in life and literature, Hurston introduced readers to the shop of the first Eatonville mayor Joe Clark, and then turned to more personal places.
"Left of the road," she wrote, "is a white-brown decorated modern national school with well-maintained courtyards and playgrounds that Howard Miller always cares about, even though he can't read or write much."
She also mentioned Dash's new widow's husband and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of all kinds and anything that fits the clock hotel."
So in just a few hundred words, Hurston Eatonville was linked to self-government, but also to illiteracy, re-marriage and sex.
This was obviously not the typical publishing house of Fodor's.
In fact, it was not a portrait that everyone would appreciate.
“Zora said it the way it was,” says 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of Johnson’s choir girls who made Hurston immortal by quoting men who sang dirty songs about their beauty.
"Some people didn't like it," she added.
Hurston is still remembered here as a cypress emissary, which often returned after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Seventy-seven-year-old Augustus Franklin remembers that when she approached the city, she arrived unannounced in a huge Chevrolet, smoked and wore pants in a city that is still proud of decent clothing today.
Most of the population was fascinated, Franklin said, but many fell in love.
"The people have always liked to see Zor," Franklin said.
But, he added, swinging on a chair on the back terrace overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized, "she never stayed too long."
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were removed from the press.
It seemed that Eatonville, along with the rest of the world, had forgotten about her.
Although she was once a literary star, present-day Langston Hughes, and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an unmarked grave in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she had previously lived.
There were no major mourning ceremonies or large public readings in Eatonville.
"I don't think they understood her meaning to the world or her reference at all," said Valerie Boyd, author of Hurston's 2003 biography Wrapped in Rainbows.
Change came in the 80s of the 20th century.
Orange County officials wanted to stretch the city's five-lane highway instead of Kennedy Boulevard, which is the local two-lane main road.
The dismantling of Orlando has already pushed Interstate Highway No. 4 through the western edge of the city.
The proposal came at a time when Eatonville was still getting out of a difficult historical period.
Forced integration, along with other things, ended the relatively idyllic isolation of this community.
In the fifties of the 20th century, the struggle for the mixing of races brought hatred to the threshold of the community.
"At the time, a bunch of white guys, they came and threw oranges and stuff at the people sitting on the side," Franklin said.
"Actually, we had a lady here who killed it.
They threw the melon out of the car."
In a letter to The Orlando Sentinel in 1955, Hurston challenged the Supreme Court's demand for forced integration and declared his decision in the Brown v. Chamber of Education to be "offensive to my race rather than ceremonial."
Residents now claim that the disintegration of schools, although positive in some areas, has reduced cohesiveness in Eatonville and undermined the courage of local youth.
"Black children were used to hugging - I remember it - you hugged your teacher in the morning, you hugged your teacher in the evening," said N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Elly Dinkins and executive director of the non-profit group Preserve the Eatonville Community.
It lasted until the teachers and pupils came from the same place, she added.
"You don't embrace your white teacher because your white teacher - I mean, there's a cultural barrier," said Miss Nathiri.
Civil rights, however, helped create space for many more Zory Neale Hurstons – black writers, actors and artists who, like her, rose above prejudices with mild self-confidence and quotes such as “How can one resist the pleasure of my presence!
I don't understand."
In 1975, Alice Walker traveled to Hurston's unmarked grave and began to fight for the revival of her reputation.
Five years later, a highly praised Hurston biography by Robert E. Hemenway came on the shelves in bookstores, which re-introduced it to the American canon.
The highway project arrived just as the most famous daughter of Eatonville found the ramp lights again.
Hurston's former neighbors now considered her a savior.
To show what could happen to its highway, the community began planning the Hurston Festival in 1988.
Thousands of fans arrived at the inaugural event two years later, and every January, many return to the celebration.
After a few years, the state withdrew from the highway proposal.
“These five motorway currents have revived, you’d say, directly inflamed, a real civic pride,” Nathiri said.
Boyd said it more simply, "The Zora saved Eatonville."
Victory over the highway project helped change the image of the city.
Aliens like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who started going to the local church in 1993, began to appear in greater numbers, and residents began to rethink the past.
Eatonville joined the National Historical Registry in 1998.
A new one-story library (named after Hurston, of course) was opened in 2006 on the repainted and beautified Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains a Florida anomaly: just six miles from downtown Orlando can sometimes act as a falling alley in summer rain, as small as when it was founded with just 27 black families in the 1980s.
(Today it is 90 percent black.)
With strangers coming to search for the story and meaning of Eatonville, it is still often treated with caution.
Permission for most interviews is required to have in advance, and certain things — such as wall paintings in the oldest church in Eatonville, painted by whites and depicting blacks in the fields — are not allowed to be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Jones, a bold, self-confident teacher who likes to be saturated with red, still fear that their isolated community will not be properly understood.
And even as the Hurston Festival grew, so did the domestic pride.
Especially young people tend to see Eatonville the way Hurston saw her entire race: beautiful, with problems and so on, but not better, not worse, and as proud, creative, hardworking, crazy, and diverse as other American races and ethnicities.
From the voice of Franklin's nephew, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, comes a sincere love of the village when he plans to return to Eatonville after college to work for the local government or the police, which he says would benefit from some help.
And even younger ones, such as 11-year-old Winter Park twins Alondra and Alexia Kenonova, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people, when they're just passing by, will think, 'Um, this town is nothing against the others,'" said Alondra Kenon recently after the church.
"But if you really stop and look at history for a moment, it's a very nice city."
Here in New York, we all speak fluently financially.
At first glance, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan were to stay away from newspaper stands and screens on Times Square, they would not have realized that they were standing in the middle of a storm.
They would never decide that in the swirling bee trap of the offices above their heads, every day, bankers and fund managers who monopolize New York, have had the worst “bad day in the office” since the 1929 crisis.
The envoys keep shoving metal carts down the sidewalks and transfer the muffin bakers to breakfast meetings.
The Hispanics are still moving among the towers and are wearing, like human mules, fifty ragged shirts hanging from wax on their backs.
Office rats are still waiting at the front for their morning bagel at the street food stalls, and it is still not possible to get a yellow taxi on a daily basis between 4 and 7 p.m.
It didn’t look like a crisis at all until, with all the talk about pessimism, I decided to set up a savings account on Thursday afternoon.
Even though I had scheduled this task to cover up with a late-afternoon siege at my local JP Morgan Chase branch, there were already about twenty people waiting in the front.
Not in front of the cash registers to pick up or deposit cash, but in front of the bar where older customers order checkbooks, tourists ask for a way to shop with Macy's mixed goods, and new customers set up accounts.
Most of the people in front of me, as I learned from Starr, my "licensed personal banker," came for the same reason as me.
But compared to me, they have already chosen their savings from smaller banks in places where they came from, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania or Staten Island.
They chose money from so-called thrifts (slightly similar to construction savings banks), monetary unions and those types of savings banks whose branches operate in only one state and who claim to care for their customers as a family.
Over the past year, 15 such banks have quietly collapsed.
A few days ago, Washington Mutual, a $327 billion bank, went bankrupt, and when New Yorkers returned home on Friday evening, another bank, Wachovia, with $440 billion in assets, tried to catch a rescue buyer.
The employees of the offices and shops that stood in front of me and were afraid of another collapse, moved their cash to a bank that is perceived as a safe harbor and that does most of the bailout on Wall Street.
Ordinary New Yorkers have been learning fluently financially over the past week.
A woman in my local Chinese supermarket spoke on the phone and spoke to Lehman Borthers, that bank that went bankrupt, and to her obnoxious top executive, Dick Fulda, with such familiarity, as if she were rubbing about a sledgehammer.
And Lyn, the uniformed about fifty-year-old housewife of my agent, changed the subject of our ordinary conversation—Brad, Angelina, or my food delivery.
After my visit to the bank, she told me, "I have my savings in the money market funds now.
I've moved it, I'm not going to risk it."
Muslim graves deconsecrated after Austrian right-wing rupture
Heinz-Christian Strache, on the left, from the Austrian right-wing Free Party and Filip Dewinter from the Belgian right-wing Vlaams Belang are taking part in a demonstration that presented in Antwerp on Thursday 17 January 2008 the organization "Cities against Islamization".
They carry signs similar to traffic signs, which show mosques crossed by a red line.
The police accuse right-wing extremists of desecrating a Muslim cemetery in Austria on the same weekend in which extreme right-wing parties achieved huge gains in the general election.
Over 90 graves at the cemetery in the town of Traun near Linze were destroyed sometime between Friday evening and this morning and the police are convinced that it was an organized action.
The culprits have smeared Jewish symbols on some graves such as David’s star, but the detectives are convinced that it could have been an attempt to mask the motives of extremists driven by hatred towards Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident was linked to the election.
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said they were "deeply shocked" by reports of desecration coming as the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan nears its end.
Austria, meanwhile, is entering the quest for its own soul after the right-wing movement in yesterday’s parliamentary elections.
The two far-right parties, which won more than 30 percent of the vote together, the Free Party and the Union for the Future of Austria, vehemently campaigned against immigration and some of their slogans were condemned as xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the president of the Free Party, who won over 18 percent of the vote, protested in the campaign against the Shaqs and Burkas, and even expressed his opposition to food that is perceived as a relationship to Islam.
At a recent meeting with voters in Vienna, he spoke of a “European brotherhood” to prevent the rise of Islam.
Both sides are trying to ban the construction of mosques and minarets and argue that these are political symbols of the ongoing Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Surveys and analyses carried out immediately after the elections, which put the far right in the position of the strongest political bloc in the country, suggest that this change was caused mainly by young voters who are worried about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter is not allowed to travel abroad.
Gary Glitter, a glam rock star who has been convicted of child sexual abuse, has been banned by the court from travelling to France and Spain.
Officials imposed the six-month ban on Glitter after informing monitoring authorities that it plans to travel through France to Spain.
The ban was approved by Kent police last Thursday after it handed over evidence of Glitter’s past convictions for sexual abuse of children to officials.
Glitter, under his own name Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at Ashford's lowest criminal court in Kent, but was represented by lawyers from Corker Binning.
"On Thursday, September 25, at Ashford's lowest criminal court, Kentian police asked for an order to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd from crossing the borders to France and Spain until March 25.
Paul Gadd didn't participate personally."
64-year-old Glitter told authorities that he wants to travel abroad, as recorded in the register of sexual attackers.
He must notify the authorities if he wants to travel abroad for more than three days.
He must also forward the planned date of departure to the police a week in advance.
If he neglected to inform the authorities, he could be sentenced to five years.
The Kentian police said they would not discuss individual cases of Glitter's possible routes through the district.
A Kent police spokesperson said: “The Kent police will do whatever it takes to protect children in this country or abroad.
From our point of view, it is easier to track someone who will stay in the UK, because we have extensive systems here that handle potential dangers more effectively.
Protecting the people of Kent is a top priority for the Kent police, and we are working closely to monitor the behavior of the sex offenders recorded in order to minimize any danger to the public."
Glitter returned to Britain last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for the abuse of two girls aged 10 and 11.
When he was released, he flew to Bangkok, where he was scheduled to fly to London.
But he said he was not feeling well, and he refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not allow him to pass a passport check and eventually flew to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also refused to allow him to enter, and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and immigration officials insisted on his return to Britain.
On 22 August, he finally arrived at Heathrow Terminal 3 and stayed there, while his attorney David Corker went to the Uxbridge's lowest criminal court in West London and at the same time, Scotland Yard successfully requested an order to register as a member.
Glitter was previously incarcerated in the UK for four months for possession of child pornography.
A source from the interior ministry said that Jacqui Smith, the interior minister, is calm and happy that Glitter was prevented from travelling to France and Spain.
"To capture the real character, I photograph the master off-stage." Günther Bauer - photographer
No heels, no collars, no costumes.
Only the essence of the great masters of flamenco, deviated from the focus on interpretation - only in this way do I achieve the free expression of a man or woman.
On the one hand, an artist.
On the other hand, a man.
Indistinguishable, if we ignore privacy, in those moments far from the audience - then you can see a confidential gesture, the depth of a fleeting sight or the passionate gesture of hands that are carefree, because they do not intend to go on stage.
German Günther Bauer in "Flamenco-people" alternates the theatrical performances with singers, dancers and guitarists with the lesser-known face of the masters.
With this purpose, the photographer composes a unique iconography of flamenco from different environments.
The exhibition, which takes place as part of the program Mes de la Fotograf<0xC3><0xAD>a Flamenca, "reflects the ever-growing international importance of flamenco", says the author and explains that "Flamenco-people" "can be any type of people, but when you look at it, you can't look at it.
These people portrayed "on the street" are artists capable of conveying passion, sadness, joy... and completely capturing viewers.
To capture the personality of these artists it is not necessary to photograph on stage.
He has his personality and character inside him.
I was interested in creating a relaxed atmosphere that would allow me to capture the personality of the flamenco giants.
Enchanted by the Cante de las Minas festival, Bauer began in 1997 a long journey of portraying flamenco singers, guitarists and dancers on board cameras.
These are portraits that, thanks to the selection of the camera and the material, resemble a classic photograph.
The use of different stylistic means is contrary to the classical basis of the image and lends it a contemporary spirit, an idea which, according to Bauer himself, also mirrors flamenco: "Music with very traditional roots, which, however, does not cease to surprise and develop."
What spoils the audience is not the effect of the dance, the song or the play itself, but the personality and character of the artist.
The search for the moment when we meet the most important, the spirit that appears in the way of perception, being and experiencing, was and is a constant of the work presented during these days in the El Fotomata gallery.
This selection of nearly seventy photographed artists form famous flamenco figures such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyosov<0xC3><0xA1>, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales and Vicente Amigo.
The project has become a kind of flamenco anthology and soon a book edition will be held, which will contain exhibited portraits.
Two years ago, the passion for portraiture led Bauer to the idea of repeating the "Portrait of Sports Veterans" ("SportARTproject").
Although their concept is different from "Flamenco-people", the photographer admits that "photographing people, getting to know them and having the opportunity for a moment, whether longer or just short, to enter their lives - that's my passion.
I think portraits are the most difficult genre in photography.
A person meets or encounters people, personalities that he or she does not even know, or gives him or her only a few minutes to take a photo.
Despite similar circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to realize my ideas.”
A collection of portraits of the contemporary flamenco called "Flamenco-people" is on display at the Galerie El Fotomata in the street de la Mata 20, parallel to Alameda de Hercules, and can be visited until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa admits that the novel he writes is “truthlessness”
It takes place in an environment he does not know yet, and tells about the events unknown to him, yet Mario Vargas Llosa intends to successfully realize his new project - he is working on a novel whose main hero is Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived in the Amazon.
An eternal Nobel laureate for literature yesterday at the Hay Festival in Segovia admitted that the project that he is currently employing is "fidelity", and that "everything testifies that I shouldn't write" this novel.
"If I had reason, I wouldn't do it, but I'll do it and I believe I'll finish it one day," he concluded his post at the festival of exchange of ideas, thoughts and words, which in four days saw an aquaduct in the city of thousands of other writers and historians.
The author of the novel "City and Dogs" was one of the main characters of the third year of the celebration of the word and met expectations.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival award for the most popular writer - Dickens' old edition of "Our mutual friend", filled the Juan Bravo theater to the last place.
With Félix Romee's poems, which he quoted, he had a devoted audience, to which an hour of time ran like water; a Peruvian with amazing accuracy and a notable dose of humor, he remembered how in him he "remembered" the "unbelievable adventure" rather than the "experienced" of the "passionate reader."
The Hispanic-American novelist admitted that "there is no way" to determine whether and to what extent books can change lives, "but I refuse to believe that literature is just a fun, a fleeting experience" - he emphasized the "sleep" of his "sleep" and "sleep" with the "sleep" of his "sleep" and, according to him, "sleep it on people.
Due to climatology, the celebration in Pozoblanca is lost - missing copies
The performance, which closes the celebration in Pozoblanca, was cancelled yesterday morning after the announcement by the effectors that the surface of the square is not in good condition was confirmed.
That is why the firm, together with Fermin Boh<0xC3><0xB3>rquez, Pablo Hermosos de Mendoza and Leonard Hern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez, decided to cancel the bullfights.
Unfavourable weather conditions have made this celebration difficult for a long time, and two of the three celebrations could not have been held.
On Saturday, the rain prevented the course of the second planned bullfights.
During this time, the formations of José Luis Moreno, Curro D<0xC3><0xAD>az and Juan Bautista were to be built for the bulls in the arena in Castilblanca.
This was only celebrated on Friday.
The winner was Daniel Luque, who cut three ears and the award for dynamic and aesthetically quality performance was carried on his shoulders.
On the same day in the afternoon, Alejandro Talavante exchanged two strokes for salutes and one ear, which brought him rather uncovered seats in the arena than toreadorian art.
Worse still was El Juli, who walked through the bull arena of Los Llanos unwelcome.
In the second round of work, without a single breath, he earned sharp criticism from the majority of the audience.
Checks in <0xC3><0x81>lava caught in a truck with two thousand kilograms of hashish
Ten minutes, five.
Road control Ertzaintza in the city district of Armi<0xC3><0xB1><0xC3><0xB3>n (<0xC3><0x81>lava).
The attendants stop two people driving in the van and they drive them.
The cost, more than two tons of hashish, is not to be stopped.
According to a report by the Basque Interior Ministry, members of the government were persecuted and detained by one of the people travelling in the truck, a 38-year-old man who was identified as A.A.J.
He was accused of drug smuggling and forgery of state documents.
The incident occurred when several members of the Transport Unit carried out road checks on the N-1 in places passing through the border of the Armi<0xC3><0xB1><0xC3><0xB3>n district.
They were going to stop the truck for checks, but the driver did not follow the instructions, accelerated sharply and caught.
Companions of the car immediately began chasing until the vehicle stopped at the edge a few kilometers away, at which point both passengers jumped out and fled to the wooded crest.
Ertzaintza's followers finally caught one of them and seized 2,178 kilograms of hashish, which the suspects transported, as revealed during the inspection of the supply of the brand Iveco Daily.
The back of the vehicle was loaded with hashish packages, which were subsequently transferred to other police departments for detailed expertise and drug weighing.
In addition, the police found that the identification mark is "malicious" and does not agree with the data contained in the delivery documents, so the detained person was also accused of falsifying state documents.
Ertzaintza continues in search of the second suspect, who, as has already been mentioned, managed to escape, so that it is finally possible to determine the origin of the seized drug.
The 28-year-old A.A.J. detainee was transferred to the police department to deal with the appropriate formalities before later embarking on further investigation.
Actress Heather Locklear arrested for driving under the influence of drugs
Heather Locklear, Amanda’s favorite from Melrose Place, was arrested in Santa Barbara, California, this weekend for driving under the influence of drugs.
The Witness saw her perform unusual maneuvers as she tried to get out of the parking lot in Montecito, a spokesman for the California Highway Patrol told People magazine.
The witness said that at about 4:30 p.m. Locklear "was slowly stepping on the gas, driving back and forth in a noisy roar, and trying to get out of the parking lot - she crossed her sunglasses several times as she lay down."
The witness, who apparently didn’t recognize the actress at first, saw Locklear a moment after stopping on a nearby highway and getting out of the vehicle.
The person also alerted the rescue service because she was "afraid of Locklear's life."
When a police guard arrived at the scene, she found an actress inside the vehicle, which partially blocked the ticket.
"She looked disoriented," and so members took her to a specialized drug and alcohol center to undergo a test.
According to a police spokesperson, the actress cooperated and excessive amounts of alcohol were eventually excluded, yet "we believe Locklear was under the influence of some medication, which was visible to the guards at first sight."
Locklear was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of an unspecified substance and was taken into custody at around 7 p.m., although she was released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear returned from the treatment clinic, where she recovered from anxiety and depression.
Llamazares urges the Andalusian association IU to exercise its powers in the Silva case
The head of the IU and a member of the United Left Gaspar Llamazares today said that the final decision in the case of the former Youth and Sports Council in Seville, Francisca Manuel Silvy, who resigned from the party will be ousted from his office last week after being accused of ronad.
"I'm too federalist, it's up to the Andalusian organization to exercise its powers," Llamazares said in a speech to which the party will have to step up in relation to a former member of the Seville City Council.
The head of the IU, however, insisted that in the case of an investigation of the illegal conduct that Silva had committed, "transparency" is absolutely necessary: "The IU has always fought for the maximum transparency of such matters."
He also stressed that the party has a "strict code of ethics for all public functions".
"May Blood" ('Sangre de mayo'), an epic bet by Garci
José Luis Garci in the film "The Blood of May" (Sangre de mayo), inspired by episodes from the national past of Benito Pérez Gald<0xC3><0xB3>s, revives the famous Spanish uprising against the French - the most ambitious film in his filmography with a budget of around 15 million euros.
In this way, the filmmaker wanted to "depict the narrative of the characters and the analysis of society", which he always admired in the work of the famous novelist, he explained today, along with Quim Gutiérrez and Paulo Echevarr<0xC3><0xAD>a, during the presentation of the film to an extensive team of performers.
May’s blood, which lasts over two and a half hours, will be shown in cinemas this Friday and will be broadcast on more than four-hour TV series Telemadrid in the future.
As a great admirer of the literary work of Gald<0xC3><0xB3>s, José Luis Garci claims that by filming this film he fulfilled the "children's dream", thanks to Esperanza Aguirre, who three years ago for the Autonomous Province of Madrid commissioned him to produce a film of the second anniversary.
The budget of 15 million, to which the province of Madrid has fully contributed, means for Garci a "unique opportunity" to create an environment with scenery and costumes corresponding to the image of "the criss-crossing of Spain," which was not wrong in the leader's case.
The director regrets, however, that he could not count on the financial support given to the films The Sad Wing (Ala triste) or Goya's Ghosts - almost double the May Blood -, so he could not shoot some of the scenes even from the script signed at the same time.
The director of the film "Start Again" (Volver and the beginner) works as usual - on stage with actors with whom he usually tries before shooting and who does not choose to cast, because he feels like a movie to be "degrading" to him, and he also thinks that he is "participating" to me.
Many of the actors he chose for May's Blood have already appeared in front of his camera, such as Miguel Rell<0xC3><0xA1>n, Carlos Larra<0xC3><0xB1>aga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Garc<0xC3><0xAD>, with four Oscar nominations, one of which he won, is of the opinion that none of the three candidates representing Spain this year before the Hollywood Academy, the same as the May Blood, the Seven Tables of the French Billiards, and the last of the selected Blind Suns.
For this film, Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a does not expect any awards.
“At first you think you’re working for what’s next, but then you realize you’re only working for profit, and you’re going to be cheating on making one more movie,” Garci explains with a more than 30-year directorial career.
Isabel Bay<0xC3><0xB3>n revives the spiritual connection of Seville dancer T<0xC3><0xB3>rtoly Valencia
The Seville flamenco dancer is giving up another Seville dancer.
Carmen T<0xC3><0xB3>rtola Valencia, from the father of the Catalans (Floren<0xC3><0xA7> T<0xC3><0xB3>rtola Ferrer) and mother of the Andalusian (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in Triana, and when she was three years old, they moved with their family to London.
She danced modern dance and focused on oriental dance.
She lived a life of passion, pioneering women’s emancipation such as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf, and Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and vegetarian and fought for the abolition of the corset, which made it impossible for women to move freely.
The life of this woman influenced by the dance and aesthetic revolution of interwar Europe Isabele Bay<0xC3><0xB3>n was fascinated.
"I wanted to work with Pep Gamboa and she designed this character for me - it seemed incredible to me."
According to the dancer, "it's not about telling her life, it's about capturing her soul.
The names of her dance performances reminded me of the rhythms of flamenco.
So the "butterfly dance" evoked me guajira or the "snake dance" of some tango.
Her dance was sensual and they told me that my dance is also a match for this aesthetic,” she says.
The performance counts on the involvement of two exceptional personalities: with Miguel Poveda, who will sing Isabele in one performance as well as in "La porte abierta", and with the dance teacher Matilda Coral, who made an exception and joined the bluve.
"Matilde represents the older Tortola, a mature figure.
I’m glad she accepted the offer to participate in my project, and it’s a great honor for me.”
The performance also features the music and guitars of Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s Torres and Paca Arriagy, with the songs of Miguel Ortega, el Pulgy and Moi de Mor<0xC3><0xB3>n; the drums of El P<0xC3><0xA1>jara, the viola of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of the actor Juanfry Ju<0xC3><0xA1>rez, "who are the masters of the eternal guide in this kind of art."
The work also takes into account the life of this woman, who played in her time in such remote places as India, the United States or Russia, and also throughout Europe, because she usually lived in London.
“I wanted to remind her because I think she was one of those women who had a huge influence at some point, but today no one knows her and even less appreciates her creation,” Bay<0xC3><0xB3>n says.
The performance starts today at 8:30 p.m. at the Lope de Vega Theatre.
The book "The Newly Married Diary" also closes the triennale
The introduction of the first illustrated edition of the Li<0xC3><0xA8>ge diary in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), at the place where Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the program coordinated by the Cultural Council of the Andalusian government.
"Trinals of Zenobia and Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n" is coming to an end with a new edition of this work, an international congress to be held in New York, a renovation of the Nobel Museum house and a travel exhibition of "Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Jiménez's conquest into the province of Andaluc<0xC3><0xAD>a.
The Cultural Council of the Autonomous Government of Andalusia has also ordered eight hundred copies of the "Newly Married Diary" edited by Pedrera Taberner and illustrated by Jacob Pérez-Encis to continue to spread awareness of the personality and work of one of Andalusian's most world-famous poets.
America without Paul Newman doesn’t like it that much anymore.
“Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them.”
These are the words of actress Sally Field, who collaborated with him on "Without Bad Intentions" and, knowing that Newman has left, reveals her unsettled vision of abandoned American cinema and all of America.
Look at how long it took them to get Oscar.
He has been retired since 2007.
And that he knew he was seriously ill.
He was still a boy for everyone.
"Sometimes what one feels cannot be expressed in any way, and I have now lost a great friend," said Robert Redford, "my life and my country have been better thanks to him."
No one was afraid that he would be ridiculous or exaggerated.
The film's father and father-in-law died in a particularly dark time of fear of terrorists and financial markets, at a time when American self-confidence is at the bottom of a desperate search for reasons to be proud.
When times are harsh and people without virtues and only a handful of those who are worthy of your admiration, there is no need to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all, he embodied the almost platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official opponent of Richard Nixon and a fighter for lost and won cases, from the anti-drug addiction foundation based on the honor of his first-born son who died of overdose to his own brand of domestic food and bio-food.
A complete treasure for a country that was worth a lot of effort to get rid of the suicidal eating culture.
A turbulent wave of admiration flooded Hollywood regardless of nationality or nationality.
The last James Bond, Englishman Daniel Craig, stated that not one man died, but an entire era.
Another Englishman, Oscar-winning director Sam Mendes, said that working with Newman was without a doubt the pinnacle of his career.
The bad guy from Australia, Russell Crowe, trolled Newman to call himself his greatest source of inspiration.
“That fox has put a pretty high stake on us all,” says George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who today has the courage to try to live the way Paul Newman lived – based on honesty and lead a serious private life away from the cameras.
This is not always easy in today’s media jungle, sometimes even possible.
But fortunately, such people are, and Paul Newman is their role model.
He divorced once, and since then he has been married for fifty years to Joanne Woodward, who was faithful, although he certainly had more than enough opportunities not to be.
"Why should I go out for a hamburger when I have a fillet at home?" he joked.
May he be accompanied in heaven by the pride that there is on earth a reconciliation between his daughters and admirers – it is not very common in America.
It is said that "of all the great roles he embodied, he was the proudest in the role of a devoted husband, a loving father, a willing grandfather and a sacrificial philanthropist".
Imperfection of the Olympic Games in Madrid
Yes, many of us want the Olympics to be held in Madrid, and after a failed 2012, it may be 2016.
But I ask, are we ready?
If we're going to run yesterday's race, I'm saying no!
It was said to be a perfect race, and according to my court, it was the worst I've ever been at.
Such a dream of nonsense, that if it came to an assessment and I was a tester, it would be clearly insufficient.
But let's look at it from the beginning, pretty much one after the other.
The nonsense begins with the pick-up of the race number, for which one has to leave early.
That doesn’t seem bad to me, but when a person goes there, they should give him everything (including a chip to prevent overloading the track).
Oh, no, no.
Here one had to pick up the number first (first nonsense, go there only for that) and (after the display of the appropriate front) - what a surprise! - they had only a T-shirt size S (second nonsense, because I need a size XL).
Where do we live?
This is because of the crisis they decided to buy only small T-shirts because it is less fabric and are cheaper?
Well, those are small things compared to what happened on the day of the race.
In addition to the fact that it had to go very early for the chip and the front on it lasted more than 15 minutes, the backpack had to be handed over there.
The waiting time lasted over 35 minutes, which is at the race, where 11,000 people are expected, something incomprehensible.
So, as could be expected, the race started and we haven't laid back our backpacks yet, and when it was done, picking up was a lot worse.
In addition, the wait was extended by 40 minutes of rain, leading to a general uprising and an attack on the cabin.
I believe that 500 of us will have bronchitis tomorrow and some, like me, will not show the right time in evaluating the results because of the chip they gave me and which, I guess, did not record the start time correctly.
Of course, if someone asked me about a perfect race, this one wouldn't have thought of me.
And so I think we're going to have to let a well-prepared Olympic city just pretend.
Microsoft is looking for a receptionist (virtual)
At the MIT Conference on New Technologies, Microsoft presented further developments in the new system of image recognition and human interaction in a manner of artificial intelligence - not too intelligent, but able to perform basic tasks such as calling a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a messenger that would move around the entire company.
Thanks to a camera and a system that recognizes shapes and faces, this "receptionist" can see how many people are in the room who they are - even remember what they have on them - and listen and understand the key words of their conversations.
It can also sort the present by group of conversations.
In the demonstration video, the receptionist records the third person and understands that they do not belong to the group that talks to them, and that they are not an employee of the company.
She asks if she's after someone, and she tells her she'll devote herself to it in a moment.
All without the blue screen of death.
Awesome.
Of course, that is the music of the future.
Now the company has more important things to do, such as a new version of Windows.
There’s been a lot of talk this week about changing Microsoft’s strategy.
Windows 7 will be lighter and will not have as many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer came to the conclusion that if computers had only the most necessary, without the burden of commercial waste, they would be five times more powerful – man, Steve, they would be cheaper.
Discover as a chrome when we consider that Microsoft version from version adds new features to Windows and additional "extras".
A change of direction would be a worthy act.
Microsoft is right, the operating system is slowly losing meaning, and so is the software.
When Google Chrome appeared on the network, I became one of those who adhered to the theory that it was Google’s first step towards competing with Windows.
Many rightly pointed out that the browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is a necessary layer to understand between hardware and software.
It has the same function as your wife or your husband when you have to say something to the chick.
That's true.
It never disappears, but it is necessary to think of the "death" of the operating system not as absolute truth, but as relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week confirms this idea.
People are paying less and less attention to the operating system and, conversely, more and more to the Internet browser.
Your computer turns on to run Firefox or Explorer – or Chrome – and we spend more time on the Internet every day than around the windows.
What is the purpose of half the applications that accompany the system?
Less is more.
And Windows 7 must be less, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, less loaded, less complex.
Microsoft is now interested in offering its services online and finally becoming an alternative to Google.
They need it, and here is a small example.
I took this photo at a restroom for Microsoft employees in Redmond at the beginning of the month.
There was a poster on the vending machine asking them to use their search engines: "Your search. Our future."
In 2006, an independent study found that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search the Internet.
Last week, by the way, the delay of the new version of Windows Mobile 7 was confirmed.
It will not come at the beginning of 2009, but at the end, so let’s count until 2010.
At Microsoft, they will certainly try to bring Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 to the market together.
The phone is becoming more and more a computer.
Since Android and iPhone are already on the market, they will have to pay dearly for the delay.
The Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso wore it on the C<0xC3><0xB4>te d'Azur, Leonardo di Caprio in one glittered in Edward Zwick's "Blood Diamond", as well as Al Pacino in "Kmotr" Francis Ford Coppola, and in addition is part of the uniform of a muscular gay community.
And if we want to get into the list of his life roles, we can immerse ourselves in the image of a typical muscle with a pointed snout that raises the act in a nomadic circus.
In essence, it’s nothing more than a typical cotton men’s underwear, tight and sleeveless.
English speakers call it 'tank', but le Fabuleux Marcel from Brussels stands out above all others.
First of all, because of his colloquial name - although it is popularly called 'Marcel' - which is associated with sport, because, according to legend, it was named after boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lover of singer Edith Piaf.
'Marcel' stands out above the others with a quality cotton, unisex cut, distinctive label and (almost unmistakable) Belgian flag, which have models of the most emblematic prints as a detail at the neck.
And be careful, because the Belgian company does not specialize only in tank tops.
It also produces college t-shirts, retro boxers, cashmere sweaters, cotton pants, marine t-shirts, children's clothes, mini shorts...
Designed pieces for comfortable underwear.
Although it's a shame they're just underwear.
They're too beautiful.
"I want to be a young mother. Who will be a father, I don't care."
The huge image with her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Monica Cruz, though small in character, is a woman full of life.
Her new acting in fashion is now being taken very seriously by the Cruz sisters.
For M<0xC3><0xB3>nica, it means so much more than just that some pretty, famous girls borrow their name.
In Paris, she participated in a promotional event organized by Mango at its new headquarters, as well as the announcement of the most important fashion prices sponsored by the Spanish company.
She's heartfelt and cowardly, and she'll get you close.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to present a new collection that Sister Penélope and I had planned for Mango for this fall-winter season, and at the same time I attended the announcement of the second annual "Mango Fashion Awards" and dinner at the Opera in honor of Valentina.
It was a challenging but at the same time exciting day.
What is the basis of your new collection for Mango, for which you are already working for the fourth season?
My sister and I love movies from the 50s and 60s, and we have drawn a lot of inspiration from them.
I also love to walk around the city and watch women walk in clothes, how they combine and layer their clothes, I do it very often.
You're a dancer, an actress, a designer, a very versatile woman, right?
I think so, but after all, everything is connected and has many connections.
I thought I liked clothes, I always wanted to go to my grandmother, talk in her aunt’s closets and check her clothes.
It was a sensation, almost better than going on a pilgrimage.
Then, when I became a dancer, I always tried to take care of the way I was dressed.
However, you know that we dancers are based on how we are adjusted to make ourselves feel good at our hours and rehearsals when looking in the mirror.
And as an actress, when they give you a costume, then you really get into the character.
So everything is connected, but with great respect for designers and professionalism.
You were just 30 years old, you had a crisis?
No, no.
I'm feeling better than I've ever been, I'm having fun in my 30s.
I find that a woman is ready, has experience, and enjoys life with fewer mistakes.
Biological clocks don't scare me.
I refuse to do what I want, and that gives me great inner happiness.
So you're thinking about being a mother, aren't you?
Of course, I know I’ll be a mother because my body wants it, and besides, I want to be a young mother, I don’t want to miss it.
As for my father, I'm not worried about it.
But one thing I know for sure, I will give my child a sense of happiness and I will raise him with great love.
As for the movie, there are a few premieres of the films you made last year.
That's it, and I'm looking forward to seeing them in the movies.
I come from the theatre world, so I'm very impatient and restless, I want everything right now, and of course I can't.
I'm looking forward to the premiere of "La la ultima hora" and "In search of the tomb of Christ".
Definitely how you'll like it...
A few days ago, you had your premiere at the showroom next to Naomi Campbell, didn't you?
Well, don't say that.
It's not like I'm going to the pier as a model.
Only Naomi Campbell, whom I've known for a long time, called me and invited me to London to take part in charity shows for her organization "Women for a Better Life," and the clothes that we presented - I even picked two models from our collection "Na<0xC5><0xBE>i<0xC4><0x87>" and "Na<0xC5><0xBE>i<0xC4><0x87>" for Mango.
People don't know Naomi has such a good heart.
There are a lot of things about her, and since I know her, I can tell you that many of them are not true.
Besides, I'm going to stick to the good he's engaged in.
She asked me to perform for charitable purposes, but when she asks me to make a stand, I'll do it too.
I will do whatever is necessary for the women of the Third World.
Drivers repeatedly catching alcohol in the blood will have to install "alcolock"
The Ministry of the Interior requires the driver with three administrative sanctions for driving under the influence of alcohol to install in his car a system that prevents him from starting the car intoxicated or if he does not breathe.
The proposal became known as early as June of this year and is now included in the annual report of the Supreme Prosecutor’s Office, according to which it is a pilot project that will last one year.
Its goal is to return drivers behind the wheel, so drivers will also have to take a course of transport retraining.
In addition to the National Office for Traffic Safety, the Directorate-General for Transport (DGT) and the Foundation of the Institute of Technology for Automobile Safety (FITSA) will participate in this experience.
According to statistics, between 30 and 75% of drivers accused of driving intoxication more than once again in this state sit behind the wheel.
Alcolock should prevent this, as it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the level of alcohol in the exhausted air and prevents the car from starting if the driver does not breathe before or if the allowed concentration of alcohol is detected.
Its price exceeds <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1,000 and the culprit himself would have to pay it.
A study carried out in the United States in 2007 showed that in the first year since its introduction, the number of offences for vehicles equipped with this device has decreased by 65%.
In Spain, it is estimated that every year, it could save the lives of 115 people.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: that this behaviour be resolved before it leads to a criminal offence.
And in order to help its implementation, since legal regulation can be carried out in the usual way, the necessary regulation of criminal provisions requires a change of the law.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any sales version, although some industrial vehicles and public service vehicles have already been put to the test.
Tomorrow, the Congress of MEPs will vote on the proposal of the PSOE (Spanish Socialist Workers' Party) in which it is recommended to install this system in school buses, as it is in France.
In Mexico and without "peeptoes"
With British accuracy, at 17.40 hours, as it was on the program, a Spanish Air Force aircraft landed in a presidential hangar at Benita Ju<0xC3><0xA1>rez Airport in Mexico City, where the Prince and Princess of Asturias arrived.
The sun had just set, but its rays had yet to close their eyes so that a successive pair could be seen leaving the plane.
A Spanish ambassador and other officials were standing under the stairs.
A few hours ago, I asked the taxi drivers on the street if they knew that the Spanish prince and the princess were coming for a state visit.
- Yeah, that's great, it's not gonna get to the airport to pick up people... she's from here or what...
- No, no, sir, she's a Spaniard, but she lived here for a few years.
- Yeah, well, that's...
However, the Mexican press knows well who the Prince and Princess of Asturias is and how important their visit is.
Many people are waiting in a hangar at the airport just off a red carpet and a military cordon, which consists of 27 naval soldiers ready to fire an honorary salvage.
The prince appears with a smile on his lips in a dark blue suit and the princess, very alternatingly dressed and with torn hair, does not have her usual "peeptoes", apparently reported to her that in D.F. a storm is threatening.
Before they go to the hall where the official delegations are waiting, they smile at the photographers and unintentionally delay them.
At the door of the hotel where they will be staying, one of the four largest in the city, a reported Mexican television reporter awaits them.
The best-stocked fashion price
There’s probably no better place in the world to announce a fashion award than Paris, and there’s probably no more famous designer and bonvivan than Valentino.
Mango has just announced the second year of the El Bot<0xC3><0xB3>n-Mango Fashion Awards to enable an international presentation to new fashion talent.
The price is donated in the amount of 300,000 euros.
Belgian Sandrina Fasoli, the winner of the first year, yesterday looked at her proposals in the Manga outlet on the 54th Haussmann Boulevard in Paris and almost wept with surprise.
Of course, it is the second largest store of this company in Europe and it has just opened on an area of 1,335 square meters.
The largest one is located in London.
Many of the events, along with the desire to thank the designer Valentino for taking the chair of the competition jury, led us to dinner at the Garnier Opera in Paris.
The Presidential Table, ceremonially decorated by the Mango Company, looked a little more amazing next to the most famous Chagall works.
Nati, who, with a broken heart, did not reveal anything about her brother's recent death, dressed herself in the dress of this brand and the jewels of the ELAH, over which she breathed, and hung in her son Luis - the almost two-meter-elegant - at his table at several Valentine's Cheese.
Andik, the boss and owner of Mango, took the welcome and, as a true gentleman, stayed with Baron Rothschild without a jacket, as they were both offered to two ladies.
M<0xC3><0xB3>nica Cruz, who arrived at the store in her own hand-designed trousers and shirts, and at dinner she dressed in long black sexy dresses, touched the night walk around the Opera with Goyi Toled's accompaniment.
Inés Sastre did not stop at the tour of the adjacent buildings of the palace, but before leaving she showed us photos of her son on her mobile phone.
The next morning we could fall in love with the presence of Olivier Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez – another young man riding a motorcycle – and John Travolta, who came to the Intercontinental Hotel in Paris with his own bed sheets and towels and asked in advance not to use any fragrances in his rooms.
The stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh, that's life.
1001 - anti-stress number
Not 1000, but 1000 plus one way to forget about the chaotic and spooky everyday life.
And to be fair, they are all summed up in one book that will bring relaxation to the bookstore on September 30th.
The alarm bells every morning at 7 a.m. as a punishment, but even worse is to imagine yourself absorbed in the rush rhythm that brings the present life.
The office is called tension and the computer back pain.
Stress is a disease of the 21st century.
However, there are neither one nor two methods of combating daily exhaustion and distancing ourselves from the world of work.
No, that number is no more than 1001 and no less than 1001.
Susannah Marriott outside of the yoga position, classical massages and spa therapy on the pages of her book gathered an entire "menu" of options, adjusted to the taste and time options of each individual.
The anti-stress book is called "1001 way of relaxation" and thanks to the publishers Pearson Alhambra and DK will bring peace of mind to the bookstore.
If someone believes that it is not possible to achieve peace of mind in areas such as work or personal relationships, the "handbook" denies this view.
In addition, it offers other procedures such as being in contact with nature or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If your veins no longer contain adrenaline, which restores balance in your body, and stress has become a problem, it’s time to sit on the couch, turn off and focus on reading.
Talking from sleep
Some kids talk at night.
I don't mean the ones who wake up and tell us something that happened the day before, but the kids who talk while they sleep.
When it happens for the first time, it may make you stand out, but in fact, it’s insignificant.
This is a harmless sleep disorder called somnilokvie.
It is quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
I'm sure not one of you was told that he was talking about sleep at night.
This phenomenon can occur very sporadically (for example, once in a lifetime with a high fever), or with greater regularity (every day, once a week, once every few months...), the second day the baby does not remember anything.
There is not just one reason to explain her rise.
It is often associated with other sleep disorders, such as nightmares, night terrors, enuresis nocturna (night assistance) or lunar eclipse, but may not be.
As mentioned earlier, it can often be accompanied by very high fevers, stressful or troubled situations.
In any case, this is a little explored phenomenon.
The intensity with which it appears is also different.
The child can speak in a calm voice, say individual words, whisper, or vice versa (crying, crying, long speeches...).
In cases when it manifests itself with great force, it would be appropriate to observe the child and consult with a specialist to find out if he has any problem that causes great anxiety and manifests itself in this way.
We have said that this is a harmless disorder, so it is not treated only if it is associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, if it is associated with apnea syndrome or with permanent stress).
However, we can do this by keeping in mind a few very simple preventative measures, such as:
Try not to interrupt the child too much before going to bed.
So look for quiet games and avoid terrifying or somewhat violent TV shows or series.
In very nervous children and those who can work to relax, it is possible to use relaxation techniques that will help them gain some inner calm.
This will allow the child to sleep more calmly.
When sleepwalking occurs, try to remain calm.
Remember that it is harmless to the child and that he will remember nothing of what happened the next day.
Useful Advice
Don't be him.
It's useless because he's not aware and you're interrupting his sleep.
Even when he speaks, he sleeps, and so he rests.
Keep in mind that if it seems to you several times in a row that you are very worried, it would be appropriate to seek advice or find out what causes such anxiety in a child.
If he understands what he is saying (which is not so common), avoid the temptation to interrogate him and draw information from him.
It will be of no use, because when he sleeps, he is not conscious to be able to organize his thoughts.
In addition, you will hear what he says, but you do not know what he thinks about, and therefore why he says it, so pay close attention to how you interpret the information and what conclusions you come to.
Never tell a child that you can ask him about his secret at night.
Not even for fun.
That's a lot of anxiety.
Don’t worry, it’s not a bad thing, it’s just an episode that only lasts a few minutes.
Illaeusern... finally
Illhaeusern finally found his way to victory again after a long slender period.
Without playing a particularly big match, the yellow-blacks created more chances and managed to change one of them victoriously.
The game did not have too fast pace during this clash, in which the attackers only struggled, too fast.
After the first attempt by the captain of the host Kauffmann, who shot from a distance only by the hairs passed the ally, Illhaeusern began to have a slight overlap and first Fonderflick from a distance, then Hirne by air, Romain on a long leg or also Diebold gradually came to torment Dan.
The opponent, on the other hand, built a defensive wave in the half of the pitch and left only agile Riahi at the tip of the attack.
The start of the second half proved decisive, first thanks to Dannemarie's two chances with the names Riahi and Temporale, then after opening the score for the Illhaeusern, which Marais took care of.
However, Golman Illhaeusern did not enjoy the joy for a long time, about twelve minutes later he was forced to return to the wardrobe, leaving his team-mates in a weakening state.
However, Dannemarie was unable to take advantage of it, and the eleven of the Illhaeusern, who had just retreated a little to "intensify" the defence, no longer caused any greater difficulty, except for the very last seconds of the match, when the ball b. b. b. b. b. b. b. b. b. b. b. b. b. b. b. b. b. b.
Sarkozy to meet angry fisherman
Before departing for the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will take a trip through Brittany.
To face a demonstration of fishermen’s strength, which severely disrupted the accessibility of several Breton and Norman ports on Monday, the French president decided to go to the Guilvinec port in Finist<0xC3><0xA8>re on Tuesday morning to meet with their representatives.
The latter promised to be adopted "in a constructive spirit", and hoped to "come with concrete proposals".
The presidential visit comes at the same time as the general meeting of the "crisis committee" set up by Breton fishermen in order to obtain measures against the sharp rise in oil prices, which reached a peak of more than 1.14 euros per liter on average.
According to Elysée Palace spokesman David Martinon, the president “will talk to them about solutions that can be imagined in an effort to help their companies regain competitiveness and better secure conditions for hiring and paying sailors.”
Nicolas Sarkozy is a fisherman with impunity.
On Tuesday morning, they carried out an operation called a "slow-vehicle operation" in the departments of Morbihan and Calvados, causing almost 10km of clogging.
Quiberon's recreational port was also blocked, but connections to Belle-<0xC3><0x8E>le were not interrupted.
A filtration dam was established on the Quiberon Peninsula.
Sailors demonstrated their determination as early as Monday, when tyres and pallets were burned at dawn in front of fuel warehouses at the ports of Brest and Lorient, while demonstrations were held in Concarneau and Saint-Brieuc.
The movement extended to other ports along the Atlantic coast and the Channel, such as to Sables d'Olonne in Vendée, where the trawlers remained in the port, or to Le Havre, where about twenty ships blocked the operation of merchant ships.
Fishermen from Turballe and Croisic in the Loire-Atlantique area stopped the blockade of the important Total refinery in the Donges during the evening.
Those from Boulogne-sur-Mer have decided to wait until Wednesday's meeting at the ministry, before they decide to act on their own.
In Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" is due to decide on Tuesday on how to continue on the way forward, and on its participation in the preparatory meeting at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
However, some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by the head of the State Fisheries Department, who did not support their movement.
“The strike will continue” because “fishers are not leaving for nothing” and “they do not want to get to Paris,” said Liliane Cariou, chair of the Lorient Fisheries Department.
Professional fishermen who do not pay an oil tax currently pay around 50 cents per litre, however, judge that the threshold of the ship’s yield is reached only when the oil is below 0.30 euros per litre.
Paul Newman 's
Butch Cassidy and Kid's memorable representative died of cancer at the age of 83 at his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford, and Sam Mendes bowed down to the film legend and politically engaged actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its supply assumptions for 2008
Brazil’s aircraft maker relies on 215 aircraft to be delivered this year, despite the threat of a recession that is looming over the world economy.
Embraer, the world’s fourth-largest aircraft builder, maintains its supply assumptions for 2008 with 215 aircraft delivered, confirmed its president, Fredrico Fleury Curado.
In the first half of the year, the manufacturer delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian designer promises a lot from the Chinese market, especially considering the range of his aircraft from 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has supplied 41 devices to Chinese customers in the span of eight years.
AIG says it is considering transferring 15% of its assets
The insurer American International Group, which the U.S. monetary authorities have received over the water, is considering transferring more than 15% of its assets in order to pay back the $85 billion it was given as a deposit, writes the Sunday edition of the Financial Times.
AIG is ready to explore the sale of most of its life insurance activities in the international field and retirement activities in the United States, a journal citing sources close to the ongoing negotiations specifies.
The AIG board of directors met on Sunday evening to examine any possible transfers, according to the FT.
It was not possible to obtain any confirmatory statement from AIG.
The assets AIG intends to dispose of include its aviation leasing subsidiary International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in the insurance provider Transatlantic Holdings, as well as its portfolio of real estate and private equity investments, FT adds.
No final decision on these transfers has yet been taken, FT continues.
AIG must quickly obtain cash in order to repay the $85 billion loan provided by the Federal Reserve Bank with the risk of the U.S. authorities seizing 80% of its capital, while diluting it to the current shareholders’ equity ratio.
Paris. Analysis of the Historical Session of the Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange recorded a historic decline on Monday after the House of Representatives rejected Paulson’s bank bailout plan: The Dow Jones lost 6.98%, an unprecedented loss of close to 800 points, and the Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) dropped 777.68 points to 10 365.45 points.
The largest point loss to date in its history (about 684.81 points) was recorded on September 17, 2001, the day of the resumption of trade following the September 11 terrorist attacks.
The Nasdaq Index with the dominant technology component lost 199.61 points after closing and stood at 1 983.73 and the expanded Standard & Poor's 500 Index fell by 8.81 % (i.e. 106.85 points) to 1 106.55 points.
Drawn down from the beginning of the session, Wall Street literally collapsed after an unexpected rejection of the bank bailout plan to the House of Representatives, a plan that was to allow a bit of stability to be found again in the markets.
228 votes against and 205 for the representatives refused to give the funds requested to Secretary of State Henry Paulson.
Nearly two out of three Republicans rejected his plan.
“It’s a bad signal sent by the market that sees Congress not being able to accept a certain plan,” said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
"It shows how much the market relied on this plan," she added, expressing concerns that the project adopted in a few days would not come "too late".
“If this project is really doomed to collapse ..., the relay will be immediately handed over to the Fed (the U.S. central bank, ed.) and other central banks to ignite the crisis, which would further strengthen the credit conditions,” said Brian Inc<0xC3><0xAD>une, CEO of Globalight.
And with emphasis on the urgency of the situation, Pigeon said that in the United States "every new day brings the fall of one financial institution."
After the collapse of Washington Mutual on Friday, authorities organized the purchase of Wachovia’s banking activities by its rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis has suddenly taken a turn and called for urgent intervention in favour of banks in the UK, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, suggesting that markets are not dealing "only with the US crisis, but with the global crisis."
The bond market has risen sharply.
Revenue from the 10-year cash register fell to 3.632 percent from 3.827 percent on Friday night, yield to 30 years from 4.161 percent on the previous day.
Obama wins points in first TV duel
After Friday's first debate between the two candidates in the White House, the second debate was to find out who of the two John McCain and Barack Obama won.
The Republican-Democrat campaign headquarters were not surprised when both announced their victory in the television duel, which was watched by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain’s performance, however decent, was not “brilliance” enough to allow him to stop, five weeks before the presidential election, a decline in polls.
The Gallup Institute, whose public opinion poll published on Saturday credits Obama with a five-point lead (49 percent vs. 44 percent for McCain), says the Democrat is the one who won the duel.
Among the undecided voters they care about, Obama is the winner for 39% of the respondents, while, according to a CBS survey, 25% attribute the victory to McCain.
Obama should be able to confirm his leadership on Thursday with the expected good performance of his fellow candidate, Joseph Biden, during the first and only public debate with his rival, Sarah Palin.
"It would be a mistake to underestimate it.
It's a gift," Bill Clinton said of the weekend.
Seventy-seven-year-old McCain has consistently highlighted his undeniable experience in the field of foreign policy, while emphasizing his opponent’s “na<0xC3><0xAF>vety” in the issues that formed the core of the first confrontation.
"Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that..." was a recurring accusation.
"I don't think Senator Obama would have enough experience and knowledge to become president," he said.
In such an attacking spirit, the Republican television spots were carried away from yesterday.
Obama, on the other hand, stressed that it represents the future.
He did not lose his head and proved to be brief and precise.
He emphasized his ability to make the right decisions and restore the good reputation of the United States in the world.
“McCain still didn’t understand, while Obama did,” a Democratic spot on the weekend told the Republicans that he did not sufficiently consider the impact of the crisis on the “normal American.”
"During the ninety-minute debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you," Obama said in front of 20,000 people gathered at an election meeting in North Carolina in the wake of heavy rain.
He didn't even pronounce words like "middle class" or "working." The financial breakdown clearly favors Obama, whom Americans consider more likely to save the economy on the brink of a rift.
"There could be a decisive turnaround next week," Democratic Senator Charles Schumer said yesterday.
Democratic Representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama’s “economic discernment” to that of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic candidate, the current disaster is “the final verdict of an eight-year bad economic policy, how it was run by George Bush and how Senator McCain supported it.”
The Illinois senator reaffirmed that, despite the unexpected leaps of Wall Street, he should be able to reduce the tax rate of 95% of Americans, and also pointed out that the realization of the country’s potential energy independence through the promotion of health systems with renewable energy is a priority behind his number.
McCain plans to build a park with 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
Both candidates have carefully avoided questions about the $700 billion (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>470 billion) financial aid plan that Congress accepted last night and is highly unpopular.
"What, did you notice that there was an election in Minsk?"
Young people and opponents of the regime demonstrated on Sunday evening in the main square of the Belarusian capital, in order to reject the results of the parliamentary elections in advance.
Several hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday night immediately after the closing of polling stations on Minsk's main square to protest the irregularity of parliamentary elections.
Although no results have been announced so far, many young people have come to protest against President Lukashenko’s regime: a “dictator, resignation”.
Some admit that they didn’t even go to the polls: “What would it be for if they did what they wanted with my voice anyway,” says one young man.
He does not believe that this regime, which has been friendly to foreign observers with a view to resuming negotiations with the European Union, would be prepared to make a turn towards democracy.
Sanctions, including the ban on visas for 40 Belarusian sex offenders and the freezing of some assets, could be lifted if the election is deemed clean by the observers.
According to the opposition, that was not the case.
"We were kept away from election commissions and our observers were not allowed to participate in the vote count," said Yuri Potemkin, a spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a diverse group of twelve parties.
"It's about cosmetic change," emphasizes Alexandr Milinkievich, a former opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential election and the leader of the pro-European movement, "because it's important who counts the votes, and it's the executive power here.
If some opposition members get into parliament, it will be by appointing them, not by electing them.
However, their entry into parliament can mean space on television, meetings in regions and bills."
The opposition therefore feels obliged to participate in the political functioning, because "a dialogue with the European Union needs to be started.
After all, if our economy, deeply indebted to Russia, is hit by a crisis and we are not reforming, we are in danger of becoming a protectorate of Russia.
But we want to be independent.”
The opposition is concerned that the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, which monitored the course of the elections, will not declare the elections valid.
It stresses that participation seems to be too high and that the general introduction of early voting (26% of voters in Minsk) has paved the way for all possible manipulations.
"What have you noticed that elections have taken place?" asks the social-democratic leader Alexandr Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August of this year.
“There was no foot in the polls.
And there will be a maximum of five opposition MPs in parliament, those who most fit the regime."
The silence of the night was once again on the October square.
On television, President Lukashenko and members of the Central Election Commission congratulate each other on their success.
Conversation – The Blood That Is Again Sure
Yesterday, Héma-Québec celebrated the tenth anniversary of its founding and its president, Dr. Francine Décary, was rightly delighted because Héma-Québec has become one of the most reliable and effective blood donors in the world.
Above all, he regained public confidence, which was seriously shaken after the scandal with contaminated blood in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is generally known, the state blood reserve managed by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Service was contaminated during the 1980s with the immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus.
In view of this drama and the wave of public outbursts, the Canadian government launched a public investigation in February 1994, chaired by Judge Horace Krever, which aimed to explain the circumstances that led to such a tragedy, and to make recommendations to prevent such a disaster.
While Judge Krever asked to hand over the report, some provinces launched a committee aimed at planning a new blood management system in Canada.
In Québec, the Gélinea Committee took this role.
Following the Gélineau and Krever report, two suppliers were established in Canada: Héma-Québec, which was to be managed by Québec, and the Canadian Blood Company for the supply of all provinces and both territories.
“When Héma-Québec started its activities in 1998, only 38% of people still had confidence in the Quebec blood system,” recalls Dr. Décary.
"The situation was overwhelming.
With constant efforts to increase the safety of blood products and continuous work in this area over the next few years, we have regained public confidence," he says and proudly adds that at the beginning of 2008, almost 94% of the Quebec population had already trusted Héma-Québec.
Dr. Décary, however, does not lose sight of the fact that "trust is something very fragile."
Since its inception on 28 September 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
"At that time, we were in Europe witnessing the occurrence of many cases of human form of mad cow disease, new variants of a disease called Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease," says the woman, who has led the company since its founding in 1998.
"And we had no idea if this disease could spread blood.
We therefore relied on one of the basic recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau report, according to which, in the case when we do not know and when the spread of a serious disease is at stake, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob's disease, which is fatally excreted by the degeneration of the brain, is inevitable.
In April 1999, therefore, we rejected blood from people who had been staying in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980.
A few years ago, it was safely proven that this disease is transmitted by blood.
So this episode showed us that it made sense to stick to the precautionary principle."
In 1999, a much more accurate technique for detecting the HIV virus appeared on the market: tests using nucleic acid (NAT), which allow to detect the presence of the virus itself in the donor blood, and not the presence of antibodies on which the tests were used before.
NAT tests have made it possible to shorten the period between the moment of infection of the patient and the time when the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our technicians, explains the specialist.
We were able to shorten this period to less than a week.
We have substantially reduced the risk that some donors might be infected without knowing it and without us being able to figure it out.
These improvements made it possible to significantly reduce the risk of acquiring AIDS through blood transfusions.
Today, one person in every 12 million people is at risk of getting HIV-infected blood.
“In other words, it means that before someone becomes infected with HIV, 12 million blood products will have to be distributed.
Because Héma-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood products each year, it will take 24 years for the first case of transmission of HIV through a blood product to occur.
I believe that today we can get or prescribe the blood transfusions necessary for healing in complete tranquility,” says the head of the management of Héma-Québec.
“The challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
We never know what kind of disease-producing element can occur in the system.
Just last year, on the island of Réunion, there was a chikungunya virus, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted into the blood by stinging insects.
It is necessary to be constantly cautious," continues Dr. Décary, stressing that in addition to safe supply, Héma-Québec must also count on adequate supply.
“Requirements are growing because the population is getting older.
As a result of more aggressive cancer treatment, patients often need a new dose of red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also has consequences for a network of blood donors, which on average consists of only 3% of Quebecers eligible to donate."
Every healthy person is at least 18 years old, meeting the criteria of admissibility, but can donate blood only once every 56 days, that is, six times a year.
14% of people who offer blood are not accepted on average because, for example, they are carriers of AIDS or malaria, and if they have visited the country where bilge colds occur, they are excluded for one year.
“With these 3%, we are able to maintain a condition that meets the needs of hospitals.
Deficiencies are very rare.
However, members of the donor network need to be supplemented in proportion to how old they are and can no longer donate blood.
However, to convince people to donate blood is difficult, especially then to keep them and encourage them to become regular donors.
Life is so intact today that we rarely find an hour to donate blood,” Francine Décary wrote.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Héma-Québec supplies not only blood products, but also human tissue, such as bone transplants, heart valves, eyeballs and skin, which is almost exclusively used for large burns.
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before being stored at Héma-Québec, which also manages the only public bank of umbilical cord blood in Quebec.
The umbilical cord, formerly considered biomedical waste, is rich in blood from stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
"A few weeks ago we celebrated the deposit of our thousandth sample of blood from the umbilical cord into the bank and we expect to take them over a thousand a year.
By the beginning of next year, we should start offering them for transplants,” explains Dr. Décary, who describes the program of taking blood from the umbilical cord as very popular.
“Some mothers are disappointed that they don’t have access to it,” because Héma-Québec doesn’t have enough resources to offer this comprehensive and expensive program to all hospitals in Quebec.
Football - Impact in the semi-finals
Impact Montréal qualified for the semi-final round of the first USL Division 1 draw yesterday at Saputo Stadium during the second and decisive quarter-final match played on the total number of goals, thanks to a 3:1 victory (4:3 is the goal balance after both matches).
Antonio Ribeiro scored a decisive goal in the 90th minute of the game.
After the first half, David Testo and Rocco Plancentino scored the remaining two goals of the Montreal team.
Roger Levesque was the only one who was able to consult Matt Jordan in favor of the Sounders.
Remember that on Friday during the first of two quarter-final matches, Impact suffered a 2–1 defeat at the Starfire Complex in Tukwila, a suburb of Seattle.
The impact will measure its strength in the semi-finals with the Vancouver Whitecaps.
On Saturday night in Minnesota, Thunder settled a 3:1 deficit in the home game and eventually won 4:3, but the Whitecaps still moved into the semi-final round with a total of 5:4 goals.
The impact is expected to hit the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but details of the series of matches will be confirmed until today.
Short - Kovalev's winning goal
The first attacking three Canadiens are ready to start the season.
A unit consisting of Alex Kovaleva, Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Plek<0xC3><0xA1>n and Andrej Kosticina last night at the Centre Bell encouraged an attack to win the Canadiens 3:2 in separate drives.
Kosticin, the biggest star of the clash, scored a goal, Plekanec collected two assists, and Kovalev scored one goal in this fourth win of three out of six pre-matches.
Kovalev secured the victory by scoring a single goal during separate raids.
"I'm not ready yet," said the Russian.
"I need one more game to feel good."
"In the first third, he tried to do too much," said Guy Carbonneau.
"But I think he appreciated the end of the game.
He had a nice applause."
Charest bets on the north
The Prime Minister does not rule out early elections by the end of the year.
Immediately after the Liberal Party’s (Liberal Party) congress ended, Jean Charest moved to Jean-Talon in Quebec, where in today’s supplementary elections the new Minister of Health Yves Bolduc (left) is running for office.
“To push the boundaries of our last great northern border”: this is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented in a visually compelling way yesterday at the conclusion of the Liberal Party of Quebec’s congress in Lévis, but without giving details.
During his speech, pictures were projected behind his back in some kind of picture mill.
On three square canvases ran a loop with remarkable images of hydroelectric dams, down, Quebec from the point of view of "Google Maps", maps, etc.
A generous amount, as in the pre-election period.
At a press conference, the prime minister refused to rule out an early election in the fall, even though he said he had a very busy schedule.
"Plan North" is the fourth dimension of the "vision" that the prime minister plans for Quebec, the vision of a "new economic area" that includes an agreement with France on labor, the Canada-Europe agreement and the Ontario agreement.
Despite the fact that the opening of the North - the northern territory on the 49th parallel - the Prime Minister has often mentioned in his statements lately, it has never been the subject of a presentation.
The prime minister, however, limited himself to explaining why the North is a "little country with huge potential", but did not set a deadline, amount of investment, or clear priority in future projects.
At the very top, he mentioned several approaches to the points that could be further disseminated: in particular, water power plants, forests, but above all the mining sector, encouraged by the growth of rapidly developing countries and the restoration of public infrastructure.
The North, according to Charest's enumeration, contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamonds".
This "territory twice as big as France is with us", "is in Quebec.
And it's not just in us, it's in us," he said, as if he wanted to show that he was calling for a certain national founder myth.
Québec was built to a large extent in relation to the North, highlighted by the Prime Minister: the gold hunt in Abitibi, Quebec engineering, James's Bay.
"It's ours, it's our future," he added after theatrically paused to look at the huge map behind his back.
The North, 70% of Quebec’s territory, includes a part of Labrador that Quebec has always demanded, the prime minister said during a press conference.
“This is a traditional attitude that has been repeated by all previous governments.
“There is one border line that has long been out of the Convention, and if an appropriate opportunity arises, I will take that position again on behalf of the government,” he said.
Otherwise, “we also need to rethink our vision of the North in the context of climate change,” he said, speaking of the North-West transition, which will open year-round as a result of melting glaciers.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister believes that taking over territory becomes a duty.
And what about the inhabitants of the territory, the indigenous peoples and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Quebec government will be very attentive to them and that the project will be beneficial to them, especially young people.
Two former ministers from two different sides, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (a former Pequisian MP from Hungary), have already begun negotiations with some thirty communities.
The work was initiated by the Interministerial Committee chaired by Mr Beno<0xC3><0xAE>t Pelletier, in which Mr Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) has an important role.
The prime minister does not rule out a big meeting, "not necessarily a summit", but a moment when "a common vision will be drawn up".
The development of the North should, moreover, be in line with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan will be “co-designed, structured and environmentally friendly,” he promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as seamlessly following the vision of the liberal premiers who preceded it.
“Like the liberals who preceded us, we have changed our mindset to turn challenges into new opportunities for growth and development.”
This was, after all, one of the ever-challenged themes of the weekend, which was launched on Friday with a big cocktail highlighting the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage’s appearance at the front of the party.
One of the resolutions proposed to rebaptise Beauharnois's headquarters on the Adélard-Godbout dam.
"From Godbout, who founded Hydro-Québec, through Lesage, who carried out the Quiet Revolution and the nationalization of water power, to Bourass, who created James's Bay, our party was able to shape the future," said Jean Charest.
At the press conference he appealed to another authority, this time a conservative, to the program "Roads to the North" by John Diefenbaker, the premiere from 1957 to 1963.
When it came time for the Eastmain1a-Ruper dam hydropower plant, Charest stressed that its launch is planned for 2012.
"I'm just saying it between us, but I'm planning on doing it," he confided to his member base, causing a considerable applause.
The same prime minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008, and no doubt in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of holding elections in the fall of this year, which allows him the law.
However, he stressed that his program is loaded, especially the Federal Council missions in China and the Quebec-New York Summit.
The weekend’s congress provided the head of the Liberals with a platform for some nationalist resolutions, in particular certain “attempts to amend the constitution” that passed very smoothly: the PLQ (Liberal Party of Quebec) demands in particular recognition of the “specificity of Quebec” in the Constitution.
It also wants Québec to appoint a portion of the Canadian Radio and Television Broadcasting Council members who would have the right to veto decisions taken in Québec.
On the opposition side, the North Plan was sceptical in its main features.
PQ (Parti Québecois) chief Pauline Marois retracted the Northern Quebec Development Policy, launched by Landry's government in 2001.
According to her, when the Liberal government came to power in 2003, the implementation of this policy was relinquished.
If she were to stick to it, "we would be on today," Marois noted alongside her candidate in Jean-Talon (where elections are taking place today) Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Mercure.
The ADQ said it would support the adoption of the North Plan in the government.
"But we wish it wasn't just theatre," said Sébastien Proulx, the leader representing Maria Dumonta, who is returning from the holidays today.
Letters - The Destroyered Lands
It was Vic Toews, the former justice minister (or irony) in Harper’s cabinet, who let himself say last summer about Louise Arbour that he represents a “hangover” for Canada.
To stab a woman who has waged a relentless fight for justice and who deserves all our admiration, says a lot about the premiere environment and about Stephen Harper himself.
We have a government ahead of us, which, as the only one of all the Western countries involved, has not returned to the homeland of its nationals locked up in the Guant<0xC3><0xA1>namo concentration camp.
The government, which does not take into account that at the time when the acts that were being harassed were to take place, Omar Khadr was a puppy teenager.
The only government that, even though Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, denies its word and leaves the child soldier inhumane conditions.
The only one who relies on a parody of justice to judge the defendant's guilt.
Recall that UNICEF, Amnesty International and, in particular, the Association of Canadian Lawyers are advocating for the repatriation of Omar Khadra so that a fair trial can be expected in Canada.
The same government closes its eyes to torture: it does not care that this young man is psychologically destroyed next time, and this undoubtedly lasted, after so many years of torture.
We are not aware of this, but we are witnessing the erosion of our rights, our freedoms, and our "democracy", the words that Harper is so bent on and which sound so empty from his mouth.
The time has come when there is no more morality: it is possible to torture a Canadian citizen, to treat him badly, to imprison him according to the will of the head of the minority government so far (as will be after October 14th...).
Many voters believe they will find salvation in a party that proclaims Dignity, Law and Order: they do not see that this government has given up on what has made our country’s reputation and seriousness.
It is a shame, Mr. Toews, in this renunciation, and not elsewhere.
Opinions - Barrick Gold Orwell's speech
In a September 17 issue, Le Devoir printed a letter by Patrick J. Garver, executive vice president of the Canadian mining company Barrick Gold.
With Orwellian logic, he confirms that the world's largest producer of gold has launched a lawsuit against three authors and a poor small publishing house for an insult to honor in order to trigger a "transparent public debate" and demands six million of them.
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, they do not judge the truth, especially in the case of prosecution for insult to honor, but the law.
It's no surprise that Garver completely misses this crucial distinction.
Or is it the best way for Barrick Gold to lead a public debate, to bring down anyone who dares to defend the opposite position?
Whatever the case may be, the authors and publishers of Noir Canada (Black Canada) will be forced to spend decent sums to be prepared to defend themselves and fight in a very unbalanced fight with an army of lawyers backed by the almost impeccable pockets of the mining company.
The tactics in these unbalanced struggles, by the way, often consist in the destruction of the defendants in order to bring about a conciliation procedure that will shut the mouth of the opposite party and, moreover, terrifies anyone who dares to engage in this matter.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it had to present its view of the whole thing to the public.
Contrary to what is happening in several countries where Barrick Gold operates, in Canada, the debate is in the normal circumstances in exchange of thoughts, not in the early obscurity.
The mining companies, therefore, were not enough to open their books, their documentation, and to create a real debate through newspapers, media, publications, and funding of independent scientific teams that could bring light to the whole thing.
However, Barrick Gold does not seem to have confidence in public opinion and mocks petitions and letters in support of the authors of Noir Canada.
Perhaps Garver could explain how he can demand a “public debate” while at the same time dismissing the views of the same public?
It seems that this word in the Vice President’s world refers only to fat-paid lawyers, and not all Canadians; that’s a pretty narrow notion of the term.
In a democracy, they also have the right to speak out.
Barrick Gold doesn’t understand – or doesn’t want to understand – that the public that supports Noir Canada’s authors and publishers does so primarily because it rejects the brutal ways of mining companies.
The public is prepared to listen to Barrick and judge the matter, but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments, not within what many perceive as a lawsuit, in which they are to be shut up to the defendant's mouth (in the context of their lawsuit, to have a term for a "public debate" Barri's company).
Forgetting the surreal Garver speech, the pursuit initiated by Barrick Gold is a direct attack on the university’s freedom to seek and seek the truth that is essential for every democratic society.
In general, it denies the right to quote reliable sources and to debate facts and interpretations that are the very basis of intellectual activity.
If in a country like Canada, it is impossible to study and discuss topics that the rich companies of this world do not like without being subjected to repeated persecution, who else will be able to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could create it if it were guided by the scientific standards used by Noir Canada’s authors.
He has a right to an answer.
The university environment to which we belong has long been able to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold’s exaggerated lawsuit clearly shows that despite what he claims, he has no desire to conduct a transparent debate.
For the university world, this is a loss, as well as for the public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to put in place measures to curb this type of unauthorised prosecution.
Wall Street Rescue Operations – Democrats and Republicans Understand Each Other
The Bush administration and congressional leaders, both Republicans and Democrats, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the biggest economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
A new version of the plan to use $700 billion to curb the financial crisis that has been plagued by Wall Street for months has yet to be approved by both chambers of Congress.
In particular, it envisages: better control of elected representatives over its application, new mechanisms to ensure the repayment of deposited public money, new measures to capture the number of homes occupied due to non-payment of workers, and also the right to monitor the amount of salaries paid by employers.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi and Republican Representative at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight, after the two-day negotiation marathon ended.
“We have made great progress and we have reached an agreement that will be effective in the markets,” Bush administration spokesman Henry Paulson said in a statement.
“Everything has been done so that the real economy and ordinary Americans are safe from the current crisis on Wall Street,” he said.
"That's the key point: if we don't do it, the trauma, the chaos and the disruption of everyday life of Americans will be huge," Republican Judd Gregg said.
In the last few hours, the negotiations have been running at maximum turnovers out of fear of the effect, which would be another failure on the mood of investors.
The set time limit was the opening of the markets this morning.
Both candidates for the U.S. president were invited to the negotiations later, and both expressed rather in favour of the agreement, but did not neglect to express their dissatisfaction with the need to resort to such an extreme solution.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama has endorsed the addition of an agreement on some measures, in particular the one aimed at allowing owners to keep their homes, and the wage measures for leading labor-saved companies.
“When we ask taxpayers to take special measures because of the irresponsibility of some people, there’s nothing to congratulate.
However, these measures are necessary," he explained on the television waves.
His Republican rival John McCain, who was asked by another station if he would vote for the proposed plan, replied, "I would like to see details, but I hope so."
“The rough features I’ve read [shows] that it’s something that we’re all going to have to spend and with which it’s going to be possible to move forward.
Choosing inaction is simply unacceptable," he said.
The goal of the 700 billion plan is to buy dubious receivables and risk and non-sale assets of U.S. financial institutions for taxpayers’ money.
The plan comes after a 14-month crisis sparked by a bubble in the real estate market, which first led to the collapse of risky mortgage loans (subprimes), then transferred to another, more widespread form of credit (PCAA) and resulted in the freezing of cash and in the breakdown of financial institutions.
The failure of last week’s first draft of the agreement has been brought to the attention of Republican members.
Since the Democrats have agreed that some of the “toxic” assets of troubled companies will only be guaranteed by the government, but will not buy them back, there is a belief that the non-Eastern situation is ignited.
In an effort to approximate conflicting views in Congress, a measure was attached that stipulated that the government would be able to introduce new charges that would help it recover its deposit if it had to take over losses for five years as a result of the program.
The new plan counts on a first deposit of $250 billion, to which an additional $100 billion can be added if the president deems it necessary.
A further $350 billion is expected to be approved by Congress in a new vote.
In exchange for his help, Washington will gain shares in the saved companies, which in the event of profits will pay him dividends and which he will be able to resell when it is over.
The federal government will be able to delay the procedures for the seizure of property related to the loans covered by the plan, as well as to set limits on the amount of valuation and compensation paid to employees of affected companies.
The drafters of the plan would like to submit it to a vote in the House of Representatives today and in the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all the efforts, it is not yet clear whether their plan will be green.
Yesterday, the vote against this project continued to rise in both the Republican and the Democratic camps.
"It is clear that Washington will not hear you," Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House Finance Committee, said in a statement.
“Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But earning money from taxpayers is not a solution.”
Democratic Representative Brad Sherman, the moderator of a group of congressmen called the "sceptics committee", presents the whole thing differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred esteemed professors of economics, including three Nobel laureates, wrote to us: We ask Congress not to be in a hurry and carefully examine which way to go," he said.
At the same time, Europe reaffirmed that this crisis is a global crisis.
At the end of the extraordinary meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for 11.2 billion euros ($16.3 billion).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it was withdrawing from the purchase of its competitor, which is on the brink of collapse since it lost 2 billion euros ($2.9 billion) to the states as a result of the crisis.
Fortis employs 85,000 people, is among the 20 largest European banks and among the ten largest insurers.
"We are not going to lose this money," Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said yesterday.
“In return, we gain the right to vote in the bank and influence.
And that is precisely what the organizers and households can appreciate in today’s uncertain times.”
On the other side of the Channel, it seems, the British government has started to nationalize other banks affected by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government was to take over all existing Bradford and Bringley loans, of which more than 41 billion ($75.5 billion) were loans for the purchase of real estate.
According to its announcement yesterday, the Spanish bank Santander will purchase branches and client accounts of the British bank.
Bradford and Bringley will be the second bank after Northern Rock to be nationalized by the UK government since the financial crisis began.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of Socially Engaged Icons
His beauty with azure eyes has long represented his trump, according to other weaknesses.
Did this American actor get away with a charming narcissistic smile?
Yes and no.
The ingenuity, sensibility, and indomitable talent that were his own, also kept him away from the power category that produced real stars.
But what a long-distance runner he was!
Paul Newman died on Friday at the age of 83 on his Connecticut ranch from lung cancer and remains one of the last icons of fat years of American cinema.
Less magnificent than Brando, who was like him and had long been his kind of rival on the screen, Newman was a more cautious actor, certainly a fragile but also an apostle of freedom and the breakdown of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often breeds beautiful children.
Born in Ohio in 1925, his father was a German Jew and his mother was of Hungarian descent.
From these European roots, one of the famous faces of the American dream was born.
No excess ego, which is the last sign of quality.
Because he saw this whole country in love with self-made mana, a fighter in the Pacific War, wounded in the battle, who in the early 1950s studied acting in Yale, then visited the New York Actor's Studio and celebrated triumph in theater, television and short films.
The same man who fought for civil rights was also a car racer who placed second in the Le Mans 24-hour race in 1979, and at the same time as a sexual symbol, despite the fact that since 1958 he formed an exemplary couple with actress Joanne Woodward.
With him also go the dark places of this hidden, discreet, socially engaged stars, allergic to the custom of his own show business, which will remain to some extent mysterious forever.
A decent man, in the highest sense of the word.
Paul Newman’s departure this weekend has dizzyed film lovers while his big role competes together on the black canvas of memories.
After him, more than half a century of ever-changing American art has been defiling.
A charming cowboy from Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), a young man who rejects his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in Cat on a Burned Roof, a 1958 adaptation by Tennessee Williams, reappears.
From the less ancient past (1990) we equip his sensitive Mr. Bridge, anxious in the advanced age of marriage, which did not meet all expectations.
So many other Paul Newmans have gone down in history.
Boxer Rocky Graziano, a tortured, violent, memorable delinquent from Somebody Up There Likes Me by Robert Wise, a role intended for James Dean, taken over after his death, which in 1956 brought Newman into real acquaintance.
Sympathetic gangster in the absolutely great The Sting, Oscar for Best Picture in 1973.
A bitter and vengeful billiard player in the amazing The Hustler Robert Rossen (1961), the same character portrayed in Martin Scorsese's The Color of Money, bringing him the only Oscar out of seven nominations in 1987.
This face traveling through the ages, it was him.
And him again.
In his career, various epochs compete together.
Young people know him mainly thanks to the iconic Slap Shot George Roy Hill (1977) from the role of Reggie Dunlop, a non-traditional hockey coach.
Fans met him again in 1994 at the Hudsucker Proxy of the Coen Brothers.
He ended his career as a co-star of the Irish Mafia in 2003's Road to Perdition by Sam Mendes.
Unlike several film legends that left the craft relatively soon, Newman remained in the industry for a long time, although he condemned Hollywood with his brilliance, brilliance, and concessions.
French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier, not without humor, considered him "a lively challenge of underplaying", judging him from pushing too much on the saw in his performances.
For the beautiful Paul Newman, to whom the roles came as a medium, the profession was not always so tender.
However, he played first lovers less often than outsiders: neurotics, alcoholics, clumps, and desperation, whose declines and revolts were reflected in his perfect traits.
As a director, Newman revealed little-known pages of his shy sensibilities.
His 1968 film Rachel, Rachel (according to the novel by the Canadian Margaret Laurence), starring his wife Joanne Woodward, provides a sensitive female portrait full of melancholy.
He dedicated the 1984 film Harry and Son to his son Scott, whom he lost due to an overdose.
In a tribute to Newman yesterday, his great friend and former fighter Robert Redford (played together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) lamented: "His presence made my life and this country better."
Generousness, love of life, these are the main qualities of a deceased actor.
Forgetting his legendary career, a great fighter for civil rights, ecology, an independent film, an opponent of Hollywood’s collapse, is also leaving.
We were used to seeing his image on bottles of wine vinegar, sauces, cookies and other foods, which we might find rather tasteless, although at first it was a gag.
However, the profits from the sale went to the account of his Foundation for Difficult Childhood.
Newman did so, rather than let himself be embroiled in fame, to the last minute engaged in society.
To his five daughters, he left a letter containing the following sentences: “Always and to the end, your father was grateful to his happy planet.
It was an honor to be here.”
And for us it was an honor to follow the course of life of such a bright and generous American artist.
And, after all, an exemplary citizen.
What was produced in the factory for invoices Zuschlag & spol.?
Soon, on October 8, the prosecution will begin in the criminal proceedings against J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Zuschlagag and his associates.
In addition to other criminal offences, including forgery of documents, the politician and his associates are accused of fraud committed in the long term and systematically by a criminal organization, resulting in extraordinarily significant damage.
According to the prosecutor’s office, they used the money earned in public competitions for their own purposes and often documented the tasks with fictitious invoices.
The money from the state and local governments – totalling about 65 million forints – was partly spent in the Fiatal Balloldal treasury, partly in the pockets of individuals.
The method also reported by the investigating authority was that the money earned in public tenders was collected on the basis of invoices for which there was no real counter-value and never received the undertakings accepted by the association.
According to the charges, a large part of the invoices were fake.
The prints on these invoices came from the J<0xC3><0xB3>zsefv<0xC3><0xA1>ros market, the round stamp was made in Kiskunhalasi.
The names of the companies on which the production of invoices is to take place were decided, among other things, on a circular route along the north bank of Balaton, on which Istv<0xC3><0xA1>n Lados sent J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Zuschlag.
According to his statement, he had to look out the first named guesthouses and restaurants.
In them, he applied for invoices for his consumption, according to which the invoices were then produced in the framework of public competitions issued, among others, by the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs, and the Self-Government of the capital.
The invoices were mostly issued by Istv<0xC3><0xA1>n Lados with his companion Andr<0xC3><0xA1>s <0xC5><0x90>rim, who, according to our information, most often wrote the reports necessary to obtain subsidies.
On his "study trip" Lados saw a beer cellar.
According to two invoices issued by Zuschlag and his associates in 2003, this catering facility provided food for the ninety-member group of the Biztos Pont association.
However, according to the head of the company, so many people would not be able to enter this facility at once.
In the same way, the invoice issued in the summer of 2002 by a foundation called Better Future, later Together and Third <0xC3><0x89>vezred.
The guest house in Badacsonytomaji had only three rooms, more than ten people could not sleep in it one night, yet there were one hundred and thirty guests on the invoice.
Printers with a rich imagination, however, exceeded this even when they mentioned on the documents the company also dedicated to hospitality - Pigal s.r.o., in whose accounting according to the information provided to the State Department, the documents that do not appear on the name of J Hobbö.
The head of the company Gy<0xC5><0x91>z<0xC5><0x91> Farkas told hvg.hu that when he was summoned to the prosecutor’s office and showed him the invoices, he immediately knew that they were fake documents.
"The name of our company and our tax number were in the wrong place on the stamp."
He added that, apart from the formality, the fact that according to the bill, there were a hundred people, because they only have eleven rooms, which do not have such a large capacity.
In addition, the bill also included catering, with their restaurant not working for a long time.
The horny invoice manufacturers were not convinced that the prospective Budapest travel agency only organizes foreign trips, and on the invoice with payment in cash, which was also not compatible with the company’s invoicing practice, they stated nonsense as a service of mediation of the trip after Ma.
In addition, as it turned out during the investigation, VAT was also stated in the document, although the organisation of trips to countries outside the European Union was exempted from VAT.
On the four documents exhibited by the Jobb Jöv<0xC3><0xB8>v<0xC3><0xA6>r<0xC3><0xA6>r Foundation, Hotel Révfülöp s. r. o. did not agree, among other things, on the amount of VAT. The activity of the company does not apply to the mentioned 25 per cent, but 15 per cent VAT, in addition to the fact.
In addition, the "issuers" damaged the invoice, for example, by stating in one company how it turned out thanks to the investigation of the State Prosecutor's Office, as an activity carried out by the road transport of goods, which the company originally based on investment advice did not perform.
The fact that the invoices issued by the Együtt Foundation and the Third <0xC3><0x89>vezred Foundation and the 21st Century Cultural Association and Biztos Pont are false has also broken down due to formal deviations - the incorrect format of the invoice and the incorrect stamp.
As in the case of Ravenna k. s. or the Sports Camp in Kunfehert<0xC3><0xB3>, the representatives of which denied that they would issue invoices.
For example, the counterfeiters did not even notice that the company HIB s. r. o. from Ny<0xC3><0xAD>regyh<0xC3><0xA1>za was in liquidation at the time (2001), when it was eaten by a group from Fiatal V<0xC3><0xA1>rosért, which is why, according to our information, the liquidation commissioner of the company also denied that he would issue the paper.
Invoices were intentionally issued
The second group of invoicers are those who knew they were going to issue a fictitious invoice.
The Esély Budapest Foundation has issued accounts for approximately four million forints for the Third <0xC3><0x89>vezredér Foundation at the request of the organization Fiatal Baloldal - Ifj<0xC3><0xBA> Szocialist<0xC3><0xA1>k.
The head of the company Collab s.r.o. was charged with issuing a fictitious account by one of the accused Ludovic Györfi.
Biogate s.r.o. also cooperated with Zuschlag and its associates, currently in liquidation, which in 2003 supplied the Jobb Jöv<0xC3><0xB8>ért Foundation and the associations Atlasz and Vörösfeny<0xC5><0x91> with invoices worth about five million forints, for which there was no real economic activity.
Nor the movement of money, because the invoices created were later cancelled, which, of course, the organizations forgot to mention in their documents.
Another group of invoicing companies include those that had links to the defendants.
For example, Ivan Kubatov was an authorized representative of the Ukrainian company Delta Tri<0xC3><0xB3> s.r.o., dealing in the trade in fuels and motor vehicles, based in Budapest, where the company is not found.
In October, November and December 2005, the company issued several invoices for the sale of computational equipment worth approximately 18 million forints.
According to the data found by the investigation, these invoices were purchased by the Kiskunhalas company Cash Investment s.r.o., which was liquidated from 14 September 2005.
The manager of this company was a man from Romania, who was to transmit documents related to the company in 2002-2005 also Ivan Kubatov.
As we know, during the investigation, Kubatov admitted that on behalf of the company he issued invoices to the Allies Atlasz, Hoppa and the Együtt and Third <0xC3><0x89>vezredér Foundation and accepted their counter value.
At the request of Ivan Kubatova, Fa-Bani Jos Faipari s.r.o. and Jos-Investment k. s. were founded by Romanian muralists.
In fact, none of the companies were working, according to the defendant, because they lacked a job.
Nevertheless, the companies were in favour of him, because at the request of the co-accused lawyer Zsolt Szente, who also prepared their founding documents, issued invoices on behalf of the companies to the associations Atlasz and Y-Generaci<0xC3><0xB3> connected to Zuschlaga.
On behalf of the companies Investment, Delta Tri<0xC3><0xB3>, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, Kubatov gave 15 invoices worth 14.2 million forints.
The State Prosecutor’s Office decided that Kubatov had received 10 percent of the amounts stated on the invoices and VAT.
To issue fictitious invoices, this time for the selection procedure for Biztos Pont, the man also used the company Szi-Beri k.t.
In January 2006, Y-Generation and the Federation of Modern Hungary submitted proposals for the public competition of the Mih<0xC3><0xA1>lye T<0xC3><0xA1>ncsics Foundation (TMA), a public benefit organization of the Socialist Party.
They received 500,000 forints, but the amounts were not spent on the objectives set out in the proposals.
To avoid this, TMA submitted five fictitious invoices from Works Team s. r. o.
These invoices were found during a home inspection in <0xC3><0x81>rp<0xC3><0xA1>d Kemecsei’s office at the Ministry of Education.
During the makeup, some of the defendants will probably describe the process of production of invoices, as they have already done at the prosecutor's office.
It may be more interesting if the main defendant J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Zuschlag decides to reveal everything himself.
His renunciation so far is not too detailed, and although he has already promised to lay it all out extensively, he has not yet done so.
The question is whether it is in his interest - in exchange for paying a large part of the damage, fifty million forints, perhaps the Socialists have made a deal with him and Zusi will take it on himself.
In the meantime, he could have been offended, because his requests for a mitigation of the conditions of his detention, that is to say, for a placement in a domestic prison, remained unheard of.
While the perpetrators of economic crimes who have inflicted far greater damages than they have yet to pay, they can freely walk around or at least wait for the end of the proceedings they have taken in their homes, he does not have this option.
The psychology of trumping: why do we spend more money?
At auctions, customers are willing to spend more money, overvalue the goods.
The neurological and economic foundations of this well-known - and seemingly irrational - behavior have been able to reveal to researchers in the field of neurology and economics at the University of New York.
According to their study, published in the journal Science, people do not want to be late in an eBay auction competition, so they would rather pay too high a price.
Research using an experimental auction attempted to map out the scheme of this "game" in the nervous system.
One group of volunteers bet, the other group participated in a play auction, and the active areas of the brain of subjects were studied using the functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) method.
In both games, the participants could win money, but while playing at the auction, the important element of which is to overcome the other side, the whole under the cerebral cortex called the striatum began to work intensely when losing.
This area of the brain plays, among many other functions, a role in the "self-replacement" mechanism of the nervous system.
Screwing up the price is therefore, according to the researchers, possible to explain the effort to avoid the sharp reaction of the striate.
To support their theory, members of the research team from the ranks of economists conducted a cross-sectional financial survey.
Under different conditions, three groups were bidding against one partner.
The control group was simply informed of the real value of the product in question, and they made bets.
Members of the other group were also promised that if they came out of the game victorious, they would receive another $15 in reward.
The third group, on the other hand, received $15 before the auction, but in the event of a loss, its members also lost that money.
The difference between the two groups, therefore, was that everything was in the fact that one was emphasized the win and the other the loss.
However, members of the group playing "against the loss" were willing to go higher than in the control and "winning" group, which confirms the hypothesis of neurologists.
“These results cannot be derived from any previously existing economic theory.
They have so far explained the phenomena that can be observed in the auctions of the joys of winning and avoiding the risk.
Until neurological imaging methods helped us to resolve the contradiction between these two theories, we have now reached a third explanation," said Andrew Schotter, a professor at the University of New York's Faculty of Economics.
Hepatitis: when to see a doctor?
About half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C infection, and in Hungary, this chronic liver disease is one of the leading causes of death.
The number of home cases of hepatitis infection is estimated to be one hundred thousand, but only seven thousand of them are being treated. The reason for this is that patients often do not know that they are infected.
The name hepatitis is a summary of the names of infectious liver damage caused by various viruses.
There are many similarities in their symptoms, inflammation of the liver and jaundice are characteristic, but the causes of the disease and the disease caused by them differ from each other.
Hepatitis viruses are spread in two main ways depending on the origins of the disease: hepatitis type A and E digestive systems (for example, infected with food, water), hepatitis type B, C, D and other viruses of blood and body fluids (sperm, semen, semen).
Travellers should in any case be protected by vaccination against viruses A and B, there is no type C vaccine.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after ingestion of an infected food, usually accompanied by nausea, weakness, abdominal problems, compulsion to vomit.
Then, yellowing, light stools and dark urine are formed on the skin and eyelids. The treatment can take up to two to three weeks.
Every year, one million people worldwide die from the most serious form of this disease, liver cancer and liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B.
The main reason is that, according to estimates, only one in ten infected people is treated with medication.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: if left untreated, it can lead to liver cirrhosis or liver cancer.
Most infected do not even know that the cause of the disease destroys liver cells invasively, so in many cases the first symptoms will arrive in 20-30 years.
Therefore, it is very important to prevent timely, to carry out regular de-pistolation.
In three groups, this disease occurs much more often than on average: among people who had a blood transfusion before 1991, among drug users, and among people with tattoos.
Currently, the estimated worldwide number of individuals infected with the chronic hepatitis C virus is 200 million.
Since the disease can already prove a routine laboratory examination, a person should contact his/her medical practitioner if he/she notices any signs of unknown origin.
With early detection, the disease is treatable, the virus can be removed from the body, thus preventing infection and preventing the formation of cancer.
September 30 is the World Hepatitis Day, which was organized by the organizations representing the sick for the first time worldwide in 2004.
Its aim is to draw attention to the chronic inflammation of the liver caused by these viruses, the causes of its formation and the importance of early detection of the disease.
Who believes in God doesn’t hurt so much?
According to the results of recent research, faith in God acts as a certain analgesic that could ease the death of already Catholic martyrs.
Scientists at the University of Oxford conducted an interesting experiment, investigating how faith in the God of pain affects a person, the British newspaper Telegraph reported.
As part of a rather bizarre survey, 12 Catholic believers and the same number of atheists were subjected to electric shocks, while all observed the painting depicting the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to rule out much of the pain.
Thanks to a technique that explores the human brain in detail, it has also been shown that Catholics have been able to activate the part of their brain that is responsible for regulating pain.
The research is the first of a series of studies, in which scientists, philosophers and theologians from different parts of the university take part, as well as academics.
The exact test was carried out by attaching a sparkling instrument to the left hand of the test subject, which emitted electric shocks.
The researchers asked the participants to observe two paintings: Sassoferrata’s 17th-century Virgin Mary and Leonardo da Vinci’s Lady with the fringe, painted in the 15th century.
The authors of the research hoped that the view of the Virgin Mary would give believers a certain state of piety, while Da Vinci's image was chosen because it was not too different from the first and seems to them a soothing impression.
The subjects spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, and during this time they received 20 electroshocks in four successive sections, while separately observing the image with a religious or general theme.
The Catholics stated that when they looked at the Virgin Mary, they felt “safe” as if they were “settled” and “soothed, filled with peace.”
When they watched the image with a religious theme, they felt 12 percent less pain than when they had Leonard's work in front of them.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who also took part in the research, believes that a similar effect can be achieved with the help of any powerful image even among atheists, all it takes to find the right photograph.
“We would have to find an image that they will perceive very positively, from a mother’s or father’s standpoint,” the psychologist said.
Anglican Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the study.
“The practice of faith should change, and in many cases it will also change our personality,” Wright added.
After such great results, it is only a question of what effect would it have on regulating the pain of believers if they were shown a madonna by Leonardo or a painter of similar caliber.
Would looking at the quality of the Virgin Mary mean achieving even better results?
You're what you're gonna share
On its tenth birthday, Google can state that people can find it in their pockets at least as well as in the sky above their head; they know where they were on vacation, what a professional examination is going on and what interests them.
According to Eric Schmidt, one of the CEOs of the company, this is still not enough.
Of course, as for the skeptics, who make parallel with Orwell's dark vision, the very essence of Web 2.0 is not clear to them.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google’s main goal is to collect even more personal data about users, which is necessary to keep Google’s founders from their original intention, which was: “Let’s organize all the information in the world!”
According to a Google spokesperson, the company, even after ten years of global work, is only at the beginning of the process, so that it can work with all the information.
When asked what would happen in five years, Schmidt replied that he would like Google to be able to answer questions such as “what should I do tomorrow?” or “what kind of work would it really be for me?” – they wouldn’t be able to inform the user about these seemingly simple questions, but they wouldn’t be able to answer software.
Not all Internet users are well aware that the exact search words are captured during the Internet search, as well as the IP address from which they were searched and which pages the searchers moved to.
For example, with the Personalized Search service launched two years ago, users can save their browsing history, look back at what they were looking for and what they clicked on, and then in the long-term, they will be able to generate findings that will be tailored to their products, and will be more directly tailored to their services.
What if my data is being used against me, what if someone looks at me, what do I do? - ask users who are afraid when looking at Google's data monopoly.
In most cases, the scope of the potential power represented by the company is more threatening, the counter-reaction does not incite guilt awareness, fear of punishment, a desire for freedom, or even a rebellion against power in Internet users.
However, it is confirmed that all the terms searched are not only captured, but in justified cases they can also be issued to a third party, in such legal cases the personal rights of Internet users do not protect anything.
The most well-known recent example was a coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, during which Google provided the Brazilian government with information that enabled the identification of pedophiles from the Orkut community sites established through it.
Internet users who are concerned about personal rights, however, could still breathe in May, when the company, hand in hand with the EFF, successfully proved its truth in a dispute with the FBI: Google must not be able to inform that in the future, but by an article of the constitution, to force it to do so.
(At the same time, the federal government successfully eliminated almost fifty thousand web addresses and thousands of search terms, which it obtained with a reference to the strengthening of the law on the protection of children adopted years ago, however, it failed to get the lists of the users, the users of the websites, the users of the websites.
The view on Google is so contradictory: it is beaten by those who fear the provision of their personal data, because they feel that their intimate sphere and private life will be by starting to use the services of Google, exposed to harm, and stand up against it with the imagery of the company that belongs to it.
And meanwhile, the American geek culture and its wild ribbon, gathering around them enthusiastic computer fans, activists and users, appearing in many countries, sees in it a new generation of great-grandfathers, "a corporation that's swarming now," unlike its rival, Microsoft.
This may be due to the fact that Google, unlike Microsoft, does not require an identification code from its users and does not require them to make money for its applications; an open, free and constantly fresh source of information and a package of programs acts as a much more accessible, youthful, "cooler" package.
However, this may also be due to the fact that geeks understand exactly the very problematic relationship between the Internet and personality rights, which has brought with it one of the most blatant keywords of recent years: web 2.0.
Web 2.0 is nothing more than a collaboration, that we deliberately leave behind traces and use the communication channels we have at our disposal, and although their scope is different for everyone else, the essence remains the same: we show ourselves.
The average young person can keep an automatic profile immediately on several community sites from Facebook to Xang, which can easily connect to other services, such as Twitter or the last.fm app, can record the most pictures of the person he listens to, can record the most pictures of the music he listens to.
Here we can read about a lot of exemplary cases, from which she emerges: a friend in the morning looking at the flood of photos of common friends will easily find out who her charming friend spent the evening with one of her life together, or the company can snatch her employee up in the aftermath: d throw them out on their blog.
The one who lives online life is made up of what he shows himself, so we could define the basic theses behind the behavior of today’s youth.
And anyone who wants to hide something or at least avoid a Google monopoly has the option (starting with, for example, Scrooge, which uses Google’s search engine, but does not intentionally leave a trace).
For example, a large number of people do not voluntarily register on community sites, so that they cannot be found. The online Google application from the text editor to the photo editor and the news portal can be exchanged for alternative versions that are not connected to giant server parks and which of us can not make the most profile.
Public opinion doesn’t secretly expect Google to show its hopes.
With a current value of $156 billion more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca Cola ($110 billion), AdWords/AdSense advertising platforms are threatening advertising agencies’ investments, and Microsoft’s designs aren’t constantly accelerating.

A double killer from <0xC3><0x93>zd helped to remove the traces of two young people
Two young people were interrogated by the police in the case of a double murder in <0xC3><0x93>zd, on reasonable suspicion, helped to remove traces of the crime, a spokesman for the Upper Police Directorate of Borsod County said on Tuesday.
Persons have experienced the activity from which they were suspected and are currently charged with assisting a criminal offence.
The two young men, according to MTI, are being held in prison.
Assisting a criminal offence is punishable by deprivation of liberty for up to 5 years.
A suspect in a double murder in <0xC3><0x93>zd, a 23-year-old man there, was taken into temporary custody on Sunday.
He's a suspect in a pre-planned multiple murder for special reasons.
During the investigation, it was revealed that a 23-year-old young man owed a larger amount to a 53-year-old man.
The suspect did not want to repay his debt, so he dragged his creditor to a factory in <0xC3><0x93>zd last Wednesday, where he first killed the man and then his 9-year-old daughter.
According to MTI, the young man was preparatory for the crime, which is also evidence that he committed the murder with a weapon hidden at the scene of the crime.
The weapon and the circumstances of its use are investigated by the police with the involvement of experts.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange has made an offer to buy the Prague Stock Exchange.
Two hundred million euros – about five billion Czech crowns – were offered by the Warsaw Stock Exchange for the purchase of a 100-percent package of shares of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, chairman of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Polish party despite the fact that the Czechs had already excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the circle of possible new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason is that the owner of the Warsaw Stock Exchange is the state.
99 percent of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which wants to sell 60 percent of the securities in a few months.
According to the Czech Economic Journal E15, the offer of Poles represents the highest amount that has been offered to those interested in the Prague Stock Exchange so far.
According to Czech newspapers, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Transatlantic Stock Exchange Nasdaq, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Börse have so far submitted an offer.
The head of the Prague Stock Exchange, Petr Koblic, said last week that the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst new owner of any interest, and did not rule out that it could lead to the demise of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
The value of the Prague Stock Exchange is estimated by stock market experts at 5-10 billion.
According to the shareholders agreement, approximately 90 percent of the shares could be resold.
The largest owner of the Prague stock exchange is investment bank Patria Finance with a share of approximately 25 percent, followed by <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xA1> spa<0xC5><0x99>itelna with 14.7 and Tiger Holding Four S.a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
On the financial crisis from the point of view of European papers
In their comments on Tuesday on the intensifying international financial crisis, the leading European charts are already reminiscent of "the second of September 11".
For the global financial disaster, we can thank the US President, La Repubblica indicted in Rome. The president has not even been able to squander his own side in support of that fast-paying bill aimed at correcting this desperate situation...
Instead of the new Pearl Harbor, which reminded billionaire and investor Warren Buffett, we could talk about September 2nd.
Also part of the Madrid press sees the culprit in Washington.
According to the newspaper El Mundo, it has brought the world economy to the brink of collapsing there’s a lack of political leadership.
The danger of the collapse of the American financial system is constantly growing, for which the whole world will ultimately pay.
Bush’s plan was not perfect, but after a vote in Congress, there is a danger that Washington will not offer a political tool to solve the crisis.
The world economy is hanging in the air – right at a time when one of the biggest changes in the history of capitalism is taking place.
The threat can no longer be ignored, according to the Geneva daily Tages-Anzeiger.
Individual states can still throw a life-saving circuit to cash-back institutions, and taxpayers can save them from bankruptcy.
Of course, if other banks collapse as dominoes, then neither cash nor other improvisation will be enough.
In the long term, it is necessary for the Member States of the European Union to move beyond their national egoism and unify control over fragmented financial markets.
On Monday alone, the defunct monetary institutions received more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 billion, the Vienna-based Der Standard recalls, according to which fears that, like Americans, they will have to reach deep into the pockets of European taxpayers in order to solve the crisis are becoming more real.
The European Union is facing a tsunami-like crisis on the old continent that has not yet been seriously addressed.
The “rescue workers” may not have to pay hundreds of billions of euros right away, but it would be a good idea to make a firm determination in which case it would be reasonable to tap into taxpayers’ money to prevent even more damage.
Intelligent car mimics the year of a beetle
What would be the best way to develop technologies capable of preventing collisions if not for the imitation of obstacles detectors in the natural world?
For example, bees.
The basic strategic idea of the surprising project, presented at the CEATEC in Japan, was injected by engineers from Nissan. It was about how to build a new generation of systems to prevent collisions.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built a biomimetic BR23C-type robotic control system, a robotic mini-car equipped with bee characteristics, with the ultimate goal of helping to create a system that can eliminate all crashes.
“During the flight, each bee creates its own personal oval-shaped space, which is actually very similar to our safety protective packaging,” Kazuhiro Doi, the brand’s chief technology officer for PR and R&D, explained at the exhibition.
Composite eyes play an important role, allowing bees to see in all directions at an angle of view of more than 300 degrees.
To copy the function of the composite eye, the engineers came up with the idea of a laser telescope.
It identifies obstacles up to 2 meters ahead of BR23C in the 180-degree field of view, calculates their distance and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which is immediately converted into a collision prevention operation.
The obstacle is caught during a fraction of a second, then the robotic car begins to mimic the bee movements and by rotating the wheels to the extent necessary to prevent the collision immediately changes direction.
Unlike any existing system, this outgoing maneuver takes place in a completely instinctive way.
“If this were not the case, a robotic car would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles,” explains Toshijuki Ando, head of the Mobility Laboratory and the robotic car project.
It must react instinctively and immediately, as this technology meets the most vulnerable and innermost layer of the safety protective packaging, inside which the collision is currently considered inevitable.
The whole process must reflect what the bee does to avoid other bees.
This process should not take longer than a blink of an eye.
However, unlike bees, this movement cannot be directed upwards, downwards or angularly, it can only be two-dimensional and only in the direction in which the wheels can be rotated.
Instead of the endless possibilities offered to bees when avoided, only the possibility of rotational motion, acceleration and slowdown was applied in the case of a robotic car.
BR23C uses lithium-polymer batteries that are lighter and have a higher energy density, meaning they have a longer life than lithium-ion variants.
According to Ando, instinctive, intelligent response is important, not the ability to process, let alone the storage of data.
This mechanism has to process and respond to only a few incoming signals per second.
There is no need to store them and react using intuitive logic based on data from previous manoeuvres, so only a few kilobytes of memory is constantly used.
It does not need memory with gigabyte or megabyte capacity.
This is the first step in the development of an immediate avoidance technology, which Nissan estimates could get into mass-produced cars within a decade.
Another option of application may be to connect the unit to the GPS satellite navigation system, which, after avoiding obstacles in the way, would lead the driver to the specified final destination.
The damned dear child already has a name
The $700 billion economy bailout bill, which is to be divided into several installments and is aimed at the purchase of low-quality bank loans, is already in writing.
Half of the amount will be used in the first round.
After further negotiations, which ended until Saturday after midnight U.S. Eastern Time, Congressional officials reached an agreement in a several-day debate on a bailout totaling $700 billion, Reuters reported.
"We have made significant progress," Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic Speaker of the House of Representatives, said in a statement.
The compromise on the package was also supported by both presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain.
Finance Minister Henry Paulson said: “The program will work and be effective, but further steps need to be taken.”
The written version of the package was published before the opening of the Asian markets on Sunday at 8 p.m. Washington time (i.e. on Monday at 2 a.m. Central European time), but it did not cause any special rise on the stock exchanges.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will vote on the draft legal norm, which will take the name of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, which is to be established.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi on Saturday night, after the news of the deal was also welcomed in the White House.
"We are pleased and very appreciative of the efforts of both sides to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy," White House spokesman Tony Fratto said in a statement.
The program differs from the Bush administration’s original proposal that a total of $700 billion would be spent on the purchase of low-quality mortgage-backed securities.
Now it is possible to spend a maximum of half the amount of 700 billion in the first round, so that 250 billion will be spent immediately after the matter is expected to be decided by Congress on Monday, and the Ministry of Finance will buy for them billions of presidents’ securities secured by mortgages, which are not valued as 100.
The program will be controlled by a special body whose member will also be the chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank.
Spending the second half of $700 billion will depend on the next decision of Congress.
The Ministry of Finance can apply a combined tactic within the meaning of the law: it can simultaneously purchase low-quality loans, mortgages and securities secured by mortgages, or other "supply" loans.
The purchase can take place within the auctions and directly, the competent representatives of the Ministry said.
The legal standard will allow the companies concerned to participate in an insurance program, in which the Ministry of Finance will provide them with a guarantee of funds that are cause for concern, for which the companies will then pay a price corresponding to the amount of the expected damage.
As Henry Paulson said, the law provides the necessary means for up to $700 billion to be spent on meeting the urgent requirements of the U.S. financial system, whether it is a large-scale purchase of bad funds, insurance for them, or averting systemic risk for them.
"We will take the necessary steps to be ready to introduce the law as soon as it is signed," he added.
On the contrary, bankers who get into trouble and are waiting for state aid can count on the government to cut their margins – which is simply called the “golden parachute” in the overseas sling.
They will only be limited in certain cases, and these restrictions will depend on the manner in which the Ministry provides assistance.
The restriction essentially means that if the ministry is to buy within the auction, a tax surcharge will be imposed on the gold chips unless the fallen bank directors are sent directly into retirement.
In the event of a direct purchase of non-quality loans, the government will aggressively take steps to ensure that the money for management is not exaggerated.
It should be added that the existing agreements on gold rushes are not changing, the restrictions apply only to new contracts, which is to be another incentive to participate in the programme.
"This is the first time in U.S. history that there will be a legal restriction on the remuneration of directors-general," Barney Frank, chairman of the House of Representatives' Financial Services Committee, said in a statement.
In addition, the State in the banks participating in the programme will have the right to take a share, thereby reducing the risk of taxpayers, because once the economy and the saved bank are on their feet, they can also make a profit on this transaction.
The plan for the proposal provides that the president will have to submit a proposal to Congress in the next five years to determine how the expected losses from the financial sector can be repaid to taxpayers.
There were, of course, voices on both sides expressing doubts about the plan.
“That’s not what American citizens asked us to do, because that’s not what the taxpayers’ dollars will protect,” said Republican Congressman Darrell Issa.
His Democratic colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur, says it was precisely those responsible for the collapse of Wall Street who insisted on the adoption of the provisions.
Industrial prices continue to rise.
Domestic sales prices in the industry increased by 0.1 per cent in August 2008 compared to the previous month, then by 12.9 per cent in August 2007, the Central Statistical Office reported.
Export sales prices in the industry were 1.1 per cent higher than in July 2008, down 3.9 per cent year-on-year.
Industrial production prices were 0.7 per cent higher as a result of changes in domestic and export prices compared to the previous month, rising by 3.2 per cent year-on-year.
Domestic sales prices in the industry have risen only minimally, by 0.1 percent, compared to the previous month.
Domestic sales prices in the processing industries also increased slightly, by 0.1 per cent, compared to July.
The biggest price increase occurred in August 2008 in the leather and footwear industry (2.8 per cent), mainly due to the inter-monthly increase in prices in the bag and saddle products industry by 4.6 per cent and in footwear production by 2.5 per cent respectively.
The higher price levels of plastics and chemical raw materials caused a significant monthly increase in prices in the chemicals and products industry (1.6%).
The prices decreased in the oil processing industry (1.4 per cent), the production of electrical machinery and appliances (0.9 per cent), as well as - to a minimum - in the woodworking industry (0.1 per cent).
The prices in the paper industry and in the publishing and printing industries have not changed.
In other sectors of the processing industry, we measured a price increase in the range of 0.2 - 0.9 percent.
In the production and distribution of electricity, gas and water, which is of great importance to the domestic industry, prices rose by 0.3 per cent in August, mainly due to the continued impact of the officially established increase in gas prices, which is taking place from 1 July.
In the twelve-month comparison of domestic sales in the individual sectors of the processing industry, prices rose the most in the professional sector of oil processing (32.4%).
In the metal-processing industry, there was a 13.2% increase in the production of food, beverages and tobacco products, which was of decisive importance, followed by an 11% increase in prices.
Prices fell in the textile and textile products (2.5 per cent) and electrical machinery and appliances (0.3 per cent) sectors.
In other sectors of the manufacturing industry, the price growth rate ranged between 0.6 and 9.1 per cent.
In total, prices in the processing industry increased by 10.2 per cent over the past year.
Prices in the electricity, gas and water production and distribution sectors outperformed the prices of the previous year by 18.7 percent.
In August, the highest monthly price increase (0.7 per cent) in the sectors concerned with the production of tangible assets was seen in domestic sales by sector focus.
In the consumer goods industries, prices rose by 0.3 per cent, in the energy processing and further processing industries, prices did not change compared to the previous month.
The largest price increase compared to the same month of the previous year was observed in August 2008 in the energy processing and further processing sectors (16.8 per cent).
In the consumer goods industries, we measured a price increase of 6.8 per cent, while for tangible assets, prices fell by 1.4 per cent.
Export sales prices of industrial products measured in forints increased by 1.1 per cent in August compared to the previous month, down by 3.9 per cent in twelve months.
Our domestic payday in one month weakened by 1.7 per cent against the euro, then by 7.1 per cent against the dollar, compared to August 2007, increased by 7.5 per cent against the euro and 15.9 per cent against the dollar.
Are you going to the U.S. next year without a visa?
According to Kinga Göncz, there is high hope that around January 12 the U.S.-Hungarian visa-free agreement will come into force, the foreign minister said in Chicago before the top representatives of the local Hungarian community.
According to her, “almost everything now depends only on whether an electronic system of road permits and controls will be built on time at sea.”
At the same time, she noted that there will be no entry permits as part of the new system, but tourists will have to register before departure.
The representative of the Hungarian diplomacy from today is continuing the negotiations in Washington.
He will meet with Foreign Minister Condoleezza Rice, who will hand over the Middle Cross with a star of the Order of Merit for the Republic of Hungary and will hold talks with foreign policy advisers to Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain agree to bail out banks
Barack Obama and John McCain, the presidential candidates of both major U.S. parties, unanimously pledged their support for a $700 billion government bailout package on Sunday, but there are also politicians who demand the resignation of the finance minister.
After several days of marathon talks between Congress and administration officials, it was announced early Sunday morning: a basic agreement on a bailout package for banks was concluded.
The financial package, which aims to melt the Wall Street crisis and the frozen credit market, has become a central issue of the presidential campaign.
Both Obama and McCain are consistently calling themselves the most suitable of the two candidates to pull the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent surveys, along with how the economic issues got ahead, Obama gained some advantage again and McCain’s lead, which secured Sarah Palin’s nomination for vice president after the Republican convention.
Obama on Sunday expressed hope at the Detroit Pre-Election Assembly that the $700 billion package bill would be quickly passed by Congress.
He underlined that the proposal contains passages on consumer protection, which he also supports.
“We must act immediately, responsibly (...) to your places, to the economy, to the whole industry, to the stability of the whole economy is in danger,” he said in front of a crowd of 35,000.
He didn’t miss the opportunity to call McCain’s visions of the economy outdated.
In an interview with ABC, McCain said: “It’s going to be a bit of a cause for everything ... but doing nothing is simply not a possible way.”
As stated by the Republican senator, the proposal includes the establishment of a supervisory commission of the Minister of Finance and the limitation of the derogation for the top representatives, which he insisted on.
Obama told CBS that McCain did not play a more important role in the negotiations, on the contrary, he himself was in daily contact with the minister.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Sunday that the House of Representatives will vote on the bill as early as Monday.
Press overview of the German-speaking region
The right-wing camp is intact, only the voters inside have become more confident - so analyzes the weak result of the CSU in Bavaria Der Spiegel.
The Haiderovs are ready to rule Austria to prevent the red-black coalition.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
In an online edition of the left-wing German news magazine, Franz Walter discusses the causes of the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article entitled "The Bavarian Revolution Eats Its Father".
According to the well-known political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad duo Beckstein-Huber took over his office.
Christian socialists have rebuilt Bavaria for decades – and it is these modern citizens who are now being turned away from it.
The change in the period is a problem for the entire Christian democracy, and so is Angela Merkel.
Debakl was not entirely surprising to the CSU, but on Saturday he ended a process that could have been predicted for almost exactly ten years: the undisputed hegemony of one state party ended.
Already ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU landed at 47.7 percent, the first time since the 1950s under the 50 percent limit.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 Bundestag elections, that is, still in the so-called Stoiber period.
The reason is the modernization that CSU has consistently carried out in this country and is eating its parents.
Sociologists have been predicting this for 40 years, but they were very wrong at the same time. The secularization, the results of education, the settlement of Germans from the east and the north in the developing regions of Bavaria could not have been without consequences for the loyalty of the CSU voters.
Modernization is associated with the growth of possibilities, which also has visible political consequences.
The right-wing camp is intact, only the voters inside it have become more self-confident, more critical, more self-centered.
It is also clear that in recent weeks, the CSU has been the most distant from the classical civic strata; people in the free profession, businessmen, individuals with a degree and with a higher education.
CSU support has already fallen below 40 percent.
The press (diepresse.com)
The conservative Vienna newspaper, in its article entitled "Who, with whom? Presidential parties are reluctant on coalition issues", deals with the confusing domestic political situation created as a result of the Austrian elections.
The SP<0xC3><0x96> wants to deal with the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
The <0xC3><0x96>VP shall direct the SP<0xC3><0x96>’s involvement in its internal affairs.
The BZ<0xC3><0x96> seems open to all negotiations, the Greens do not want to join the coalition yet.
The elections are behind us, now everything revolves around the coalition; in the debate held on public television, the presidents of the parties did not allow themselves to look at their cards.
SP<0xC3><0x96> President Werner Faymann confirmed that he wants to negotiate with the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
And the SP<0xC3><0x96> wants to show that cooperation between the two sides is certainly possible - in some federal countries and in social partnerships.
The question of whether he could even imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current chairman of the <0xC3><0x96>VP, as a vice-chancellor, left Faymann open.
As he said, the Schüssel-Molterer course was over-voted for each fall.
The repetition of this direction is not taken into account.
Molterer responded carefully to the red offers.
As he said, the cooperation will certainly not be successful if Faymann tries to interfere in the internal affairs of the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
Whether his party chooses the opposition, or joins the coalition, it is still completely open in the party, these issues must be definitely discussed within the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
BZ<0xC3><0x96> President Jörg Haider once again appeared open in all directions.
"In order to prevent the red-black coalition, we are ready to take on the government's responsibility," Haider said.
J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>kov<0xC3><0xA1>: The enchanted circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
In Paris today, the European Equality Summit, which will be hosted this year by France, the current president of the European Union.
L<0xC3><0xAD>via J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>kov<0xC3><0xA1>, a member of the European People's Party for Fidesz, as one of the main spokespersons for professional counseling in her message addressed to the plenary drew attention to segregation in education, as it is one of the most serious of the injustices affecting Roma children.
The summit was launched by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister of Labour and Social Affairs, and Vladim<0xC3><0xAD>r <0xC5><0xA0>pidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities, on behalf of the French Presidency.
The meeting was attended by invited representatives of governments, European social partners, the most important European organisations for the protection of rights and civil society associations working in the field of equal opportunities.
According to the press office of the group of MEPs, Fidesz J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>kov<0xC3><0xA1> pointed out that in addition to the discrimination that occurs in the recruitment of labour, Roma are expelled from the European labour market mainly due to their low education.
"The vast majority of young Roma do not have a secondary education and, as a result of the poor quality of primary education, only a small part of them can attain higher education."
J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>kov<0xC3><0xA1> also stressed that education as a fundamental human right has a key role to play in the implementation of other human rights.
Investing in the early education of Roma children can mean strengthening the economies of the EU Member States.
According to the MEP, it is necessary to establish awareness of these links in the broadest circles - among Roma and non-Roma children.
The sooner a Roma student starts school, the more likely he will be to become a productive member of the labour market; through income taxes and consumer taxes they contribute to the national budget.
"It is the right of Roma to ensure the right to quality education and to guarantee the elimination of their poor quality and segregated education," said L<0xC3><0xAD>via J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>kov<0xC3><0xA1>.
In her view, cohesion of the European Union with a focus on the objective and action is necessary in order to speed up the processes of decentralisation of schools immediately, and this is the first priority of proper compliance with the existing and planned anti-discrimination regulations.
"We need to break the enchanted circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment, we need to give Roma children the opportunity given by the democratic space, so that they as full citizens can participate in the future of Europe," J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>kov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
The European Year of Equal Opportunities guarantees everyone the objective of the European Equality Summit, held every year since last year's meeting in Berlin, to provide a separate forum to help achieve the objectives of equality and to eliminate discrimination between Member States at the European level.
CSU: Temporary Grace
The fate of the duo Huber-Beckstein will be decided at the end of October
Despite the embarrassing election debacle, the debate on personal issues has so far been postponed by the top Bavarian CSU.
Party President Erwin Huber and Prime Minister Günther Beckstein can still remain in their seats, the question is how long this grace will last.
The fate of the tandem, which suffered a disastrous 17 percent loss of votes, will be decided by the party’s special congress last October weekend.
In any case, the members of the highly criticised duo have been told that they will not be able to cling to their posts.
They tried to reassure the angry members of the faction and the bases, who, due to the loss of the absolute majority, demanded a day after the "Babylon tsunami" to carry out personal consequences.
Five years ago, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber at the top of his career, the Christian-Social Union gained 60.7 percent, now, a year after the coup against Stoiber, but its strength was only 43.4 percent.
In Bavaria, CSU has been producing 18 percent of Germany’s GDP “self-governing” for 46 years.
Although conservatives in the southern federal country, which is of key importance to the Hungarian economy, continue to hold a high position, they will in any case be forced into a coalition in the future.
One of the first signs of the reorganization within the party is the fact that a member of a narrow intelligence team, which will initiate the probe negotiations on a possible coalition of the Munich government with the liberal FDP, or with the right-wing constituency of the Slobodn<0xC3><0xAD> kiev<0xC3><0xBD>st (Semb<0xC3><0xBD>r<0xC3><0xBD>d<0xC3><0xBD>st<0xC3><0xBD> sv<0xC3><0xBD>d<0xC3><0xBD>st), will also be the vice-chair.
It is an irony that Gabriele Pauli, who used the Huber-Beckstein duo to stage a coup against Stoiber, was elected to the House of Commons as a candidate for Free Voters, but then made a mercilessly short process with an ambitious municipal politician.
The CSU leaders are now concentrating all their energy on how to stabilize Beckstein.
In the transitional period, Stoiber will also play an active role, who has so far swept the threads from the background, the former prime minister of the country and the former president of the CSU called September 28 the saddest day of his political career.
On Monday, Huber made several moving remarks to the CDU, saying they would have deserved much more support from the sister side.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a warning to the CDU and Angela Merkel.
After the September 2009 Bundestag elections, Merkel will not be able to become Chancellor unless the CSU, which played a significant role in the nationwide success in 2005, somehow stands on her feet by joint forces.
According to Merkel, who was hard to hide her disappointment because of the fiasco, the loss of the CSU position will not have a negative impact on the Berlin Great Coalition.
Which is of course relative: treating the injured CSU will not be easier and the crisis of the Social Democrats continues.
The SPD achieved its weakest result in Bavaria with 18.6 percent since 1946.
Lukashenko:opposition - 110:0
Not a single opposition MP was elected to the Belarusian parliament in Sunday’s election.
According to Russian observers, this can be explained by the well-being and stability of the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, but according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) the illegalities that occurred in the counting of votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the election.
Although the 110-member legislature of the 10 million-member country has been missing the opposition for a good ten years, the opposition united on behalf of the United Democratic Forces (ODS) before yesterday's elections seriously hoped that Lukashenko's parliamentary constituency, which he left in opposition to the parliamentary constituency on the basis of a constitutional amendment in the elections, "was to be rejected by the parliamentary constituency.
The ODS has also abandoned the previously considered boycott.
Against the backdrop of the opposition's political anticipation, the anti-Russian anti-Russian party was not an economically more dependent Belarus - which took credit to mitigate the ever-expensive Russian gas imports - and also contributed to the European Union's takeover of Beltransgaz, a gas company that owns the gas pipeline.
Earlier, the release was pointed out that when assessing the election campaign, the OSCE emphasized positive moves, not shortcomings - for example, banning the candidacy for a third of opposition candidates.
The OSCE flash report on Monday, however, already had reservations about the campaign, during which opposition candidates could not actually appear in the press, especially the fact that the opposition cannot be present at the vote count.
At the same time, according to the opposition, only improvement can be felt in the political system: political prisoners have been released to freedom and Minsk is willing to let go with Moscow even in minor confrontations, when it continues to refuse to recognize the state of Georgia's ousted South Ossetia and Abkhazia.
"We have taken two steps forward and one back, but most importantly, the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun," Milinkevich told the newspaper.
According to the opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential election, it is desirable that it should remain so, despite the fact that "a single member of the opposition has long been allowed into the insignificant parliament."
When looking at the results of the opposition, it is not planning a protest, but rather trying to deliver its message to voters about the need for economic reforms.
"With this, of course, we have a lot of problems, we have to print opposition letters in Russia, the distribution is made by the local authorities, but I still see that the change is supported by more and more people, even among the elders," said Milinkevi<0xC4><0x87>, with the exception of Pod<0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD>v<0xC3><0xA1>c.
"Because of the country's debt and the growth of the trade deficit, it is only a matter of time when the social security 'driven by the silence of the cemetery' will collapse," Milinkevich said.
In contrast to opposition politics, Russian election observers viewed the election as democratic.
Sergei Lebedev, the head of the Commonwealth of Independent States mission, told Russian news agency Ria Novosti that “people don’t believe in words, but in actions,” so the absence of opposition is nothing more than proof of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on, breakfast before work"
It is the first time in the history of the Chigi Palace that a rotating door was introduced on the arrival and departure of employees.
However, from today, this new measure will begin to work against lubricated people, against those who piss and then go to coffee during working hours.
The news against the Lenos was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renat Brunetta, and the Secretary General of the Presidential Council, Maurem Masi.
“Rotary doors,” says Brunetta, “are a tool for better work, higher performance, more presence and more services.”
“A new era of accountability and transparency is now opening.
This is reformism,” Brunetta said.
The Chigi Palace will complete the implementation in all the Council Presidency buildings.
For Masiho, "the choice of rotating doors is also important from a symbolic point of view".
There were no objections on the part of the employees, the Secretary-General assures: "It was a joint procedure with the workers and cooperation of all."
In short, no more breakfast during working hours; no more coffee and croissants.
Brunetta smiles and says, “There’s nothing better than a proper cappuccino at seven in the morning.”
During one conference at the Higher Professional School of Public Administration
In Rome, the minister will finally announce that within three months the absence of public employees for the disease has decreased by 50%, that is, by 60,000 more people a year at work.
And he adds that it is necessary for the Italian public administration to become more efficient
“Its payout dynamics have doubled in the last 8-10 years compared to the private sector and is far higher than the inflation rate.”
In the meantime, thousands of public servants have gathered to reject the rules of Brunett’s decree in accordance with a request supported by the Codacons.
“While the Minister of Public Administration will present today the figures related to lower absences from work due to illness,” writes the Consumer Protection Association, “the nation of ‘serious scoundrels’ is constantly growing.
In Italy, we have thousands of productive and correct public administration employees who have gathered to declare war on the illegitimate norms contained in the decree.
Taru will protest in particular against the exclusion of sickness allowances, which depend on activities; the extension of the period during which it is possible to check the sick person, the timeframe within which check visits will be carried out, and against other norms included in the new ministerial regulations.
Occupational injuries, Napolitano: "Resolute prevention"
Every day, 2,500 work injuries occur in Italy, three people die and twenty-seven remain permanently disabled.
Inail values confirm that in 2007 we have about 1,200 deaths as a result of work injuries.
These values testify to the severity of the order, which remains one of the main causes of death and causes nearly twice as many deaths as murders.
In order to raise the attention of institutions, social and information media regarding this dramatic problem, Anmil is today celebrating the 58th National Day of Victims of Workers’ Strikes in all Italian regions, which is set for the second Sunday in October.
“The worrying data extended by Anmil and the same tragic reports these days confirm how important the issue of occupational safety is,” President of the Republic Giorgio Napolitano confirmed in a report sent to President Anmil, the National Association for Frozen and Invalids, for the sake of Pietroande.
The Head of State expresses his heartfelt admiration for the continued joint efforts to ensure safety in the workplace, to protect the injured workers, to assist the families of the victims and to participate in public opinion.
"Naturally there has been an outraged 'enough', honestly shared face to face with tragedies, which in their extent provoke a stir in the media and the participation of public opinion, but everyday reality again offers us dramatic cases, even in its aftermath."
Napolitano does not hide that "there is no doubt a problem of resources: it is crucial to invest in training and awareness.
Of particular importance are the numerous initiatives put forward in the field of education, so that young people, who are facing the world of work, gain a clearer awareness.
It is necessary to draw attention to this phenomenon, not to give up because of its disturbing social seriousness, to apply and improve legislative standards.
The president of the chamber Gianfranco Fini, for his part, emphasized, "how the phenomenon of death as a result of a work injury creates an absolutely critical social condition, how it offends the conscience of each of us and forces all institutions to make a convincing effort towards the necessary end of it."
"As far as work injuries data are concerned, they appear to be positive, but this does not deny that the number of deaths as a result of work injuries is as alarming as it is," said President Anmil Pietro Mercandelli.
“We don’t want this ‘attempt to reduce’ to lead to less attention, because right at the moment the attention rises, tragedy will erupt.
“We believe that in general, too little is being done to stop the injury problem and there are many activities that can affect this problem.
In our opinion, it is necessary to increase controls and inspections, but also to intervene more strongly in the field of training of workers, right from school age."
"There is still a need for further efforts - he added - in terms of communication and co-participation of public opinion.
But above all, there is a need for a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers towards the phenomenon, which is an exceptional social phenomenon.
Finally, Mercandelli said it was a progressive degeneration of the level of the right to compensation intended for work victims and a “displacement of supportive care” that the system has been receiving in recent years.
“The goal is therefore to return the insurance guarantee to the employee – he added – because the fate of those who hurt themselves must not depend on spontaneity or gifting from time to time by the legislator.”
Mp3 Players Accused, Exposed Hearing Risk
Listening to loud music for a long time and using portable musical instruments as an Mp3 player can cause permanent hearing loss.
According to a notice published today by the European Commission, which cited the opinion of the Science Committee on Health Risks recently raised and identified (Csrseri) Eu in an extended Official Report in Brussels.
"From this scientific point of view - we read in the notes - it turns out that 5-10% of those who listen to music for at least five years using portable musical instruments, a week more than an hour a day and keep the instrument at high volumes."
“I’m concerned that so many young people who often use portable musical instruments and mobile phones at high acoustic levels may unknowingly damage their hearing in an irreparable way,” says Kuneva.
“From scientific findings, the leader continues, there is a clear risk and there is a need to react quickly.
The most important thing is that we need to encourage consumers and make this information public.
We need to re-examine existing control systems in the light of this scientific finding to make them fully effective and keep up with the new technology.”
Brussels asked the Independent Scientific Committee to investigate this problem due to the high use of portable musical instruments and the growing number of young people exposed to the noise of this origin.
"Scientists confirm that there is a need to worry, and now the European Commission will examine together with the other members and parties that have raised the problem, what measures could possibly be introduced by the institutions to protect children and young people from being put in place and thus to protect their children and young people better."
At present, there is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable musical instruments to 100 dB, but concerns about hearing damage, which may be caused by excessive exposure to similar forms of noise, are growing.
It is very possible to reduce these damages by looking for solutions such as reducing the level and duration of exposure.
In its opinion, the European Scientific Committee states that users of portable musical instruments, if they use loud music (more than 89 decibels) for just five hours a week, will exceed the currently applicable limits corresponding to the maximum volume permissible work.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for a long time risk lasting hearing loss after five years.
This problem should affect 5-10% of users of such devices and their number can be numbered between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Alemanno leaves free passage to the Commission for the future of the capital
Today we will start, we will close in March, we will have sums in June.
This is the calendar given by Campidoglie to the workers of the "Commission for the Future of the Capital of Rome", which met this morning at its new headquarters behind the Caracall spas.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and 49 other members of the Commission will draw up guides for Rome.
When the doors are closed in March, Giunta and the city council will evaluate the analyses and projects so that in June they can present a strategic plan for Rome with the "official stamp" of Campidoglia and its mayor Gianni Alemann.
"The Commission is completely independent and includes all political, social and cultural ideas," Alemanno wants to stress, "It will have to secure proposals for the development of Rome, which will eventually be used by political decision-makers who remain Giunta e General Council.
It's not about any exchange of functions, but just about trying to have some place to work on a big project for Rome.
The work will be completed in March and then disbanded, because these institutions must have an exact deadline.
In June, the mayor announced, we will present a strategic plan and take advantage of the work carried out by the Commission for the future of the capital of Rome.
To the one who accuses the Commission of ineffectiveness, Alemanno replies: "It all depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do and the quality of their proposals.
If they are of good quality, like the Attali Commission's proposals, and I am sure of that in Rome too, their contribution will be decisive.
Too often, politics resonates with everyday problems and with emergencies that occur from time to time.
We, on the contrary, want to look further and further, in a deeper perspective, to work seriously on the development of Rome and its future.
In addition, the mayor of Rome wants to stress that "this Commission is neither a useless undertaking nor a bluff: it is completely free, Roman citizens will not cost even the euro and will serve to devise and engage the best intelligence the capital has".
For Alemanna, in essence, "it is necessary to have a strategic outline as a starting point, neither definitive nor immobile, in order to allow our city an authentic ascent to the level it necessarily needs, and to think in a united spirit of its future."
The future, which, the mayor of Rome specifies "will not be limited to the current municipal boundaries, but will look much further" not only in terms of the future metropolitan city and its legal status the capital city, but "will also include the role of the cities of Europe as the sultan of Rome.
Obama? The first anti-American president. It is already known why
A well-known U.S. president wrote that it is important for him to remain independent: “Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.”
The first was Jimmy Carter, who by his decisions decimated the U.S. economy and maintained relations (as well as today as a private citizen) with the enemy of Islam.
Attacks on Obama are on the rise just as the election date approaches.
A woman from Miami wrote on the website: “This man is full of ambition.
But Obama has the guts: he thinks he's going to get to the highest post of a nation that had two governors and five black senators everywhere!"
In fact, these attacks don’t say much; they are clearly racial attacks and they don’t answer the question of voters: will he be a good president? And then we have polls; everyone says Obama will win and with a big leap forward.
Even in this case, there are those who act according to the heart and not according to the brain.
A newspaper from Mississippi, from the southern outskirts of the United States, wrote a comment: “At least once in the election booth, we know well who gets the vote of the American patriot.
One side of the American mentality will come to the surface, which remained hidden until the last moment.
Say what you want, and we'll eventually take care of it ourselves, who to turn on, whether Obama or McCain."
There are people who swear that if Obama were to win, we would leave America.
These are things that have never been said before, it seems almost certain the success of the black candidate.
But despite all these considerations for the Democrats, George Bush is the main weapon.
They asked 1,500 people: What mistakes did Bush make during his term of office? Eighty-nine percent answered: Iraq.
America is changing.
In Vietnam, this nation lost fifty thousand soldiers and sent it home with digging in the ass.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers died and the Americans were not forced to pack.
And yet, Iraq has become, for the most part, Bush's weakness.
Whoever takes the place of Georgie W will have to perform a huge task.
The economic collapse of the United States has also been felt by journalists: there is a period of investigation in the newspapers. And many accuse the Internet, the "killer" of the press.
The PEW Research Center interviewed five hundred journalists about the state of their profession and the presumption of the future.
Now almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
However, the questions did not openly state that they were less concerned about their credibility.
You don't feel isolated like you used to.
The problem for American journalists is money, the money.
For these journalists, the crisis of 2008 is a crisis of the destroyed economic model.
In addition, the cuts made in the newsroom, in the room where the editors work to put the newspaper together, are a huge problem.
According to the interviewed journalists, this is a problem that needs to be solved if we do not want traditional journalism to be fundamentally changed as the general public understands it.
There is a clear but complex pessimism among American journalists.
Six out of ten press reporters and executive seniors are convinced that journalism is going the wrong way on a national scale.
In the local area, the executive group is at 65%.
Printed against the broadcast.
It is not difficult for journalists to see where the web is going.
Larger publishers are paving the way for the Internet, which many view as a "killer" of print media.
“Economic pressure,” which journalists warn, has increased by as much as 79%.
Five hundred interviewed journalists admitted that they are turning to technology in the hope that they will “do something good for their journalism.”
The biggest gap in American journalism is between those who run the newsrooms — that is, the leaders — and the reporters who work for them.
56% of leaders at the national level are confident that their reporters share their values, while at the local level the value drops to 23%.
This has something to do with "work security."
Leaders who think they will lose their jobs within three years are at the national level 47%.
As far as journalists are concerned, they are up to 30%.
When it comes to "safe work" regarding staff (our editors, etc.) in America is still on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work on a contract.
In such a huge nation as the U.S., with three hundred million people and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radios, TV and the Internet, employers often offer what they want, so it’s a matter of taking it or leaving it.
Leaders almost always get huge salaries, and an editor can earn as much as ten thousand dollars a month outside of paying pensions and insurance.
With regard to holidays, the argument is complicated: a certain number of days after the first year, a certain number of days after the third year, up to fifteen days after a certain number of years.
However, U.S. journalists, according to their own admission, often get sick within a year.
It is only a matter of climate.
UNIPOL: COURT IN ROM, DANILO COPPOLA IN GROTTAFERRATI
The President of the Second Criminal Senate of the Roman Court, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to refuse the submission of a businessman with realities Daniel Coppola, who asked to move from his city, Grottaferrata, to an apartment in Rome.
Coppola is being investigated for bankruptcy in connection with the sale of Unipol-Bnl.
During the trial at his own expense, he was released from home prison last week, which was converted into a forced permanent residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni e Gaetano Pecorella, requested that the real estate businessman be able to change the place of residence from a rural town to a capital.
However, according to the court, this move (against which PM has spoken out) would allow him to influence his company and get to the evidence that accuses him.
Elites in Danger
This phenomenon occurred a few days ago when the House of Representatives voted against the $700 billion bailout plan submitted to the White House: a significant proportion of Americans were more interested in punishing Wall Street than in saving the economy.
This is confirmed by yesterday’s New York Times, which informs us that the current crisis is dispersing the Republican party, which is constantly more divided between its old East Coast soul, more modest, receptive to the world’s federal institutions and to the world’s non-states’ and business community’, and its new soul, which, on the contrary, preserves.
A soul that arrogantly manifested itself in the vote I spoke of at the beginning.
But this thing just quoted is just an example of the changes, the big changes that the current economic earthquake already shows: not only in the United States, but throughout the West, and perhaps not only here.
As in the U.S., so in Europe, this crisis seems to act as an accelerator of phenomena that have been in incubation for a long time, which are shrinking in the new climate and finally coming to light.
The first of these phenomena is the reactivation, the extraordinary revival of the market, the double category of State-power in relation to a certain renationalization of the economy.
The crisis is indeed a crisis of banking financial institutions, which, of course, have strong ties abroad, but which mainly involve the budgets of people and families living in a single country, in a single state.
This has created a political problem for those who run it: it means how to respond to the difficulties and protests of people and families who are, among other things, voters.
In short, the crisis appears economically global, but politically almost exclusively national.
Political internationalism seems to be significantly out of the question or has nothing to add: the obvious evidence has been given by the European Union, which is as always divided between different interests and different national strategies and which cannot decide on a single common political line.
And so everyone waits for the intervention of the government of each individual state, the rescue plans, the revival of the market, the new rules and, above all, the distribution of funds: the moment we get to the emergency, only the states have the economic resources, the amount of financial resources to be able to afford themselves.
It also possesses the necessary resources and authorizations to use them: two sources of immense value, under certain circumstances which, perhaps, no market and no international organization will ever be able to have to the same extent.
This new emphasis, which the crisis places on the state-national element, is, by the way, in full compliance with the growing importance which is trying to attribute the latest economic advances to one factor closely linked to it: territorial citizenship.
Paradoxically, while we were convinced that we had entered the realm of sitta, increasingly sophisticated technology, immaterial, while we were convinced that global finances were as predestined as ever to dominate the world by the powers of the world, we would have realized from nothing that the world was so predestined to dominate them.
All things, who would have said it, can be moved from one place on earth to another, but in any case they are connected, absolutely, to a confined space, a territory.
So whoever becomes their ruler certainly has a lot more cards in his hand than he does, and who is lucky enough to live in a place without grain, without oil, and without water.
I get to the second novelty, which predicts a breakthrough.
Those who speak of territory, state, government, inevitably speak of politics, that is, of leadership.
In the light of the economic crisis, there seem to be two convergent phenomena.
On the one hand, he realizes that there is an objective need for authoritative leadership, a request for someone to be able to grasp the situation.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit towards existing leadership, especially economic ones, which turned out to be equally unsatisfactory and full of dark spots.
And together, something even deeper and in a sense disturbing: discredit, impatience, a sense of incapacity and absence that seeks to control the entire ruling class in more and more Western countries.
In fact, it seems that it is spreading more and more in the broad masses of the population of beliefs than that their actions are the same as the ideas of the hitherto popular elites, as their way of feeling and being, as their culture in the true sense of the word, that the elite has already surpassed its time and is indifferent to the others.
The demand for the leadership of the P<0xC3><0xA1>p<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>st<0xC3><0xAD> Ib<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0xBE> simply feeds from the underground one branch, but the strong movement for the removal of the ruling classes and the traditional political arrangement is manifested in the sudden electoral "resistances" of the P<0xC3><0xA1>p<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0xBE>, or in the unexpected changes of the collective moods.
We have the impression that the traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their ceremonies, their newspapers, their accredited intelligence, someone would say their format, have ever greater problems understanding, so representing, which, not from the present day, is being developed in the depths of the cradle, the collapse of Western societies, and the collapse of the economy.
Before that, it would be excessive to talk about a permanent “mass uprising”.
But we certainly can’t say that it means having properly opened eyes.
Super glue for walking on the walls
Overcome the laws of gravity thanks to super glue and in the future walk on the walls like Spiderman.
This is the object of various American research centers and now a team of four institutes has come very close to it.
Scientists were able to keep a stock kilogram body glued to a vertical wall using a sticker of only 2.5 square centimeters.
STUDIUM – The American journal Science has published the findings of some researchers at the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material, invented by the team of researchers, is the development of materials already existing, which use a special structure of carbon, called carbon dwarf tubes.
“The foundation of the adhesive can be imagined as a series of tubes laid out as an organized pile of spaghetti,” explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists were inspired by the legs of the gecko, covered with microscopic hairs, which allow the animal to ensure perfect adhesion.
Tests carried out on various materials such as glass, Teflon and glass paper have shown that the new adhesive is ten times stronger than the feet of these plasters and at the same time "just sticks away from the wall," explains Liming Dai, a researcher at Dayton University's Faculty of Engineering.
"This material could be useful as a temporary adhesive," adds Liming Dai.
Perhaps to walk around the walls like Spiderman? Perhaps yes, but researchers are thinking about far less fascinating use as an electrical appliance connection, because the dwarf carbon tubes are conductors of heat and electricity.
Other applications could be related to aerospace engineering .
No superheroes yet.
The University of Berkley, California, is also engaged in the research of new adhesives.
In an article in the American Chemical Society, California scientists introduced a glue formed from microfibers like hair that cleans itself from dust by moving around the surface to still maintain perfect adhesion.
Drugs: Never with juices
Watch out for grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
If you take these drinks, which are consumed especially in the summer because they are refreshing and full of vitamins, along with some life-saving medications, their consumption changes the enhancement or decrease of effectiveness with serious health consequences.
In order to highlight the risks of juices both ready and fresh in combination with the use of certain medications, David Bailey, professor of the Western Ontario University of Applied Chemistry, at the current 263rd National Scientist Meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, is raising a new alarm.
Grapefruit juice has already been accused of being responsible for increasing the effects of some antiarrhythmic drugs, antibiotics, anxiolytics, antihistamines and neurological drugs to toxic levels.
MEDICINES IN RISK – The Italian medical agency itself announced this in an information bulletin two years ago and rallied doctors and patients to not underestimate the dangers of this mixture and to pay attention to what they drink if they take drugs such as Metapa.
NEVER GRAPEFRUIT – According to experts, orange and apple juice also contain substances that oxidize drugs.
A long list of effects succinct with grapefruit and other juices.
Michele Carruby, director of the Department of Pharmacology at the State University of Milan, said: “Such discoveries are usually immediately reported to a wide variety of international and national pharmaceutical agencies, which may arrange and exchange informational drug instructions.
So always read the illustrative tickets of the drugs you get and if you come across something unclear, don’t worry, but ask your doctor or pharmacist for clarification,” the expert for the agency Ansa emphasized.
Nobel Prize in Economics Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize was awarded to Paul Krugman for his study of commercial models and the localization of economic activities.
Krugman is a 55-year-old novelist who teaches at the University of Priceton and is a well-known editor of the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the most important critics of the Bush administration's foreign, economic, and political moves.
Several months after the September 2001 attacks, on the days when Enron crashed, Krugman predicted in one commentary published in the New York Times that the second event would be, in terms of consequences on U.S. history, much more important than the first.
The prediction, which caused little controversy, and which had been counted to him for years, proved to be accurate.
"I am surprised and shocked at how quickly collapses like Enron and Worldcom have disappeared from the public interest," Krugman said in a statement.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is "an economist of great importance", but also a popularizer who has "a very aggressive style, especially critical of the excesses of Bush's liberal administration".
Open Office, we have here the third edition of the "anti-Microsoft" package
It is the day of the release of Open Office.org 3.0, an open source personal production package aimed at penetrating more and more users, from home to office, from experts to public administration, as a free alternative to Microsoft Office.
After about a year of volunteer work, controlled by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office shows a wide audience with various innovations: to the welcome screen and to the revised and improved ISO opening window are added another, much more important one after the standard.
Emphasis is also placed on collaboration with the Office 2007 package, Open Office is able to open a document even with a new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting are the special features of some models such as what allows you to reduce the size of a PowerPoint presentation, useful for example for electronic transmission, or the ability to transfer a PDF folder to a graphic model and maintain the original appearance of the page.
From this point of view, we can still create "PDF hybrid" documents that resemble typical Adobe-format graphics and have the properties of a table processor or text program.
Collaboration is an element that has received many improvements within the application programs: in excel it is possible to work together between different users and avoid conflicts on changes, in the text program is assigned to each co-worker one color for comments to make it clearer.
Some companies are also working on transferring some of the Open Office features to the Web (on the cloud), and in the coming weeks they are expected to change the final result.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://en.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html, has been added to the English version, which is on the mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, as usual, the package is also available for the Linux operating system.
Also, the installation CD can be sent home or to the workplace on request.
And if the theme of free can be a draw to the expansion in households, it is on the business area of the Open Office package that a lot of bets, and can already count on a variety of projects implemented in public administration and in schools.
And there is no shortage of training, consulting and assistance services ideal for small and medium-sized businesses, which could open up business prospects.
Open Office consists of five main models: Writer, for video writing replacing Word; Calc is a spreadsheet processor that aims to replace Excel; Impress for PowerPoint-like presentations; Dbase, as in the case of more famous Access, is a program that allows you to work on databases; it is a Draw, Graph, finally.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that today we are almost 3 million and 600,000, with the release of the new version, it is possible that this figure can even be exceeded.
Kohl's results are also positive, it's the fourth case of doping
A new positive case at the last Tour de France: it is Rakushan Bernhard Kohl, from the Gerolsteiner team, the third ranked and winner of the shirt of the best top scorer.
The report was quoted by the L'Equipe newspaper.
At the age of 26, Kohl is the fourth positive rider at Cera, the third generation Epo, after Italy's Riccardo Ricc<0xC3><0xB2> and Leonard Piepoli and the German Stefan Schumacher, and he from Gerolsteiner.
The results of Kohl’s blood samples are among those carried out in recent weeks by the laboratories of Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the control analysis confirms the positiveness of Ceru, Raku<0xC5><0xA1>an will lose third place on the Tour and will face the two years of disqualification.
The report on Kohl’s positives for the third-generation Epo is confirmed by Pierre Bordry, head of the French anti-doping agency, who reported to the Associated Press that he had already reported the results to the Austrian government.
26-year-old Raku<0xC5><0xA1>an placed on the ranks of the winners behind Spain's Carlos Sastre and American Cadel Evans, he also got a punctuated shirt of the best top scorer.
IMMIGRANTS: NEW YORK TIMES ASKED, IS ITALY RASISTED?
Italy "as a country of emigrants has only in the last house turned into a priority target of immigrants" accepted with resistance.
Is it turning a beautiful country into a nation of racists? So, in a long article in the New York Times, that devoted this article to the debate on racism in Italy, and began with the case of young Abdul William Guibre from Burkina Faso, who was killed last month in the uk of Milan.
The case highlights what the New York Times defines as “the paradox of the north”: the northern regions are at the same time those where “more integration and more work” is recorded, but also “the strongest anti-immigrant thinking in the country and the strongest support of the Northern League.”
To confirm rising tensions between Italy and immigrants, NYT cited cases of intolerance from Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampina and Castel Volturna.
Not just that.
The new legislation required by the Lega, which seeks to curb immigration and facilitate the expulsion of illegal immigrants, is also cited as an example of Italy’s changing climate.
The tendency emphasized by both the pope and the president of the republic: "Giorgio Napolitano, after meeting with Benedict XVI in Quirinale, asked the state and the church to work together to defeat racism."
Students are victims of expensive rentals - up to 900 euros per room
The rent market for university students is not experiencing a crisis.
According to recent research by Sunia, the tenant unions, renting a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, in Florence 700, in Naples 650, in Rome 600.
"Jev has already reached such a size that entire layers of students have lost their right to study because of the overall too high prices that their families would have to bear," explains the head of the Sunia Study Office, Laura Mariani, who, in the process, was also asking a lot of questions from students in this city.
In most cases, the rental offer contains several violations: contracts in a free manner, unregistered, without a limited lease, and related leases.
A special intervention is needed for Sunji, which could regulate prices thanks to a tax revision.
If we look at the details of the research, we will see that in Milan, in the Brianza area, it is necessary for a single bed about 450 euros, for a single room is payable from the minimum price of 650 (zone Bande Nere) through the average value of 800 (zone Lambiate, Udine and Fiera).
In Florence, one bed costs an average of 350/400 euros, one room about 700.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in zones close to the university, you need 250/280 euros for a bed in a double room, from 370 to 500 in a single room.
In Rome in the central university zones (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna) they want about 600 euros for a single room, 450 beds in a double bed.
Values are slightly lower (550 euros for a single bed) in zones close to other universities (Ostiense and Cinecitt<0xC3><0xA0>).
We save only if we move to the peripheral areas: 300 euros per bed and 450 euros per single room in the Prenestina, Centocelle and the like.
In Naples you need 300/450 euros for a bed, for a room from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei zones.
In Bari they want for a bed 250/350 euros, at least 350 for a single room.
In smaller cities, prices are definitely lower, but have a greater impact on the economy of citizens.
In cities such as Perugia, where it is the most common phenomenon for students from countries outside the European Union, one more anomaly is finally recorded: an increase of about 25-30% of the fee they want for foreign students, compared to Italians.
Farewell to the old Paradiso cinema, the city cancels historic halls
The cinematographic historical halls are closed in favor of Multiplex.
"A city without cinema is like a blind man, like a face without eyes."
The image offered by director Giuseppe Tornator successfully documents what is happening in the great Italian city centres, as well as in rural towns.
The process of limiting cinemas, the birth of large multisales in the suburbs, and the subsequent disappearance of monosales in central urban areas, is one of the events that seem to be inevitable and irreversible, but also has all the signs of a true cultural crime.
"It's as if we lost a friend, a friend with whom we shared a piece of travel and a lot of emotions," feels the director of New Cinema Paradiso, a film that, twenty years ago, won a life-successful film for a man named Tornator's Oscar and a grand jury award.
The values obtained by Anec, the main association of operators, speak clearly: in the last five years the doors of 316 cinemas of traditional type have closed, and the highest account paid mainly the halls in the most important cities: by 10 minus in Florence, by 5 minus in Méri, by 5 minus in Florence, by 9 in Topoli, by Ne Milan.
Among the regions most affected is Emilia-Romagna with a loss of 82 cinemas, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
And the evidence that the first responsible for their disappearance is the emergence of multiplex, are precisely these three Italian regions that have recorded the highest number of new cinema multisales: by 195 more in Lombardy in the last five years, by 81 in Tuscany and in Emilia-Ro.
"The Italian process has evolved irrationally," says Paolo Protti, President Anecu, "it is useful to create new structures, but it would be necessary to guarantee that existing ones will survive, because when one cinema in the city closes, not all its visitors are willing to move to the multiplex.
Then let us not even talk about the insufficient subsidy to the fund to the benefit of operators: the previous state debt is about 10 million euros.
From a moral and ethical point of view, it is a shame that the government does not respect existing laws.
Between <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>16 million and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>18 million per year would be needed to support the sector."
An interesting case is the Bologna case, the first Italian city to worry about closures and decided to find a way out by signing a protocol between the municipalities and Anec, the first of its kind in Italy to protect and promote small cinemas both in the historical centres and in the suburbs.
Among the planned norms are steps of tax relief in favour of operators and benefits for the public in terms of mobility: spectators will be able to navigate to a zone with limited transport and will have special prices to stop and in some parking lots.
“I like this initiative,” says Giuseppe Tornatore, “and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna by introducing other measures.”
However, it is certain that in order to resist the great power of multiplex, traditional halls must improve the quality of sound and image, because today’s audience is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a theme that has always been important: the closure of Super Cinema in Bagheria, instead of my childhood and adolescence, was a spark that convinced me to set up the "New Cinema Paradiso" that I have been thinking about for 10 years.
I’ve been living in Rome for 25 years, and when I walk in front of the already closed Rialto or Quirinale in Nazionale Street, where I’ve shared so much emotion that I don’t have to look at the black dust inscriptions, I turn to the other side.”
The connection between the political and the Mafia group 'drangheta, mayor Gioie Tauro in prison
"The mayor of Gioie Tauro was willing to adjust the municipal election according to the interests of the Piramalli Mafia group."
The charges brought by the Directorate against the Mafia in Calabria against the mayor and viceroy Giorgio Dal Torrione e Rosario Schiavone, and the mayor of Rosarno Carl Martelli, imprisoned this morning for outside cooperation with the Mafia, are organized by the Mafia.
Gioacchino Piromalli, an old intermediary between the clan and the public administration, and his grandson, a lawyer, the name of the boss, already accused of committing crimes of a Mafia character, sentenced to pay 10 million euros.
"They ignored all legal and moral norms, as well as common sense," state prosecutors wrote when the two local administrations expressed their willingness to pay for the consultation with a lawyer named Piromalli.
"This would allow the Mafia group to formally enter the city authorities, and make it easier for them to control and manage the public administration."
The president of the Calabrian regional commission, Agazio Loiero, does not hide that "the secret agreements between local institutions and the organized criminal underworld are many in his region: "There are areas where the concentration of the mafia is stronger than in others, where secret agreements are inevitable.
But we also have many local politicians who resist the pressure of 'drangheta, heroes who are still immaculate.'
The arrests of this morning follow the July arrests of last year, by which the police showed that the Piramalli Mafia group had received a final intervention.
Since the end of April last year - the city council of Gioi Tauro has been dissolved since 1991, the reason was the supposed link between organized crime and local government at the time - local politicians have been deprived of functions in the municipal administration.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, president of the Christian Democrats, who was elected the head of the centre-right coalition after a narrower election in May at the moment of dissolution.
He yelled at the scandal when the Prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
He called for the responsibility of then Deputy Interior Minister Marc Minniti and accused him of devising everything for political reasons, but the judges in the imprisonment order signed this morning explain that the Mafia group has even gone so far as to ask for changes.
Other hearings ordered against Dal Torrion, the public prosecutor writes, revealed "the desire to move the demands of the entrepreneur, representatives of some larger group very close, as is generally known, to Piromallim and to adapt the elections to the public administration."
When the energy is generated from the waves, the big ones come into play.
It is an infinite bearing that covers more than 70% of the earth’s surface and is now being discovered by large global energy companies.
Waves, currents, tides, tides are new sources of inexhaustible energy on which the eyes of giants like Chevron are now trying to reach out to these sources.
The possibility of generating energy from the motions of the sea has been studied for more than a hundred years, and in the 1970s in connection with the first oil crisis, research intensified.
When the price of oil dropped around 1980, the idea of using marine energy went awry. But now the ecological organization and the new increase in the price of oil gave the sector a new impetus.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London in 2007 stated that about 15 percent of the world’s electricity consumption could be covered by the use of sea waves.
That would be twice the amount of energy that is currently being produced in nuclear power plants.
In addition, there are also streams and tides and tides.
The giants are attacking.
The company that invested in marine energy was Enersis, which in 2005 agreed to build facilities in northern Portugal.
When this intention was announced, it looked like a huge revolutionary step.
After two years of investing in marine energy, more and more companies are investing in marine energy than in traditional energy.
“Chevron is studying ocean energy technology,” a spokesperson for a company connected to the U.S. oil rig, told the Wall Street Journal, “and they’re thinking about working with us.”
The cooperation we are considering is about obtaining permission from the U.S. Energy Commission, which is necessary to launch a project to use marine energy in Alaska.
We cannot underestimate this signal, especially considering that it is the US that continues to mine oil in Alaska, and President Bush recently came up with a plan for a new drilling.
In addition to Chevron, Verdant Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey are tracking the trace of marine energy, and the sums invested so far, although not in detail, show increasing interest, according to observers.
Technology, shit needs to be worked out.
Experts are talking about technology, which is still in its infancy, because it is not known what impact the use of marine energy will have on the environment.
For the time being, facilities in Portugal and some in Scotland are small and do not appear to cause major problems to the ecosystem.
However, for greater energy production, it is necessary to use technologies with greater impact on the medium.
The methods are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of battles that are interconnected.
The force of the waves that moves with the bolts up and down is changed by means of cylinders and cylinders to hydraulic pressure inside these bolts.
The pressure rotates the turbine, which supplies energy to the generator.
The energy is delivered to the shore by subsea cables.
For now, there are four facilities of this type in the project phase, which are only awaiting federal approval and some of the energy could be used for military purposes.
On the contrary, Verdant Power is already producing energy for the shopping mall and parking lot using six offshore turbines in the East River in New York City.
The movement of water during the tide and tide is caused by the rotation of the turbines, which by this rotational movement feed the generator.
Verdant said they have a long list of clients waiting for the necessary authorizations due to the possibility of using this energy.
After the waves, after the tide and after the tide.
At this point, the potential of influx and influx is of particular interest, they say at the Institute for Electrical Energy Research.
Although this is an incoherent factor, tide and tide are more predictable than wind, sun or waves, and thus more reliable as a source of energy.
States such as New York, Maine and Alaska, as well as other coastal states, have already invested $7.5 million in inflow and forecast investments of up to $35 million for 2009.
