Eighty-year-old chef found dead in San Francisco store
An eighty-year-old chef, who recently moved to San Francisco, was on the steps of a local store this week.
The victim’s brother, however, says he doesn’t see anyone wanting to hurt him, and adds, “He finally started to succeed.”
The body found at Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning was identified as an eighty-year-old San Francisco resident, Frank Galicia, the forensic doctor’s office said.
The San Francisco Police Department said it was a violent death and an investigation was underway.
Victim Louis Galicia’s brother for the ABC KGO station in San Francisco said Frank, who was previously a regular chef in Boston, got his dream job as a chef at the Sons & Daughters restaurant six months ago.
A spokesman for Sons & Daughters said they were “shocked and destroyed” by his death.
"We have a small team that works as a close-knit family, and we will miss them very much," the spokesperson said.
In this difficult time, our thoughts and sorrows belong to Frank's family and friends.
Louis Galicia said that Frank had slept in the inns at first, but that recently "he finally started to succeed."
"He found an apartment, he went out with a girl," Louis Galicia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said he didn't see anyone wanting to hurt his younger brother.
He had a kind soul and a big heart.
When he wanted to connect with his family, he always cooked food for us, he made dinner for us," said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to take part in any quarrels.
It was a brother who took things as they are.
“Even if everything else in the world was wrong, it was an unbridled diamond that lit up every day,” he said.

Czech railways have invested in the modernization of vehicles over 31 billion.
They also have air conditioning and new toilets.
Over the past six years, state carriers have invested more than CZK 31 billion in vehicle modernization.
A third of the cars are currently equipped with air conditioning, about half of the trains have a new system of closed toilets.
However, the modernisation rates in the individual years except for 2012 are gradually decreasing.
In the last six years, Czech railways have invested more than CZK 31 billion in vehicle modernization.
A third of the cars are currently equipped with air conditioning, about half of the trains have a new system of closed toilets.
The money spent was shown to reduce the average age by two years for locomotives and separate units and by six years for classic cars.
A larger share of investments gave carriers access to regional transport, where about 60 percent of the money went, and 40 percent of the company then invested in the restoration of vehicles for long-distance transport.
The average age of locomotives and units is currently 19 years.
However, modernized older vehicles are included in this indicator as completely new.
If the modernisation of vehicles did not count, the average age of the <0xC4><0x8C>D drive vehicles would increase by ten years.
A little older are on average passenger cars, the average age of which at the time of modernization is 23 years.
If only the age from the date of manufacture were taken into account, the average age of these vehicles would be 33.4 years.
However, in recent years the classic sets of wagons and drawn by locomotives from the Czech and worldwide railways gradually disappear and are replaced by motor or electric units.
Between 2011 and 2015, the locomotive fell from 280 to 223, similarly the number of classic cars from 2716 in 2011 to 2132 in the middle of this year.
The carrier in particular got rid of old vehicles equipped with leather seats and doors without the possibility of blocking the opening while driving.
From January to July, the carrier had 110 of these vehicles crashed.
Of the investments that <0xC4><0x8C>D plans to make in the near future, it is possible to indicate, for example, the purchase of 50 wagons for speeds up to 200 kilometers per hour, which the carrier plans to deploy on the international line Prague - Bratislava tramway - Budapest.
The contract counts with the collection of up to 30 pieces of motor and 20 pieces of electric units.
For a quarter of a year, the authorities know about illegal advertising, they can't get rid of it.
We're completely helpless, they admit.
For a quarter of a year, the editorial staff of the online newspaper Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz has been following the story of a billboard in southern Bohemia, which now attracts motorists to visit Leipzig, where there is not only a touristic walk in the crowns of trees, but also an Olympic park.
Highway managers know it's black, but they're saying they can't do anything about it.
There are hundreds, perhaps thousands, of similar advertisements all over the country.
According to officials, it is the fault of the chatter law, which makes it not possible to remove illegal mobile billboards immediately.
First of all, a complicated bureaucratic wheel is needed.
In the meantime, however, the company will change its name and the office is short on it.
Or just push the ad a few meters and the official process has to start again.
The Directorate of Roads and Highways admitted a quarter of a year ago: at the main train from <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice to Lipno, there is a billboard in black on our land near the state road.
But even three months were not enough for officials to get rid of unauthorized portable constructions with a huge advertising poster.
It's as if no one cares that he's standing right next to the road, in a 50-meter-long protection zone where nothing can stand for safety reasons.
Road managers claim that they cannot simply consult with the billboard because of the hollow law.
Maybe load it up and take it away.
“We can’t just afford that,” says Nina Ledvinov<0xC3><0xA1>, a spokeswoman for the Directorate of Highways and Highways, referring to the complicated bureaucratic wheel, which the removal of billboards must be preceded by law.
The case of this particular billboard, the fate of which the online journal Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz began to monitor in detail in the spring, is not unique and points to a general problem that cannot be solved effectively and quickly by the authorities.
In the southern Czech Republic alone, the editorial office counted dozens of similar mobile ads placed against the rules just next to or near the ticket.
The same is true of other countries.
"We have difficulty forcing the company to remove the triggers," confirms the head of the transport department of the <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xBD> Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice Regional Office, Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Kl<0xC3><0xA1>s, whose colleagues deal with similar stories.
According to the Kl<0xC3><0xA1>sy, there is a hollow law that unites officials.
In advance, the billboard owner has to call complex to put the advertisement away.
However, the bosses of the companies are often inaccessible or know the trick, which has already been described in the past, when the issue began to interest in more detail: it is enough to move the mobile stand with advertising by a few meters and the officials can make the previous call to remove the black advert.
This is because the agency has to determine exactly where the illegal billboard stands.
"If someone moves it and the coordinates do not agree, they will see it as a new device and we need to contact the owner again," explains Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Kl<0xC3><0xA1>sa.
The new law won't help.
The amendment could have been introduced by a new law that will ban billboards at highways from September next year and restrict them even on Class I roads.
Critics point out that the rules for tackling illegal and easily portable ads will remain the same as before.
And the authorities don't do that.
Companies can continue to make tens to hundreds of millions of crowns a year on illegal land leases, and no one can afford them.
For example, the billboard attracting Lipno belongs to Commerz Billboard.
Officials know her well: the <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xA1> Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovski magistrat is currently running three administrative proceedings with her for black-built billboards.
The company is subject to a fine of <0xC2><0xA3>30,000 in each case.
This is a number of advertisements that have been placed in the Class I road safety zone without permission.
The proceedings have not yet been completed, says Jaroslav Mr<0xC3><0xA1>z, head of the transport department of the <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xA1> Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jov<0xC3><0xAD>k Magistrat.
The advertisement, which Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz is interested in, although it is not yet among these cases, will soon be added to them.
According to <0xC5><0x98>SD spokeswoman Nina Ledvinov<0xC3><0xA1> firma did not respond to repeated written calls for removal, and the case will reach the provincial and then probably magistrate officials.
Commerz Billboard is one of the suspect companies that can’t be contacted.
It does not take over the post and the official headquarters in <0xC5><0xBD>i<0xC5><0xBE>kov was cancelled more than six years ago.
It's not even clear who's behind it.
In the past, the post office of the company went to the South-Czech businessman Anton Fischer, who was famous for a sharp dispute with the head of the Czech Hyundai brand.
Fischer, whose Euro Billboards he rents from Comerz Billboard and offers them to advertisers, has denied any connection in the past.
In the spring of this year, when <0xC5><0x98>SD started to take an interest in advertising on Lipno, Fischer had public officials send a letter to the secret company Commerz Billboard to his pension, where the company is supposedly based.
To this day, however, no one has contacted the highway managers.
It's a waste of fighting.
Similar silences or opaque changes in settlements are not uncommon.
A few years ago, a company was gradually fined two million kroner.
But she changed her name and what, and there was nothing to deal with.
The executor returned the case, the ads went on, maybe in other places.
We are quite helpless against similar companies and their business practices.
It's like fighting windmills, admitting, on condition of anonymity, one of the officials.
No one has yet settled the new law in this regard.
At the time, he spoke to several members of the House who were concerned about the problem.
So far, they have not developed any activity.
On the contrary, there were members who wanted to extend the deadline for keeping billboards at the main Czech communications.
The government rejected it.
Billboards are not only a very sensitive and somewhat schizophrenic topic for national but also regional and municipal policies.
On the one hand, they know about the social demand for their limitations, on the other hand, they need them themselves for the purpose of advertising in election campaigns.
I don’t give up the pretty well-established impression that if something doesn’t work, then the laws need to be changed.
Farmers harvest less grain this year, but more rapeseed and mackerel, the statistics estimate.
According to estimates by the Czech Statistical Office, grain harvest will be 6.7 percent lower this year than last year.
However, this year’s harvest exceeds the average for the last five and ten years.
In contrast, the harvest of rapeseed (3.9 percent) and maca (2.5 percent) will be higher.
Grain harvest will be 6.7 percent lower this year than last year.
Farmers harvest 7.2 million tons of grain.
This is according to an estimate published by the Czech Statistical Office as of July 15.
The initial estimate a month ago was more pessimistic and predicted a decline of ten against last year.
Last year’s harvest was over-average.
This year’s harvest is above the average for the last five and ten years.
On the contrary, this year will be higher the harvest of rapeseed and maca.
Growers harvest 3.9 percent more than a year ago, when they got 1.256 million tons under the roof.
This year’s macaque harvest could be 2.5 percent higher than last year’s.
The projected decline in cereal production is due to both a 3.7 per cent reduction in yield per hectare to 5.71 tonnes per hectare as well as a decrease in arable land.
This year, farmers harvested 3% fewer fields.
Winter wheat, which is the most important grain for the Czech Republic, is estimated to be harvested by 3.3 percent less this year.
The farmers then moved it to several fields.
However, a lower yield per hectare will be signed, which will fall to 6.04 tonnes.
A decrease of about one-fifth is expected for spring barley, which is most often used for beer production.
Reducing crop yields means a 15.2 per cent reduction in crop area, but also a lower yield per hectare.
Winter jelly, on the other hand, will be born by 6.3 percent more.
The grain harvest will also be increased.
Rape harvest statistics estimate 1.305 million tons, which is more than last year.
Axis areas have expanded by 7.3 percent.
The yield will be 3.2 percent lower than last year.
This year’s crop of rapeseed will exceed the 10-year average by 13.3 percent, while seedlings are one-third larger in area than they were ten years ago.
In the last four years, fields with macaque have also increased.
This year, the farmers planted it on 35,543 hectares.
Compared to 2008, when the mackerel in the Czech Republic grew at a record 70,000 hectares, the field is only half.
Thanks to the expansion of the crop area, this year’s crop will be richer.
It is up 2.5 percent from last year to 27,423 tonnes.
The yield per hectare will be 6.1% lower.
Olomouc police have accused two men of attack with a knife and a machete, the court has sent him to jail.
Police have accused two attackers who attacked the center of Olomouc on Tuesday with a knife and a machete of a 35-year-old man.
"Although the attacker tried to escape, they caused him a sharp and cut wound, which required treatment in the hospital and other treatments," police spokeswoman Marie <0xC5><0xA0>trb<0xC3><0xA1>kov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
The two suspects were arrested by police immediately after the attack.
The plaintiff submitted a request to the court for their detention and the court complied with him on Friday.
Both men face three to ten years in prison.
Police have accused two detainees of assaulting a thirty-five-year-old man in the centre of Olomouc with a knife and a machete.
The attackers inflicted a urinary and slit wound on him, and the man ended up in the hospital.
The attack was preceded by an incident between two groups of people that took place on Tuesday at noon in the Freedom class, police said.
The smugglers ended up in custody, Olomouc police spokeswoman Marie <0xC5><0xA0>trb<0xC3><0xA1>kov<0xC3><0xA1> reported.
A mass clash between the two families took place in the garden area in front of the Tratorie bar in the immediate vicinity of the center of Olomouc.
After an aggressive verbal outcry, two attackers attacked with the knife and swords of a thirty-five-year-old man.
Although the man tried to escape, they caused him a sharp and cut wound, which required treatment in the hospital and other treatments, a police spokeswoman said.
The clash, which attracted a lot of attention in the centre of the city and caused several police officers and guards to intervene on the spot, involved family disputes.
The criminals of the thirty-four-year-old man from Slovakia and the thirty-seven-year-old man from Olomouc have been accused of attempting serious harm to health and extortion.
The plaintiff filed a motion to the court for their detention and the court complied with him on Friday, the spokeswoman added.
The maquette was used in the center of Olomouc during the mass battle by the attackers also five years ago, it was only a few dozen meters away, in front of the Varna discotheque in Riegrov Street.
Police said at the time that a group of about 10 foreigners with guns attacked the guests of the company who were standing in front of the entrance.
Police said they had knives, knives and swords in their hands.
The court then penalized two attacking foreigners with a conditional sentence.
Abandoned and empty houses in the center of Prague.
You’ll be surprised if you walk around them every day.
One of the most striking examples of an unused and empty house is the large building of the former headquarters of IPB in the middle of Senov<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xBE>n<0xC3><0xAD> square.
It was supposed to work as a hotel a long time ago.
But still nothing.
That it is necessary to build new and new apartments and offices in the metropolis?
And what to use the existing, often architecturally valuable and protected?
Right in the center of Prague, in the immediate vicinity of Wenceslas Square, there are several commercial houses, which, despite their location, size and often even monumental protection, are empty and empty.
We have selected properties in the center using the project V<0xC3><0xA1>zdnédomy.cz, which maps long-term vacant properties in the Czech Republic.
Houses are usually victims of financial problems of their owners, opaque relationships between companies, or belong to a state that cannot or does not want to get rid of them.
There are more empty houses in the Czech Republic than there are homeless people.
Whether the owners pay a special tax, they want the initiative
Fidel Castro was shot almost there, and Hitler's brother lived there.
The writers showed a different little side.

Clinton’s husband made $10.6 million last year.
Trump has refused to release his tax returns.
Hillary Clinton and her husband, ex-president Bill Clinton, made $10.6 million last year.
More than a million dollars were spent on Clinton’s charity.
Most of Clinton’s revenues – over $6 million – are for their statements.
Trump refuses to publish his tax returns.
U.S. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton released her tax returns on Friday, raising pressure on her Republican rival Donald Trump to do the same.
Hillary Clinton and her husband, ex-president Bill Clinton, made $10.6 million last year, the AP reported.
Most of Clinton’s revenues – over $6 million – are for their statements, mostly from the period before April 2015, when Clinton began her campaign before the election.
The tax report showed that Clinton’s husbands paid a federal income tax of 34.2 percent last year, followed by a state and local income tax of 9 percent.
In total, they paid 43.2% of their income on taxes.
Trump, however, has a similar problem with the move, so far he has not decided to publish a tax return.
There is a possibility that Donald Trump will not pay any taxes at all, Clinton wrote on Twitter minutes after her confession was made public.
Clinton has repeatedly returned to the secrets surrounding Trump’s earnings, among other things, to raise questions about whether her rival is really as rich as she claims, the AP said.
Trump’s wealth is estimated at billions of dollars.
Lower earnings would damage the Republican candidate’s reputation as a successful businessman.
Senator Tim Kaine, who is running for vice president in tandem with the former First Lady, today released a report on his tax deductions over the past decade.
Together with his wife Anne Holton, they gave 7.5 percent of their earnings to charity and spent 25.6 percent of their earnings on taxes last year.
A firefighter in Nigeria broke out again.
The Islamists of Boko Haram prevented a consistent vaccination and killed a doctor.
In Nigeria, cases of child molestation have reappeared.
In the north-east of the country, the government has declared emergency vaccinations, as two children infected with the disease have died.
Vaccines were transported by helicopters.
In the affected area, Islamist terrorists from Boko Haram, who prevented the vaccination and even killed doctors, were killed.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the virus was undetected.
In the northeast of Nigeria, emergency vaccination of children against measles has begun, as two children infected with the disease have been infected there.
In Africa, the armour was last diagnosed two years ago in Somalia.
The Nigerian government has announced that a million children will be vaccinated in the state of Borno and another four million in the surrounding states.
Nigerian military helicopters on Friday quickly transported vaccines against child prostitution to the affected northeastern part of the country, where Islamist terrorists from Boko Haram operate.
The World Health Organization (WHO) said the virus had been undetected in the area for many years.
Boko Haram extremists have prevented vaccinations in the past and even killed doctors.
Their attacks on Thursday also made it impossible for doctors to get to areas where children with cerebral palsy were detected.
The two affected toddlers arrived with refugees from parts of Nigeria newly freed from Boko Haram.
The director of the WHO section responsible for the eradication of rabies, Michel Zaffran, told the BBC that vaccination in Nigeria will begin next week.
In Borno, the Islamic radical group Boko Haram has been active for a long time.
The area was made available to international organizations and the government until the beginning of this year, when Boko Haram managed to weaken in this part of the country in a fundamental way.
Nigeria’s health minister Isaac Adewole has admitted that the new cases are a major disappointment for the country, as Nigeria wanted to announce next year that it has been eradicated.
The WHO noted that it is possible that although the disease did not appear for two years, it was still spreading among children.
Children under the age of five will now be vaccinated.
In 2012, Nigeria accounted for half of all cases of obstruction in the world.
While it was still active in 125 countries in 1988, it now remains in only three regions – Afghanistan and Pakistan and northern Nigeria.
In Rome, the Pope met with ex-prostitutes.
He listened to the stories of the dead women.
Pope Francis has met with twenty former prostitutes who have escaped the Easter gang thanks to the police.
The Pope listened to their difficult life stories and urged them to look with confidence into the future.
Francis wanted to draw attention to human trafficking by this meeting and to call for a stronger fight against it.
Pope Francis met in Rome with twenty former prostitutes, who were freed by the police from the power of a pagan gang.
The head of the Catholic Church listened for more than an hour to the troubled stories of fallen women and subsequently urged them to look with confidence into the future, a Vatican spokesman said.
Among the former prostitutes Francis visited were six women from Romania, four from Albania, seven from Nigeria, and one from Tunisia, Italy, and Ukraine.
Their average age is around 30 years old.
All of them, according to the Vatican, were subjected to cruel physical violence during forced prostitution.
With the visit, Francis wanted to draw attention to human trafficking and call for a stronger fight against it, the Pope's spokesman said.
Francis often points out the fates of people on the edge of society.
On Thursday, for example, he had lunch with Syrian refugees who arrived in the Vatican this year in April and June thanks to his personal invitation.
France is hitting jihadist factories.
Without the help of Muslims, it will not be possible.
France has to help the Muslims themselves in the fight against radical Islamism.
The government of Prime Minister Manuel Valls also intends to make significant changes in the functioning of mosques and the education of clergy.
Since last December we have closed 20 mosques and prayers.
And others will follow, the interior minister announced.
There are over 100 jihadists in the country.
“If Muslims don’t help the state in the fight against those who violate public freedom, it will be increasingly difficult for France to guarantee this recognition of freedom,” said Prime Minister Manuel Valls.
In particular, it intends to ensure that only imams who have been educated in France are preaching in mosques and prayer halls.
At the same time, he wants to stop financing mosques from abroad.
Currently, about 20 percent of the money comes from abroad for the construction of new mosques, mostly from Morocco, Algeria and the Gulf countries.
This is also the reason why preachers enter the mosque, who can sow radicalism in France.
"Our country must show that Islam is compatible with democracy," the prime minister added.
The key to achieving these goals will be the new French Islamic Foundation (FIF).
It should serve as a bridge between a secular state and a Muslim minority.
No more money from abroad.
The French Foundation for Islam, founded in 2005 by the then Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin, now operates in the country.
Already at that time, the foundation had to contribute to the transparency of the financial flows between the mosques and the countries that finance their construction.
But the institutions soon intervened in internal contradictions and rivalry.
"It's a total failure," Valls said recently.
On the French political scene, after the attack on Charlie Hebdo magazine in January 2015, the debate over a new institution that will replace the non-functioning foundation began.
All of them accelerated the further terrorist attacks in France, which were carried out on behalf of the Islamic State by radicalized Islamists.
French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve recently announced that a new foundation would be created in October this year.
It will have two main tasks - to ensure the financing of mosques from domestic resources and also to oversee the imams.
At the moment, it is not clear where the money will be taken not only for the construction of new mosques, but also various educational centers.
However, several proposals are being considered.
One of them is a special fee or halal food tax.
In practice, retailers would pay for halal food for the certification.
Some of that money would then go to the foundation’s cash register.
The contribution of ten to twenty euros (270 to 540 kroner) could then be paid by French pilgrims who go to Mecca.
Every year about 30,000 of them go there for a traditional pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia.
And not only that.
According to the Prime Minister, in the mosques in the future, only preachers who have passed special education programs at French universities should act.
This should ensure that the preaching is in line with democracy.
We'll close the radical mosques.
At the same time, the French government is fighting against radicals.
And others will follow, the interior minister recently announced.
In France, there is no place for those who in the mosques proclaim hatred and do not respect some of the principles of our country, such as equality between women and men.
There are an estimated 2,500 mosques and prayers in the country.
It is estimated that about 120 of them are under the influence of radical Islamism.
Since 2012, authorities have fired about 80 imams and are considering it for a few more dozen more.
Not everyone, however, believes that the government’s actions can significantly counter radicalism.
Those who want to radicalize will do the same.
This is not happening in mosques, young people are radicalizing on the internet, said Severine Labatov<0xC3><0xA1>, an expert at the National Center for Scientific Research.
Drummer Kelemen lost a sprint with the star Baugem in the 1st round.
The Czech heavyweight cyclist has to fight for the process to the finals in the corrective races.
Cyclist Pavel Kelemen at the Rio de Janeiro Olympic Games after a sprint qualifier among the top eighteen lost in the 1st round to French giant Gregory Baugem, a silver defender from the previous games in London.
He has to fight for the eight-finals in the corrective races.
At the start of the Royal Discipline, 27 riders were standing on the track and the best Czech rider at the moment has recorded the 14th best time.
The two-seater with a flying start came in 9,969 seconds.
In the main elimination phase, he was expected to qualify for the fifth Baugé, who already has bronze from Ria in the team sprint.
Kelemen eventually reached out to an experienced Frenchman, but he kept an eye on the procedure.
The gold defender Jason Kenny glittered with great performance.
The 80-year-old Brit took the third-fastest double in history and won the qualification in an Olympic record of 9,551.
He then easily managed, as expected, the last protagonist, who was German Maximilian Levy.
The British quartet was also successful with Bradley Wiggins, who broke a new world record of 3:50,570 in the four-kilometre race and reached the final.
The current high (3:51,659), which had belonged to the British four years since the London Olympics, improved by more than a second.
Young doctors are pushing: They want a fresh wind in the industry
Representatives of the young doctors met to approve new steps in their dispute over the new contract.
The Council of Young Physicians (JDC) at the British Medical Association (BMA) must request the full council to support further field actions from the beginning of September.
The JDC says the ministers have failed to resolve the issues regarding the treaty.
Young doctors and medical students voted in July to reject a contract agreed with the BMA.
58% of its members who took part in the elections were rejected.
In a letter to members published Thursday night on Twitter, JDC President Ellen McCourt said the government remained “still silent” on the issues, leading to a rejection of the contract.
She said: “In this light, the JDC executive body decided by voting to reject the proposed new treaty completely and to request a new formal hearing on all issues.”
In response to the government’s silence today, the JDC Executive Board formally requested a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve the ongoing programme of threatened sectoral actions at the beginning of September.
The controversy led young doctors to announce six strikes this year, including the first general strikes in NHS history.
Dr. Johann Malawana, the leader of the young doctors at BMA, resigned after deciding to reject the agreed terms of the contract recommended by BMA.
BMA members at the pre-vote meetings before 54,000 young doctors and medical students said the deal was good and should be accepted.
After the vote, the health minister said the contract would be a burden for doctors in England.
Russia and Turkey: ‘incompatible’ alliances?
It was a gesture that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and announce the formal end of eight months of verbal war and economic sanctions.
But while Vladimir Putin welcomed the Turkish counterpart in the sprawling hall of the palace in St. Petersburg, I had the impression that Ankara wanted more of this reconciliation.
Hands-on, yes.
But Putin did not smile and barely radiated warmth from him, even by his measured standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, has repeatedly spoken of his "dear friend" to Mr Putin - five times, according to one of the reports.
I didn't count it.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their pre-crisis levels, but will be even better.
The next day, one of the local newspapers wrote that Erdogan was acting as if nothing bad had ever happened.
In my opinion, his enthusiasm revealed the exact opposite.
But the continuing cold that radiated from Putin showed that the Russian leader had forgotten nothing.
The real cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening speech: the shooting down of a Russian fighter jet by Turkey on the Syrian border.
Moscow’s reaction at the time was outraged.
Putin was stabbed to death and accused Ankara of stabbed Moscow in the back.
It was a shame that it came from a supposed friend.
Re-establishing true trust will be difficult, perhaps even impossible.
Russian public opinion has also changed since December.
State-controlled media has been campaigning massively against Ankara for months.
All of a sudden, it looked like the Turks could do anything.
More serious was the accusation by top state officials that Erdogan’s own family had benefited from the illegal oil trade in parts of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He strongly denied this.
But there was an official message in St. Petersburg that it was time to move on.
After all, the meeting was only because Putin was given the apology he had asked for from President Erdogan.
Russia could have declared a victory as well.
For Ankara, the benefits of the ceasefire are clear.
In the first place, Erdogan was almost powerless during a failed coup last month and therefore needs all of his friends.
The repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey have also visibly shaken him.
There is also an economic motive.
Russia's sanctions had a severe impact - especially the cancellation of charter flights, which annually transport several million Russian tourists to the coast of Turkey.
This number has decreased by almost 90%.
As far as Russia is concerned, tour operators and charter companies will be sure to take a breather when flights are renewed.
They earn on the Mediterranean tourism at the end of the season.
Even this week, state television promised cheaper fruits and vegetables when the import of agricultural commodities from Turkey was allowed again.
"Tourists there, tomatoes back here," as reported in the Vedemosti newspapers.
The visit, however, had another political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry at the West for what it sees as a bad reaction to the coup attempt.
In addition, the long-running innocence of the lengthy talks about joining the EU and joining Putin - who aspires to be able to exploit the cooling and break Turkey's ties with the West.
The Russian leader certainly got bonus points when Ankara asked him for help from the elected authorities after the coup attempt.
You have to understand that for Moscow, which has a deep-rooted fear of regime change, this is a given.
So the summit in this pompous, seaside palace of Russia and Turkey allowed me to present what one of the analysts described to me as “incompatible alliances”: how the forces of the two countries feel to be rejected and exploited by the West.
However, despite the fact that they have publicly shown mutual reconciliation, there are fundamental differences between the two countries.
The first is Syria, where Moscow has recently established itself as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey are on opposite sides.
It could be said that after almost three hours of introductory talks, the two presidents stated at a press conference that they had not even mentioned the issue.
The Turkish president deliberately avoided answers to the question about the differences between them, while Putin decided to highlight these differences.
There is no clear agreement on the basis of which the two countries could find common ground on the issue of Syria.
But after months of open hostilities – and given the risk of a complete disaster, when a NATO member Turkey shot down a Russian fighter jet – it is certainly better for the two leaders to speak together at least once again.
Royal Bank of Scotland to Disappear for Customers Outside Scotland
According to the bank’s executive director, the RBS brand is to be suppressed into a back office role.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be lost to customers outside of Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank’s global ambitions.
Of these, it slowed down when it almost disappeared eight years ago and had to be redeemed from debt.
At the time, strategic brands were using "RBS" to protect other brands of consumer finance.
It was followed by millions of pounds spent on sponsoring international sports, from the Six Nations rugby championship to Winbledom champion Andy Marray.
But now it has been decided that it is better to give more to stand out rather to national brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used for Scottish customers, but will not launch new stores.
All references to RBS in England and Wales, with the exception of the head office and stock coding on the stock exchange, will be changed to NatWest.
For customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, the Ulster Bank brand is already in use.
There are other, smaller brands for private banking that will get more ahead - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank.
On the way to customers and employees in Inverness-shire, McEwan answered Ross McEwan’s questions.
BBC Scotland said: “The RBS brand will cease to be our investment brand and the brand for which our employees work, as we are now becoming a brand bank much more.”
As the bank itself has become a global brand, it has become a global brand as well as RBS.
Now I say that we no longer have a global aspiration, we have efforts focused on the domestic scene.
Each of these brands will mean something completely different in their own communities, and our employees will be working under these brands.
RBS has already announced that it will not continue its sponsorship of the Six Nations Championship, and has prepared a profile of the individual brands of the sponsorship of the sport.
“This is a good time for us to move to a brand bank, because the basic question (which we are asking) is how to focus on becoming a better customer bank?” said the CEO.
Three years ago, it would have been very cynical to say that we would become a great customer bank and introduce those brands.
But along with how we focused on customer needs, not our own, I think there’s a lot of change going on.
We can recall these marks again, I think the right time has come.
Frankie Dettori at Newmarket on Predilection led to the 3000th winner
Dettori sprays champagne after a double victory at Newmarket brought him 3,000 victories
Jockey Frankie Dettori won the 3000th British victory in the Newmarket on Friday.
He achieved this milestone with his second win in the evening on his local track - on the Predilection horse trained by John Gosden.
Fifty-four-year-old Ital is the sixth jockey to achieve such a result in a flat finish.
His predecessors are Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
Three-time champion Dettori, who had previously won the Ghayyar, said, "It's weird."
I’m very excited because my family is here.
I’m very happy that it happened in Newmarket, because it was here that I anchored 30 years ago.
It's not a huge event, it's not Royal Ascot - it's Friday night on Earth with 20,000 people.
I got stuck and I'm very grateful.
Dettori collects congratulations when he brings Predilection after victory
Two jockeys have achieved this milestone in the hurdles - hockey champion Richard Johnson and 20-time retired champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who during his career set a record-breaking goal of more than 4,300 winners.
Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4,493 career winners
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of modern times and it is no surprise that he has reached the milestone that only a few riders had before him.
He’s stylish and strong, but it’s his tactical fist that sets him apart from other serious riders.
He is a fantastic ambassador of achievements, his enthusiasm and charisma have attracted fans to this sport for many years.
A few weeks ago, I told Frankie in Epsom that if he didn’t just drive on weekends and big breaks, he’d already have 6,000 winners!
Of course, the truth is that Frankie drove the winner in the UK for most of his 30-year career, and that’s really something.
It has a vivid character, which is good for British tennis, but more importantly, it's an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrates his success with his famous summer jumper
From summer finishes to summer jumps – Frankie Dettori has been a proponent of British flat finishes for two decades.
It was like riding on a mountain track.
The vast number of winners of the big races, including his famous "Big Seven" in Ascot, survived the plane crash and was banned from taking off due to drugs.
Three years ago, he stagnated for the first time when he returned after a 6-month ban on starting, but proved incredible internal strength and returned in the best form despite all the doubts.
And maybe it won't be the last time - Dettori has previously stated that he would like to continue racing for at least 50 years.
Russian President Putin Releases Presidential Office Chief Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly fired Sergei Ivanov from the post of head of the presidential office on Friday.
Ivanov was one of Putin’s closest collaborators for many years.
Thirty-year-old Ivanov was appointed Special Representative for Ecology and Transport.
The Kremlin’s statement said Putin had “liberated Ivan from his services at the head of the Russian presidential office,” but no reason was given.
He will be replaced by Anton Vajno, who has been Ivanov’s representative since 2012.
The forty-year-old Vajno was previously a diplomat.
Born in the Estonian capital Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious State Institute of International Relations in Moscow (MGIMO) and worked at the Embassy in Tokyo.
The website (in Russian) states that he later served as head of the presidential protocol and presidential office.
When he was appointed to Putin, he said, “Thank you for your trust.”
I believe that the most important role of the administration is to support your activities of the Head of State in the sense of drafting laws and checking the extent to which your guidelines are being followed.
On Friday, Putin told a Russian TV station that Ivanov had asked her to be released from the post and recommended that she be replaced by Vajno.
Persuasive smiles?
This move completely mystified Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov was one of Vladimir Putin’s closest collaborators for a long time and, like Putin, worked for the KGB.
As head of the presidential office, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcast on state television, the two men said they were leaving the post of head of the presidential office at their own request.
But the smiles on the cameras convinced a few people – especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
Is this the result of a struggle for power?
No one knows that yet.
But the official claim that the man once thought of as a possible president was suddenly keen to pursue Russia’s environmental policy was met with great distrust.
On the Kremlin’s website, Putin is quoted as saying: “It is true that in 2012, in an interview, I asked you to give me this very challenging post, even if you could call it a problematic post, he entrusted it to me for four years.
I was the head of the presidential office for four years and eight months.
Ivanov caught the post in December 2011.
Previously, he served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and previously, like Putin, worked for the State Security Committee (KGB).
In the late 1990s, when Putin commanded the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov one of his five closest collaborators.
At the time, it was even speculated that Ivanov could become Putin’s successor in the state after his second term, because the third period would be unconstitutional for Putin.
This post, however, was taken over by another close Putin collaborator Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister just three and a half years later before returning to the presidential office.
Thomas Gibson, the star of the series The Thoughts of a Criminal, was released after hitting the director
Gibson got involved in a physical exchange of views on stage last month in Los Angeles.
TV stations ABC and CBS, which produce the series, announced its release in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologised on Thursday before announcing his expulsion.
There have been creative differences on the scene and disagreements.
I'm sorry it happened," he said in a statement.
According to a statement from ABC and CBS, details about how Gibson's character disappears from the series, which follows the stories of the FBI's team of agents, a little later.
The forty-year-old actor, who starred in the sitcom Dharma and Greg, has appeared in the series since the first series in 2005.
“I love the thoughts of the criminals and over the past twelve years I have put my heart and soul into them,” Gibson said in a statement.
I was hoping I'd be in it all the time, but that's not going to be possible now.
I would also like to express my thanks to the authors, producers, actors, our amazing team and above all the great fans that this show could have hoped for.
The return of the series to the twelfth series is expected on September 28.
In the city of Banff mysteriously landed in the garden of fish
A man from the town of Banff asked for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden.
Kevin Bain believes that 75 pieces of fish can be sand dunes that left a waterfall there.
Bain, who lives about 500 meters from the sea, published a short film of his findings on the Periscope channel, believing that someone could help explain how about 5 centimeters of fish got into his garden.
Queensferry Crossing: Most now connects with Fife
<0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion project to be completed by May 2017
Engineers have connected the northern platform to Queensferry Crossing and the viaduct – the bridge now connects with Fife.
This is the first of four closures among the “platforms” that are now almost completed around each of the three pillars of the bridge.
The part of the bridge from Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It contains 10,000 tons of iron and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 hanging ropes.
The <0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017.
Economic Secretary Keith Brown visited the building today and was among the first to come from the mainland to the bridge.
He said: “This is a historic moment and a symbolic moment of building the Queensferry Crossing.
On this project, we are all witnesses of how construction engineers have used more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel to build this part of the bridge on an impressive scale.
Despite the massive dimensions and weight of the bridge, the closure between the viaduct and the bridge platform was a delicate operation that required extraordinary precision.
There is now a total of more than 79% of the total area of the bridge, the concrete for the last part of the platform is now pouring into Rosyth, so the entire platform is ready to lift to the bridge.
Michael Martin, project manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: “The first closure of each bridge is always an important milestone.
On this amazing project, this closure represents the pinnacle of land construction.
After installing the last part of the road platform and connecting it to the North Tower expansion platform, we had to close the last gap on the north side - towards the mainland.
We did this by stretching the northern approximate viaduct 700 millimeters south.
This was a massive and at the same time very delicate operation.
Massive because the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be stretched with an ascent of about 3%.
Delicate because the tolerances with which the team worked were very small - only a few millimeters in each direction.
Luckily, everything went very well.
Rescue in Moelfre Bay: Three men are "happy to be alive"
Three men are "happy to be alive" after they are washed away by water from their fishing boat at Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI lifeboat station declared an alarm on Friday at 13:20 British Summer Time after the crew saw the incident in Moelfre Bay.
All three men were trying to get into safety as their boat continued uncontrollably.
“We saw their boat circulating around them and we thought the worst,” said Moelfre lifeboat pilot Vince Jones.
"Fortunately, a strong wind drove him away from them before we left," he added.
Two men were rescued by a local fishing boat, and a third man, aged 60, was found without a life jacket exhausted as the fights were held.
All were handed over to the shore rescue boat and taken back to the rescue boat station.
Jones said, “Three men thrown into the water are happy to be alive and completely uninjured.
The boat's engine had a rope for emergency shutdown, but somehow it was disconnected from the person who was driving the boat when the overturn occurred.
Someone above those guys was holding a protective hand.
The judge refuses to settle the case because of Tluchor's wife.
Petr Tlucho<0xC5><0x99> is one of three MPs who were accused of receiving political traffic from Prime Minister Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as and his then cabinet chiefs Janna Nagy, i.e. a lucrative post for a political resignation.
In 2012, it was the approval of the tax package.
<0xC5><0xA0>najdr, Fuks and Tlucho<0xC5><0x99> allowed him to resign.
Then they appeared on influential posts in state firms.
That is why they also faced suspicions of bribery and ended up in prison for a month.
According to the court, however, it was unjustified, and they received a total compensation of almost 2 million kroner.
The deaf man now appears in the case as a witness, after the intervention of the Supreme Court.
His wife works in a courthouse on the Fruit Market and settles civil disputes.
Nevertheless, Judge Helena Kr<0xC3><0xA1>lov<0xC3><0xA1> wants to be cautious (resolves criminal matters - pozn. ed.) and avoid possible objections.
The case is likely to be handled by another district court in Prague.
The king has twice acquitted Jan Ne<0xC4><0x8D>asov<0xC3><0xA1>, formerly Nagyov<0xC3><0xA1>.
It was an alleged misuse of military intelligence to monitor Prime Minister Ne<0xC4><0x8D>ase Radka's first wife.
In this case, the clown did not figure.
According to lawyer Jaroslav Ortman, however, this is an unnecessary overreaction.
I think that impartiality cannot be interpreted in such a way as to exclude the court if the witnesses have a wife or relatives in court.
I'm afraid then that nothing could be judged at all, he noted for the diary.
"I think it's delicious," he added.
In the case of political traffic, Roman Bo<0xC4><0x8D>ek, a former official, is also accused.
According to his lawyer Peter Toman, however, any objection would have a chance of success.
On June 13, the District Court for Prague 1 discussed the charges of former head of the cabinet of Prime Minister Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as Jana Nagyov<0xC3><0xA1> (now Ne<0xC4><0x8D>asov<0xC3><0xA1>) and others accused of misuse of military intelligence.
In the picture, Timeless comes to court with her husband.
Tlucho<0xC5><0x99>ov<0xC3><0xA1> was supposed to deal with Peroutk's statements.
For example, the ambassador’s wife was to judge President Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Zeman’s statements about the democratic pre-war journalist Ferdinand Peroutt.
Zeman said he sympathized with Adolf Hitler.
One of the students is already dead!
Apparently, the girl was killed in an airstrike by the Allied forces.
She flew to Syria with her two equally old girlfriends from London’s Gatwick Airport in February last year.
The British Interior Ministry did not comment on the report of her death.
According to police, the young Londoners who escaped from their home were secretly transferred to Syria across the Turkish border.
Shamima Begum, Amira Abase and Kadiz Sultana were reportedly targeted for their next former classmate from London’s Bethnal Green Academy.
The case last year sparked a huge wave of attention and also tensions in the relations between Britain and Turkey.
British security officials estimate that some 600 British Muslims have left for Syria so far, including about 50 young women and girls.
Many of them joined radicals from IS and other groups.
Those who return home pose a terrorist threat to the United Kingdom.
A dream job for a hundred thousand dollars.
A well-paid job that you don’t even need a college.
That's what it looks like at first glance.
And often to the other.
The advantage is not only for the Czech ratios extremely high salary (in Prague you will earn up to CZK 180,000 for work in IT), but also extreme benefits.
The reason is a huge shortage of IT specialists.
Thousands of specialists are missing.
It is estimated that almost 20,000 IT specialists are missing in the Czech Republic.
According to the statistics of the Grafton staff agency, the most sought-after include programmers, developers, network engineers and application specialists.
Candidates can choose from a number of job offers.
It does not support candidates for a job position, but jobs for candidates, comments Jitka Sou<0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1>, marketing manager Grafton Recruitment.
College is not a necessity.
Higher education is not a necessity for young people.
Higher education means a good foundation and is an overall indicator of the candidate’s intelligence and educational ability, but often has little in common with knowledge of development.
Developers need to constantly learn new things, which once a graduate college will not replace, says Petr Kuba<0xC4><0x8D>ka, director of Monster Career CZ.
He will make the most money in Prague.
The salaries of the Aztecs are everywhere moving high above the republican average.
The most money will come in Prague and Brno, in the regions it is not such a hitparade anymore.
"The wage conditions in Brno are comparable to those in Prague," Kuba<0xC4><0x8D>ka confirms.
The highest earnings will be achieved by the Technical Directors.
In Prague and Brno you can come to 120,000 - 180,000 CZK.
In other regions, the salary is lower, but it will not fall below CZK 80,000.
IT project managers are also in demand.
At the start they can earn 60,000 - 100,000 CZK.
It's also about graduates.
While in some professions, graduates often have to go straight to the office of work, this does not apply to autistics.
In fact, if companies pull over and overpay an expert from another company, they would like to reach for a graduate.
They can raise it according to their own.
Without language, they won't go away.
The knowledge of a foreign language is suitable in every profession, but at least decent English is necessary for the Aisha.
Knowledge of at least one foreign language is a necessity for some IT positions.
On the other hand, there are a lot of cases where companies are looking for a particularly professionally trained and experienced person and are satisfied only with the average knowledge of English.
However, if, for example, a support worker is fluent in more foreign languages, it is interesting for his employer because he can serve more customers from different countries, adds the Director of Kuba<0xC4><0x8D>ka.
Good on google, there's paradise.
The Czech workers can only be silently jealous of the employees at Google.
Of course, for them, flexible working hours, the possibility of working from home or various shorter periods, not only for mothers.
“The company is giving newly baked fathers an extra four-week leave after the birth of the baby,” says Martina Jonekov<0xC3><0xA1>, a Google spokeswoman.
Health care for employees and family, catering, transport, training, wellness or massages directly at the workplace are also included.
Anyone who wants to learn is green and doesn’t care what they want to learn.
But that doesn't end the benefits.
Such a full free fridge is definitely not to be missed either.
A healthy lunch (in some locations as well as breakfast and dinner) is available on site every day.
In addition, in all offices there are so-called micro-kitchens, where people always find a healthy snack, the spokesperson reveals.
And so that nothing needs to be thrown away, so that it does not fit, it can be placed in boxes that employees can take home in the evening.
And the reason for these unbelievable benefits to Czech relations?
Create a creative and motivating environment!
“For Google, it’s not important for employees to sit in the office for eight hours a day, but the results of initiatives or projects, shifts or developments, ideas and innovative solutions.”
The U.N. strongly criticised Bulgaria for criminalizing refugees.
U.N. human rights commissioner Zeid Ra’ad al-Hussein on Thursday accused Bulgaria of systematically violating human rights by criminalizing refugees.
The Bulgarian government's official strategy "raises serious concerns about Bulgaria's non-compliance with international law," Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein said in a statement.
"It is particularly disturbing to be witnessing how important and influential public figures publicly express support for the criminal armed militants who are plotting to hunt refugees on the border between Bulgaria and Turkey," he said.
"One of the most serious problems is that almost all people who enter the Bulgarian territory irregularly are automatically arrested," Zeid said.
And worse, they are often prosecuted and imprisoned for a year or more if they try to leave the country.
Their attempts to leave the country are criminalized despite the fact that under international law everyone has the right to leave any country, including his own.
Bulgaria detained 14,000 migrants this year, 21,000 in the same period last year.
Pokémon Go - a quest for health and happiness that pays off
It’s fascinating to watch the world change.
Over the past decade, many people have lamented that teenagers and children no longer play outside and prefer to spend their free time in front of screens.
Pokémon Go lifts people off the couch and leads them to activity.
The time spent in front of screens was initially spent on television, later on video games, and most recently on smartphones.
It is great to see that technologies and activities outside are not mutually exclusive.
I’m talking, of course, about the fashion that is Pokémon Go, a character-based app that first appeared in video games in the late 1990s (later a cartoon, playing cards, and more).
As with many cultural phenomena, there has been a decline in interest ahead of the launch of this new game in early July in the US, Australia and New Zealand.
The listing in other countries was then postponed due to the huge interest that led to the overloading of the servers.
Pokémon Go has gained more users in a few days than Tinder and almost as many users as Twitter has.
How does it work?
In short, players on a smartphone go out to look for Pokémon that they track using GPS, and when they find them, they can “photo” them (via a screenshot on the phone) or “picture”.
M<0xC3><0xA1>nie embraces the generation that played the game at a younger age, lifts her from her seats, and makes women look out for Pokémon.
In the United States, thanks to this game, there has been a significant increase in the number of steps that the “average” person will take every day.
Apple’s Smart Watch Cardiogram app, which monitors 35,000 users, recently reported to the Washington Post that within two days of the game’s launch, the number of people who exercised every day for 30 minutes jumped from 45 to 53 percent.
The company has no information about who is playing Pokémon Go - it only sees rough data about exercise levels.
Many public campaigns aimed at “finding 30,” “getting out of the couch,” and “being active every day” fell to unsettling ground because most public health messages are boring and intended for people who don’t look good.
However, the importance of exercise should not be underestimated.
Those who exercise on a regular basis reduce the risk of cancer or depression.
Physical activity is involved in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes, and a long list of benefits that we can’t list here.
But the beauty of Pokémon Go is that people go out and do something that amuses them.
You cover three pillars of health -- movement, fresh air, and sunshine -- and fun.
Some people even make new friends when chasing Pokémon.
As it is, of course, there are also such boring patrons who are looking for any excuse to be able to complain.
And yes, someone can enter the door.
What, like?
It was a breakthrough.
At the time, smartphone apps like Fitbit were able to track our activity, but they gave us no reason to do something like this game.
The news is ticking and interest in it will start to drop at some point.
However, thanks to the success of Pokémon, there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with real-world activity and help a lot of people hunt for activity, health, and better form.

Simone Biles won gold in women's multi-fighting gymnastics
Forget the pressure.
Forget the excitement.
Simone Biles is immune to all this.
Dynamic on the jump.
No effort at the stake.
All of them were free-spirited.
Excellent in everything.
And now, finally, the Olympic champion.
The nineteen-year-old American gymnast went straight for the title in multicolor on Thursday and outperformed the others in full line under Olympic spotlights.
A total score of 62,198 was clearly confirmed by her lead in front of silver medalist and a member of the "final five" team Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliyya Mustafin.
Simone Bilesov<0xC3><0xA1> (USA) on Thursday during a performance on the hammer in the multiplayer final of individuals in sports gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Biles became the fourth American in a row to win a multi-fight, and the fifth overall, when she confirmed her reputation as the best gymnast of her generation and perhaps the best ever.
When her overall final score was on the board and her long journey to this point was over, tears appeared on her face.
This success ranks her in the same league of individual athletes of her time as Michael Phelps, who added a new dimension to their sport:
Biles has dominated her sport for the last three years, winning 15 medals at the World Championships - including 10 golds. Her stunning compositions are a mixture of ambition and precision and the 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton named her "the best gymnast, vi gymnast."
The last test was in Brazil, not so much between Biles and the rest of the racers, but between her and the burden of too great expectations.
Anything other than returning home to his family in Spring, Texas with a handful of gold medals would be seen as a disappointment.
Simone Bilesov<0xC3><0xA1> (USA), left, and Aly Raisman are embracing themselves after winning the gold and silver medal in the women’s multiplayer final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
The first Biles won on Tuesday, when she was as a cheerleader in the party leaving national team coordinator Martha Karolyi.
Biles insists that she never looked forward during her long journey to the top, which is not entirely true.
Part of her composition in the open – the one that contains her typical triple jump with a double turn – is set in Latin music that would just fit home, into the streets outside the Olympic arena in Rio.
It's no coincidence.
The girl was adopted by her grandparents as a toddler and her talent was discovered by the mother of coach Aimee Boorman on her way to the gym, where Boorman trained and gained strength.
The multiplayer competition has not lost since the summer of 2013 - it is a trail of victory that can continue as long as Biles wants.
Although Mustafin took the lead for a short time thanks to two turns, it was just an illusion.
Bet and free - where Bilesov<0xC3><0xA1> defends the world championship - are waiting.
She got back in the lead with 15.433 points for the hammer – and ended up with 15.933 points in the free.
Raisman gently hugged her as they waited for the final score - a mere formality - and around the shiny red, white and blue shadows, tears appeared when the wish that she had once written in the diary as a child was fulfilled.
Raisman's performance was a bit of a payback for the Olympics four years ago, when she was split by a third inning with Mustafin, but at the time she had bronze due to the sum of the three best teams.
This time, the 20-year-old captain of the team, who the Americans call “grandmother,” was quite ahead.
After her free time she sent a crowd of air kisses, overwhelmed with a return that sometimes seemed uncertain.
For Biles, the post that this nineteen-year-old athlete posted this week on Twitter, where it became a complete hit, has a whole new meaning:
Police: Three victims in serial killer's case shot while listening to music in car
According to a police report released on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl died during the most serious attack in decades, in the case of the first serial killer in Phoenix. They were shot while sitting in a car, talking and listening to music.
Authorities announced that Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and daughter Ellis Maleah were shot dead on June 12 in a car parked on the driveway.
The report states that the gunman stood on the side of the passenger and fired eight wounds from the handgun and then fled in another vehicle.
Police say the robbery is not a triple murder, because the assailant did not take the wallets, nor the amount of $2,900 that one of the adult victims had with him.
A Phoenix police spokesman, Sergeant Jonathan Howard, said investigators were investigating whether the shooting had anything to do with any of the previous four attacks.
In two predominantly Spanish neighbourhoods, there were a total of nine attacks over the course of four months, killing seven people and injuring two others.
“It’s happening in the suburbs in front of the houses,” Howard told CBS’s KPHO branch earlier this month.
Police believe the suspect was using several cars, including a brown Nissan from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s, and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Investigators refused to disclose what evidence led them to conclude that the attacks were interrelated and were carried out by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was taken to the hospital, where she was later injured.
Liner (31) and daughter Ellis Maleah died on the spot.
A witness told police it was not unusual for women to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
The authorities also published a police report on the shooting, which targeted an empty delivery just half an hour before the triple murder, and the police believe that its origin was this serial killer.
Investigators found bullets and bullets in the seat and under the hood of the engine.
Mother of six-year-old child with microcephaly: "His condition is improving"
Edmund Picciuto, like most children of his age, loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But unlike his peers, he suffers from microcephaly, which is a result of a genetic disorder his mother, Elizabeth Picciut, did not know about during pregnancy.
When he first came home, I was the first to think I couldn't handle this.
I can't handle this.
I'm not ready for this.
Which is not true at all—of course you’re ready for it,” she said.
She and her husband Vincent learn that Edmund may never recognize them and that he may not even survive.
Some doctors have even suggested that he be placed in the institute.
“My first reaction was that I thought people weren’t doing this anymore,” Picciut said.
Edmund walks with the help of a walker.
He couldn't sit or crawl until he was three, and he still doesn't speak.
However, some of the boundaries are slowly being filled.
He walks with help and rides a bike.
He also loves to play with his two brothers and loves to sing.
Elizabeth performs a sign speech in which Edmund says, “Please sing to me.”
“We’re teaching him sign language,” Picciut told CBS News.
But it's not a common character speech - it says that Edmund invented some of the characters himself.
Microcephaly can arise from a number of different conditions: genetic, as in the case of Edmund, and after infections in pregnancy caused by viruses such as measles or Zika.
Symptoms and prognosis may vary significantly.
It’s too early to say what impact Zika will have on the lives of the infected.
Picciutta recalls the emotional tax she chooses for an uncertain future.
I keep asking, “What happens next?”
What's next?
And she's still not sure.
In fact, I never asked myself what the overall prognosis was, because I don’t expect anyone to be able to tell me.
But Picciutova has an encouraging message for the mothers of all children who suffer from congenital defects caused by the Zika virus.
The situation's getting better.
Know that it will be better.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Heavy Rains and Floods Require Rescue Jobs in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rains and heavy flooding in Louisiana prompted the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday, with further rains expected in the state on Saturday.
The National Meteorological Service (NWS) has reported that after the extreme pourings, a number of rivers in southeastern Louisiana and southern Mississippi are draining from their shores and threatening massive flooding.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said state officials are in continuous contact with local authorities and assistance is already on the way to the affected areas.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Office of the Governor of National Security and Emergency Preparedness, said they were receiving requests for water-driving vehicles, boats and sandbags.
Steele said only Tangipaho County had asked for ten thousand bags of sand.
The flood guards will remain in most of southern Louisiana to work until Saturday.
The Meteorological Service said in a statement that about 8 to 13 centimetres more could rain over the sea.
In southern Alabama, a flood guard was on standby on Friday, as rain continued in the area of the city of Mobile.
The Comite River at Baton Rouge and the Amite River at Denham Springs are expected to culminate on the weekend.
Meteorologist Alek Krautmann said the two said they could flood a number of homes in the suburbs of Baton Rouge.
He further stated that floods in Ascension County are a danger, when these diverted streams will only slowly pour into Lake Maurepas.
The Tickfaw River, just south of the Mississippi border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached its highest level on Friday morning at 9 a.m. local time.
Rescuers are still picking up people from the tidal waters of Amite and Wilkinson County in southwestern Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and son-in-law were among the survivors at Gloster on Friday.
Hansford (62) said that the water from Beaver Creek, which is normally more than 120 meters from his house, increased rapidly overnight.
He said that he was warned by his other stepdaughter, who lives nearby.
"We woke up and the water was approaching," said Hansford.
We had her up to the waist.
According to his wife, it is the highest level she has ever experienced on the river in the last 48 years.
Hansford said that he and all members of his family are disabled and he is the only one who can swim.
Hansford said crisis workers had rescued all three huge military-style trucks and transported them to a fire station in Gloster, where they remained covered up on Friday.
Krautmann said that as heavy rains continue, the floods are "spreading rapidly" and the authorities are considering evacuation.
According to Krautmann, an observer near Livinston reported that 35 centimetres of rain fell between midnight and Friday morning.
Krautmann said the soil has been heavily soaked since Wednesday.
Authorities said heavy rain and paid travel had demanded the rescue of residents from their homes in Tangipaho County and the cancellation of education in five school districts.
The WWL branch of CBS reported that 200 homes were flooded, according to the Tangipaho elder.
The residents were evacuated to two churches, but both are now flooded.
Mayor Robby Miller said the authorities had rescued 72 people and seven domestic animals that were trapped in the high water, according to the report.
In the village of Amite and in the town of Hammond shelters were established for those who were evacuated.
"They'll be able to come home when the water starts to rain," he said.
In Tangipahoa County, Hammond, more than 20 streets were closed due to flooding, and locals were provided with sandbags that they could pick up and try to protect their homes and businesses from water.
"We had the last major flooding here in March," said the city manager Lacy Landrum.
These floods seem to be similar.
Rupert Lacy, a crisis manager in Harrison County, Mississippi, said heavy rains continue on the coast of the Persian Gulf.
He said a couple of homes were reported flooding on Thursday, but none of them appeared in the report on Friday.
Keith Townson, head of Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has been living in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in several places where I've never seen it before," Townson said, "and it's still there."
Mahaj Brown (6) - "Boy Shot as a Solution" Survived Shooting in Philadelphia
According to police, a six-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia this week, the second shooting of a six-year-old boy in the city.
The child's grandparents identified him as Mahaja Brown for CBS Philadelphia.
Grandparents say the boy had suffered several gunshot wounds, including a weak leg, legs, arms and abdomen, but was aware of it when he was transported to the hospital.
"He took it terribly, his little body was shot as it were," his grandmother, Delores Melendez, told the station.
I can't believe it.
The boy is in critical condition in the hospital and has undergone several surgeries.
The family told the station that the boy should recover.
He was supposed to be in the first grade of elementary school.
Mahaj Brown is among the four people who were shot in part of Germantown.
Three other men were shot: two at the age of 29 and one at the age of 32.
One of the men at the age of 29 is in critical condition, according to CBS Philadelphia, two more victims are in a stabilized state.
According to the station, the child was found shot in the front seat of the vehicle along with a 29-year-old man in critical condition.
The other two victims were not in the car, and police are investigating whether any of the injured men could have been a gunman.
Investigators at the CBS Philadelphia station said there was likely a sniper between several armed men.
At the site, ammunition was found from attack weapons of the type of attack, belonging to various attack weapons.
It seems to have been a continuation of the battle.
There were ammunition in the street on both sides of the hallway.
So it seems that there were several armed combatants who were actively involved," Philadelphia Police Captain Anthony Ginaldi told the station.
Several homes and vehicles in the area were also affected.
No one has been arrested and police are reportedly investigating video footage from the cameras.
Another six-year-old child, this time a girl, was shot in the arm by a stray gun on Tuesday in front of a house in the West Oak Lane neighborhood.
The girl recovers and the police are still looking for the suspect.
Why We Need Simone, Gabby, and Laurie
That’s how I imagine the women’s gymnasts team for this year’s Olympics, for a number of reasons.
First, I’ve been at every Summer Olympics since 1984 and the United States has never been so dominant.
And secondly, there are three gymnasts in this team, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who inspired so many young colored girls.
Everyone is proud of the composition of this team, which is complemented by Aly Raisman, who is of Jewish origin, and Catholic Madison Kocian.
We finally have a team that looks like America.
He also confirmed the presence of blacks and Latinos at the top of the sport.
The number one high school student in the last four years was an African-American.
Simone and Gabby were in the first and second row last year.
That means something.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Dougals surprisingly became the Olympic champion and America cheered.
Now the world could witness the incredible performance of three-time world champion Simone Biles, Douglas, and Laurie Hernandez, who performed unexpected but masterful gymnastics figures.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American to win gold in the women's multi-fighting singles.
And team member Aly Raisman won the silver.
We're witnessing a sporting peak, but in gymnastics classes in the country, it doesn't look like that.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie were on the same path as Aly and Madison.
They are the “final five” because the gymnasts team for the next Olympics will consist of only four athletes, and this is the last year Marta Karoliyova is training.
The reality is, however, that gymnastics is a financially demanding sport and gymnasts train mainly in private gymnastics clubs, which keep parents who pay for training costs, equipment, trips, jerseys, fees for competitions, hotel accommodation (for trainers and their trust).
Most of these sports clubs are in affluent suburban areas that can support activities.
In these clubs, gymnasts have all trainings and for families of gymnasts and gymnasts it is an expensive and long-term commitment.
Aimee Boorman, coach Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach Laurie Hernandez, both trained athletes at the time they started gymnastics.
It is our duty to bring gymnastics trainings that are more accessible and accessible to the communities of countless young girls who have inspired Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I founded the Gymnastics Foundation 20 years ago.
In my organizations where we offer free or low-cost gymnastics in Harlem to more than 15,000 young people within the city (mainly black and Hispanic) and we have trained national and international champions.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) where we will provide high-quality gymnastics to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination of the body and hard work, discipline and determination of the mind.
This combination means life-long benefits for good health, achievements in school and at work.
It is the inspiration of this team that will send thousands of young girls to us who will want to do gymnastics. And that is great.
Participation in this sport is very important, especially for girls.
It's a very exciting time.
Thank you, Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison, for proving your "girl power" and winning the Olympic team gold. And thank you for motivating so many young girls of all backgrounds to become singers and songwriters who are healthy and strong.
After the rejection of Jeremy Hunt's proposal, young doctors are ready to take on further strikes
Ministers hoped that after a revised contract was concluded with representatives of the British Medical Association (BMA) there would be an end to disagreements about the changes. But 58 percent of the 37,000 young doctors who participated in the election rejected the contract.
In July, Hunt revealed plans to enforce a contract with the NHS being in “nobody’s country” and further delays would have a detrimental impact on employees and patients.
The first young doctors have already signed a new contract, which includes changes in night and weekend work practices to improve care in non-social hours.
Dr Ellen McCourt, Chair of the BMA Commission for Young Physicians, said in a statement last night: “Young doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, especially in the sense that there will be an increase in the current crisis and the workforce.”
Just eight weeks before the first group of doctors goes under a new contract, it is necessary to make progress and time passes.
The BMA’s efforts to resolve disputes through negotiations met with a reluctance to engage the doctor and often with a deafening silence from the government.
And that's despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month that this option is still open.
"Jeremy Hunt now has to act, push for coercion and address the concerns of young doctors."
If this does not happen, then young doctors are ready to take further steps.
During the last strike at the end of April, nearly 13,000 routine surgeries and 100,000 visits were postponed as nurses and specialists were called to represent the doctors who were among the protesters.
The ministers hoped that after the conclusion of the revised agreement with the representatives of the British Medical Association (BMA), disagreements about the changes would be concluded.
The BMA wants higher pay for weekend work for 54,000 young doctors who would be the subject of a contract.
Daniel Mortimer, chairman of the NHS's employers, called on young doctors not to go on strike.
Mortimer said, “The field action will achieve little or nothing, but there will be pressure on already overloaded teams and services and an increase in anxiety, exhaustion and disruption for patients, nursing staff and their families.”
Over the past two months, we have been negotiating with the Council of Young Physicians and, together with the Ministry of Health and others, we have responded positively to their concerns about the role of supervision and informant.
Employers hoped that continuing positive engagement in other important issues - such as stress, flexibility in training, further training for those who return after a career break, the costs of training, the mutual recognition of these subjects, the health minister would be able to do both, the study leave and the difference in wages.
The drug for sixty crowns a day can reduce the risk of a heart attack
Thousands of patients at risk of heart attack will be able to take the drug, which in turn costs about sixty crowns (two pounds). The authorities recommend to give it to more patients for a longer time.
Ticagrelor reduces the risk of recurrence of an attack in people with heart disease.
The drug is now given after a heart attack for 12 months to reduce the risk of a stroke or other attack.
NHS watchdog NICE recommends that the drug be given to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Now, however, NHS watchdog NICE recommends that it be administered to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
In England, about 140,000 people suffer a heart attack each year, and a quarter of them are affected by another heart attack or heart attack.
A heart attack and stroke are caused by the accumulation of fat, which forms a coherent layer on the walls of the arteries.
If this layer is torn apart, blood clots, blockage of blood access to the heart, and a heart attack may occur.
If the clot is released, it can continue through the bloodstream, block the blood supply to the brain, and cause cerebral palsy.
People who have already had a heart attack are at a higher risk of another attack.
Ticagrelor, which is produced by the British company AstraZeneca and is sold under the trade name Brilique, reduces the risk of collapsing by being less likely to occur.
In the draft NICE Directive, which was published today, it is recommended that patients receive 90 mg ticagrelor for 12 months and then 60 mg with aspirin twice daily for an additional three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Center for Health Technology Assessment, said: "Despite the availability of effective secondary preventive treatment, there are a quarter of patients who have had a heart attack and who will be affected by another heart attack or stroke - often with devastating consequences."
Fear of repetition can have a significant negative impact on the quality of life of the patient.
Ticagrelor in combination with aspirin has been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
We are pleased that with the preliminary recommendation of Ticagrelor, we can extend the treatment options available to many thousands of people who will be able to benefit from it.
Because the information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited over three years, treatment over this period is not recommended in the proposal.
With computer culture began to thrive fraud in Muslim areas
Tower Hamlets mayor Lutfur Rahman was fired last year due to corruption, which was linked to a government report.
A culture of political correctness has led to the disregard of widespread fraud in Muslim communities, the government said in a report.
Ex-Minister Sir Eric Pickles vehemently criticizes the police, election inspectors and council for ignoring the abuse of voters because of "sensitivity to ethnicity and religion."
A former community secretary, now the ruler of anti-corruption interventions, said the intimidation of voters on the basis of their religion is so bad that police should make strings in front of the polling stations and protect the oppressed voters.
He recommended that voters take their identity card with them and be able to prove who they are in the election.
At the moment, it is enough for voters to state their name and address.
The report also proposes that people’s fingers should be inked with indelible ink when they give their voice, in order to prevent someone from voting twice.
Whistleblowers should have greater protection, Pickles says.
It requests that the press gain greater access to documents from the meeting and to decisions taken by the informal committees or working groups.
“It’s not just about protecting against election fraud, but also protecting the local government from the broader corrupt environment and financial fraud that goes hand in hand,” he said.
The report was requested by Downing Street as a result of an election scandal in Tower Hamlets, West London.
Last year, the Special Electoral Court ruled that the mayor of Lutfur Rahman should be dismissed from his post after being charged with corruption and illegal practices.
The court found that Rahman had "cynicically interfered" with the religious sentiments of his Muslim community and silenced his criticisms with accusations of racism and Islamophobia.
In his words, Rahman “led his campaign in such a way that it was the religious duty of devoted Muslims to vote for him.”
Up to 300 votes have been questioned, or as a result of identity theft, when a person votes and makes a statement about someone else.
Sir Eric said there is evidence of fraud all over the country.
He expressed particular concern over the fraud in the correspondence vote — which is claimed to have been pressured by senior members of the Muslim community during the course of his tenure by people to vote for the candidate they voted for.
Sir Eric, on the photo, gave several recommendations on how to clean up the electoral system, including filing an identity card.
The report states: "Evidence has been presented that vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, have been under pressure to vote according to the will of the elders, especially in the communities of the P<0xC3><0xA1>k<0xC3><0xA1> people."
“There have been concerns that ... state institutions have been closing their eyes to such behavior because of the ‘politically correct’ hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion.”
Sir Eric put forward 50 recommendations on how to clean up the system, including prohibiting political activists from manipulating the correspondence vote and thus preventing "voting harassment."
The report, which is now being evaluated by Theresa May, also calls for more thorough checks on registrations to prevent the use of voter lists for immigration fraud and tax fraud.
Consider the possibility of asking voters to submit a proof of identity before the vote.
Use indelible ink on people’s fingers when voting to prevent someone from voting twice.
Conducting systematic checks on the nationality of persons to ensure that they can vote.
Requests for automatic correspondence voting shall be limited to three years.
Prohibit political agitators and activists from manipulating with submitted correspondence votes and electoral envelopes.
Give the police permission to create a cordon around the polling stations.
Change the laws to make it easier to prosecute persons developing illegal pressure under the 1983 Reform Act.
Disable taking photos in the polling stations.
Require that only Englishmen (with the exception of Wales) work in the polling stations.
Strengthen training and ensure that employees follow the rule that voters go to the polling booths individually.
Sir Eric criticizes London police and says it is "surprising" that no criminal charges have been brought after the Tower Hamlets case.
“The Electoral Court has ruled out Lutfur Rahman and his agent for litany of corruption and illegal practices,” he said.
For a number of reasons, he was found guilty beyond reasonable doubt – in the strength of evidence of a criminal offence.
He also criticizes the unsuccessful "checking of checkboxes" in the departments for registration of voters in the town hall.
Sir Eric said: “Last year’s court decision in the Tower Hamlets case by waking up.
Our nation has a proud reference to parliamentary democracy, but the disturbing and covert spread of electoral fraud and the state of denial by some authorities threaten this reputation.
The Madness of Cycling Double Duchess Kate and Other Celebrity Doubles at the Rio Olympics
Fans of the 2016 Rio Olympics this week went mad at the French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who is strikingly similar to the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the twenty-four-year-old Olympian is by no means the only athlete to seek gold this year, who can boast his own double from the ranks of celebrities - at least not according to social media.
To celebrate the Olympic Games in Rio and all the celebrities who are currently appearing on our screens, the Women’s Column FEMAIL has compiled a list of Olympians who are more than remotely similar to Hollywood celebrities.
Like a hunted animal: A member of the American archer team Brady Ellison (left) has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since childhood
In addition to the twin Kate on the bike path, a number of people online quickly pointed out that a certain archer could be the twin of the star Leonardo DiCapria.
Brady Ellison, a racer from the American archer team, caused a storm on Twitter after his footage, which is strikingly similar to a Wall Street wolf, emerged.
Brady himself noticed the media insanity and admitted that he had heard of his resemblance to Lee since he was a child.
"I don't see much resemblance to myself, except for the beards," Brady told the Huffington Post.
"He's a freak and he looks good, so I think it's a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons from London 2012 will undoubtedly be highlighted even more this year: the striking image between British distance jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
The Russian gymnast Aliye Mustafin with her big, prominent eyes was said to be a copy of Cuban-American singer Glorie Estefan.
And when we look at the swimming pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to Gell series star Matthew Morrison for several years.
And for the change: User thinks that Nathan has an "athletic version" of the actor from the movie The Beginning (Inception)
Another long-standing comparison is the comparison of tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who have similarly dense eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver swimmer Yulia Efimov not only boasts the same brown skin and blonde hair as Annalynne McCord. And about Nathan Adrian from the U.S. team, fans say she looks like "the athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitt."
Adorable women: football star Hope Solov<0xC3><0xA1> (left) and actress Dexter Jennifer Carpenter (right) have similar face and eye shape
Not just one: The Twitter user was very pleased that others noticed the similarities
On Waves Theory: According to this user, there may be a reason for similar appearance of pairs
A Twitter user recently expressed her satisfaction with the fact that “the rest of the Internet thinks Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical.”
Football star Hope Solo and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter have an incredibly similar shape to their faces and eyes.
Among other popular comparisons is Union's Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to actress Laura Linney's smile, or the holder of the gold medal for gymnastics Gabby Douglas, proud of her girvody girvoz<0xC3><0xB3>w<0xC3><0xB3>w<0xC3><0xB3>w<0xC3><0xB3>w<0xC3><0xB3>w<0xC3><0xB3>w<0xC3><0xB3>w<0xC3><0xB3>w<0xC3><0xB3>w<0xC3><0xB3>w<0xC3><0xB3>w<0xC3><0xB3>w<0xC3><0xB3>w!
CBC Olympic commentator apologised for saying about Chinese swimmer that she "exploded"
Watchers of Wednesday’s live stream of the Olympic Games at CBC station were shocked by the performance analysis of fourteen-year-old Ai Yanhan commentator Byron MacDonald. The swimmer finished in fourth place in the women’s race at 4x200 m freestyle relays
Canadian station CBC was forced to apologize after one of its commentators said that a fourteen-year-old Chinese swimmer “drawn like an odor” and “exploded” during the race.
Commentator Byron MacDonald thought his microphone had been turned off when at the end of the women's 4x200-meter relay final he began to shake his own opinions.
MacDonald, who was supposed to bring “resurrection” to the CBC commentator team, said, “That little 14-year-old from China gave up, you crazy.”
Excessive excitement, she stretched like an odor, exploded.
Thank you.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan (14) swam the second relay of the race in 1:57.79 – 1.61 seconds slower than Canadian Taylor Ruck, allowing Canadians to reach China.
Viewers in Canada quickly began to ring online and were horrified by the tone and language used by the commentator
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted: “The 14-year-old swimmer from China “exploded” on CBC????
The idiot didn't notice he was still on the show."
Ai Yanhan of China in the final of the women's relay race at the 4x200 meter freestyle was described as: "That little 14-year-old from China gave up, you crazy."
Byron MacDonald's criticism on Twitter came from all sides and many asked for his revocation
When Twitter users found out how insensitive Byron MacDonald is, they didn’t hold back
Another user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: 'Wow <0x23>ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada, and it sounds like we're a gang of racists.
Shortly thereafter, Scott Russell, who hosted the CBC broadcast, apologized for MacDonald's live comment and said, "We apologize for the comment on the performance of the swimmer who escaped the broadcast."
It was an unfortunate choice of words, and we're sorry it happened."
CBC has apologized more than 90 times to people who tweeted in response to a comment.
Commentator Scott Russell Apologizes on behalf of MacDonald
The CBC then copied and apologised to more than 90 Twitter users who complained about comments made by commentator MacDonald.
The station also quickly apologised and issued a statement.
He sincerely regrets that the words were spoken, should not have gotten into the ether.
We quickly apologized to our viewers in the broadcast and to those who are watching us on social networks.
To be clear, Byron's comments were about the performance of the swimmer, not the swimmer herself.
In other words, it was an inappropriate and unfortunate choice of words. Byron deeply apologises for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, Byron MacDonald apologised in a live broadcast and tried to explain his remark by claiming that he did not want it to sound like a personal attack.
"I would now like to apologize for the comment I made last night after the women's relay," he said in an Olympic broadcast on CBC.
“I meant the performance of the swimmer, not the person of the swimmer as such.”
“There’s no need to say I didn’t intend to be disrespectful, and I’m very sorry.”
Customers in Primark outraged by a woman who rudely tried underwear in the middle of a store
When a woman took her clothes off to try out her panties on the sales floor in the middle of Primark, shoppers were not sure which direction to look in.
To make it even worse, she tried to fit her size, took her pants off and put them back on the shelf.
She continued to browse, and finally tried four pairs of pants at a shop in the Bouverie Place shopping mall in Flokestone.
Primark shop at Bouverie Place in Folkestone, where a woman tried her pants before returning them to the shelves
The mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was in the store at the time, said that the mysterious woman “was dressed again and left the store without buying anything.”
She said, "People couldn't believe their own eyes."
She stood in the middle of the store, took her panties off the shelf, put on her own pantyhose and pantyhose and put them on.
"She didn't even try to find any discreet place - she just stood there, stiff as a monkey."
"Everyone was just staring at her pants again, and obviously she didn't like them because she brought them back to the shelves."
She did the same with the three others before finally deciding that she didn’t like anything, dressed again and left.
“She didn’t seem to care who was watching at all – not even thinking about the man who might be buying the pants she tried.”
Ms. Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent, said, "The idea that someone would take home pants that someone else had on and nobody cleaned them.
The event took place on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms. Davidson added, "When she left, I picked up things that she obviously tried to pull out of the sale - which is also the only right thing."
“I’d be scared to think I’d bring home new pants and find out that another woman was wearing them, took them off, and that they weren’t washed.”
A spokesperson for Primark said: “Primark is aware of the incident that occurred at our store in Folkestone on Tuesday, August 9.
All the products concerned were withdrawn from sales.
How to defend against a weapon attack using Krav Maga
The world outside is dangerous, but thanks to this video from Dailymail.com it could be a little safer for you.
We spoke with Rhon Mizrachi, the Grand Master of the Krav Magy Federation based in New York City, to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close range.
This video will show you how to suddenly gain control over the rapist, whether it approaches you from the front or from the back.
If he approaches you from behind, says Mizrachi, then the first thing you need to do is to turn around to see your attacker and “have a free-range shot.”
You then grasp the gun between your forearm and shoulder just before you throw it into your face with a free elbow.
Then he follows the knee to the weak, and while the attacker is in pain, you turn the gun out of his hand, hit his head in the face and start to retreat, while the gun is held towards him.
If an armed man is approaching you from the front, it is a similar technique - get your body out of the fire line, grab the gun and screw it out so the gunman can't shoot.
At the same time, put strength into the weapon and hit the attacker in the chest, then screw the weapon out of its grip and start to retreat, still dying on it.
Does that sound complicated?
Take a look at the video where you can see exactly how Mizrachi does it.
Remember, however, that the safest way to get out of the assault - if you are not the great master of Krav Maga - is to spend all the cash.
Traveler Ian Wright licks Europe's Dirtiest Places in a Travel Guide
A British traveler has decided to undergo a severe test of his immune system and a time-consuming reflex - licking the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.
Moderator and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk, to prove the strength of his immune system, hugged a euro banknote in his language, slammed on the Piccadilly Circus, a button on the toilet in the train and a Russian public telephone.
He used a luminometer to show himself and all of us what he was going to do before he hugged each object.
The experiment, based on which Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was filmed, however, brought interesting results.
The idea of licking the sprinkler button on a train that has been used by thousands of other people may seem completely repulsive, however, there is actually a lot more harmful bacteria in the kitchen sink.
Throughout his trip to Europe, Ian Wright has talked to doctors and health professionals about strengthening gut flora bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, none of what he licked left nothing worse in his mouth than the taste.
Ian Wright was famous for testing the endurance of his guts on trips around the world and eating strange and amazing things.
During this mission, he tested his immune system completely safely – from the public railings at train stations to the sink.
In the film, he says, “I haven’t taken much care of my health since childhood, and I’ve put everything in my mouth, from clay to eating worms and muddy water.”
In the film, he confirmed his reputation for dosing.
The only thing he refused was dirty public toilets in Russia.
After a simple wipe, the luminometer showed a value of more than 4000 units.
For comparison, freshly washed hands should have less than 60.
One public toilet in Russia, however, refused to lick after its luminometer showed more than 4,000 units, while freshly washed hands have less than 60
Ian Wright and the Finnish dairy manufacturer Valio filmed a traveler's film called The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, which shows the number of bacteria in different places, such as the bathroom
In the film, he said, "This is almost the most disgusting thing I've ever felt in the bathroom."
There's nothing dirtyer than this!
I'm not gonna lick anything because it's disgusting here.
Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was filmed in collaboration with the Finnish dairy producer Valio.
The company provided Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria and vitamins C and D, which help to strengthen the gut bacteria and immune system in humans.
Niko Vuorenmaa, Valio’s senior vice president for snacks, juices and new categories, said: “We wanted to offer consumers something really new.
Something that would keep an eye on the intervention and at the same time allow us to explain the benefits of probiotics.
We came up with a lot of crazy ideas that ended up with the idea of "let's call Ian."
It is said that the interest in the health of the intestines becomes a worldwide phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to put them in broader contexts – good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system.
The growing interest in healthy bowel is a worldwide phenomenon and through this document we have brought consumers more detailed information in an interesting way.
I also think that there is a great sense of humor in the film!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, adds, "Let's say this, Ian would lose my respect if he licked something I wanted him to do - such as the nasty Russian toilet that appears in the film."
Swallowing some things was naturally easier for Iana, while others were quite difficult.
I'm glad we've filmed some of those dirty things licking."
In 2015, Valio conducted a survey that found that 84 percent of respondents associated lactic acid bacteria primarily with stomach and intestine health, and 58 percent of respondents said that they at least occasionally take products containing added lactic acid bacteria.
Family of Socially Needed Before Relocating Destroyed a Municipal Building in Saltash, Cornwall
The family of the socially needy left <0xC2><0xA3>50,000 in damages in their communal home after being accused of terrorizing their neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were evicted from a house in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long series of complaints against them.
After their forced removal from the house, the officials of the housing cooperative were shocked to find that the property was in a state of emergency.
There were holes in the walls, the floor covering was smashed, everywhere on the floor was the waste, and the walls were smashed.
The family has already moved and is believed to live in a private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, Cornwall Housing’s chief housing officer, said she was worried the house would be saved.
She said: “It was a nightmare for people here and I don’t think people should live like this.
A number of circumstances need to be considered, because this property will most likely come to the attention of the "not so nice part" of Cornwall.
The family is infamous and their names are infamous.
The couple have three sons who have been in the house for a while, and police said the family’s horrific rule included street battles using baseball bats, intimidation of surrounding residents, drug use, drug distribution, and loud screams, quarrels and intoxications.
The Skeldons (47), whose name was mentioned on the lease, were punished in June for antisocial behavior.
In several rooms in the house, which may have been demolished, scenty waste was found.
In the house from which drugs were distributed in the past, the floor covering was torn out.
Neighbors say they saw them on the street peeping, and people called the police on a regular basis.
Cornwall Housing forced her and her partner to move out of the house this week after being given an additional 11-week deadline to move on a voluntary basis.
Neighbors who were relieved welcomed the emigration with the fact that their lives were a living hell.
One of them said, “They didn’t care about anyone at all.”
We've lived next to them for 20 years and it's always been like this.
How many times we've seen the police here can't be counted at all.
“We couldn’t sleep this morning.”
We got up because it was unbelievable quiet here - we're not used to it!
It'll be nice when they're finally gone.
Adam Fitzpatrick, Cornwall Housing’s neighborhood supervisor, said the family was unable to work with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, the house was regularly called to the police
Waste and old toys spilled over into the crowded part of the town hall
She adds: “It is a shame that the tenant has not been able to accept responsibility for her own behavior and for the behavior of her family. Moving is always the last step that Cornwall Housing considers.
It was a very complicated case, because their behavior was extreme and their actions, according to the witness, had to scare her neighbors.
I appreciate all the work done by my team, the Devon and Cornwall police, and members of the local community who have been bravely informing us.
I hope that this step will bring some comfort to our neighbors and at the same time bring a message that we will not tolerate unsocial behaviour.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons of the tenant who lived in the house at different times were about 20 years old.
Polluted mattress that remained on the floor of one of the bedrooms in the house after the move
Workers will now have to dispose of the piles of waste left around the house.
In 2014, she ran a raid and found over 70 grams of cannabis, weights, equipment and <0xC2><0xA3>1,700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined when she was found guilty of holding class B drugs she wanted to sell.
She claimed the money was earmarked for the foundation of the house for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
It is believed that Tanya and her partner now live in private accommodation in Plymouth.
The walls in many rooms of the house were painted graffiti.
Police say they will seek to relocate tenants who violate the rules of their leases
Angela Crow from Denova and Cornwall Police said the move was a clear message to other tenants who will continue to violate the rules.
“This is a message to all those who think they can behave with impunity, and to those who would like to follow such behavior,” she said.
The Dean and Cornwall Police will never tolerate criminal and unsocial behavior and will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal scared after low overflight of military jet plane over the beach
Tourists who enjoyed the sunshine in Portugal’s Aveiro were terrified to die
The Portuguese Air Force P-3C Orion flew to an unbelievably low altitude
The U.S. Air Force said it was a training flight and insisted that there was no threat to safety.
As the low-flying jet flew over a crowded beach, the frightened tourists panicked.
The dramatic footage shows how a military aircraft gets to a distance almost to the touch of the sun when people get to the sandy beach near the city of Aveiro in northern Portugal.
Tourists began to get up after the noise of the jet engines disturbed them, without seeing what emerged from the clouds.
The incident took place yesterday afternoon on the Costa Nova near the city of Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of the few who posted video footage of the dramatic overflight on social media, said: “The plane flew twice really low and at one point it seemed to crash.”
Nuno Arroja adds: “I surfed and I really thought the plane would fall on my head.”
Tourists on the beach in Aveiro were terrified when a plane flying low appeared from the darkness
The Portuguese military said today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion was on a training flight to identify a fishing vessel off the coast and had to endure low, as it was the only way to inspect the ship.
The plane is said to have flown slightly lower than usual due to poor visibility caused by smoke from nearby forest fires. However, the airline insists that the safety of people has not been compromised.
Forest fires destroyed part of mainland Portugal this summer and claimed four lives on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese military said the pilot had to fly low due to the dense fog and smoke from the fires that prevented him from seeing.
The aircraft was on a training flight and the pilot was asked to identify the fishing boats during the training.
Half of the funeral services are non-compliant.
Half of the funeral service providers do not comply with the law.
The Czech Trade Inspection (<0xC4><0x8C>OI) found this during the inspections in the second quarter.
Funeral services, according to her, do not usually inform the survivors about their prices or issue written confirmation of the acceptance of the order.
<0xC4><0x8C>OI has imposed 41 fines totalling 73,000 kroner.
Today, her spokesperson Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Fröhlich reported.
The inspectors found the error in 47 of the 95 checks.
In addition to not informing about prices and missing confirmations, some funeral services have also sold products or provided services at prices other than agreed upon.
In five cases, the products sold were not properly labelled and once the seller used an officially uncertified meter.
Therefore, the inspection prohibited the sale of 23 products for a total of SEK 7077.
It concerned packaging for urns, candle covers and vases, which were not properly marked by mandatory information.
"Given that there is still a violation of the law in this specific area of services, the control action will continue in the next quarter of this year," Fröhlich added.
A London schoolgirl who joined ISIS has been killed in Syria.
It was reported that Kadiz Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIS, died in Syria.
Lawyer Tasnim Akunjee said the family learned about her death in Raqqa a few weeks ago.
ITV News announced on Thursday that she was likely killed during a Russian airstrike in Raqqa, which is a bastion of the group in the country.
The sultan was 17 years old, and according to her family, she died just as she was preparing to flee the war-torn country and return to Britain.
“One wants to believe that the only good thing about the whole thing — as a message and a warning to others that these are the real dangers associated with the journey to the war zone — is that it discourages people from making decisions,” Akunjee said.
Sultana and two other schoolgirls from east London boarded a plane to Turkey in February 2015 and then boarded a bus to the Syrian border.
Sultana's family learned that she had married an IS fighter in Syria - and within a few months she was widowed.
Reid says that if Clinton is elected, she will leave Garland as a Supreme Court candidate.
Senate Democratic Party leader Harry Reid says he is convinced that Hillary Clinton, a Democratic presidential candidate, is nominating Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court in the event of her election.
Republicans in the Senate have blocked Garland's nomination, although President Barack Obama will nominate him as early as March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnel says the person who will replace the late Supreme Court judge will be elected by a future president.
During a conference call on Thursday, Reid said he believes Clinton will select Garland "with a certain degree of credibility."
Reid's spokesperson later stated that he had not spoken directly to Clinton about whether Garland would be nominated, and that he was merely speculating.
He appreciated Garland and said that Clinton’s team would not want to “leave the ship” by choosing someone else.
Garland is the president of the federal appeals court in Washington.
Reid said the Republicans blocking Garland's nomination were "advocats" and "successful" of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.
He said Trump is not fit for office.
Treats Magazine Says Naked Calendars for “Women and Men”
Treats magazine collaborates closely with photographer David Bellemer on the 2017 calendar, inspired by the 1970s Pirelli calendar.
But instead of revealed celebrities, they are trying to find the next generation of top models for their 2017 NU Muses calendar.
Steve Shaw, president of Treats, told us earlier this year that his nude magazine is different from the old-school Playboy because “Playboy is for men.”
I do it for women.
It seems to me that the calendar is also.
“We need to get back to portraying timeless and classic nudity, where both women and men feel comfortable and let themselves be inspired by photographs of the female body,” Shaw said in a statement.
Women want to be part of this project because it is a wonderful piece of art.
Models can submit their pictures online or in person during open competitions in Los Angeles and New York.
Where does vinyl go: who really buys gramophone records?
Vinyl love the lonely men of middle age.
Before you decide to pay for the comments section with pepper notes under the pseudonym Not AllLonelyMenMiddle Age, we point out that this statement is based on the actual data.
According to YouGov, so much of the debated revival of gramophone records is associated not with the boom of millennials who want to love the originality of the physical object, but with the nostalgia of the middle age.
Those who recently bought an album on vinyl are most likely people between the ages of 45 and 54.
Young people aged 18-24 are the least likely.
It’s not really about accumulating an enthusiastic fan – it all has an emotional dimension: older people who buy gramophone records are more likely to want to keep their feelings (56% versus 53%) and like to be alone (69% versus 66%).
But are YouGov’s results true?
If this blog was broadcast as a television reporter, the camera would watch me go to a busy street in Soho, dressed in a decent gray outfit and gesture broadly. Then I would stop, pull my hands out and say something authoritative, like, "Let's go."
Well, let's take a look at this.
While the heart of Soho is slowly losing its charm and charm – the buildings once occupied by independent retailers, are now filled with hotels, restaurants and eateries, confectionery and office supplies – several fantastic specialized shops with gramophone dials.
I'd probably ask the camera to stop filming for a while. I'm gonna get close to the different men in these stores and try to spot their age and emotional mood.
Stuart (55), a native of Glasgow, whom I follow from Sister Ray (counts: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (counts: eight middle-aged men, one middle-aged woman about 20) has a time in London for an afternoon to rendezvous, to snatch, and to snatch.
I asked him if he was a collector.
"I think so," he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 recordings.
All these recordings touch the walls of his living room - in the picture above (he sent me a photo by e-mail, I didn't follow him home).
This huge number of albums and singles is also due to the fact that he can afford it: he can now buy gramophone records that he couldn’t afford when they first came out, and buy again what he sold in his youth and didn’t even have a winery.
“A lot of what I buy is from the late '60s and early '70s. These are things that would have been released when I was 11 or 12. I was too small at the time and couldn’t get them,” he says.
He agrees that those who buy the recordings are probably introverts who like the company themselves, and he adds: “I don’t smoke and I don’t drink too much.
This is my sin.
Wez (25) works at Sister Ray and also thinks that many of the customers she meets are part of the YouGov profile.
He also noticed a new influx of people affected by the media wave. People who heard about comeback and felt compelled to buy their old gramophone records back.
According to my interviews, people got rid of their collections most often between 1998 and 1999.
“Customers who once sold their gramophone records and bought CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their gramophone records back,” he says.
This could explain the boom of lovers of gramophone records of a certain age.
But what about the alleged emotional importance of gramophone records?
It won’t take more than a few seconds for you to discover in a store like Phonica that in music stores you’ll find a pleasant community of people with similar thoughts.
According to Weze, some older customers are particularly depressed by the contactless payment system.
Some fans of gramophone records may feel overwhelmed in the digital world and have opted for the familiar environment of gramophone records packaging, things that evoke memories of peaceful adolescence.
“I think filling the gap or possessing something material can bring some comfort,” says Wez.
I'm a collector myself, and I think a lot of people do.
It’s an easy way to fill a place in your head.
“We are all like their social workers!” says a collaborator from a bunch of gramophone records.
An ICM survey in April found that nearly 50% of people who bought a vinyl album a month earlier had not listened to it yet.
According to the survey, 41% of respondents have a gramophone that they never use, while 7% of those who buy gramophone records do not have a gramophone.
At this point in the reportage, he probably looked seriously worried while browsing the bunch of bossa nova compilation.
The aspect of "trophy" and the revival of interest is something that Jonny (42), who works in Sounds of the Universe (number: three middle-aged men), noticed.
“Someone recently came up and said, ‘I don’t have a gramophone yet, but I want to buy it on the Radiohead board so we can put it on the shelf,’” he says.
The percentage is not great, but it does happen.
It’s more about the product side than the music.
There are people coming to us who say, "I don't have a gramophone."
These are the younger people, not the older, adult teenagers who get into it.
Fopp, where almost a whole floor is currently reserved for gramophone boards, has a much more diverse visitor when I arrive.
There are couples of 70s, tourists who take pictures, teenagers and middle-aged women.
While the atmosphere isn’t as relaxed as the shops before – from the speakers to the tau jazz, the latest Wild Beasts pop is full of synthesizers and sex, it’s good to see different customers.
None of them look particularly lonely at all, but it’s hard to guess the intriguing mental trauma when you’re standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora (27) spends a few minutes at Fopp and checks out various gramophone records at a discount.
She's one of those people who'd rather look at the bills than spend a lot of money.
According to her words, she doesn't make much money, so she doesn't think she'd collect gramophone records.
It costs a lot of money.
It's easy to listen to music on a computer or something, but the gramophone records have their own charm... " he sighs longingly.
I can't explain it - it's unique.
My last stop is the store that supposedly inspired a new generation of gramophone lovers: Urban Outfitters.
I think I'm very interested in the little girls in tight jeans, and I'm watching a group of teenage girls gather around Polaroid cameras, and then my father and daughter decide to buy a Crosley recorder.
To the left is the staircase, the wall of which is covered by the gramophone records of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary and classical music, the basis of any average collection of gramophone records.
No one is looking at them - perhaps because they are just for decoration and some are so high on the wall that they cannot be reached.
It's just a vinyl trick.
But since any attraction to it could mean more money for the industry and send a few customers to the depths of Soho for the next, there’s not much to complain about.
It is no surprise that the demographic area, where there is more time and money than in other areas, is also the one where the most spent on the most luxurious goods, as vinyl is certainly.
But while, according to my findings, the results of YouGov seem to be accurate – at least in record stores, they do not take into account the large number of collectors and vinyl lovers who actually exist, in record stores and online forums.
These people are likely to work hard in schools or in offices.
He certainly doesn’t spend a Thursday morning strolling through the Berwick Street record stores, browsing through the recordings, and avoiding looking at a strange, 30-year-old fake TV moderator hiding behind the backs of middle-aged men.
Green shark is the longest-lived vertebrate - videoreportage
According to scientists, the Green Shark has the longest average life span of all vertebrates on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who studies sharks, says the video shows a female whose age is estimated to be between 272 and 512 years old and measures five meters.
Court in France Refuses to Destroy Stores in the Jungle Refugee Camp
A court in France rejected the Calais authorities' order to demolish dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle camp, where thousands of refugees live.
During the hearing this week, the Calais authorities argued that the state should be able to cancel a total of 72 interim stores where people inside the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer a few cents for haircuts, or 50 interim restaurants.
The Prefect’s office in Calais argued that places need to be demolished because they represent a parallel economy that does not pay taxes, and because they pose a risk of fire and health risks.
The court said that shops and restaurants are vital and that free meals offered by state-backed associations and other groups do not provide food supplements for the growing number of refugees in the camp.
Controversial temporary shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free food to people in need.
The court in Lille ruled that there was no legal basis to prevent people from running 72 interim stores, but said the Calais Prefect's objections were "completely understandable".
Judge Jean-Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Molla said that grocery stores, cafes and restaurants play a much greater role than simply serving food to people who “live in extremely desperate conditions.”
He said that the premises provide quiet places to meet refugees and volunteers.
One of the places threatened by the demolition was the camp’s Jungle Book Kids cafe, which is run by a non-profit organization that offers 200 meals, English and French lessons daily, and asylum counseling for hundreds of unaccompanied minors.
More than 170,000 people signed the petition to protect the “children’s” café.
The Guardian received a letter stating that the closure of the café “would be a disaster for these children, some of them only 8 years old.”
Charitable organisations Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants on Friday estimated that the number of refugees in the camp has risen to more than 9,000 over the summer, which is the most so far in all time.
He thought he was dead.
Ul<0xC4><0x8D> is also named Volleyball <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD>.
"I have been able to train normally since March," he said at the start of the summer preparation in full force.
What's wrong with you?
I had a double-sided pulmonary embolism, and that's why I had heart problems.
Because when I was at a university in Korea, I didn't know I had any blood problems.
So he caused trouble for a long flight to Asia?
For two years I had a crush on him, and I didn't know it.
It hurt, no one found me.
Then the snail got up.
There is a broken vein in the femur, it will always hurt, especially when the weather changes.
But nothing that would limit me, rather an aesthetic thing.
Were you worried about life?
He did.
Last year at the summer tournament in D<0xC5><0x99>ev<0xC4><0x9B>nica I didn’t know I had an embolism, and I couldn’t move there at all.
I vomited blood in the evening.
The doctors told me it was something completely different, and I was completely healed for another five days.
In fact, I thought I was dead in D<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>v<0xC4><0x9B>nica, as well as my girlfriend and family.
I've seen you somewhere else.
How did you deal with that?
I guess I had to go through it, now it's just going up.
I know I have some blood problems, that I have to be more careful when I fly somewhere.
But you can do anything about it.
It was only when I wanted to get back to the preparation of the Pribras last year that there were still problems with the heart.
It's all right now.
Since March, I have been preparing myself at home to be able to play again.
I'll bet I'm better at it physically than before.
What do you expect from <0xC3><0x96>st<0xC3><0xAD>?
I'm looking forward to the party looking good, I know most of the guys.
I'm curious about the other two foreigners who are coming.
Let's sit down humanly to make it fit together.
Will you lift your mouth?
There was a rumor, but every season is different.
Brno was the eighth one two years ago, now the second one is over.
There is a new team in <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD>, there are only a few players left.
It was the last in the extras, so there's plenty of room for improvement.
How we use it is up to us.
We'll see after the first rounds who's going to be the loser, we won't.
Is Coach Brom a guarantee of success?
He is already experienced and experienced a lot, he will think of a better than the last place.
But my arrival didn't have anything to do with it, I agreed earlier.
There were other coaches in the game, I was a great friend with one and it was agreed that he would work here.
I won't say a name.
Mr. Brom finally came and I'm glad.
He has a great name, has been in good clubs, has been training for many decades, is a former good player.
He'll move us up.
What will you bring?
This team is going to fight, which is my position.
I like to fight, I like to play and I like to get the chance in a not so top team.
I’ve been in P<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>bram for two years, but <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> is a bigger challenge than being in the sixth team right away, because it starts from the bottom.
You mentioned the aliens, the Australian Boehm is already training in <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD>.
What's it look like?
I know him by coincidence, we played against each other in a group at the university.
And a couple of times we had fun there, sometimes we sat together the night after the games, so we already know each other friendly.
We beat them 3:1, I put it to him at the start of the summer preparation in <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD>.
He has a Slovak girlfriend, he's a sympathizer.
There will be an American and a Brazilian.
Do you know anything about them?
I've written with an American, he looks like a nice guy, a Brazilian who knows how to speak English.
You contacted the American?
I thought it was a good idea.
I'm a recorder, so the one who makes it, so I should communicate with everyone.
I immediately found out what kind of players they are, I found them on the internet, how they play, I saw some videos.
He showed up quite well, the boy jumps, he's tall.
We wrote a few messages on Facebook, it seemed like a joke, it would come to us.
How do you look forward to the position of recorder number one?
I didn't want to take anything else.
After all, I'm only twenty-four and I don't have the nature to switch.
I'd rather be in the middle of things, I'd rather lead the team than lead it by someone else.
I probably don't want to play anymore if I'm supposed to be like a second recorder and be doing it full time, and if something isn't done full, it's bullshit.
How many times have you been single?
Half a year in P<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>bram, when it didn't work for Kust as captain, he got hurt, then there were problems with the money and he left.
We've been up ever since and I've been playing all the time.
In Brno, whose guardian I am, I switched one and two.
It was an excellent year in the Old Town, after which I had a lot of offers and chose P<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>bram.
Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice wanted me from there, I stayed, but I did not finish the season because of the embolism.
Now it's a new beginning.
The 22nd gold.
The short positioning remains the Phelps domain.
"Being back on the ranks of the victors and hearing the hymn is as sweet as ever," Phelps laughed, with tears in his eyes again.
His fiancée and mother were again cheering in the audience, this time Boomer’s son slept quietly with headphones on his ears.
I'm having an incredible week at the end of my career.
It's crazy - 20 years ago I started racing and in a few hours it'll be over, he said.
In the final behind Phelps, the silver Japanese Kosuke Hagino was left by almost two seconds, who won a long position.
Bronze was won by Chinese Wang Shun, a bronze medalist in this discipline from last year’s World Championships.
After Al Oerter (disc) and Carl Lewis (distance), Michael Phelps is the third athlete to have mastered the same discipline in four consecutive games.
After most of the race, Phelps was led by fellow American Ryan Lochte and home team Thiago Perreira.
While the defender of the gold in the final cricket fifties bet to a crushing finish, they fell out of the medal position.
The American superhero will have at least one more chance in Rio to expand his unique medal collection.
Shortly after the official announcement of the position, he advanced to the final of the 100-metre butterfly race.
The legend could not be overshadowed by the countryman Ryan Murphy, who won a record double - after a hundred in Rio also won a double track.
In the final, he left behind 37 sets of Australian swimmer Mitchell Larkin, third was the Russian Yevgeny Rylov.
While from last year’s World Cup, Murphy has only the fifth place out of two, in Rio he has become the marking king.
From the imaginary throne, Larkin sat down, with whom the same double succeeded just at last year’s world championship.
He won a medal at the Olympics just now.
The gold medals were shared by Canadian Penny Oleksiak and American Simone Manuel.
For the sixteen-year-old Oleksiakova, it was the fourth medal at these games, for Manuel's second to silver in the relay.
She was the first African-American to win gold in OH.
I believe I can be an inspiration to others.
This medal is for everyone who comes after me, the sport will become a love for them and they will get to where I am,” Manuel said.
The third was the Swedish Sarah Sjöström, who won the 100-metre butterfly race in Rio in the world record and has silver from the skeleton.
The world record-breaking Australian Cate Campbell finished sixth.
Japan’s Rie Kanet won the first Olympic medal in her twenty-seventh year.
It has no precious metal nor from the world championship, its maximum was the fourth place in this discipline in 2013.
Russia’s Yulia Yefimov won the second silver medal in Rio, which, due to the start of the games despite the doping past, faces the hostility of the spectators and rivals.
I made a big mistake once.
But I won in court, and I don't know why I should always answer these questions.
I'm so tired of it, said the Russian swimmer.
The right to start in Rio took place only at the special panel of sports arbitration CAS just before the start of the games.
They dealt with my appeal and I won.
Whether someone likes it or not, or if they have a different opinion, whether they turn to the arbitral tribunal, she added.
Hermann: Disappointment, we could have won.
And start at midnight?
I don't remember that.
The Czechs had a special day.
It was not until about an hour before the match that they knew who they were going to face.
They must have mastered tactical training.
And then, in an unconventional time, the game began on the small court number one.
The first set did not start well, then reached the opponents' lead, but at 19:19 they did not manage to finish.
In the second they were clearly better and compared, but the decisive tie-break did not work out for them.
In particular, the series of services shown meant a 10:15 loss and a farewell to the Olympic tournament.
"We could have defeated the Russians," Hermann lamented.
How would you rate the match?
Hermann: After the unfortunate start before I played, we got into the game beautifully.
In the end, in the last balloon, I had an income that I had gotten used to before.
We lost a hundred, which was key.
In the next set, we stepped on them with a look at the field, another defense and pressed on the service.
In the tie-break, there were terribly spoiled submissions, there we dressed up on this page.
It was a disappointment because we could have defeated the Russians.
Slukov<0xC3><0xA1>: It was a shame at the start of the first set, we missed it there.
We were able to download it, but we missed the dots.
The second set was great and the third was decided by the service.
We've made a lot of mistakes.
We gave them five points and it was about those five, we hesitated a lot there.
It's a shame, because the Russians were playable.
How did you play in the little castle number one?
Slukov<0xC3><0xA1>: Similar to China in the adjacent courtyards.
The atmosphere and environment were different.
It was one hour a night, complete silence, no music, nothing.
That was the difference from the center.
We would not choose such conditions, but we cannot choose.
What was the preparation for the match when you found out the opponent's names an hour before the match?
Herman: It was weird.
We started training for the match without knowing the opponents, so we couldn’t make tactical preparation like the other teams.
But Simon (Nausch’s ball) took tactics to almost all the possibilities that were there.
He had a lot of tactical papers prepared, so on this page we were pretty well prepared.
Do you remember that you would ever start a match at midnight?
Hermann: Probably not.
We played at 11:30, but not at 12:00.
Blok Rusky Birlovov<0xC3><0xA1> in the forecourt play-off at OH in Riu.
Beach volleyball players Markéta Slukov<0xC3><0xA1> and Barbora Hermannov<0xC3><0xA1> in the play-off at OH in Rio.
Was it unpleasant?
Slukov<0xC3><0xA1>: By playing the last two games in the group of ten, we had the mode shifted earlier.
That was two hours more than that.
It’s strange, I can’t imagine that another sport has athletes who have to serve their best performance at twelve o’clock.
But I think we did the best we could.
We knew it would be so, but it's not quite typical and probably it won't be my favorite time to play.
What do you think about the Olympic experience?
Hermann: Since the process was our goal from the group, on the one hand, it’s okay, good.
We've done what we said.
But now after the game, I'm sad.
Slukov<0xC3><0xA1>: I will sleep out of it and from tomorrow I will remember the Olympic tournament only positively.
Big brother's here, the first smothering SIM coming up.
You won't get away with it.
The new rules should apply to all persons without a Thai passport who, while staying in Thailand, decide to pick up a SIM from one of the local operators.
That is, not only for tourists, but also for people with long-term visas, for example, who work or have entered into marriages in Thailand.
The Secretary-General of the National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission, Takorn Tantasith, said there would be no exceptions.
The plan to sell SIMs exclusively to foreigners was presented by the national telecommunications regulator at the beginning of August.
New measures to monitor their position are planned by the authorities to be introduced within six months.
According to Tantasitha, it is a means of preserving national security that will allow to deal with criminal acts committed by foreigners.
In addition, so-called tourist SIMs help to detect persons who exceed the permitted length of stay.
Within six months, a special SIM for foreigners will also be available to retailers alongside a SIM designed exclusively for Thais.
The difference will be precisely the tracking function, which will be permanently turned on for cards intended for people without a Thai passport.
It won't be possible to turn it off.
"This feature is not for Thais because we can always easily track them," Tantasith added.
It should be added that in Thailand, subscriptions are not as anonymous as in the Czech Republic.
The seller requires a proof of identity.
On the other hand, for several years, one of the operators distributed a free start-up SIM to tourists at airports.
They were completely anonymous.
Ten telecom regulators from other Asian countries, such as Malaysia and Singapore, are also considering introducing the same measure as Thailand.
They are also currently subject to mandatory SIM registration, but legal use of the tracking system is not possible.
However, the measures envisaged do not entail an obligation for foreigners to assume a SIM upon entry into the country of the local operator.
Of course, they can use roaming services with their own home SIM, in which case the Thai authorities will be short on them.
The operators of the country in question know only the relevant network information after crossing the border, i.e. after the SIM is logged into their network.
They know the phone number, but not the owner’s information.
However, the difference in roaming prices compared to local operators’ rates is so blurred that most tourists will also start looking for local SIMs during their stay in Thailand.
The authorities’ attempt to monitor the movement of foreigners on the part of foreigners living in Thailand has come with immediate criticism.
Tantasith calms the situation and, in the context of privacy, the proposed system compares it to the obligation to provide a residence address in immigration documents.
In addition, the police will need a court order if it is necessary to monitor a particular person.
Any abuse of the system will be threatened by an indefinite penalty.
"If the service provider monitors the location of the SIM without a court order, he will be charged with a criminal offence," Tantasith added.
The system should also maximise the use of prepaid cards.
While a specific number is currently being recycled only after the 90-day period after which the SIM has not registered to the network, a new one could be re-established after fifteen days in the event of a departure from Thailand.
Luxury apartment in a new building in Vinohrady has a swimming pool and a hot tub on the terrace.
Why did you choose an apartment in a new building?
We were looking for a carefree apartment where most of the care for the property is provided by the administrator.
A condition was enough parking space and an elevator in the house, which essentially disqualified the older building.
Not to mention problematic acoustics in old houses, problems with floor bending, high energy demands and the like.
The condition was also large terraces, which the old building is not able to offer.
Other interesting visits can be found in the magazine Modern apartment.
The whole interior was designed for you by the architect Lenka Langerov<0xC3><0xA1> and her colleague Kamila Pol<0xC3><0xA1>kov<0xC3><0xA1> from Artiga studio.
Why did you just call them?
Would you recommend working with an expert to everyone?
Collaboration with the architect would be recommended to everyone, if he proposes an apartment from the beginning, because it is a very complex technical process.
The second level is the interior design itself: designers have a significantly better idea of the range of possible materials and are able to match the interior appropriately based on the wishes of the client.
We collaborated with architect Lenka Langer in our mountain apartment, then on the basis of the personal recommendation of another client, and since everything worked well, it was a clear choice for us even in the reconstruction of our new apartment in Vinohrady.
What were your practical and aesthetic requirements?
We wanted a generous social-living space with a corresponding background for a four-member family conceived as a modern, but not a cool interior.
The priority was to connect the apartment with the terraces and realize intelligent control of the household.
And, of course, the quality of the execution had to be monitored.
Did you leave everything to the experts, or did you interfere with the final form of the interior yourself?
We have approved all designs including technical drawings and samples of materials, but the design has always been from the architects.
At the beginning, we determined what we expected from the design, and showed some elements of the interior that we would like to incorporate into the design, such as carpets or paintings.
I think it was our collection of mostly Czech authors including works by Karl Malich, Karl Vysu<0xC5><0xA1>ila, V<0xC3><0xA1>clav <0xC5><0xA0>p<0xC3><0xA1>ly or Otto Gutfreund that helped the architect to orientate in our taste.
The combination of black, white and walnut wood was also the architect’s idea as well as the individual pieces of furniture, walls, floors, lighting, carpets, textiles, art, etc. We then jointly verified with visualizations whether everything fits together.
Have there been any complications during the implementation that caused you to give up your original ideas, or vice versa?
Perhaps only in the initial phase of the project, when we came to the construction at the moment when it was first possible to climb up to the height of our floor, and found that the views that we had planned, in fact, shade the surrounding building.
Then we literally changed the mood overnight from the ground up.
A granite was used on the kitchen line and on the lining of the fireplace wall.
In the interior, the wooden surfaces of the complemented leather, for example, on the upholstery of the dining and bar chairs Norma from Arper dominate.
How would you characterize the interior?
Are you going to make any changes, or is there something else you would like to have today?
I think it is a modern aerial interior, which above all fulfills its purpose.
We do not regret the changes, most of the modifications after the move took place in the level of shading and occupancy of the terrace.
Perhaps the only excrement is to the floor, when the walnut wood turns out to be too delicious for a household with a dog.
Word of architects, Ing. arch. Lenka Langerov<0xC3><0xA1> and MgA. Kamila Hornychov<0xC3><0xA1>, authors of the realization.
The apartment is on the last floor of the new building, so it was possible to make a completely new layout solution and several other modifications within the building.
For the interior is an important element of the placement of lights in the ceiling of the hallway and the main toilet.
This allowed us to get daylight into the darker areas of the apartment.
Also the direct entrance from the main bathroom to the roof terrace to the pool from USSPA is one of the construction arrangements that has been very beneficial for the function of the entire apartment.
There is also a swimming pool and a hot tub.
Compared to the French, you are not negative, says a Muslim living in Prague.
You're from France.
Where did you live all over the world before you moved to Prague?
My parents are from Algiers.
I was born in the south of France, not far from the Spanish border.
I've moved quite a bit.
I lived in Toulouse, Lyon and Marseille.
In France, I graduated in journalism, so I got to work in a magazine.
Why did you decide to move out of the country?
I began to feel like I was drowning in France.
I just didn't want to live there anymore.
Mainly because of the atmosphere between people.
It seems to me that every Frenchman is terribly negative.
People in France are negatively aligned in general, but lately it has worsened.
It’s interesting that you mention negativity.
This is how some people view the Czech character.
Believe me, you're not negative compared to the French.
Some people may not feel that way when they come to France, because as tourists they do not perceive it so much.
But it was too much for me.
The big issue is the money.
People feel like they have little money, while the minimum wage in France is fifteen hundred euros, which I think is enough.
There is also a problem with people’s behavior towards Muslims.
That's completely incomprehensible to me.
For example, in the street where I lived, my non-Muslim neighbor started looking at me through his fingers just because I was a Muslim.
It's like I'm some kind of evil.
That's why I didn't feel good in France.
But my family stayed there.
So you decided to go to another country.
Why did you choose the Czech Republic?
I was looking for a job virtually anywhere else, and I ran into a free job at Air France here in Prague.
I admit that I didn’t know Prague at all from the beginning.
I knew something about the Czech Republic, my father even told me about what was happening in Czechoslovakia, but I didn’t know what to expect from Prague.
I've been here for three years now, and I can't imagine not living here.
Was it a big difference when you moved from France to Prague?
Mainly because of a completely different atmosphere.
Maybe it’s because I don’t speak Czech, so I can’t capture any negative reactions or overreactions, but I feel that there are more free people here.
That I can do anything, dress up any way, and no one will judge me.
In France, someone is still looking at you unpleasantly, for example, when you have special clothes and so on.
In Prague, I began to feel really free.
I don't think the roasters care about that sort of thing.
Where do you work now?
After working at Air France, I worked for one travel website for a while.
Then, with another friend, we set up a website on which people offer and search for shared housing.
So far we are only operating in Prague, but we would like to extend it to the whole of Central Europe.
Do you have any Czech friends in Prague?
I have two very close friends here, who are half-Czechs, and two more friends of the Czech Republic.
I have to say that another specificity of the Czechs is that at first they keep more distance.
He won't let anyone go straight to his body.
That’s a big difference from where I grew up.
In the south, everyone hugs and kisses their faces.
It's different here, but I understand it's a cultural issue, so I'm trying to adapt.
You mentioned that you don't speak Czech.
Is the language barrier a problem for you?
On the contrary, I have quite a simple thing in Prague, because maybe everyone here speaks English.
Even in the evenings or in the food.
I'd like to learn Czech, but I don't have that much time.
And by being able to communicate at least a little in English, I don’t have such a need to learn the language quickly.
And every time I have a problem, there's someone to help me.
Have you encountered any negative reactions as well?
Is it because you are a Muslim?
Actually, no.
Perhaps it is also because I work in an international environment that is more tolerant.
One experience strikes me.
My boss, the Czech Republic, once told me about the French football team and said something in the sense that they are not French, but Africans.
It touched me quite a bit.
But if someone has a problem with being a Muslim, that hasn't happened to me yet.
And this is despite the fact that my colleague once warned me of some anti-Muslim demonstrations.
He told me not to go to the mall, they're gonna make me do it.
Anti-Muslim demonstrations are in part linked to terrorist attacks.
How does the current situation affect you?
Are you afraid that something like that in Paris, Nice or Brussels can happen in Prague?
I feel safe in Prague.
But the problem is, nowadays anything can happen anywhere.
Until recently, I may not have been able to imagine that something like this would happen in France.
This is not just about Muslims.
In addition, Islam does not recognize violence at all.
For me, the people who kill are not Muslims.
The Qur’an says that man has no right to kill because he is not God.
How do you feel when terrorists defend your faith?
It's very hard.
I feel guilt and guilt, even if I shouldn't feel that way.
I try not to watch the violence reports too much, but every time I read something, I need to apologize for something that isn't really my fault.
I'm a completely different person, so why should I apologize for the terrorists?
We met in the square of Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> z Pod<0xC4><0x9B>brad.
On Wednesday, Czech Muslims, along with Christians, demonstrated against the violence.
Did you record it?
I didn't know that.
But I understand that these people feel the need to prove that they don't agree with violence.
I don't think they should do anything like that.
Why should they feel guilty for something they didn't do?
Do you meet other Muslims in Prague as well?
My colleagues, for example, are from Egypt and other Muslim countries.
They are a little more religious than me, so we sometimes have quite wild discussions about Islam because we all see it a little differently.
I'm from France, so I went through a different education, they might have studied Islam in school.
We have different attitudes, but we respect each other.
Islam is sometimes associated with the subordinate status of women.
How do you feel?
I don't seem subordinate in any way.
Quite the opposite.
I am a woman, I have strength.
There is also the fact that you do not wear a head covering.
Like the hijab?
And it's mostly the way I was raised.
My mother, for example, is a fundamental Muslim.
He prays five times a day, but he doesn’t wear a scarf.
She has always taught me that faith is purely a personal thing.
It’s up to everyone how they interpret it.
When a person reads the Qur’an, he should make his own opinion on these things.
So when I read a passage in the Qur'an that says that God told the Prophet to hide his wives from the eyes of others, I said to myself, "I am not the Prophet's wife, so why should I hide?"
On the other hand, I respect that, and if I arrive in Iran or Saudi Arabia, where the scarves are required, I will take it.
Are you planning to stay in Prague?
So far, yes.
Nowhere else did I feel so good.
I’ve been thinking about Poland for a while, but I’m doing great in Prague.
I can even imagine raising my own children here as well.
Prague is the ideal city for this.
The Czech Muslims, together with the Christians, demonstrated against the violence.
The Kozelska Fenclov<0xC3><0xA1> wind in Riu went on the procedural trenches.
On Friday, the Czech yacht Veronica Kozelsk<0xC3><0xA1> Fenclové arrived at the sea in Riu de Janiero, Brazil.
In the Laser Radial class, she moved in front of the final two starts to tenth place.
This would ensure the Czech Republic take part in the final race.
Packs are collected as Pokémon.
They want to compete with carriers.
Behind the idea to take advantage of the already planned routes for the transfer of shipments is the TV director Mat<0xC4><0x9B>j Li<0xC5><0xA1>ka and the manager of the Prague music club Marek Greger.
With the idea, three apps with different geographic ranges breathed life into them.
We launched the National Transfer App in May.
There are thousands of cities in it right now, and we're going to expand the network.
In the Czech Republic, we want to learn this first, before we focus more on abroad, says in an interview for iDNES.cz a forty-year-old manager.
How does the Transfer app work and who can benefit from it?
Download it and register for free.
Then you can enter the route and details of how much package you can transfer and how much you want for it.
Someone may be asking for a transfer on that day.
When the route and the time of delivery match, it is paired and the two will receive mutual notifications.
At that moment, the chat will open, where the couple will arrange a transfer.
How many people do you think would have to register in order for each package to always find its own courier?
I don’t know the ideal condition, I can’t estimate how many registered and how many journeys it takes to make the coverage completely optimal and each offer paired with demand.
On the main tracks it already works and it is logically easier than on the way between the villages.
The more people, the greater the potential for speed and accuracy.
People are also building trust and discovering that no one is running away with the package.
Have you not had to deal with such a case yet?
How many users does the service have two months after launch?
Right now, we have about 5,000 to 6,000 people who are creating paths.
We see this as a success and we believe that there will be more.
Is it possible that the sender will wait too long?
We hope that we will be competing for the big conglomerates just because we are able to deliver the thing on the same day and for a fraction of the price.
For a large company, you will pay several thousand for delivery within two hours.
You'll pay a hundred or less here, because that's the way someone's already doing it.
Should traditional carriers be concerned about the potential loss of customers in the future?
Let's hope it does.
The market has huge potential, there are huge multinational carriers feeding here, as well as the chain of business, where everyone started shopping and gradually found that quality does not match what it pays for.
No one wants to find in the ticket box the message that he has to pick up the shipment at the branch, first the day after 19:00.
At the time, I needed the package for six hours and I was waiting at home because it was important.
We want a better, faster and more functional service that will not bother anyone and send a signal to the competition to try.
Marek Greger (41) and Mat<0xC4><0x9B>j Li<0xC5><0xA1>ka (39).
No one has ever been involved in the field of information technology.
Marek Greger works as manager of the music club, Mat<0xC4><0x9B>j Li<0xC5><0xA1>ka as a television director.
In 2014, they started preparing the Shippansee LTD application, which uses planned packages to transport routes between the world’s metropolises, especially by plane.
In 2015, they submitted a project to process the company that created applications for MALL.cz, Jobs.cz or <0xC4><0x8C>SFD.
The programming lasted three quarters of the year and the application was released on the market in March 2016.
The Transfer app started to develop in December last year and was released this year in May.
This is a local version of Shippansee adapted for the Czech market.
The Mes<0xC3><0xAD>ek and Mes<0xC3><0xAD>ek Profi app has been developed since January this year and made available to users at the end of July 2016.
The intention was to make all of these apps, which one day will merge into one from the beginning.
In the Czech Republic, they want to dodge the application and then, in cooperation with a strong investor, focus more on the global market.
Shared economy has been a topic lately and this is an AirBnB or Uber service.
Are you not afraid of acting in an area that no one can say much about so far, where is the boundary of sharing and where is the gray economy?
It’s the same, just another product.
It is clear to us that if it succeeds and we go up with it, we will be the next thorn in the eye through the gray economy.
But even if someone saves and someone earns, it’s not the intention of bypassing financial authorities and tax controls.
Each user, whether on one side or the other, will be encouraged to give his/her income if he/she makes his/her income.
What makes you think the service has such great potential?
The sender will save and the carrier will make a profit and reduce the cost of travel.
That is the strong idea that connects interest on both sides.
In the age of social networks that divide people, we would like to see this one come closer.
They can create nice stories, people are happy to help someone and they will tell them about it.
Maybe someone will bring you forgotten glasses, keys, or pills.
People have been lacking personal access for a long time, we say about this app that it is a service to people.
So how do you guarantee that the courier doesn't run away with the package?
Each user of the application, along with the registration, scans the citizen card and indicates the bank connection, payment or credit card.
These are the channels that give service and credibility to a person.
The couriers also collect stars based on the ratings of the senders.
We will also offer insurance, we will arrange the details.
The courier is responsible for the uninsured shipment in the event of loss or damage, but does not accept liability under criminal law for the content if there is something illegal inside and does not know about it.
If the police stop him and find himself in a sealed package in his trunk or ten kilos of hashish, criminal liability falls on the sender.
Is there a risk of misuse of sensitive data from the database?
The data subjects are, if necessary, monitorable by the administrative authority, which will be the only one who will be able to look at them, even we ourselves are not able to see them, the data are protected against abuse.
How much money will you get after successful delivery of the shipment to the courier?
The courier determines the price and gets the full amount he/she says.
The detachment is charged a few percent extra for contacting.
This money is our profit, but it is only a few percent, because we want to push the volume.
Also, no one can accuse the courier of not delivering the parcel when it is actually delivered, the pickup and delivery is verified using QR codes.
Are there any restrictions?
Whether in relation to the size or contents of the package?
You can move anything.
We have three sizes, small as a butter cube, medium as a plate of eggs, and big as a bass beer.
Then there are no more restrictions and if someone has a seat in the car, you need to transfer the refrigerator.
Plus, the sender has the option to take a picture of the package in the app, so the courier can see what he wants.
You don’t even have to pack the item unless you want to hide the content outlined.
You put the forgotten shirt in the courier's hand, and that's it.
Who came up with the idea and how long did it take to start the service?
The friend got the idea more than two years ago, then I didn't pay much attention to it.
Then he showed me a demo of an app with a transnational reach, which is aimed primarily at the passenger plane.
At that moment, I told him that I would not be looking for an investor, but I would like to become an investor and put savings into it.
The development lasted another year before we founded Shippansee LTD in London due to the greater credibility of the entire product.
But this is not the version you are focusing on right now.
No, we focused on marketing in the Czech Republic, where we are trying to capture the app, because it all had birth pains and still has something to deal with and improve.
We try to respond to feedback from customers and the foreign market does not solve as much at the moment.
We know it’s a long run, but we don’t want to, we want to create a really good product for people.
Shippansee LTD was the basic and the most expensive application, the other two were in their own way upgraded.
The transfer came about when we said that the national segment could be much more interesting and that we will at least learn it in the Czech Republic.
The third application of the Moon is local, for the city.
But he can send the package to the exact address and to the other end of the world.
It works for the sender as well as the Transfer, but the difference is that in it, as a courier, you see shipments in the form of points on the map that are closest to you, thanks to the geolocator in the mobile.
Applications for couriers who want to live by it, we called the Month of the Profi.
So someone can make a lot of money by picking up packages in the city?
Exactly, the latest app will be downloaded in Prague, for example a taxi driver, a student, a mother on parental leave, someone who wants to make the most of the trip to work.
Just like everyone's crazy about these Pokémon now, they can collect this just the same.
One sees where the orders are in the city, comes to it, clicks and sees when it has to be delivered and the shipment is transported.
It's set up cheaper than competitive services.
At this point, we are still making a web interface, which will be key for companies to send shipments, fill in data about them on the web, or create points on the map.
We are then able to invoice them for the use of the service, for example, every month.
Are you currently working on a full-time project?
It makes it hard for us, but we normally have it at work so that we can enjoy and develop the project.
There is no strong multinational investor behind us, we are two guys, one of whom had a brilliant idea and the other jumped into it with other incentives and ideas.
We are now looking for an investor strong enough to be able to curb the Czech market with us, but who should go with us into a global product and become another huge player in the market such as AirBnB and Uber.
The storyline of Titanfall 2 is meant to bring an almost forgotten diversity.
This will fix the second part and the solo game in it will be smarter according to the first information than in Call of Duty.
The length will be around the standard eight hours and the filling should be based precisely on the concept of network braking in the first part.
Therefore, one can look forward to freedom of movement, which in addition to running includes the possibility of using a combat titan.
In addition to the action passages in addition, the game will contain levels aimed at just a reversible movement.
They'll remind the platformers and include ribbons.
For this reason, it is essential to overcome them, for example, double jumps, running on walls and rope slides.
In addition, sometimes it will be necessary to eliminate enemies.
There will be no shortage of maps reminiscent of the dungeons and levels with special concepts.
In one, for example, it will be possible to lift and pull down platforms and close a huge door.
You will adjust the shape of the battlefield.
The tempo of the game should oscillate between angry action and quieter moments to explore an unknown planet.
We're going to play Jack Cooper's pedestrian dreaming of a career as a pilot.
Cooper, along with Captain Lastimosa, is defeated on the alien planet Typhon, which is inhabited by enemy soldiers.
And there won't be any wildness there.
In addition, Lastimos sustains mortal wounds in the accident, and Cooper is tasked with launching the Captain Titan.
His dream of a pilot's career will come true sooner than he expected.
But the first step will be to steal the battery necessary for the robot's repair.
Also important will be Cooper's calls with the Titan.
It will serve as a source of information about the military’s past, but at the same time, the robot’s individualized communication will create humorous moments.
For example, if the titanium is dry, it will name all the injuries that Cooper faces during the planned jump.
The first information about the campaign in Titanfall 2 was brought by the Polygon server.
In addition, the result will be able to be assessed in two months and Bonusweb will give you first impressions of the network game after Gamescom.
Titanfall 2 will be released on October 28 for PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
The THQ brand comes to life, but the original publisher remains dead.
Swedish company Nordic changes its name to THQ Nordic.
After the collapse of THQ in 2013, it acquired a number of its brands and the right to use the logo and the name of the company.
For example, Nordic has released Darksiders 2 Deathnitive Edition and the Red Faction Collection package.
In addition, another 23 games are being created for the publishing house and 13 of them have not yet been revealed by the company.
Thirty years ago, at the time of my retirement, my wife, after thirty years of marriage, found a twenty-year-old man, our neighbor.
I knew it from the beginning - first, obviously, I tried it for a long time, then they got together.
He's such a big guy, probably her type, because she was walking in front of me like that.
She was completely mad at him.
In the first few days, her voice even changed, she had such a girly, in love voice.
But when I told her I knew what was going on, she denied it.
I've been watching it all.
He then left work regularly at half-four, so she always left at three to go shopping.
Every day she tried to at least see him.
Later, I found out they were meeting at his bar, in the laundry room.
How many times I knew they were there.
I got my keys, and he was determined to catch them there.
But I don't know why, in the end I always stayed at home.
I've never been able to go there, take that decisive step.
You may laugh at me, but I believe that my wife has mental control over me.
Soon she found out that I was controllable, that I was going to do what she wanted.
And I really did.
Maybe I'm just such a bitch.
My neighbors told me that they knew about it too.
I was so stupid that I never asked them what to do.
I was afraid that if it all broke down, it would be bad.
That it would happen to everyone in the family, only the daughter knew something.
So I always put it off, keep going.
But one day I went to his apartment to see if I needed help in the laundry room.
He went there with me and I told him that I got anonymous, that he was meeting with my wife and that it all testifies.
I asked him what he would tell me.
He stood there, shrugged his shoulders, looked down at the ground, and said nothing.
Then I also once met his wife on the way out of the store.
I told her, but she didn't believe it at all.
She didn't respond to it, and she didn't tell me anything.
No one told me anything back then.
I'm the kind of person who's never gone far, who's got a problem getting to know someone, let alone finding a woman.
So I didn't even think about divorce.
I kept relying on it to end one day.
I thought I'd forgive her and life would go on.
But it wasn't.
And I've never actually coped with it all.
I still have it in me.
I used to show it to her quite often, but in the end I left it alone.
He still lives in the next house and I still live with her.
It's just rather than my housewife's wife.
At home she always did everything - cooked, washed, cleaned.
She's a hard worker.
She always tried to make sure I had no other reason to complain.
And you can say that she is also good.
But sometimes I'd like to flatter her, embrace her, and she won't let go.
We go for walks and shopping together, and everyone thinks about what a happy marriage we have.
But she once told me she never loved me.
That she loved and loved me, but that she didn't love me.
And I see that he loves him to this day, he is her god.
And I don't enjoy life like that.
Already when it started and I took it very badly, I told her once that she didn’t want to live for me and I asked what she would say if I ended it.
I wanted to know if she would agree with it or not.
And that's what I wanted to hear from her: Yes or no.
But she thought, and finally she said, "But there's plenty of room here."
Prime Minister Manuel Valls wants to establish a new French Islamic Foundation, which should serve as a bridge between the state and its Muslim population.
After the terrorist attacks, France is stepping up the fight against radical Islamists and the government and the local Muslim minority are calling for help.
"If the Muslims themselves do not help the state against those who violate public freedom, it will be increasingly difficult for France to guarantee the freedom of their confession," said Prime Minister Manuel Valls.
He intends to ensure that only the spiritual education in France is preached in the country.
He also wants to stop financing mosques from abroad, where preachers often come with money vaccinated with jihad.
By October, Prime Minister Valls wants to establish a new French Islamic Foundation to serve as a bridge between the state and its Muslim population.
The new institution will replace the current French Foundation for Islam, founded in 2005 by the then Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin.
Already then, it was supposed to contribute to the transparency of the financial flows between the mosques and the countries that finance their construction.
However, she was soon hit by internal contradictions, and therefore it never worked properly.
"It's a total failure," Valls said.
The new foundation will likely be headed by former Interior and Defence Minister Jean-Pierre Chev<0xC3><0xA8>nement, who is known as a supporter of the secular state.
There are about 2,500 mosques and mosques in France, about 120 of them serving radical Islamism.
Since 2012, the French authorities have expelled about 80 Islamic clergymen from the country, and for a few dozen more, they are considering this step.
This week, the German police also attacked the jihadist clergy.
The Imams reportedly recruited fighters for the Islamic State.
One of them operated an area where believers allegedly radicalized and later attacked a Sikh temple in Essen.
Immediately after the attacks on Charlie Hebdo in January 2015, a debate in France over a new institution to replace the non-functioning foundation was raging.
All of them accelerated further terrorist attacks carried out on behalf of the Islamic State by radical Islamists.
The new foundation will have two main tasks – to ensure the financing of mosques from domestic sources and also to oversee imams.
However, it is not yet clear where the funding will be obtained, although several proposals are being considered.
One of them is a special fee for halal food, i.e. meat derived from defeats according to Islamic principles.
In practice, this tax would be paid by halal sellers for the granting of a permit.
Some of the money would then go to the foundation’s budget.
A contribution of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>10 to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20 could also be paid to French pilgrims who go to Mecca.
Every year, about 30,000 of them are deported from France to Saudi Arabia for traditional pilgrimage.
In addition, only preachers who have passed educational programmes at the universities in the French mosques should be involved.
As a result, their preaching should be in harmony with democracy.
The government is also shutting down radical mosques.
"We have closed 20 of them since December and more will follow," Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said.
“There is no place in France for those who proclaim hatred and do not respect the principles of our country, such as equality between women and men,” he said.
Zaragoza.
His ex-wife was seriously injured by an unidentified gunman on Friday morning at a shopping mall in northern Zaragoza, the Independent newspaper reports.
The shooting took place after a woman and her daughter left the garage in their car.
The man was waiting in the car in front of a shopping mall, from where he also started shooting.
According to witnesses, the man then turned the gun against him, writes Independent.
The woman was taken to the hospital by an uninjured daughter, and an ambulance had to arrive for the men in critical condition.
The attack took place around 11 a.m. in the central part of the metropolis of the autonomous region of Aragon, near the local university.
Referring to the Spanish agency Europa Press, the Independent writes that the motive was probably the unresolved recent divorce of the two partners.
Rolls with basil, wakame algae, ginger and chilli sauce.
The summer wishes for light, well digestible food, only we Czechs are rebels and we have our tastes and our heads.
And so from summer gardens smells grilled necklaces, lentils, pork chop.
Nothing too healthy, nothing too light, even so sometimes with the exception of salad or roasted vegetables.
True, grilling is time-saving and dishes, plus it's a social thing and no one needs to be closed in the kitchen.
But there are other alternatives, how to make good tastes, which special tableware, their preparation is a small ritual, but at the same time you do not have to cook, bake, fry or simmer anything for a long time.
And they will also contribute to our health.
Whether it’s homemade sushi or sashimi, where high-quality ingredients and a few well-crafted griffins are enough to make cooking fun and food itself a real exotic treat.
As well as even easier rolls in rice paper from today's recipe.
Here, even the more time-consuming cooking and cooling of rice falls.
The paper can only be softened for a moment in the water and then depends only on the imagination of the cook, how he intends to play with fillers and accessories.
There's no algae like algae.
The advantage of a number of dishes of Asian cuisine today is that raw materials are already generally available.
Including loaded sweet-acid ginger, which is one of the basic flavors accompanying sushi or fresh rolls.
You can also prepare it at home, but the real rosemary ginger has a unique spicy sharpness and at the same time a delicious taste thanks to a secret recipe, according to which it is mixed with several types of vinegar and ginger.
Therefore, it is enough to buy a bag of the right size, and the appendix with demonstrable antibacterial effects, promoting digestion and resistance to cough or flu, is ready.
Banana leaves.
They are especially used in Buddhist and Hindu cultures in serving and decorating dishes as part of a variety of festive occasions and rituals.
Long ribbed banana leaves are very common in a number of countries in Asia and South America as well as as a "help" for preparing a variety of baked, cooked and fried dishes, which are packed in them similarly to alobale.
The banana leaf also imparts a specific flavor to the food.
They can be bought at exotic fruit and vegetables stores, even pre-cut into the shape of wheels.
However, select only the leaves saturated green, and therefore healthy - unripe and spotless.
Equally easy is the preparation of lettuce from wakame, sesame and sesame oil.
You can buy them frozen again.
Who often eats or prepares sushi, probably will know especially the range of nori.
In Japan, it is one of the most important species of seaweed, from which it is produced by cutting, pressing and drying the so-called nori leaves <0xE2><0x88><0x92> plates designed specifically for the production of sushi.
Wakame – a dark green algae growing in the waters around Hokkaido Island – is also fresh and dried and is as popular as the nori algae.
By the way, who wouldn't know miso soup with wakame, it's supposed to be used by Asian women for recovery after childbirth.
And at all, this algae has almost miraculous effects.
Cleanses the blood, strengthens the blood circulation, even supposedly prevents graying of hair and is literally loaded with minerals.
Dried and diluted wakame also serves as a spice, for example, to flavor rice.
Fresh algae are first allowed to simmer in water, then rinsed, put in boiling water and cook for half a minute.
Then it cools in ice water, cuts out the middle ribs and continues to adjust, such as a favorite salad.
Of course, buying it ready-made, frozen is the easiest solution.
So all you have to do is wrap the roll with an easy filling of vegetables, delicious and light, full of healthy flavors.
Such a bomb of longevity.
If you resist and do not add extra grilled rags.
Eating healthy, light and summer.
Asians know how to do it.
Just a few special ingredients and a bit of skill, and you have an interesting fresh food that deliciously combines tastes.
And they're done once or twice.
Four pieces of rice paper, 40 g of carrots, 40 g of white raisins, 100 g of green cherries, 60 g of lettuce cucumbers, 60 g of wakame algae and 60 g of sweet chilli sauce.
A bunch of chopped coriander, a spoonful of black sesame, a spoonful of sriracha chilli sauce, 20 g of mango and 40 g of stuffed ginger, a little pine nuts.
Let's get the screws ready first.
Soak the rice paper in cold water for five seconds.
Then we take it out and wait for it to soften.
In the meantime, in hot water, cook the basil sprouts for a short time, after about three minutes, let them cool quickly in ice water, so that they do not lose color.
Place the vegetable filling on the allowed paper and wrap it.
We prepare the filling from white radish, carrots and salad cucumbers, which we cut into fine noodles, mix them with a sweet chilli sauce, add the chopped coriander, mix thoroughly and put on rice paper.
On the banana leaf, add the crispy sprouts, add the threads and finally decorate the whole dish with a wakame range, stuffed ginger, mango slice, sprinkle with black sesame and add a few pine nuts.
Britain must settle for silver in seventh rugby, pick Fiji takes gold
Britain's impressive performance in seventh-place rugby ended in a devastating run on the last hurdle, Fiji defeated the British in the final match on Thursday night at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio high 43:7.
The Fijians have delivered a master’s lesson in processing, scraping, bending, supporting games, rope running and brutal force – and have won gold, their first Olympic medal at all.
The defeat came with an undisputed price of comfort in the form of a silver medal - for Britain's third on that day - and the British could be proud of their performances in the inaugural Olympic seven-week rugby tournament, defeating the Republics of New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
A 7:5 win over the South Africans in the semi-finals the same day, may be frozen in the final.
Fiji, on the other hand, would have defeated a 15-member team in full health.
It may not be comforting for the British, but they can rejoice that at least one of them will have a gold medal around his neck tomorrow: the Fiji chief coach is Ben Ryan, the former England manager from Wimbledon.
The United Kingdom has taken a path.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game at the Adelaide Sevens.
They lost the only one here.
This defeat hurts, but progress is undeniable.
Fiji began spectacularly, the British’s breakthroughs reflected for joy.
For Captain Tom Mitchell and the other team-mates, it was like running behind a series of moving buses and the World Cup champions led 5:0 when Osea Kolinisau came out around the corner.
The timer showed four minutes and Jerry Tuwai added another down on the right wing from which the conversion was made.
12:0 and Britain barely touched the ball.
Great Mitchel tried to stop the giant Leon Nakarawa and prevent him from scoring for the third time, but only Fiji slowed down.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua threw the touchdown in the right corner and the British lost 17:0.
Nakarawa added another one after his return and there was still more than 1 minute left... from the first half.
Vatemo Ravova then penetrated the tiny Brits and joined the line where he scored.
After the conversion to 29:0, the break was followed.
It was as if Fiji was born for rugby 7s, while the British were still learning to pass.
That's the way it is.
The British made massive changes after half-time, and the Fiji movement stopped... for a full four minutes, which was good compared to the first half, until after the brilliant interception of Fiji Joshua Tuisov went on.
Dan Norton tried to get an opportunity for the British, threw a touchdown in the left corner to raise the an 36:7. But the game had long been won by the Pacific Islanders and their fans were ready to sing, wave flags and dance.
It was hard not to admire the totally cheered approach of the Fijians.
In the final moments, Mata Viliame was blinded by another attempt to win the Fijians.
The whistle sounded, the Fijis hugged each other, and the British fell on the lawn in complete silence.
The same day Fiji defeated Japan 20:5 in the semi-finals and the United Kingdom defeated the South African Republic in a narrow semi-final – the difference of one conversion.
Kyle Brown got the South Africans to the lead in the first half, but Dan Norton, thanks to his dazzling footwork, broke the defensive line and scored in the second half under the hook.
Marcus Watson, Anthony’s brother from England’s 15th-placed team, secured a victory – and eventually a silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired the coach’s fight against cancer to win the rowing race
You won’t find more emotional gold at these Games – and that’s what to say.
From the first shot to the last, during 220 punishing breaths in history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found another meaning in their golden moment at Estacio de Lagoa.
While there were two people on board, there were three voices in the boat. When the boat swooped on the level to meet the second Olympic gold in a row in the women's doubles race, there was still the voice of coach Robin Williams on the boat. They were the first women in the history of the British sport.
Their predominance was absolute, overall it was their 39th race in which they remained undefeated.
What we see - two excellent athletes flying along the water level with the elegance of a whirlpool - does not reflect the nature of victory completely.
Behind every gold medal in rowing is a battalion of auxiliary hands, which make a difference piece by piece. And no hands were helped more than the hands of a coach who 30 months ago did not know if he would survive this day when he was diagnosed with cancer.
According to his words, it was uncertain.
I suffered from bladder cancer, which can be operated on, and I underwent this surgery.
Without surgery, anything could happen.
It would be a very bad situation.
This will change your view of the matter somewhat.
Williams was diagnosed with cancer in December 2013.
The lucky thing for the entire trio was that he could begin treatment in early 2014, off-season, and thus reduce the outage to a minimum - if we can call it that under such circumstances.
I needed to make money, so I had to get together quickly.
That was an incitement.
I was in the hospital and I walked around the room - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said a few steps was enough.
That's how it started.
Riding in and of itself is a journey, but this was a little more challenging.
Immediately after the victory, their first thoughts on Williams, who was very nervous in the morning, spoke less than usual as he tried to cope with his own unrest.
Stanning, the captain of the Royal Artillery Regiment, who has a mission in Afghanistan, said: “This week I’ve been down with emotions, maybe it’s a bit extreme, but it means so much.”
Again, it underscores how much it means to me, how much Helen and I worked together, and Robin too.
So far, it's been three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin we wouldn't be anyone, so he's a huge thank you, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have wished for a better man for training, or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a single race in five years.
The pair set an astonishing rhythm that their rivals couldn’t cope with.
Even in the final 500 metres, when crews from New Zealand and Denmark began to approach, Stanning and Glover had a very large reserve.
We were focused as much as possible at the time.
Helen shouted, “Don’t stop, don’t stop.”
It's really important not to be kidnapped.
We had a good start and at the same time we didn’t want to achieve anything famous.
We didn’t enjoy today’s fireworks, we just wanted to get well, go out and win the race, which we managed to do.
The couple's gonna take a year to think about it before they decide what's next.
Glover is getting married next week, and her upcoming TV adventurer is Steve Backshall.
Now he wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean to say it would be my last race.
That would mean too much pressure.
It took about six months in London to find out that I was an Olympic champion.
It was all so new and I was so stressed out.
It took about four minutes here.
I feel a lot better about it," she said.

Jail?
Rather, let them drive people for free, says the taxi-mafia hunter Rube<0xC5><0xA1> to a breakthrough charge.
Six taxi drivers and a former magistrate’s official in Prague are, as the <0xC4><0x8C>T said, indicted.
You have filmed a number of reports in which you have revealed fraudulent practices and those who are to be in the group that will appear before the court.
That's why you've faced some unpleasant confrontations with the actors who've been exposed.
How much is the report about the indictment of members of the organized group breakthrough for you?
I was expecting some kind of trial to take place.
I'm mostly curious about the verdict.
I don't think they should be in jail.
It's useless.
First of all, they should return all the stolen money.
And they should return them so that they will drive all the people for free.
That's a bit of a weird solution.
Does this mean that you do not see a possible punishment as effective enough?
For me, it is enough that some of them are so afraid that they are no longer doing the work.
For example, one makes a pinch, another weighs a pizza, and one coughs up.
The defendants can theoretically get two to eight years in prison.
Do you think that's an adequate rate?
In general, I have a problem with taking away my freedom.
I think that's a bad punishment.
To put someone in jail, especially in this case, is nonsense.
Such people should give back to the company they took from her.
For a quarter of a century, they have been committing the destruction of our country and the robbery of people.
So let them do a good business card now and weigh people for free.
I can't imagine it any other way.
It would work as a public benefit job.
As someone goes to collect waste, they would get a car and drive people around Prague for free.
No, I really think they'll get a condition in the end and they won't care.
They'll find another way to cheat somewhere.
He studied at the Miroslav Ond<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ka Film Academy in P<0xC3><0xAD>sek and later at the Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Bati University in Zl<0xC3><0xAD>n.
It belongs to people who in the Czech Republic started with viral videos and videos directly for the web.
He works as an editor for Internet TV Stream.cz, where he participates in a number of shows, now prepares the show Prague Guide, which is aimed primarily at foreign audiences.
Rube<0xC5><0xA1> advises them in the form of short reports, which services they prefer to avoid in Prague and which on the contrary he recommends to use without fear.
Previously he filmed a series titled How to, City of Cheats?, Life in Luxury, A Enough! and Prague vs. Money.
The indictment refers to them as an organized group.
The police followed her for several months.
Can such a network of fraudulent taxi drivers be called a Mafia?
They are such cute mafias, not the ones we know from Kmotra.
It's more about the mafia - juniors, but the organized are certainly.
It’s just that they’re looking after each other (taxi station).
Prague is all over the place.
I followed up that for example, the main station does not like Paris, Paris does not like with taxi drivers waiting at the Karlov<0xC3><0xA1> L<0xC3><0xA1>zn<0xC3><0xAD> (disco club)
Everyone just keeps an eye on it, and each group is sort of organized.
It's probably a net.
There are only seven people, six taxi drivers and one former magistrate officer who warned the driver of checks.
As you say, the undesirable phenomena have not disappeared from the streets.
So what percentage of Prague’s scammers in the taxi service according to your estimation?
That's a very small percentage.
The worst on the street are still there.
I'm talking about Ale<0xC5><0xA1> Ry<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek, for example.
This is a man who is really dangerous - in his car is driving a telescopic casing, and every Friday and Saturday is standing at the Charles Bridge and driving people.
The last time I went with him, he wanted me seven hundred miles.
The police did not arrest him for any reason.
Only a few people from all over the big group were selected.
The same is true in other places in Prague.
With the charge of seven people, it is therefore difficult to eradicate the already famous Prague nasty, which is apparently much larger in size.
Of course, it's not for nothing.
It will help, but all evil will not escape, it is true.
Are taxi drivers stealing foreign tourists still performing in the same places you showed in the reports, i.e. at Charles Bridge or on Paris Street?
Yeah, that's right.
In these locations they stand every day and every day they violate the decrees.
It is ignored by both the city police and the Prague magistrate.
It's not even cats anymore, it's a complete indifference.
Business of Prague Taxi Drivers in Numbers
Some of them, though only part of the group, will go to court.
It's a breakthrough.
So I have to ask: do you feel satisfied?
If I took it as a compliment, it would be bad, because my goal was, is and always will be to make the centre of Prague better.
And even if I feel like I need to get a little better, I'm going to keep doing it.
It is necessary to press the door on the other side.
Even if the last thief stays there, we should still do something to remove him.
You can't settle for that.
But this is not the case, of course there are more.
Are you still trying to confront them directly in taxis?
Sometimes I do test drives and I have to say it's still bad.
Just last week I caught a cab driver, by the way, from the same group, and he was very surprised to see me again.
He charged 560 kroner for three kilometers, although he later claimed it was 56 kroner (he used a trick with a decimal line).
He had a note on it, the cops arrived, and this taxi driver was so cute that he was still going after those cops and asked them when someone would finally give him those 56 crowns.
A similar case.
A taxi driver on a taxameter smashed a decimal strip and stole tourists for 357 kroner.
Can it be said that the bravery of the fraudulent taxi drivers did not go away even after you showed in your shots the faces of those who charged ridiculous amounts for a short drive?
Their bravery is still unbelievable.
How'd it go with that cab driver who's got 56 kroner?
The police sent him away with the fact that they could not discuss with him on the spot because he had issued a bill.
And that, I think, will be a problem in this court as well (six taxi drivers and one exorcist).
On one side there will be a taxi driver with his bills, on the other side of the police.
However, according to the decision of the Supreme Administrative Court, the Magistrate may not use secret recordings of a taxi service vehicle as evidence in court.
When I filmed the pieces about their scams, the taxi drivers themselves warned me of this precedent.
I've always wanted to use the footage but only for reporting.
Are you worried that this fact could protect them from trial?
I hope that every judge will understand that no taxi driver would be able to drive for six or ten crowns per kilometre, because he would not live with it.
You talked about a trick with a decimal line, which is being shoved especially in front of foreign clients by fraudulent taxi drivers.
Is it still up-to-date, or are they worried that this fiend will continue to use after publishing your reports?
I think we popularized this trick by broadcasting the show on the contrary.
I was driving with a cab lately, boasting in front of me that he's the honest cab driver.
Then I noticed a black card attached to the side of the taxameter.
When I asked him what he had there, he said, "You know what it is."
If the fines did not work too well on taxi drivers, can the court and their colleagues be wary of them?
Is there anything that can discourage them from fraud?
You talked about the fact that according to you, they will always find a way to cheat.
I don't think anything can discourage them.
But someone can push them out of those places.
And these are the fairy taxi drivers who should be fighting harder to get them out of there seriously.
From my experience, I have to say that these fairy taxi drivers in Prague are fortunately predominant.
But do they want to go against those who ruin the reputation of their services?
They have a taste, but they lack a mind.
He can't do much, and he can't say exactly what they want.
When they organized the demonstration (due to the proposal for a general restriction coming from the office of Mayor Adriana Krn<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ov<0xC3><0xA1>), it was not very clear what they really wanted.
They once said they didn’t protest Uber, they just wanted to have the same terms as this service, and then they said they wanted more than Uber.
It happened that they only blocked Prague and only the best possible advertisement for Uber came from it.
How do you assess the overall approach of the Prague Magisterate in solving the problem of overcrowding?
It can be seen that she had to step into this until the criminal police in order to solve something.
The master's degree was short.
They had a handkerchief there that carried out the information, which means that the taxi department was doing its job for several years completely in vain.
I hope that this official will be charged to the last check for all the misappropriated checks to realize what he's done.
That's the worst thing I've ever seen.
I was even on a check-in ride with him, which I found out later on from their list.
It has been a few months since the last episodes of the series were published.
What's the response?
I think mainly of foreign spectators, which in fact the series is the most focused.
Every time I have friends from abroad, I'm leaving the videos to them.
And then when we walk down the Old Town Square, there are surprises that the same people that are seen on the footage are seriously standing there.
Famous Prague celebrities.
I'm serious.
I'd put a blanket around them so people could look at them.
Museum of Communism on the street.
My last question is clear.
Do you drive a taxi when you need it?
Yeah, sure.
I'm driving services where I don't have to pay in cash, but with a card.
I use services like Uber or Liftago where there is no possibility of fraud.
But there are also many dispensaries that are fair.
I've only taken a cab on the street once since.
The driver said to me when I got into the car, "Well, you have the guts."
Bém in a costume for an Italian tourist.
The fraudulent practices of taxi drivers were already written in 2005.
Former mayor Pavel Bém took a test drive in disguise for an Italian tourist in the same year, and on the first attempt, the driver smashed it by two hundred.
Rube<0xC5><0xA1>, however, had a worse experience.
Taxi drivers charged him for the ride from the Old Town to Wenceslas Square 820 kroner, which is about 195 kroner per kilometre, according to the authors of the report.
The Prague Magistrate has set a maximum price of CZK 28 per kilometre.
There are also other surprising sums in the filmed reportage: for example, the two-kilometre road from Paris to Truhl<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>sk<0xC3><0xA1> cost a tourist 400 kroner.
Expensive rides were also provided by taxi drivers waiting at the Charles Bridge.
For a ride to the Angel, which is 2.5 kilometers long, they also charge six hundred kroner.
The marble is washed with mostly clean water, as much as possible without chemistry and the longer the better.
Impurities from it go well, although sometimes dirt has to be put down with a scalpel, it needs to be drained out of the folds.
It’s not easy and it doesn’t go fast, the restaurateur Vanesa Trostov<0xC3><0xA1> from Old<0xC5><0x99>ichov in H<0xC3><0xA1>j<0xC3><0xAD> approached her work.
Hat down in front of it: the tomb is built with a climb, after which it is necessary to climb countless times and descend again.
"The restaurant should be careful, patient and uncomplicated in the working environment," she said.
In Frydland, this is not her first restoration work.
Thanks to it, for example, the stone elements of the fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade in the rear section of the city hall of Fr<0xC3><0xBD>dlant have been restored, it has also restored the statues of St. Mary Magdalene in Zati<0xC5><0xA1><0xC3><0xAD>, St. John Nepomuck<0xC3><0xBD> in Fr<0xC3><0xBD>dlant, Piet<0xC3><0xAD> in Pr<0xC5><0xAF>mn<0xC3><0xAD> Podl<0xC3><0xAD>z in Fr<0xC3><0xBD>dn<0xC3><0xAD>zn<0xC3><0xAD> in M<0xC3><0xAD>zn<0xC3><0xAD>zn<0xC3><0xAD>zn<0xC3><0xAD> street, and F<0xC3><0xAD>up.
With the restoration of the tomb of Melchior, Kry<0xC5><0xA1>tofa and Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina of Redern, Fr<0xC3><0xBD>dlant began in 2011.
Now the surface of the stone elements is purified from the application of impurities and crevices, the loosened stone parts are secured against fall and displacement; they will either be anchored to the wall or to each other.
They are also awaiting treatment and preservation of the surface.
The inscriptions on the tomb are golden again.
"Then it starts with the golding of inscriptions on marble plates with pure sheet gold," said the rapporteur of the State Memorial Care of the city office in Fr<0xC3><0xBD>dlant V<0xC4><0x9B>ra Sobotov<0xC3><0xA1>.
There are no records from the past that the tomb has undergone some repairs.
At a closer look, take in the holes, drilled in the marble columns.
They are hundreds of years old and are the remains after the decoration of the tomb.
It was richly decorated, unfortunately after the invasion of the Swedes during the Thirty Years' War everything disappeared.
Literally, they were eyeing the grave, Sobotov<0xC3><0xA1> noted.
In the Church of the Finding of the Holy Cross are restaurateurs with a slight oversized as at home.
After the flood in 2010, it was necessary to put in order the graves, which were found underwater, the baptism hall was restored, the wall paintings in the tomb and now the tomb.
"We would also like to go into the windows in the future," Sobotov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
The church is otherwise in very good condition, every year we put money into maintenance and repairs.
Restoration work on the restoration of the Redernov tomb will come to a total of 128,000 crowns.
They will be paid with grants, the city will not put any of its money into this part of the restoration.
A hundred thousand crowns will go from winning in the regional round of the Historic City of 2015 competition, the remaining 28 thousand crowns is then a contribution of the Ministry of Culture, said the Mayor of Fr<0xC3><0xBD>dlant Dan Ramzer.
The Representation decided to release the prize for the restoration of the tomb.
Expert opinions on future developments in selected foreign markets monitored through indices and comparison with the Czech capital market (PX) over a period of one and a half months.
There is low volatility and growth in the markets.
Who would have said that at the beginning of the year?
The US S&P500 index, which went 12% in February, is now at a new record high and has already recorded 7% since the beginning of the year.
Once again, the iron rule confirms that traders should never go against the interests of the central banks in the long run, which, in the end, have always achieved their own.
In a situation where U.S. stocks are at a historic high, volatility disappears again, which is currently the lowest since 2014, when markets grew satisfactorily and fearlessly thanks to the quantitative easing of the U.S. central bank and when, like today, the volatility index (VIX) remained stable.
And I don't want to.
Although the Fed continues to prepare markets for a gradual increase in interest rates, quantitative easing in Europe and Japan is in full swing and last week also joined the Bank of England, which will buy <0xC2><0xA3>70bn bonds in the next six months.
Therefore, the new wave of quantitative release pushes already low yields even lower and contributes to almost complete elimination of risk and fear of the future.
How long will this condition last?
That is, of course, a million-dollar question.
But at the moment there are no risks, the world economy is undergoing almost constant growth without major fluctuations, the situation on the commodity market and in China is stabilizing and Brexit is no longer an issue, so we should probably not be too surprised if in a similarly quiet environment.
Too bad Juncker isn't studying Klaus!
I am very pleased that my friend Michel Barnier has taken on this important and challenging task.
I wanted an experienced politician for this difficult job, said European Commission President Juncker, when a French politician (really experienced, as he was scattered by so many different transnational political functions, that the European Union would make a better example of the so-called European elites out of the European Union.
Juncker’s choice has sparked signs of hope that it is in the EU’s serious interest to seek with Britain a form of future friendly coexistence.
However, most British media accepted Barnier's name as Juncker's act of war.
Barnier is a rock European federalist.
He hates Britain.
As European Commissioner for the Internal Market (2009-2014), he was in charge of the reform of European banking law.
He conceived it as only he could understand it: the stubborn enemy of the Anglo-Saxon concept of free market and the model of capitalism.
A proponent of multilateral regulation was a co-author of the concept of the so-called banking union and resenting everything that comes from London’s financial centre City, he has passed legislation overloaded with tough regulation of the financial sector and services.
So this Michel Barnier, the representative of Paris in the dispute with London, will be a tough, unbridled and apparently ruthless negotiator.
I don't think that's good news.
In this context, let us not forget the calm and friendly division of the Czechoslovak federation, to which so much has contributed the balance, overview and empathy of Prime Minister V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Klaus.
Even today, Czechs and Slovaks can be close friends and allies.
It is a pity that Juncker did not learn from V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Klaus – at least in this regard.
It would be for the good of everyone!
Earthquakes around Putin?
The ruler of the Kremlin released his close Ivanov.
Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday dismissed Sergei Ivanov from the post of head of the presidential office.
Anton Vajno will take his place.
She informed the Russian media with a reference to the announcement by the Kremlin press service.
Putin has indicated that Ivanova will be released at his own request.
At a meeting broadcast by Rossija 24, the president said he was responding to Ivanov’s wishes when he took office to be head of the presidential office for a maximum of four years.
At the same time, he announced that Ivanov would be his special representative for ecology and transport.
The report on the exchange in the head of the president’s administration, which Ivanov’s former representative Vajno will now lead, is considered quite surprising.
Ivanov, who is 63 years old, is considered one of Putin’s closest collaborators.
For example, this former KGB officer in the past served as defense minister and deputy prime minister.
He will now leave the chair of a member of the Presidential Security Council.
Ivanov, at his meeting with Putin, however, said that the length of stay at the head of the administration of the head of state is actually a record.
He lived in it for four years and eight months.
In this context, he recalled that in the 25 years since its establishment, 11 people have already been replaced in this position.
The squirrels and the squirrels will not play in the finals.
So far, none of Friday’s tennis matches have managed to turn into a final participation.
Petra Kvitov<0xC3><0xA1> was the first to lose the match, who was surprised by Puerto Rican Monica Puigov<0xC3><0xA1> after 4:4, 6:1 and 3:6.
After a while, Kvitov<0xC3><0xA1> was followed by Czech debblista <0xC5><0xA0>af<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xAD>v<0xC3><0xA1> with Str<0xC3><0xBD>cov<0xC3><0xA1>.
The Williams sisters' first-set winners sacked after the win, but lost two sets and the Russians finally picked up the set in the shortened game.
The second set then lost by a 4-6 ratio.
The Czech skier Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Synek won his semi-finals with an overview, defeating the second Damira Martin from Croatia despite the loosening in the final by almost a second.
Today was good, the conditions were great, the wind calmed down.
I tried to save as much as possible, the son said.
Unlike him, his opponents had to fight for the course.
So it took them some strength, it could be easier for them tomorrow.
But I'm not saying it's going to be easy, it's just playing cards for me, said the rider of the Prague Dukly.
Mirka Topinkov<0xC3><0xA1>-Knapkov<0xC3><0xA1> did not walk in Snyk's footsteps.
The thirty-five-year-old rider took fourth place in today’s semi-final in her drive and on Saturday she will start in the B final and fight for 7th to 12th place.
That's not how they defend London's gold.
This is the first time I didn’t go to the Olympics.
I'm a little sorry, but on the other hand, I was driving a quality race and I put everything in it that went well.
The rivals were simply better, Topinkov<0xC3><0xA1> Knapkov<0xC3><0xA1> leaned in front of them.
She fought to the end, believing that she would get to the top of the elite six in her fourth games.
The fight gave up just in front of the target.
I knew that the girls were aligned, that anyone could pass from that field.
I was surprised by the Chinese woman who had such a finish.
And I thought I could get through Raku<0xC5><0xA1>anka to the final.
“Unfortunately, she went to a life race today,” she told the 2011 World Champion.
Far behind the finals in Rio was the young shooter Filip Nepejchal, who failed to break out of qualifying even for the second time, this time in a row.
Nepejchal finished in 33rd place.
The qualification was best for the Russians.
Sergey Kamensky scored 629 points, Kirill Grigorjan (628.9).
Nepejchall's shot was 620.5 points.
Athletes also spoke to the program in Rio for the first time, including Czech seven-year-olds Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Cachov<0xC3><0xA1> and Eli<0xC5><0xA1>ka Klu<0xC4><0x8D>inov<0xC3><0xA1>.
Cachov<0xC3><0xBD> is the eleventh place after the second Olympic competition, and the Czech record holder Eli<0xC5><0xA1>ka Klu<0xC4><0x8D>inov<0xC3><0xA1> is the twentieth.
The lead is British Katarina Johnson-Thompson, who jumped to a height of 198 centimetres as well as the second ever Belgian Nafissatou Thiam.
They both managed to achieve the best altitude performance in the history of the seven-game race.
They tried to jump 201 centimetres, but failed.
German, Russian, who's worse?
From the absurdity of the questions posed: German society has undergone deep self-reflection, whereas Russian society has not.
In both major Eurasian nations, dictators emerged in the 20th century, and regimes came to power that were inhuman, brutal, and terrible.
From 1917 to 1989, the Russian Bolsheviks contributed greatly to the 94 million victims of communism listed in the Black Book of Communism, whether it was daily individual repression, targeted starvation, incompetent warfare or inhuman experiments.
The Nazis inhumanely wiped out about 6 million Jews, and the total victims of World War II are estimated to be 60 million.
In the occupied or abandoned territories, both the Germans and the Soviets committed atrocities.
In Germany and the USSR, not only a few individuals were to blame, but a large part of the nation participated in these crimes either actively, passively, or simply by cowardice or by shoving their heads into the sand.
This is not just the specifics of these nations, we Czechs are equally to blame.
In Germany immediately the end of the war came denacification, the Nuremberg Tribunal.
But the most important thing came later.
When the children grew up, they began to ask, “Daddy, Grandpa, why did you participate in such atrocities?”
How could you!
This brought real reflection and healing to society.
Until recently, the German elites were mainly concerned with the prosperity of the country, the eradication of poverty, the well-being of their citizens.
Now they have other (often naively idealistic) goals, but it’s certainly not about rejoining Alsace-Lotrine or attacking someone – in retaliation – militarily – perhaps everyone recognizes this.
After the loss of the Cold War in Russia, there was no great reflection.
The window of possible positive changes has definitely closed at the turn of the millennium, when former KGB (sic!) officer Vladimir Putin came to power.
The criminal past is often celebrated in Russia today.
The policy of Putin’s Russia is revenge, the conquest of lost territories, the humiliation of the West.
The health, prosperity, and future of one’s own people are of no value to the faithful.
With their own, and strangers will be afraid.
I still believe that it is only in the decades of the despotic regime that the Russians are not genetically or culturally inferior – predestined to Asian (self) tyranny.
Who benefits from growing tensions around the Crimea?
The Ukrainian Army.
In recent days and hours there has been a deterioration of the situation on the Ukrainian-Russian border in the Crimean region.
Who is benefiting from rising tension?
After a long period of relative calm, relations between Ukraine and Russia have again deteriorated.
The castle of the Ukrainian party became the peninsula of Crimea, which was annexed to Russia more than 2 years ago and is part of its territory.
Of course, the reports from the two hostile parties contradict each other and it is difficult to verify them independently, so we can only think of an old familiar question to whom it benefits?
According to reports from Moscow, there have been terrorist attacks on the Crimea from the Ukrainian side, which of course Ukraine rejects and accuses the Kremlin of provocation.
On the information about the arrest of members of the Ukrainian special forces on the territory of Russia, already from the case of the pilot Savchenko a known answer that they were allegedly abducted on the territory of Russia.
If we were to approach the Ukrainian version, what would benefit Russia from the deterioration of the situation around the Crimea?
The simple answer is: in nothing.
The escalation of tensions around Crimea can only hurt Russia, especially from the West in the form of further tightening of sanctions and strengthening the anti-Russian campaign.
In the past year, in the background of the immigration crisis to Europe, attention has been withdrawn from the situation in Ukraine.
The Ukrainian leadership has already lost all credit in front of its residents when the current support of President Poroshenko is around 15%.
Ukraine’s economy would have been bankrupt long ago if there were no generous financial injections from the EU and especially the IMF.
In this situation, the Ukrainian regime needs to once again draw attention to its country in order to justify its further requests for financial assistance and try to improve its reputation in front of voters in its country.
President Poroshenko and other members of the leadership of the forces forces want to show themselves again as strong men who are not afraid to stand up to the great Russia.
It remains to be hoped that all those who are trying to start an open conflict between Ukraine and Russia will finally realize their enormous responsibility for the lives of not only soldiers, but of all ordinary people on both hostile sides and stop their animosity in time.
For the first time in eight months, Bulgaria has experienced inflation.
According to national statistics, the monthly inflation rate in Bulgaria reached 1% in July.
This is the highest in several years (since June 2012) and the first non-zero since October last year, when a positive inflation rate of 0.2% was published.
The average annual inflation rate, measured by the CPI index, for the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12-month period (August 2014 - July 2015) was -0.8%.
The consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101.0%, so monthly inflation was 1.0%.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 vs. December 2015) was -0.2% and the annual inflation rate in July 2016 vs. July 2015 was -0.2%.
Compared to the previous month, in July 2016, there was an increase in travel in the following categories of consumer goods: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), transport (1.8%), culture and recreation (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), other goods and services (0.3%).
Prices decreased for clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, household equipment and regular maintenance (0.5%), health (0.1%).
Prices for alcoholic beverages and tobacco products, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communication and education remained at the same level as last month.
U.S. intelligence agencies have been tracking Russian hackers for a year.
Information about the Russian attacks came to the public last month when the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) announced it was dealing with an attack on the servers of the Democratic Party headquarters.
However, there is no official report about Russia’s involvement in the attack.
Moscow has refused to take part in the attack.
The report of the surveillance of the alleged Russian attack was strictly secret, as its disclosure would reveal that U.S. intelligence agencies are monitoring the hacking attack and could also reveal how they do it and what resources they use.
Two Russian intelligence agencies were reportedly involved in the attack.
New Advisory Board for Cyber Security <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
The material on the Russian track was coded and accessed by only a small group of experts, Reuters reported.
Only a small group of eight leading members of Congress, called gang eight in the U.S., was informed of the public figures.
It is made up of the heads of both chambers Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan, the presidents of the Democrats in both chambers Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid, and four members of the defense and security committees of Congress.
Democratic Party chief Donna Brazile said on Thursday she was setting up an advisory body for cybersecurity to "prevent future attacks and ensure first-class protection of the Democratic Party's servers."
There was a dangerous parasite in Alberta's taken salmon.
The chain apologised.
On the basis of the consumer's initiative on health problems after consumption of food Losos wildly taken - pieces 100 g, date of consumption 22.11.2016, the Prague hygienists carried out a check in Albert stores on Wenceslas Square and Na M<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>stka.
The inspection found that the batch L23012562/T4 with the date of consumption 22.11.2016, which was notified by the customer, is no longer available, and therefore the product of the same batch with the date of consumption 11.12.2016 was removed.
The presence of Anisakis spp. Anisakis simplex was confirmed by a laboratory test.
It is a parasitic worm of the gastrointestinal tract of marine mammals.
It is dangerous for humans - larvae in the body cavity or muscle of fish are a strong allergen and human-supplied living larvae can penetrate through the stomach wall into internal organs, Stich said.
We apologise to our customers for the problems with this branded product.
We immediately removed the aforementioned lot from the sale and for preventive reasons we also removed all other lots of this item.
There was a mistake on the side of the supplier we are dealing with, and at the same time we had this product tested ourselves, Alberta spokeswoman Barbora Vanko told News.
If the customer has purchased this product, they can return it in any of the chain stores and get the money back.
The larvae will destroy the frost and sufficient heat treatment
The seller was the company Nekton - Vrn<0xC4><0x9B>ata.
On the occurrence of a dangerous product, the hygienists informed the Prague and Central Bohemia veterinary administration.
According to the server bezseknostpotravin.cz, people after eating the parasite can become ill with anisakiosis, which manifests itself with severe abdominal pain, vomiting and nausea, or the disease can occur without symptoms, <0xC4><0x8C>TK said.
Symptoms occur one hour to two weeks after consuming insufficiently heat-treated infected fish.
Three weeks after the onset of the disease, the larvae usually spontaneously leave the digestive tract.
Adult worms and larvae are sensitive to higher and lower temperatures, so they are killed either by heat treatment of fish meat or by freezing it.
Veterinarians have also checked salmon for the recipient of imported goods in the Central Bohemian Region.
Three of the five samples studied had a parasite in them.
The shipment of 1700 products arrived in the Czech Republic according to the State Veterinary Administration (SVS) at the beginning of April.
Expedited, in the vast majority to the Ahold chain, there were 919 packages to date.
Currently, unsold stocks of the product are being downloaded from sales, SVS spokesperson Petr Pejchal said on Friday.
Veterinarians immediately after finding positive samples prohibited the shipment of other products from the warehouse.
The seventeen-year-old British woman wanted to escape from Rakka, apparently killed by a Russian raid.
After initial enthusiasm and a quick marriage to a jihadist who was soon killed, there was a rejuvenation.
The expected paradise of the caliphate for British girls turned into hell on earth, from which there was no escape.
According to relatives, the girl was in contact with her sister Halim.
She phoned her to Britain repeatedly and told her she wanted to go home.
Leaving the Islamic State is like trying to escape from Alcatraz.
They are ordered to shoot without hesitation, the Telegraph's family lawyer Tasnim Akunjee said.
The last traces led to Rakka, from where the girl called for the last time.
Then there was only a report of her death, which could not be verified.
The family communicated with her from an apartment in East London.
They discussed together how she could get out of Rakka and cross the Turkish border.
They were hoping to meet their ex-student again.
But Kadiz was probably killed before she could escape because the house where she was staying was compared to the ground in May, according to the British ITV News.
TV added that the bomb was apparently dropped by a Russian plane that attacked the IS basin in Syria.
“You could dream blue from the sky just to get your child out of a dangerous area,” said Tasnim Akunjee, a family lawyer.
In the week when (Qadiza) was thinking of fleeing the territory of the Islamic State, one Raku<0xC5><0xA1>anka was captured in an attempt to escape and, according to available information, was publicly killed.
I think she put it out as a warning and decided not to take the risk, according to BBC Akunjee.
The family would do anything.
Kadiza Sutlana, along with 15-year-old schoolmates Shamima Begum and Amira Abas, went on a trip on 17 February last year.
All they said at home was that they were going out.
However, they targeted Gatwick Airport and from it via Turkey in the territory controlled by IS.
The girl's family, according to the lawyer, did everything in her power to get Kadiza back.
You would dream blue from the sky just to get your baby out of a dangerous area, and this family would do everything they could, strain all their efforts to get their daughter home.
But it was not possible without them, without risking being caught on their own, the lawyer added.
The only positive, he said, is that the fate of Kadiz could serve as a deterrent for other girls or even boys who are let down by Islamist propaganda.
"There are many cases when people have gone there, realized how things are going, understood how far it differs from the promises of Islamic State propaganda, and wanted to return," Akunjee said.
The fate of Kadiz's classmates is unknown.
But since they have also been silenced, their families must accept that they are most likely to be dead.
To prison for money.
In Scotland, you can go to jail without committing a crime.
For many centuries, the village of Inveraray was the county centre and seat of the Duke of Argyll.
Since the middle of the 18th century, courts were held in the town hall and the basement under the hall served as a local prison.
The conditions in which the convicts stayed were sad, and many inmates tried to escape.
A lot of them were successful.
Therefore, city officials decided to move the prison premises to a new location.
The new building was completed in 1848 and was much more welcoming to the prisoners, had heating and gas lighting.
It was not in operation for a long time, it was closed for economic reasons at the end of August 1889, because the smaller repair equipment was expensive to operate and did not pay much.
Stories of Punishers and Ghost Hunt.
The prison opened to the public a whole century later, visitors can compare the old building with the new one to see for themselves how the different conditions prevailed in them.
Guides in antique costumes still enhance the authentic experience.
There is also a torture room where visitors can find out what forms of punishment were applied to the criminal, whether it was breaking fingers or burning marks on the body.
As part of the tour, tourists can be locked up in one of the cells, mostly because of a photo on the memorial, or to convey the feeling that prisoners experience behind bars.
Inveraray Prison is one of the most famous places in Scotland where it is said to be feared.
There have already been several groups of hunters of paranormal activities there and to this day the museum allows people to come and hunt some ghosts.
That night, of course, will cost <0xC2><0xA3>300, which is about 9,500 kroner.
Apart from this popular tourist attraction, the village also attracts great food, surrounding panoramas and history.
The “Anime” effect on Snapchat is criticized as an Asian cartoon
According to Snapchat, this filter is inspired by anime, but some observers say it is racially insensitive.
Every day, Snapchat allows about 150 million users to change reality and play with identity in ways that border on absurdity.
You can make yourself a pineapple, a dog, or a character that seems to emerge from Roy Lichtenstein’s image.
Filters are simple tools that deform reality and generate more than 30 million improved selfies every day.
Any errors will be made public immediately.
Snapchat’s filters have in the past earned criticism with the accusation that the app promotes blackfacing or that it supports white skin shades as an ideal of beauty.
So when she offered users a filter this week that allowed them to have curved eyes, curved teeth and inflated faces, some critics called it a racist Asian cartoon - "yellowface."
And they asked if these repeated controversial questions did not point to the larger problem of society - the problem of diversity.
On Wednesday, Verge and Motherboard wrote about it, and the news and outrage quickly spread, and Snapchat announced the next day that it had canceled the feature.
The company offered an explanation: The filter was intended as an expression of anime characters’ accounts, not as a cartoon of Asians.
But to observers who witnessed racism, the filter resembled painful stereotypes in action.
The others without the packaging compared to the anime rejected.
Grace Sparapani, an American art student from Korea, whose photo tweet was widely shared, said in an email that the filter was "at least harmful and embarrassing."
She added that “it is difficult to argue against the comparison of the obvious Asian cartoon and the effects of the filter.
It turns out that the filter is not only about the yellow face (yellowface), but that the yellow face is reached to the despised extreme.
Snapchat is not the only company that has crossed these cultural boundaries.
It seems that American culture has an endless struggle for diversity and inclusion, from corporate halls to Hollywood and the equipment that we all carry in our hands.
And the huge number of young people on Snapchat — who are more racially diversified than their older partners — may mean that even greater sensitivity can be expected.
“When one Snapchat filter creates an image that is offensive to some user,” Katie Zhu, 25, said Thursday in an interview, “it’s only very hard to get around these things today without noticing it as it used to be.”
Katie Zhu, a product manager and designer working for Medium, decided on Thursday to delete her Snapchat account and urged others to do the same.
In an article for Medium and in a phone interview, she said she was convinced that racially motivated issues reflect a lack of diversity in recruiting employees on Snapchat.
Katie Zhu criticized the predominantly white, all-male leadership of the company and ended the article with the hashtag: <0x23>DeleteSnapchat.
“It’s either that they don’t have any diversity between employees and colored people at the moment when they decide these things,” said Zhu, who is of Sino-American origin, “or colored people work there, but not in positions to feel safe or comfortable.”
Other observers share her opinion - a complaint that Snapchat largely left unanswered.
The company does not publish figures relating to the diversity of its employees with the fact that it has the status of a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to talk about the racial origin of its employees, but the spokesperson said it had recently hired a recruiter who should focus on underrepresented populations and internal management of inclusion.
Zhuov<0xC3><0xA1> adds: “I’m curious if they really need other users like that who can say that it’s not okay,” with their account being cancelled.
Military officers smeared intelligence information about ISIS, says parliamentary committee
In a report released on Thursday, the Parliamentary Committee said U.S. Central Command officials had changed intelligence reports to draw a more optimistic picture of the war against ISIS in Iraq and Syria than it had done in the past.
According to the preliminary report of the working group compiled by the Republican Chairman of the Armed Forces Committee, the Intelligence Committee and the Subcommittee on Defense, there was a "gross dissatisfaction" among the analysts of the Iskél<0xC3><0xAD>k's peers and the Iskél<0xC3><0xAD>k<0xC3><0xAD>k's central intelligence services, according to which they found him.
The Central Command, known as CentCom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which oversees U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
In a press release to the report, it said: "The intelligence services' statements approved by senior Centcom officers usually offered a more positive picture of U.S. counter-terrorism efforts than were confirmed by the factual factions on the ground, and were more inconsistently positive."
"What happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our fighters are damaged when the top policy makers are presented with the wrong analysis," Ken Calvert, a congressman and a Republican from California, said in a statement.
The failure to lead Centcom reaches to the top of the organization.
The 10-page report describes in detail the ongoing problems of the central staff in describing and analyzing U.S. efforts to train Iraqi forces in 2014 and 2015.
While there is no decisive evidence that senior Obama administration officials have ordered the reports to be amended, the report states that analysts had the impression that they were under pressure from the leaders of Centcom to present a more optimistic view of the ISIS state of danger.
“In the first half of 2015, many press releases from the central staff, statements and congressional resignations were significantly more positive than the actual events,” the report said.
For example, the representative of Centcom publicly stated that a major military attack on the takeover of Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, remains under the control of ISIS.
"This is quite clear after months of investigation," said MP Mike Pompeo, a representative of the Republican Party in Kansas.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, U.S. intelligence personnel manipulated the top positions with staff intelligence outputs in order to mitigate the danger of ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicans set up a working group after learning about analysts’ concerns that intelligence services’ information about the Islamic State is being manipulated.
Following the report published on Thursday, further investigations must be followed by more detailed investigations.
In the intelligence services of Centcom, further investigations are underway, led by the Inspector General of the Ministry of Defense.
The Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday, which corresponded to some of the conclusions of the working group of Republicans.
“Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom has created a very narrow process for compiling assessments of information on IS and Iraqi security components,” said Adam B. Schiff, chairman of the committee and representative of the Democrats.
According to Adam Schiff, the process “leads to a distortion of intelligence outputs,” damaged morale among analysts, and “lacked in consideration of disagreements.”
However, Schiff and the Democrats say they have found no evidence that the White House is trying to push analysts at Centcom to adjust their conclusions according to “the subject or political situation.”
The preliminary results of the parliamentary investigation were published in the Daily Beast on Tuesday.
Last August, the New York Times reported on an ongoing investigation by the Pentagon’s Inspector General, which was launched following complaints from analysts at Centcom.
Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans, spokesman for the Pentagon, said in a statement that the Department of Defense will not comment on the parliamentary report, as the Inspector General’s investigation is still ongoing.
However, he said that “experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of comprehensive data, and that the intelligence community and the Department of Defense welcome a sound dialogue on these key issues of national security.”
The investigation has implications beyond the question of whether the American-led bombings in Iraq and Syria are successful (a statement that now proclaims an increasing number of defense officials).
Last year’s indictment, however, raised questions about the extent to which President Obama can rely on central staff to honestly assess military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis locations.
Criticism of the Islamic State in 2003 reflects conflicts for more than a decade, when Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker wrote a research paper stating that the administration of President George W. Bush would have a reluctance to do so, in spite of the objections of many analysts.
Hooker also played a key role in the resistance to the Islamic State intelligence services.
Last year, the authorities announced that Hooker’s team had concluded that despite a public statement on the contrary, the airstrikes carried out against the Islamic State refineries did not significantly weaken the financial resources of this terrorist group, and the group did not weaken in time.
The Times reported in September that the findings had not been transferred outside of the central staff.
The Centcom Commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was then criticised last year after many lawmakers found the Senate's testimony too positive by evaluating the war.
General Austin resigned in April and was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel at Centcom.
The United States won ground hockey in the fourth game in a row, so today will be a decisive match in the UK team
Katie Bam in a match against Japan, which ended in a 6-1 win, shot three goals and just the day after for the American women's field hockey team, she shot the first two goals of the match, in which America defeated India 3-0 on Thursday.
Five goals in two matches is a memorable success, but Bamov<0xC3><0xA1> (27) said she wasn’t sure if she had ever done something like this.
"I have no idea," she said.
I'm not one of those people who write their goals.
But he knows this: the Americans in the Olympic tournament lead to games 4:0 and share the first place in the group with Great Britain, which remained on Thursday after defeating Japan 2:0 remained undefeated.
The United Kingdom and the United States will face each other on Saturday in the final match of the first round.
Both teams qualified for the quarter-finals and the match will decide which of the group of six teams will end up in first place and who will finish in second place.
The team from the first place will evade the strong Danes, who lead the second group.
Whatever Saturday’s game ends, the Americans here have sparked a stir with their surprising drive, four years after they finished among the 12 teams at the London Games.
Bamboo was also on the team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and took up hockey for the first time when she was 3 years old (her older twin sister played in Drexel) and joined the national team when she was 16 and became his youngest ever player.
In 2008, she missed the Olympics because she didn't make it to the final.
Then came the year 2012, when neither she nor members of her team had much success.
The following year he was named coach by Englishman Craig Parnham and things began to change.
“Cultural change, mental change, physical change,” said Bamov<0xC3><0xA1>.
We didn’t have the pace of work in London as we do today.
We made a full turn.
On Thursday night, Bamov<0xC3><0xA1> started in the first half by firing a close-knit goal.
India entered the match without a win in the tournament, but the team proved to be surprisingly tough and maintained a score of 1:0 until the end of the third quarter, when Bama took advantage of the opportunities.
She escaped on the left side of the playing field, then slammed into the center and shot the ball into the goal to get the Americans in the lead 2-0.
Melissa Gonzalez added the last goal in the half of the fourth quarter.
The elimination of the American goalkeeper, Jackie Briggs, who helped one goal in each of the three wins, was the first in the tournament.
He's in great shape.
Just like Bam's.
"We're in a good place now," Parnham said, but how good it is will depend on the result of Saturday's game.
Zen trampoline in the middle of the Olympic brawl
It doesn't matter where you are, it doesn't matter what time it is - it's the Olympics.
From the events in Rio de Janeiro, there is a persistent, indescribable and enthusiastic fluctuation of competitiveness and effort.
It’s like the Olympic season itself is a hot relay pen that is passed down from a sniper to a swimmer, a gymnast, and a triathlete.
You can’t turn on television, read newspapers, or listen to your neighbor’s conversation in the front line of the café without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecka, or the innocence between Michael Phelps and Chad le Close.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, the impending lover of women with facial socks, is at the Olympics for the first time and could also be among those whose names will be heard in households in the main broadcast time between advertising and sponsor spots, if he were a swimmer, gymnast or even a sledgehammer.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is fighting for Olympic gold in a trampoline jump.
The Olympic fire doesn't shine at all competitions the same way.
Far from the center, a little in the shadow are sports that are not generally recognized: airgun shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
We will always be successful in the classic swimming style - and will probably rule for a long time.
But if I can name my extraordinary favorite, let me draw attention to the inconspicuous charm of the trampoline.
Although jumping on a trampoline is an Olympic sport since 2000, when it was first introduced at the Sydney Games, it remains almost unnoticed after 16 years of intervention - many of the people I've asked didn't even know it was an Olympic sport.
It can be about regional indifference.
The U.S. has never won a trampoline jumping medal, and until 2012, none of the athletes reached the final.
Prices in the men's category are usually divided between China and Russia and in the women's category between China and Canada.
This year, the gold medals from London will be awarded to Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada.
But the jumps on the trampoline have yet another misfortune, partly because the unconsecrated ear will seem to be more suited to a clown university than to the Olympics.
I have to admit, I'm not an expert, I'm just an enthusiast watching from the country.
It has comedic potential – the comic vibes of endless reflection – but also the skill of gymnastics and diving, two sports that combine.
The word "trampolin" is derived from the Spanish "el trampol<0xC3><0xAD>n", which means "scokan board."
The aspiring champions jump on a huge trampoline that shoots them to a height of up to 10 meters and perform sets with several elements (salts, bolts and combinations) before finally landing on their feet again.
According to the official Olympic program, they are evaluated by performance, difficulty and "times in the air".
In Rio, it will be contested by thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women.
The usual trajectory of the Olympic track is ahead.
Gold medalists must go on, faster and even higher, sometimes up to the end, sometimes back and forth, up and down.
He is trying to grab not only the target tape or the starter wall, but, as TV news reports, another imaginary line: the world or the Olympic record.
This unanimous effort is noble, admirable, a bit fanatical – and enough to bring the audience to tears.
But I think it's a bit exhausting when you're watching the Olympics.
The jumps on the trampoline bring relief in this regard.
The track of the athlete on the trampoline is upwards.
The point is not to move forward.
He or she reflects as if they were in a weightless state like astronauts, flying up, then down, and then again without effort up.
Without competition and of course not even difficulty, but for the duration of the composition there will be no angry fight to achieve the goal, no distance measurement, but only perfect, gentle delivery of time and gravity.
This is just the closest we'll get to the Olympics and Zen.
The women's qualifying and finals are held on Friday afternoon, at 1 p.m. Eastern Time, then the men's competition on Saturday at the same time.
The NBC station will broadcast the finals as part of the afternoon block, which starts after both days at 2 p.m.
In the midst of the Olympic madness, they promise quiet, pleasant moments that you will most likely miss through other struggles.
And if the attention is only to the fact that male athletes will be the subject of infatuation and materialization — as recently suggested by U.S. gymnasts — then Logan Dooley is just waiting for his new fans to pulse.
"Protesting Generation" in Ethiopia, a longtime ally of the United States
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Protesters demanding political change in Ethiopia have faced violent opposition from the government.
Witnesses say many protesters have been killed during clashes with the police.
Is there a war in Ethiopia?
Over the past decade, it has been one of the most stable nations in Africa, a strong Western alliance with a fast-growing economy.
In recent months, however, the country has been plagued by anti-government unrest, which is spreading to more and more areas.
In the past week alone, thousands of people have taken to the streets demanding major political changes.
According to human rights organizations, the government’s reaction was merciless.
Witnesses say the police shot and killed crowds of unarmed demonstrators.
On rolling video footage of protests, likely coming from late last year or early this year, security forces are caught smashing young people with a whip after being forced to stand on the wall.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights is now calling for a thorough investigation.
“It has always been difficult to keep this country together and taking a step forward will be even more difficult,” said Rashid Abdi, head of the Horn of Africa project for the International Crisis Group.
Ethiopia is the second most populous nation in Africa after Nigeria and its stability is supported by the West.
The U.S. military and intelligence agencies are working closely with the Ethiopians to eliminate the threat of a terrorist attack in the area, especially in Somalia, and a handful of African countries, if any, are getting such assistance from the West.
The economy of Ethiopia has evolved at an impressive pace.
Its infrastructure has been significantly improved - in the capital Addis Ababa there is even a new suburban train.
And the streets of the city are typically quiet, safe and clean.
But Ethiopia can hardly be described as a model of democracy – an organization fighting for human rights without stopping talking about government repression – the opposition in the country has been suppressed, dissidents effectively silenced.
Many of them have been resigned, imprisoned, killed or driven far into the desert.
However, this may change.
“When people are suffocated and they have no choice but to protest, there will be a breakthrough,” said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer at the University of Central Ethiopia.
All young people are protesting.
A whole generation is protesting.
Complaints are many and concern everything from land disputes to absolute control of the power of the ruling coalition.
After last year’s election, which was widely criticized, the ruling party and its allies won the last opposition-held seat and now controls 100 percent in parliament.
At the same time, there is increasing pressure on the Eritrea border, and the conflict along this imprecisely marked, disputed border has claimed hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatist groups that have been more or less repressed over the past few years, such as the Roman Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, may try to exploit the confusion and re-arm themselves.
There are several factors that explain why now, after years of smoking under the surface, these bitter feelings are burning up again.
The first of these is seemingly harmless: smart phones.
Many Ethiopians can communicate through social networks up to the last few years, when cheaper smartphones have become commonly available and the provision of internet services has improved.
And even though the government bans access to Facebook or Twitter, as is usually the case especially during protests, many people can still communicate via Internet proxys that hide the location of these people.
Several young Ethiopians spoke about how they gathered for the protests.
Moreover, there is greater solidarity between the Oromians and the Amhars, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
The Oromans and Amhars are not natural allies.
For many centuries the Amhars, mostly from the Christian peaks of Ethiopia, excelled in politics and commerce, using the Oroms, many of which are Muslims and live in the lowlands.
But it also changes.
“We are on our way to a unified leadership,” said Mulata Gemechu, the leader of the Oromo.
The largest protests took place in the Amharic and Oromic inhabited areas.
Many Amhars and Oromans believe that Ethiopia is wrongly dominated by members of the Tigray ethnicity, which makes up about 6 percent of the population and controls the army, intelligence services, trade and politics.
The third reason for the unrest is Meles Zenawi's death.
Zenawi, a former leader of the rebels, was the Ethiopian prime minister for 17 years until his death in 2012, when he suffered from an unspecified illness.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could see around the corner.
Analysts say he was particularly masterful in detecting the initial signs of dissatisfaction and used envoys to process and gain opponents on his side.
“The current regime lacks basic knowledge,” said Abdi, a conflict analyst.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Desalegn, was withdrawn from relative ignorance in order to replace Zenawi.
Unlike Zenawi, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say they don’t trust the Tigris-controlled security services.
Many fear that the result will be another bloodshed.
Ethiopia last experienced such unrest in 2005 after thousands of people protested against what analysts described as elections that the government voted for and then stole.
This was followed by a hard strike, during which many protesters were killed – albeit less than in the past few months – and this period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts have praised Ethiopia’s leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new suburban train and measurable progress in the fight against poverty.
Of course, it is quite clear that the gradual increase in disputes within the Ethiopian government did not stop it.
And there is a dangerous ethnic formation.
Last month, protesters in the Amharic city of Gondar attacked commercial companies owned by the Tigris, and resentment against the Tigris on social media is becoming more common.
Analysts say the protests are putting the U.S. and other Western allies in a turbulent situation.
The U.S. government is using Ethiopia as a base for drone crossings over neighboring Somalia, although it has recently declared that the base has been closed.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, at the same time it does not want its ally to disintegrate in such a volatile area.
"That," said Abdi, "is a very sharp edge of the blade."
Donald Trump Explains His Statement on Obama and Financing ISIS as “Sarcasm”
Donald J. Trump on Friday tried to undermine the latest controversy that flooded his campaign, saying he didn’t mean it seriously when he insisted several times this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the “founders” of the Islamic State terrorist group.
The explanations raised new questions about the Republican candidate’s ability to speak clearly to the American public.
He also puts his supporters in an awkward situation, who have been hard-pressed in stormy times, and must explain that his remarks may not have been taken seriously.
Following this proposal at a Wednesday night meeting, Trump confirmed the statement on Thursday and insisted in the interviews that he did not really intend to say that the president and H. Clinton created ISIS.
But in a tweet on Friday morning, Trump said he was only sarcastic.
The post was the opposite of the old one-day claim, when Trump said in several interviews that he was serious about his accusations.
When conservative radio moderator Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump mitigate the note by reminding him that Obama is trying to destroy ISIS, the Republican candidate for president did not respond.
The latest storm comes at a time when Trump has tried to focus his campaign on the economy, while his preferences in election polls are dropping.
Trump and Clinton participated in this week’s Michigan duel on economic issues.
On Friday, Trump tried to come back on the issue.
On Twitter, he again warned that Clinton’s proposals were linked to a tax increase, and said that he said her speech was boring.
Trump has used sarcasm in the past.
At the end of July, when he slammed a wave of criticism, when he proposed that the Russians should infiltrate Clinton’s emails, he later explained his remark with the words: “I’m, of course, sarcastic.”
This approach allows Trump to push the boundaries of political statements and to mitigate them as needed.
"I think it's his way of testing the extent to which some of his supporters' response messages have to find out how they react, and then, according to the reaction, "submit an explanation in one way or another," said Ruth Sherman, a communications specialist who monitors the language, who both candidate.
But I also think that he is useful in his statements and knows that they are vague enough to be explained in a different way.
As the results of the election polls continue to decline in his favor, Trump has chosen an even more crisp tone in recent days, rather than targeting things for the general electorate.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist survey, which was published on Friday, showed that Tump is at a great distance behind Clinton in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado and very close behind her in Florida.
Trump is trying to avoid apologising for the provocative statements he says, but he often accuses his critics of misinterpreting his words or misunderstanding his sense of humor.
But along with Trump’s heightened attention in the final months of the presidential campaign, Trump’s jokes have put his loyal supporters, who must publicly stand behind him, in whatever provocative way his remarks may be.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York City, who is one of Trump’s most prominent supporters, had to defend the candidate extensively on Thursday in an interview with CNN.
“I think what he’s saying is a legitimate political comment,” Giuliani said, when asked about Trump’s credibility of the claim that Obama and Clinton founded the Islamic State.
That's true in the sense that before Obama, ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, which he mistakenly called a newcomer, and it happened because he pulled his troops out of Iraq.
Most ordinary Republicans try to argue that the Obama administration, in which Clinton served as Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to thrive and failed to aggressively handle the situation in the Middle East.
Before Friday’s gatherings in Pennsylvania, Trump continued to fire media outlets around him on Twitter for reciting every word he had said and being concerned about him.
He laughed at the “poor, pathetic” TV students who were trying to understand him, and said, “They can’t!”
Several Democrats apologised to Trump for saying it was just another proof that he was not eligible for the presidential office.
The cafe has been pushed out of the price market. Now it is back in Greenpoint
The Verb Cafe was a cool place in Williamsburg where you could only pay in cash, without Wi-Fi, but where coffee has been served for 15 years.
Naturally, she was pushed out of the front of the house on Bedford Avenue.
Soap Cherie - a store that Verb replaced in the summer of 2014 - sells soaps in the form of cakes.
The locals mourned it as the last loss of a growing city.
Molly Crabapple tweeted: "New York is a change, I know, but I still can't believe that the CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel is ripped off and Verb is now a soap shop."
But if New York is a change, then it's also a rediscovery.
Resurrected Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new verb has wifi and accepts payment cards, but some of the original employees work there and there is a similar, modest atmosphere.
Coffee is still good, too.
Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the original coffee shop, is the manager of the new Verbo, who is also the owner and CEO of the new location.
It started in 2001 and remained until the end.
When one of the customers offered him to pay for the move to a new location, he said he would gladly do it.
Rodriguez (36) left a lot of things as they were.
The verb still has the same bakery supplier and bought the same model of the espresso machine.
He even used the illumination of the old Word again.
Rodriguez said he wanted to try something new.
He began to use new ingredients.
There are sandwiches with ham, egg and cheese and toppings such as capers and fried onions.
You will also find dishes with brown rice here.
The café no longer serves beer, but offers you fresh fruit juices.
After nine months, Rodriguez noticed a steady influx of original rodents.
“A number of original customers also had to move out of Williamsburg because of prices,” he said.
Last Sunday, one of those customers, Rebecca Oliveiro, was here.
Ms. Oliveiro (34) lived in Williamsburg and went to the Verb Cafe often.
It happened even after the coffee shop moved to Greenpoint.
She said that when Verb shut down, she stopped drinking coffee for a while.
“I found out that what I like is coffee and culture in Verb,” she said.
Now she drinks coffee again, but that day, instead of her usual iced coffee, she gave herself a mixed chai, another novelty.
Tom Rosenthal, another long-time customer, has been dedicated to Verba since 2003.
He walks in front of work and always orders the same thing.
“At four and eight o’clock every day, like clocks, I come here and they’re already preparing my bag with everything and butter for me,” he said.
Photo: Rodriguez said he wanted to try something new and add new ingredients to the menu.
Mr. Rosenthal continues to order what he usually does, but sometimes he lets himself put bacon, eggs and ham on his lap.
Rodriguez said he didn't regret the soap business taking his old place.
The truth is that the owners of Soap Cherie offered him to make a special soap for Verb and use filtered coffee from a coffee shop as an ingredient.
"I think we could still use it," Rodriguez said.
The traditional Polish residents of Greenpoint also welcomed the café well.
One of the new customers translated the offer into Polish and Rodriguez said he wanted to find a place where he would soon exhibit it so that his new neighbors would feel at home here.
The new location has other advantages.
A local producer of fruit juices wants to put in bottles and sell filtered coffee.
There is an opportunity for the café to expand into the neighboring building.
For many customers, it is enough that they have regained their old favorite.
Joseph Whitt was a regular customer, and when the cafe closed, he said it broke his heart.
Mr. Whitt says that when the café reopened, coming in and having coffee is like coming home.
"I missed the smell," he said.
Depressed food from the time of crisis - in "Square Meal"
Shortly after joining the office of President in March 1933, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat in the Oval Office and had lunch.
President Roosevelt’s lavender enjoyed selected dishes from 5th Avenue, such as a pastry made from gooseberries and a Maryland tortoise soup.
But his menu for that day was more modest: eggs in a devilish way in a tomato sauce, potato pie and as a dessert poodle pudding.
“It was an act of chef solidarity with the people who suffered,” said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added, “It was also a message to Americans how to eat.”
The couple, who live in Brooklyn Heights, is devoted to gastronomic history.
Andrew Coe’s last book, “Chop Suey,” was about Chinese cuisine in America, while Jane, in her book, “97 Orchard,” tells the life story of a dwelling house on the Lower East Side through food.
Their new collaborative work, A Square Meal, released by Harper on Tuesday, is a history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.
They showed chef solidarity and met with the reporter at a dinner at the Eisenberg sandwich shop, a small, spicy buffet in Flatiron, which has been in operation since the crisis, since 1929.
Jane (54) ordered cream cheese and a sandwich with chopped olives, Andrew (57) gave her a crocan, potato sauce and mixed vegetables.
The reporter ordered a meat carbanate, which, according to the couple, was perfectly suited for a meal interview during the crisis.
“The carnations were very popular,” said Ms. Ziegelman.
Peanut, liver and bean carbanate were sold.
They were made from that mixture and other inexpensive foods that set the ingredient.
Think about the amount of buckwheat you’ll have to eat for dinner.
Andrew Coe sneezed.
"They'd be in your stomach like lead," he said.
In the years before the crisis, American cuisine, especially in rural areas, was served in the form of a buffet of what you eat.
The women's teams cooked for the farm workers and freshly baked cake was served for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to the starving Europeans during World War I. The “A Square Meal” follows the ways in which the nation coped with the fact that it was suddenly not a land of abundance.
"It was a time when food became a central, feared point for the American people," Coe said, explaining why he and his wife decided to write about it.
Equally feared was the new budget diet: Mysterious foods such as carrots and crustaceans, crustaceans as an “awesome way to use the leftovers,” noted Ziegelman, as chefs could hide non-aesthetic ingredients on the underlay.
The fresh fruit was replaced by a cheaper dried fruit.
Meat - after many years at the heart of American food - has become a cost-saving luxury.
The strange mixtures that were meant to serve as a calorie and nutritional filler were preferred over taste or even common sense when cooking.
During the surveys for a book containing recipes, Ms. Ziegelman prepared a seasonal meal of roasted onion filled with peanut butter.
"It wasn't a favorite addition to the dinner table," said Andrew Coe.
As Jane Ziegelman said, “It was surreal.”
Peanut butter with roasted onion doesn't fit together.
It was typical of a lot of homemade recipes.
As never before and never after, domestic economists—including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Office for Home Economics from 1923 to 1943—managed the country’s eating habits.
They published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, called on women to take over budget cuts, and slicks such as cream spaghetti with carrots turned into tasty food.
The book “A Square Meal” is a celebration of historical delights.
First of all, the cakes were created in the government’s response to its hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover’s “I’ll give myself a cake.”
While publicly praising the simple Ioannian farm kitchen of his childhood, he served as the chosen millionaire he became.
“He liked to eat continental cuisines like fish with cucumber sauce,” said Andrew Coe.
He ate in an almost gold-plated room, wearing a tuxedo.
He was incredibly old-fashioned.
President Roosevelt would probably have made the same mistakes if his wife Eleanor hadn’t told him to set an example for his own stomach.
As the book tells us, Mrs. Roosevelt hired a housewife who was not interested in the taste at all, which led to the White House “not only serving almost the finest food in all of Washington, but also the most unfortunately prepared.”
Many of the eating habits of the crisis have faded as the country re-established itself.
The link has remained in our ongoing exploration of calories and nutrients, says Ms. Ziegelman, and in the way science applies to cooking.
The couple says that while writing the book, they better understood Ms. Ziegelman’s mother’s eating habits – perhaps why she couldn’t throw away the food.
“She was really afraid of wasting food,” Andrew Coe said.
Ziegelman recalled, “It was bad for people.”
There was an accident with a spoon.
When the tables were clean at Eisenberg's, she and Mr. Coe pulled out the dessert they had prepared at home: the plum dessert that President Roosevelt had for lunch.
"It's called plum cream," Ziegelman said, adding that the usual trick was to give modest recipes elegant names.
There wasn't any cream, just plums, some flour, sugar, water, and cinnamon.
Everyone unwittingly shoved a spoonful of thick brown matter.
Surprisingly, it was bad.
Andrew Coe added, and then again.
And as a proper farmer, he said to his wife, "There would be some haircuts going on."
Europeans: Migrants go for allowances.
Most of the refugees who are coming to Europe are coming for economic reasons.
Young Russians are making fun of themselves.
That's what the series would look like if we shot them.
A group of Russian artists, who call themselves 2D Among Us, is making fun of their home country.
Using Photoshop, he creates collages that funnyly show what it would look like if famous series and movies were shot in Russia.
Gilead is entitled to reimbursement of the costs of legal representation in the case of a type C patent against Merck
A district court judge ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc. is entitled to reimburse the fees for lawyers it has incurred in the case of a type C patent against drug manufacturers of Merck & Co Inc.
In June, a ruling was overturned that Gilead was to pay $200 million for damages for violating two of Merck’s patents in connection with the highly successful Gilead, Sovaldi and Harvoni drugs, after a federal judge repeatedly found out that the company had not been followed by a federal judge.
Federal judge Beth Labson Freeman said Thursday that Gilead is entitled to waive fees incurred in connection with the representation in the case.
Merck is trying to reach Gilead, which dominates the market for new-generation medicines against type C jaundice, which can cure more than 90 percent of patients with this liver disease.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other and claimed to be the owner of basic laboratory research for sofosbuvir, the active ingredient of Gilead’s drugs.
U.S.-backed military forces claim to have gained full control of the city of Manbij
U.S.-backed troops gained full control of the northern city of Manbij near the border with Turkey after the last Islamic State fighters fled the city, a group spokesman said on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) is now clamoring for the rest of the group of radicals who have been hiding in the city.
The units liberated more than 2,000 civilians detained by radicals, Sharfan Darwish of the SDF alliance and the military council of Manbij told Reuters.
“The city is now fully under our control, but we are still looking into it,” he told Reuters.
In 2015, Clinton earned $10.75 million and paid a federal tax rate of 34.2 percent.
Hillary Clinton released her 2015 tax return on Friday, stating that the Democratic presidential candidate and her husband had an income of $10.75 million in the year and deducted a real tax of 34.2 percent.
In 2015, they donated $1 million to Clinton for a charity, mostly to the Clinton Foundation. President Bill Clinton contributed to the joint fund with an almost $5.3 million fee for lectures, and the former Secretary of State gave a donation to Simon for an income of $3 million.
Clinton's co-candidate, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, along with his wife Anne Holton, released a tax return in 10 years.
In 2015, they paid a real tax of 20.3 percent.
“Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to be a model of financial transparency,” said Jennifer Palmieri, who helped Clinton with the campaign.
On the contrary, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and shrugs off his earlier promises to publicize his tax returns.
It is a custom for candidates for President of the United States to publish their tax returns, even if they are not required to do so by law.
Trump, a New York merchant, and his lawyers cited an audit of the U.S. Treasury Department as a reason for his refusal to release a tax return.
“Your move,” campaign proponent Hillary Clinton said on Twitter, citing a tax confession of a Democratic candidate.
Michael Cohen, Trump’s special adviser, told CNN on Thursday that he would not allow Trump to release a tax return until the audits are over.
Trump’s critics, including 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney and other members of the Republican Party, agree that his rejection raises questions about his net profits, contributions to charity, business transactions, and various other relations in Russia.
Clinton has made a strong statement on the issue and released a video on Friday reminding her of the Republicans’ high standing on Trump urging him to release their tax returns.
On Thursday, he mentioned the issue in his speech on economic issues in Michigan.
“She refuses to do what all the other presidential candidates have done for decades — to make her tax returns public,” she said in front of people.
Politico said Trump had paid no or very low taxes in the last two years of the 1990s, and a New York Times publicist cited a number of tax advisers and accountants who claim it may be the case today.
The federal tax rate became the subject of the presidential election.
Clinton enforces a rule named after billionaire Warren Bufett that would ensure that everyone who makes more than $1 million a year will pay a tax of at least 30 percent.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
Last week, Buffett at a Clinton meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, where Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate is based, called on Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said he also went through an IRS audit and that Trump was “not afraid” of the financial authority, but of voters.
Clinton's campaign published a tax return until 2007, and the tax return was announced.
The Clintons, now living in Chappaqua, New York State, paid an average federal tax of 32 percent between 2007 and 2014, and a combined tax of about 40.5 percent.
According to Clinton’s 2015 tax return, unlike most Americans, they make only $100 in their incomes.
Their main investment was a low-cost mutual index fund, from which Clinton reported dividend and interest income of $109,000.

Condoms filled with chilli or fireworks for elephant protection in Tanzania
Protectors of nature in Tanzania use an unorthodox way to prevent elephants from entering human habitations – throwing condoms filled with chilli powder on them.
This procedure has been proven by the Honeyguide Foundation, which came up with the idea a few years ago, together with the American environmental organization The Nature Conservancy, to promote and train volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania, using this non-violent procedure, and to take four steps.
Many of them used spears to defend themselves.
Friday is World Elephant Day, dedicated to the protection of these animals.
“Since they’ve developed this ... toolkit, we’ve noticed a change in behavior in these communities. People believe much more that they can keep elephants out of their fields without hurting them,” said Damian Bell, CEO of the Honeyguide Foundation in Prol<0xC3><0xA1>h.
The first and second step is to illuminate the passing elephant with a flashlight and start the claxon.
If this does not prevent it, the so-called “chilli cloud” will be thrown out.
Chilli powder mixed with salt is wrapped in a condom along with a petard, its end enchants itself so that only the knot looks from it.
After firing, the condom explodes and a fine chilli powder is sprayed into the air.
Usually, one swamp is enough and the elephant goes in a different direction.
The last option is to fire the fire engine, which triggers a loud, clear explosion.
Jewish director leans against Berlin hotel for removing the code for calling to Israel at the "request" of Arabs - RT News
A French filmmaker of Jewish origin has sparked media outrage after finding that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin does not have a code for calling to Israel, according to the employee’s words based on the “requirement” of Arab clients.
Claude Lanzmann, the author of the documentary about the Holocaust "Shoah", ventilated his frustration from the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin in an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his recent stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the hotel calling codes list.
However, the state has not been listed among the countries to which it is possible to call directly from the room.
How is it possible that in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of Germany, Israel was removed and erased?
Written by Lanzmann.
Instead, Hotel Kempinski Bristol offers the possibility of calling to Israel through its own call center.
The director was looking for an explanation and with the problem he turned to the hotel reception.
The answer he received was that Lanzmann, according to his words, "shocked".
The hotel employee replied that the measure was "decided after considering the management of Kempinski Hotels."
The reason for this move the director made even more sense.
“Most of our guests are Arabs and they have asked you to erase Israel’s call code,” Lanzmann said in a letter.
According to the Suddeutsche Zeitung, Israel’s ambassador to Germany, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, called the case “a great embarrassment.”
We were horrified and shocked by the events.
It's a shame in itself.
The fact that such a thing happened in Germany and, moreover, in such a hotel chain is an even greater shame.
There is no need for further explanation.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions," he said.
The event sparked a strong reaction online, people called it a scandal.
Some believe that the Kempinski Hotel simply “lost” in the demands of Arab customers.
"Hanba to you," another post says, pointing out that the hotel, which is located on the noble Kurfurstendamm street, stands near the synagogue.
According to Spiegel, the hotel itself quickly dismissed any charges by calling the incident a "review" and apologizing to Lanzman.
“A direct order has never been issued” not to include Israel in the call codes list, the hotel’s Kempinski representative quoted the Suddeutsche Zeitung as saying.
Adds that the call code has been added to the list.
Police use tear gas and rubber projectiles against protesting Brazilian students
A clash between students and police took place in S<0xC3><0xA3>o Paulo, Brazil, on Thursday, when students met for a demonstration against government reforms in the public education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber projectiles against protesters.
The problem erupted when the government’s regular services tried to disperse the students, which ended up using rubber projectiles and tear gas by the police.
The demonstration was attended by several hundred students in order to express their concerns about the plans.
Among the proposals of the governor of the state of San Paulo, Geralda Alckmin, to save money is also the closure of nearly one hundred public schools and the relocation of 300,000 students.
Some of the participants of the demonstration were seen spraying inscriptions on the wall against interim President Michel Temer.
The latest protest comes just days after demonstrators took to the streets to support the overthrow of President Dilma Rousseff when the country’s Senate decided to sue her.
Trade between Russia and Iran increased by 71% - RT Business
According to the Russian ambassador to Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan, after the lifting of sanctions, trade turnover between Moscow and Tehran increased by 70.9 percent year-on-year.
The ambassador said that since the abolition of international sanctions against Iran, there has been an increase in interest on the part of Russian companies that trade in the country.
Russian companies are renewing existing ties with Iran, while new firms are ready to enter the market.
Further expansion of trade is, of course, one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," Dzhagaryan said.
He noted that during the first five months of 2016, trade turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and reached $856 million.
Specifically, Russia’s exports to Iran jumped by 91.5 percent and reached $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $158 million.
“A sharp increase in trade was ensured by the supply of machinery, ground vehicles and weapons,” the ambassador said.
Dzhagaryan also expects Russia to visit a record number of tourists from Iran this year.
In the past year, the Russian diplomatic mission in Iran has issued about 35,000 visas, mostly travel visas, to Iranian citizens.
Iran is ranked among the top 20 countries by the number of tourists coming to Russia for the first time.
“We can safely say that the record number of tourists from Iran to Russia from last year will be surpassed,” he said.
At the same time, however, Iran is visiting a relatively small number of Russians. The ambassador hopes that there will be a change here.
“I personally recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, where the monuments of ancient Persian civilization are in good condition,” he said.
Scott Callum Skinner rushes home after British wins gold in cycling
Callum Skinner from Scotland entered the Hall of Fame last night in a men's team sprint at the Rio Velodrome when the VB trio defended the 2012 London title.
The 23-year-old native of Glasgow was in the role of the brake that Sir Chris Hoy took for his Scotsman, and the young legend delighted when he joined the goal and stole the victory from the hands of the favourite New Zealand.
Four years ago, Britain won surprisingly, and Hoy won the fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated the same trick after finishing modest sixth at the World Championships in March, even though Hoy ended his career in the meantime.
The problem between Beijing and London was a replacement for Jamie Staff's first-time driver.
The Indians arrived just in time.
After Hoye's departure, a spot was also released, which he tried to fill with Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton.
Skinner was a man of British coaches and the search for potential has now been confirmed.
Kenny Hindes - who was with Hoy's champion four years ago - and Skinner achieved an Olympic record in qualifying, but took over New Zealand in the first round.
And the British trio won gold in the team sprint.
Hindes was slightly behind in his turn, but Kenny's team pushed forward and Skinner kept the lead.
The change in strategy was a big part of the transformation when the Indians went to a higher gearbox to slow down and allow Kenny and partly Skinner to keep pace.
He watched the race today from his position as a BBC commentator, and when Skinner, Kenny, and the Hindes took to the stage, he didn't let them down.
Thirty-three-year-old Skinner, a native of Glasgow, said: "It's a flattering comparison."
I'm here to get the best out of me and to honor my name.
We set an Olympic record in the final and beat the best.
It was just unbelievable.
There is no better way to win it.
After a triumph alongside Kenny and Hoy in London in 2012, Hindes admitted to deliberately falling off the track after a weak start.
He later withdrew the note and the British rivals had no chance of withdrawing.
This time around this victory, there was no such problem.
Hindes said, “With all those British flags on the stands, I felt like I was in London.”
Over the past three months, we've all worked together as a team.
We’ve lost in many world races, so winning the Olympics again is just amazing.
It is one event, one gold medal for a nation that has won seven out of ten competitions in Beijing and London.
If this is to be an indicator of progress over the past five months, then there are five successful days ahead for us at the velodrome.
With the form Kenny presented, it is not unthinkable that he would repeat Hoy's success and win three gold medals at one Olympiad at the same time.
That would then mean for Kenny – who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy’s birthday on March 23 (that date seems to be sacred for British sport, on this day also celebrates the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) – meant a total of six golds and one silver medal.
No matter how much Hoy got.
Kenny will take part in a sprint that starts today and lasts another three days.
An eighty-year-old native of Bolton said, “I’m enjoying this one now.
Team racing is always the best.
You win along with the others.
To tell you the truth, winning for yourself is a little lonely.
Hindes said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he should get a knight's title."
It was the only medal race of the day, but Britain was waiting for more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified as the team's fastest four-kilometre chasing race.
They finished at 3:51,943.
The world record, which fell in London in 2012, is 3:51,659.
The first round and finals (22:42) will be held on the second day of the race, which Wiggins will focus on.
Yesterday, before the qualifying race, he was debating with the commissioner when the referees invited him to measure the height.
In a similar women’s race that continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie reached the world record with a time of 4:13.260.
The VB team relied on its strong rowing team and dominated the middle ages of the Olympic Games and won a lot of medals.
After truly exceptional performances, showing absolute dominance in Beijing and London, during the preparations for Rio, expectations decreased.
In the background, dramatic events unfolded, not least the resignation of Technical Director Shane Sutton in April on charges of sexism and discrimination, and the end of the careers of giants such as Hoy or Victoria Pendleton.
However, as evidenced by the first night of races on the velodrome, it seems that the legendary reputation that the UK team is able to deliver top performance with perfect timing could be reconfirmed.
The future of the Portland tavern after the end of the contract for the supply of energy
The future of the Portland aluminum mill in Victoria - and the jobs of hundreds of workers - is uncertain because of the power plant, which the company supplies electricity and which informed about the intention of one of the owners of the mill to terminate the contract on the supply of electricity.
The move comes after the Victorian government decided earlier this year not to extend the granting of subsidies that keep the company running.
The fixed 20-year subsidy expires in November.
At Alcoa Portland, up to 2,000 jobs may be at risk.
When closed, up to 2,000 jobs – direct or indirect – may be at risk.
And because the tavirna consumes about 10 percent of the total electricity produced in Victoria, there can be further avalanche impacts.
Alcoa closed the Point Henry plant in 2014, which led to the closure of the Anglesea plant last year.
Alcoa's Portland tavern is punctual and is in danger of closing.
This move follows several years of speculation about the future of the company, initially in response to the strong Australian dollar and recently due to the prices for the plant’s production.
AGL, which supplies electricity from the Loy Yang A power plant in the Latrobe Valley Valley, said it expects one of the other three owners to also decide to terminate the contract.
The majority owner of the plant is the joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, with small business shares held by the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp.
“AGL expects that the Portland plant will continue to operate, in other words, that the demand for electricity from the tav<0xC3><0xAD>rna will continue,” she said.
AGL stated that the contracts are so-called ‘insurance contracts’, which were to enter into force from November 2016.
Contracts have a 12-month notice period, so they actually expire in 2017.
“AGL continues to assume that the contracts will participate in the profit for the fiscal year 2017,” the plant said.
Any possible impact on AGL’s profits from fiscal year 2018 is currently limited due to the strong outlook of the commodity market for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL said it had already written down the value of contracts according to its accounting books of $187 million "in case of termination."
Alcoa stated that the decision to terminate the contract “has no impact on its ... ability to operate the tav<0xC3><0xAD>rna or secure the supply of electricity to the tav<0xC3><0xAD>rna.”
The U.S. company said it had signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which was due to go into effect from November this year, although it still has to explain why it withdrew from the contract.
Analysts are very cautious about the possible closure of the Portland tavern in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to the weak economy in the sector.
AGL chief operating officer Stehpen Mikkelsen, who turned to analysts earlier this week, said Portland consumes about 600 megawatts of electricity a year and Tomago about 900 megawatts.
If both of these companies were to withdraw from the market, this would mean a significant reduction in demand in the [electricity] market.
It would not be good for us as a producer," he said.
Kendall is not only the star of the real estate TV show Kardashian - now it's the cover of September Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, a model and fourth daughter of clan mother-manager Kris Kardashian-Jenner, appeared on the cover of the September issue of American magazine Vogue.
Kendall, Estee Lauder’s ambassador for fashion week in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
“In a room full of people I love, I want to cry when I look at this title page,” Kendall wrote.
The opening of the title page was followed by a bizarre (or simply a continuation of the humorous Kardashian?) staged video, in which the whole Kardashian-Jenner family (the bartenders Rob and Caitly) were able to record their albums together.
It’s the boundary of almost every “birthday” part of a children’s television show (Seacrest says: “Did you think we forgot you?” with the sincerity of the cartoon rabbit in the show at eight o’clock in the morning), but Kris could have done it for the audience.
Because when we look at the September issue of Vogue magazine, we certainly have entered the new era of the Kardashian.
Elder sister Kim may have pushed on the cover of Vogue (she was on it with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the title of the September issue of the magazine is a different league.
The October issue of Vogue magazine is the best-selling issue of the year.
The publication, which by its thickness resembles a book for advertising purposes rather than a fashion magazine, attracts a number of advertisers (Fashionist calculated that out of 832 pages in last year’s edition, there were 615 pages with advertising content).
The unveiling of the star, which appears on the title page, is unexpected, so it is no wonder that in the past two years, images of the magazine have escaped before its official publication.
Among the women who have appeared on the cover in the past are Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista or Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have certainly been more “celebrities who make models” on the cover than “models who are celebrities.”
Jennifer Lawrence, the Oscar holder and Dior’s ambassador, made her debut in 2013, a year later with the honor of Laga Gaga.
But while it’s highly unlikely that Kendall – which the magazine describes as the “breakthrough model” of her generation – will fall into the first category, he’ll be in very good company.
These celebrities are not relatives of celebrities, nor are the stars of real estate shows, nor are the children of today who know how to make a well-cut video (although Jenner represents all of this).
They are demonstrably talented women who excel in the entertainment industry.
Beyoncé, who appeared on the title page last year, had one of the strongest years of her career thanks to the release of the album Lemonade.
Of course, not everyone is excited about Jenner's success.
Her position in the fashion world will always be difficult because of her participation in the reality show.
Stephanie Seymor, the original Victoria's Secret model, criticised Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid in June, calling them "girls of the moment".
These feelings rekindled with the news that Jenner appeared on the cover of Vogue.
But this dissatisfaction is not in place.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September Vogue.
It's a supermodel in the real sense.
She's performing for Mark Jacobs.
She sells you makeup from Estee Lauder.
She and all her sisters sell you pictures of themselves on their own paywalls.
She sells photos of Cindy Crawford's daughter, whom she photographed for LOVE magazine.
And in her spare moments, she acts in a reality show, perhaps just as one of the ways to see Kourtney and her kids.
Community legal aid centres reject 160,000 people annually
More than 160,000 most endangered citizens are denied legal aid each year in community centres, and the sector itself is set to face further financial constraints on already overburdened services.
In Queensland, three out of five people—mostly people of advanced age, immigrants, endangered workers, victims of violence, and people with no financial means to fight unfair emigration and the like—are already refusing helpless at the moment.
Community legal services, which are already so strained to break up, are going to be further cuts.
As of June next year, these legal aid centers will lose an additional 30 percent of federal funding.
James Farrell, the director of the community legal aid centres in Queensland, said that according to the National Association of Community Legal Aid Centers’ latest summary report, 5,000 people are rejected each year.
Mr. Farrell said that without the repeal of the federal government's decision, the situation will worsen.
“The community law centers in Queensland are chronically underfunded, which means thousands of people are being denied the vital services they need,” he said.
People who have escaped from relationships with the rapist, people with excessive and crippling debts, families going through separation, workers who are unfairly fired – all these people have problems with legal dimensions, and this report shows that they don’t have a chance to help.
The federal government will cut funding by 30 percent from June 2017, leading to thousands more endangered people from Queensland having to navigate complex legal problems without assistance.
We call on Attorney General and Queensland Senator George Brandis to immediately prevent this cut in finances so that people can get the help they need when they get into legal problems.
In the past year, the government of the state has received its commitment to ensure the financing of legal aid up to the national average.
Now is the time to look at the needs of community centers for legal assistance and the community of their clients and the Palaszczuk government must invest in this important work.
A lawsuit against Donald Trump's campaign after a member of the staff allegedly targeted a gun
NEW YORK: Donald Trump’s campaign was sued for alleged inaction after they were told that the director of operations in North Carolina had targeted a gun on a staff member during a jeep ride in February.
The incident was described in a court file that was handed over to the state court in Charlotte on Wednesday by Vincent Bordini, a former software trainer for the state campaign.
Bordini said he had waited months for the situation to be resolved internally before he came to the conclusion that “it will not happen.”
Director Earl Phillip "pointed the fingers of the gun, put the right pointer on the trigger, and pointed Vincent's head to the checker," Bordini said in the lawsuit.
According to the file, Bordini, following a complaint from the local and regional campaign leadership, found that at least four other people had experienced the same thing with Phillip.
“Weapons don’t have to fire to cause damage,” Bordini said in the lawsuit.
The lawsuit comes just two days after the Republican presidential nominee called for a raise when he told voters in North Carolina that they could step down the owners and holders of weapons (which in the U.S. is regulated in the second amendment of the constitution) if his fellow voter from Hillary Clinton becomes his rival.
Trump’s campaign says the media has taken his words out of context and that Trump did not defend violence.
Bordini is seeking compensation from the campaign for negligent surveillance and from Phillip for endangering personal safety, illegal use of violence and causing emotional harm.
Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Attempts to obtain a statement from Phillip were unsuccessful.
The WCCB, a local news agency in Charlotte, announced that Phillip had recently left the campaign.
The phone call to his consulting company Innovative Consulting Services did not respond in a short time.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is running a controversial election campaign.

Britain must continue to spread the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will also be a source of renewal and prosperity not only for our local communities and across London, but across the country.
For me, Heathrow is hugely attractive, just like London 2012, when we made extraordinary efforts to ensure that all our nations and regions will be able to benefit from the Olympic Games.
The Olympic Games were a huge benefit to Startford and the East End.
And we're going to do it again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
For our local communities alone, we will create 10,000 new teaching jobs, 40,000 new jobs, and end the unemployment of young people around the airport.
Just like before the London Olympics in 2012, there will be people here who will think that the Heathrow expansion is too big.
I have been told that Britain will never be ready for the Olympics and that we will be ridiculed on the world stage.
The suspects were wrong in 2012, and even in the case of Heathrow, it turns out they were wrong.
He will always have to overcome obstacles, but Heathrow is able to answer every question that concerns him.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is an infrastructure project involving many people and companies, not just a few.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create 180,000 new jobs, an economic growth of <0xC2><0xA3>211 billion, to leave behind a legacy of skills and jobs both around the airport and across the UK.
We have a great team at Heathrow that has put in place a <0xC2><0xA3>11 billion infrastructure investment program on a timely and budget, starting with Terminal T5 – which has been voted the best terminal in the world five years in a row, and Terminal T2, which has been built between the two busiest ranches in the world.
Now they are ready to deliver a third runway worth <0xC2><0xA3>16 billion of private investment.
The games in London in 2012 were a huge success for the UK and I am convinced that the Heathrow expansion will be a success as well.
It is time for us to continue to spread the spirit of the Olympics and expand Heathrow, secure trade for the future, and leave behind a legacy of skills and jobs that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is the Chairman of the Board of Directors and a former Deputy for Business Affairs of the Ministry of Finance.
Adblock Plus - Facebook in the game on the cat and mouse in blocking ads
Attempts to bypass ad blocking programs have turned into a cat-and-mouse game for companies that make money from online marketing, at least one of the companies that program such software.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced it would block the ad filters on its desktop pages, Adblock Plus posted a post on its pages stating that users can update the filters in their program and re-block the ad on that screen.
Facebook said on Tuesday that its desktop website will change the coding around ads to make it more difficult for ad filters to find out which parts of the site are advertised.
But Adblock now claims that the new codes have already passed.
Adblock spokesperson Ben Williams wrote in a blog post that “there’s been some kind of war between the open source ad blocking community and those who try to bypass them ever since ad blocking was invented,” and that Facebook is likely to come up with another own fix.
The fact that the company that owns the world’s largest social network has been involved in the war only proves how big the problem of blocking ads for industry has become.
According to a study conducted by Pagefair last year, Adobe uses around 200 million people worldwide ad filters — almost four times that of 2013.
Mobile advertising now accounts for 84 percent of Facebook ad revenue, with 1.03 billion active users visiting Facebook from mobile devices every day.
The spokesperson said the company is against desktop ad filters because mobile ad filters on mobile social networking apps and Instagram don’t work.
Ads on desktops still represent a profit high enough for Facebook to decide to invest in it.
Facebook also said on Tuesday it would update the ad preferences tool to give people a better control over how ads are displayed to them.
On Thursday, Facebook said that Adblock’s new filters are worrying them because they could also block content that is not related to advertising on the site.
“It’s not a pleasant experience for people and we want to solve this problem,” a Facebook spokesperson said in an email statement.
Ad blocking is an insensitive tool, and that’s why we’d rather focus on building tools like Ad Preferences that give people control.
Woman hit by car on Swiss motorway
The victim was lying on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are looking for witnesses of an incident in which a woman who allegedly tried to commit suicide was hit by several cars on the highway on Thursday morning.
The accident occurred on the A1 motorway near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight on Thursday.
Police in Vaud said in a statement that the actress of the “desperate act” was lying in the dark on the road and was driven by several cars.
It is clear that the victim, a 49-year-old woman, wanted to kill herself and crashed several cars, including a truck.
She died on the spot.
Several drivers have already been interrogated, but according to police, not all have yet been identified. Police are calling on these drivers and all others who witnessed the accident to report.
A criminal investigation has been opened, a “logical” step in a situation like this, Gilles Hofstetter, a lawyer, told Le Tribune de Geneve.
It is still necessary to find out if any of the drivers involved will be facing some kind of charge.
Is it possible to prevent a collision?
That's what the prosecutor has to find out," Hofstetter said.
Based on two similar cases over the past five years, it seems that drivers will not be held responsible.
In both cases - one of which was a person walking on the highway - it was decided that motorists could not expect a pedestrian crossing the highway in the middle of the night, the newspapers said.
Last year, a police officer was acquitted of negligent death charges after she crashed and killed a man lying on the A1 motorway near Payerne on the night of August 2014.
The court heard that the victim, aged 22, drank alcohol and fainted on the road.
The court found that the police officer – who responded to an emergency call – was acting in a reasonable manner and that the man’s presence on the road was “a very exceptional and unpredictable situation,” the judge said.
Anyone with information about the Thursday incident that occurred at Morges should report to the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
A tolerant city.
Prague is a popular destination of the LGBT community.
The Association of Czech Travel Agencies and Agencies (A<0xC4><0x8C>CKA) expects up to 20,000 visitors to Prague Pride.
This was announced on Friday by the Executive Director of A<0xC4><0x8C>CKA Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Pet<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1>.
The sixth year of Prague Pride began on August 8, the festival brings the lives of lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transsexuals (LGBTs) closer to life.
Last year, about 35,000 people took part in the event.
"Prague is among the most popular destinations of the LGBT community, for a high degree of tolerance and a wide range of specialized businesses," said Pet<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1>.
According to the survey of organizers, foreign visitors to the festival spend an average of 3,100 kroner per person per day.
Gay tourists are available to support their travel special maps of Prague with a complete list of Prague gay and gay-friendly bars, clubs, cafes and restaurants in the form of mobile apps etc.
"For tourism in general, the LGBT clientele is very lucrative, is interested in staying in higher price relationships with a high standard of travel services and spends more than others," said Petr<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1>.
This year, the first Pride Tourism Symposium will take place.
It is attended by experts from the LGBT tourism sector from Europe, the US and China.
The festival continues until Sunday, August 14.
This year’s main theme is love, but the event will also focus on several thematic areas, including family, AIDS prevention and transgender issues.
The top of the festival will be on Saturday a traditional parade with allegorical cars, which will go from Wenceslas Square to Letn<0xC3><0xA1>.
The pilgrimage, attended by thousands of people in recent years, this year honors a minute of silence in the memory of the victims of the June attack at a nightclub in Orlando, where the assailant killed 49 people, mostly homosexuals.
Pat and Mat celebrate their 40th anniversary.
The irresistible cuddly Pat and Mat, whose quest usually ends in disaster, have been entertaining small and large audiences for forty years.
The pilot part of this evening television series directed by Lubom<0xC3><0xAD>r Bene<0xC5><0xA1> premiered on August 12, 1976.
Behind the creation of this animated series, now known to viewers in more than a hundred countries of the world, were the cartoon jokes of the artist and director Lubom<0xC3><0xAD>r Bene<0xC5><0xA1>, who invented for the magazine with two swirls of Mr. Ouhol<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek and Sedlec.
Bene<0xC5><0xA1> then invited the playwright Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Kub<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>k and the artist Vladim<0xC3><0xAD>r Jir<0xC3><0xA1>nk to collaborate and together they created the film Kut<0xC4><0x9B><0xC3><0xA1>ci.
Today's form with yellow and red tricks and bullets and radio was given to the characters in 1979, when he began to create a series for Slovak television in the short film Prague.
The names Pat and Mat Kutilov<0xC3><0xA1> were then given in 1985, this time it was filmed directly for the short film Prague.
In 1990, Lubom<0xC3><0xAD>r Bene<0xC5><0xA1> founded his own studio of the animated film AIF Studio in Prague and Zurich, where other works were created.
After his death in 1995, other works continued with other creators, many of whom were played by Bene<0xC5><0xA1>'s son Marek.
There are currently over ninety episodes with stories of these cute little ones, with everything pouring under their hands, but they never get angry at each other and they are always filled with optimism, ideas and cute enthusiasm and finally are satisfied with their work, which proves the familiar gesture "...and that's it!".
Pat and Mat have even moved from television screens to books, DVDs and theaters, and characters or other toys depicting Pat and Mat are a hit for every toy shop.
A fairy tale for Fiji and two years of harmony.
The end of the week is in the sign of fairy tales, we have selected for you one sport and one of life.
They both have a good ending.
Well, let's have a look.
Fiji has been a historic success.
What is the reason for the joy of the whole country?
A two-year-old British girl has an identical girlfriend and is happy with her.
What are the things people spend the most on at airports?
This is Friday's review of the world's web sites.
The first medals of the Olympic Games.
Historical success is celebrated by the island state of Fiji.
The rugby selection of this archipelago was defeated in the final of the Olympic tournament of the seven-time rugby team of the United Kingdom.
This is the first time Fiji has won a medal at the Olympics.
Waiting for the first precious metal to win took sixty years since the first expedition to the Olympic Games.
The great merit of success is borne by the coach of Fiji.
The irony is that he is Brit Ben Ryan.
The team has been leading since 2013 and after the final as a British citizen, unlike its compatriots, could be satisfied.
"Let's play freely and easily and see if we can manage the biggest game in our history," the coach said before the final.
Fiji eventually ruled it sovereignly, and a small state with 900,000 inhabitants is now experiencing an Olympic fairytale.
This was reported by the French newspaper Le Monde.
A new friend and good luck for a little girl.
Two-year-old Harmonie-Rose Ivy Allen, who has been living without her arms and legs for 11 months, has made a new friend.
A doll who looks like her.
"Mom, she's like me," the two-year-old girl rejoiced as her mother revealed to ABC News.
She added that her daughter likes to remove her hands and feet and then sit together without prosthetics.
Harmony was diagnosed with type B meningitis in less than a year of life, and doctors gave it only a 10 percent chance of survival.
There's nothing I wouldn't love about her.
She's beautiful, smart, funny, and she never gives up.
He's got a glimpse.
I saw her introduce herself to the other children with the words “Hello, I’m Harmony and I don’t have my hands,” added the mother.
Look at the joy the doll has caused.
What do we spend the most on at the airport?
According to CNN, people at airports spend the most on bottled water.
Hudson's travel essential stores has released data for the past year, summarizing the 10 products that customers shop at its airports the most frequently.
Water was the first sovereign.
Drinks were generally very popular, eight of them placed in the top ten.
The ninth place was a large package of M&M candy with a coconut flavor.
And can you guess who closes the first ten?
One of the things mentioned above is not to be eaten.
According to CNN, it is the Wall Street Journal.
Other popular newspapers sold at airports include: New York Post, The New York Times USA Today.
Magazines include US Weekly, In Touch and The Economist.

We're just going to win, Murray and Bond laughed.
New Zealand cyclists Eric Murray and Hamish Bond have ruled the category of duo without a steering wheel for seven years and have also confirmed their dominance at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics.
At first glance, the unsorted couple switched to a smaller crew after the Beijing Olympics and have been crushing competition since 2009.
In the Laguna Rodriga de Freitas scored their 69th win in a row in the Thursday final.
What are we different from the others?
We are just nicer, Murray joked already during the Olympic regatta, when he was to answer questions about the dominance of the New Zealand couple.
Honestly, we don’t do anything different than others.
We're just training hard, very hard.
And we’re constantly trying to improve our technique, that’s our philosophy,” Murray said more seriously.
Their dominance is also remarkable because they are physically different.
Murray is an almost two-metre and a hundred-pound chasm, academically looking Bond is five centimeters smaller and 15 kilograms lighter.
In addition, they also have a different nature.
Bond studies and deals with finance, Murray has a charity boxing match behind him, for example.
It doesn’t take a lot of time out of the box.
Eric's getting on the boat with the fact that we can't lose.
We're just going to win.
“I tend to think about what might go wrong,” Bond admitted, who even at a press conference made an optimistic statement that Murray is the dominant character in the crew.
It was he who always answered first, and Bond was waiting for his opportunity.
On the water, however, it destroys the opponents with calm force.
They are going at their own pace, and although they are often not at the forefront yet, opponents have not yet found a recipe for their gradual acceleration.
We race on a two-kilometre track and we never wanted to go the first mile uphill.
We're just trying to go at a pace that no one else can.
“We know what we have to do to win,” said Murray, 40.
With his four-year-old partner, he won seven gold medals at the World Championships.
They also triumphed in 2007, when both were members of the Golden Four without a wheelchair.
Just after the unexpected failure of the larger crews at the Olympics in Beijing a year later, they decided to move on to a pair without a steering wheel.
At the Olympics in London, the biggest defeat of their careers was probably rested and dominance was also confirmed in Rio.
London was very intensive.
We did everything the coach told us, and they didn't ask for anything.
This time it was a little more fun.
“We knew it was going to be damn hard, and we had to make sure we were mentally good at it,” Murray said.
We all know they want to oust us from the throne.
We still have that target on our back.
But we are trying to be half a step ahead of everyone, he added.
NASA's climate model: Venus was once habitable
According to projections of NASA’s new climate model, Venus was once habitable.
Scientists at NASA’s Goddard Institute for the Study of Space have developed a model for studying Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those used by scientists in the study of climate.
The model was designed to determine whether, once on Venus, whose surface is hot, water-free, and saturated CO2, conditions similar to those on Earth could prevail.
Scientists have previously suggested that the low speed of rotation of Venus can be explained by its dense atmosphere.
According to the latest simulations, however, it seems that Venus once boasted a rare Earth-like atmosphere and was spinning slowly.
The model also dealt with the earlier topography of Venus.
The planet was probably drier than the Earth, but there was once enough water and geographic diversity on it to rule over life and provide protection against rapid evaporation.
Venus used to use the Sun, which was 30 percent more luminous.
“In the simulation of the GISS model, Venus is exposing its daily side to the sun almost two months at a time during slow rotation,” GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio explained in a new report.
In this way, the surface is heated and the rain is formed, which creates a dense layer of clouds that behave like a umbrella and protect the surface from excessive solar heat.
The result is a climate with average temperatures that are actually slightly lower than they are currently on Earth.
The model composed the story of Venus similar to an evolution previously hypothetically composed by planetary scientists.
Although Venus was probably habitable in the past -- over the course of several billion years -- it was exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet radiation.
Its oceans evaporated and its water vapors were burned by ultraviolet light.
Hydrogen has escaped and only a dense atmosphere of carbon dioxide with the deadly effect of greenhouse gases remains -- that's Venus as we know it today.
The researchers published their findings from the new Venus climate model in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns as Colorado Avalanche coach
Patrick Roy resigned as coach and vice president of hockey operations for the Colorado Avalanche team on Thursday, citing the impossibility of participating in the team’s decision-making process.
Colorada Executive Vice President/General Manager Joe Sakic confirmed the move and said the club will start looking for a new coach immediately.
"For the past three years, I have served as the head coach and vice president of hockey operations for the Colorado Avalanche, with energy, passion and determination," Roy, 50, said in a statement.
Over the years, I’ve been thinking about how I can improve the team, give it the depth it needs, and get it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, it is necessary that the vision of the coach and vice president of hockey operations are in line with the vision of the organization.
They must also be able to participate in decisions that have an impact on the performance of the team.
These conditions are not met at this time.
Sakic, who accepted Roye on 23 May 2013, thanked him for his contributions to the team.
"Patrick informed me of his decision today," Sakic said.
We appreciate everything he has done for our organization and wish him all the best in the future.
Roy was nominated to win Jack Adams as the league's best coach during his first season with the Avalanche 2013/2014.
He led the team to 112 points and first place in the Central Division, but Colorado faced Minnesota in the first round of the play-offs and during the last two years he did not always get games after the season.
The Avalanche team scored 39:39:4 in the 2015/2016 season and missed five points to get the second wild card in the Western Conference.
The goalkeeper Roy, who enrolled in the Hall of Fame, won the Stanley Cup four times -- twice with the Montreal Canadiens and twice with the Avalanche.
Workers on the North Sea Oil Platform Renew Conversations and Interrupt Strike
The leaders of the negotiating parties said the strikes over salaries for the workers of the North Sea oil platform were interrupted, while all the parties to the dispute met for a new round of negotiations.
The strikes against the oilfield services company Wood Group sporadically occurred on platforms in the North Sea, operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
“Wood Group and the unions Unite and RMT can confirm that they have agreed to renew the process for resolving current disagreements,” the statement said.
Starting next week, we will have a series of all-day meetings over the next few weeks, where we will try to look at the problems from a new angle.
According to trade unions, their recent event, which they said was the first in more than 25 years, is protesting wage cuts by as much as 30 percent.
Wood Group has cut rates this year and paid its suppliers in the North Sea about 9% less due to negative market pressures.
The reduction in company rates comes after a 10% reduction for coastal companies in 2014.
The company argues that further cuts would give the company room to cope with the market decline.
On the other hand, Shell has removed thousands of people from its payrolls and announced plans to leave operations in the oil and natural gas field in as many as 10 countries due to the modernization of its processes - immediately after mega merger with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to low oil prices, the economic situation associated with Britain’s June decision to leave the European Union.
Scottish MP Dave Anderson met with union leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labor disagreements of a generation that led to a strike in the North Sea.
The North Sea, he said, is vital to the region’s economy.
“In the North Sea and across the country, we need an economy that works for everyone, not just some,” he said in a statement.
For comparison, in 2016, nearly $1.4 billion is expected to be invested in new projects in the North Sea, while the average for the past five years has been around $7 billion.
Kepler measures the speed of rotation of stars in the Pleiades
The latest mission of the Kepler Space Telescope to help astronomers is to obtain an almost complete list of the speeds of rotation of stars from the constellation Pleiades.
The new data helps astronomers understand why the stars in the constellation rotate at different speeds, as well as how the rotation time is related to the formation of the planet.
“We hope that by comparing our results with other constellations, we will learn more about the relationship between stellar matter, its age and even the history of its solar system,” said Luisa Rebullov<0xC3><0xA1>, a researcher at the Anadesis and Profrasing Center in Caltech.
The constellation Pleiades is located 445 light-years from Earth.
Many of the stars in the cluster are now reaching maturity and have been formed for about 125 million years.
Now it's spinning the fastest.
At moments of maximum rotation speeds, these teen stars release a huge amount of stellar wind.
Because these winds move along the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a slowing effect on them.
As the star ages, its rotational speed also slows down.
Kepler measures the speed of rotation of each star by measuring the time between the discovery of recognizable points on stars -- similar to sunspots.
According to the latest data on rotational speeds, larger stars rotate slower than less massive stars.
The Rebellion compares the stars to the dancers, making the pirouettes slower than the smaller ones.
“In the ‘ballet’ Pleiades, we see that the slower rotating stars are more massive, while those that rotate the fastest are usually very light stars,” Rebull said.
Because the Pleiades cluster is so close, it serves as the ideal space laboratory for comparing the quality of stars and the speed of rotation.
“The Pleiades provide us with an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions, for younger and older stars,” Rebull said.
There’s still a lot we want to learn about how, when and why the stars slow down their rotational speed, so to speak, “they’re hanging their dance shoes on the nail.”
Rebull and her colleagues detailed the latest analysis of the speed of rotation of the Pleiades in three studies, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
Is a Qualification Agreement Necessary?
If I did not sign up, then the qualification agreement would not be concluded and after a few months I could go to another hospital?
Is it even possible to work after graduating without registering for specialised education?
The point is that in the field in which I would like to work, there is now a vacant job only in a slightly more distant hospital, but in about half a year, there could be a place in another one where I would like to work.
So I don’t know how to deal with the situation about that half-year, the question continues.
Answered by Mgr. Lenka Vlkov<0xC3><0xA1>.
No legal regulation provides for an obligation to conclude a qualification agreement with the employer - the hospital.
A qualification agreement is a legal institution governed by the labour code and may be concluded between the employee and the employer in order to ensure the return of the costs incurred related to the increase or deepening of the employee's qualification.
In the field of health care, there is a long-term pressure not to conclude these agreements with a view to ensuring the labour mobility of health workers and not all hospitals currently require this agreement.
According to Act No. 95/2004 Coll., on the conditions for obtaining and recognising professional qualifications and specialized qualifications for the exercise of the medical profession of a doctor, dentist and pharmacist, the participation in specialised education shall be expressly deemed to have been deemed to have taken place.
This means that the qualification agreement can be concluded under the labor code only if the cost reaches at least CZK 75,000.
There is no legal requirement or obligation to apply for a specialised education.
The law only establishes the conditions of an application for inclusion in the field of specialization education.
However, according to the law, a doctor is entitled to perform the profession of a doctor already thanks to the completion of the necessary undergraduate study, even under the conditions laid down by law (under the professional supervision of a doctor with specialized qualification in the relevant field).
The law provides for a situation in which professional practice completed in another field of specialization may be included in the specialist training of a doctor, provided that its content and scope correspond to the relevant educational program.
Theoretically, it would be possible to calculate the time worked elsewhere, which would correspond to the situation.
However, given that I do not know the specific circumstances of this case, it is advisable to consult the relevant department of the Ministry of Health (committee of science and medical professions), since the Ministry of Health provides its legal advisory and consultative service to the special department related to the class.
The advisory service is also provided free of charge by the Czech Medical Chamber, of which every doctor must be a member.
Doctors from the Syrian capital Halab are asking for U.S. intervention.
The United States has not made any efforts to end the siege (rebellious parts of the city by government troops), and has not used its influence to enforce the protection of civilians, she quoted from a letter addressed to the White House AFP.
“We don’t need tears, compassion, or even prayers; but we desperately need to create a no-fly zone over eastern Halab to stop the attacks, and we need international action to ensure that Halab is not surrounded again,” he said.
Russian forces supporting the army loyal to President Bashar al-Assad have announced that they will stop strikes in the Halab area every day for three hours to allow safe passage of humanitarian convoys.
From 9:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. all military activities, air strikes and artillery fire shall be stopped.
U.N. humanitarian operations chief Stephen O'Brien welcomed this, but stressed the need for a two-day ceasefire.
According to AFP, 15 of the 35 doctors operating in the eastern part of Halab are already in control of the rebels.
He writes that during the five-year war, there were violent, cruel deaths of countless patients, friends and colleagues.
The world observes and observes how complex Syria is, but does little to protect us.
The recent offers of evacuation of residents from the Syrian regime and Russia sound like only slightly overshadowed threats, pediatricians, surgeons and other doctors said.
Doctors said 42 attacks on medical facilities in Syria have been reported in the past month, 15 of them on the hospitals where they work.
We are saddened by the fact that we have to decide who will live and who will die.
Little children with injuries so serious that we have to choose among them the ones who are most likely to survive, are coming to the emergency room.
And sometimes we don't even have the material to help them, doctors described.
Two weeks ago, four newborns were suffocated when the explosion interrupted the oxygen supply to their incubators.
They licked their breath and then their life was over – before they could really start, they remembered.
The army loyal to President Bashar al-Assad, backed by Russian forces, over the past few weeks has surrounded rebels in the eastern part of Halab, inside it has been without food supplies for more than 200,000 people.
The rebels, who are under constant strikes by Russian and Syrian air forces, managed to break through the siege on Saturday after three weeks and launch an anti-offensive.
Both sides then joined forces in the city and its surroundings.
