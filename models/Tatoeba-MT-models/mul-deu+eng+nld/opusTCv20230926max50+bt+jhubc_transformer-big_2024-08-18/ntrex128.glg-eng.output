Members of the Assembly of Wales should be concerned about "taking them for monicreques"
Consternation among some of the members of the Assembly, currently referred to in English as AM, for the suggestion that they should change the name to MWP (Member of the Parliament of Wales).
The debate stemmed from plans to change the assembly's name to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the Assembly of the whole panorama are afraid to be the object of ridicule.
A Labour Party member said his group was concerned that the new name would "rive with Twp and Pwp".
For those who don't know Welsh, "twp" means "parvo" and "pwp" means "cock".
A member of the Plaid Cymru party said the group's group was "not happy" and suggested alternatives.
A Welsh conservative said his group kept an "open mind" about the name change, but noted that from MWP to Muppet there is only a small verbal leap.
In this context, the letter "w" in Welsh is pronounced similarly to the English pronunciation of Yorkshire from the letter "u".
The Committee of the Assembly, which is currently drafting the legislation to introduce the name changes, stated: "Of course, the final decision on any descriptor of the members of the Assembly will depend on the members themselves."
The Welsh Government Act of 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on these proposals which showed strong support for the designation of the Parliament of Wales.
On the issue of the title of AM, the committee preferred members of the Welsh Parliament or WMP, but the MWP option received a majority of support in a public consultation.
It seems that the AMs are suggesting alternatives, but the struggle to reach consensus could result in a headache for the president, Elin Jones, from whom it is expected to deliver the bill on the changes within weeks.
The Reforms Act will include other changes in the functioning of the assembly, such as the AM disabling rules and the design of the committee system.
AMs will get the final vote on what they should be called when debating legislation.
Macedonians hold ballots in referendum to change the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday if their country's name is changed to the "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular vote will decide to resolve a dispute that has been going on for decades with neighboring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor represents a claim of its territory and repeatedly opposes its requests for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who in the plebiscite opposes the name change, said he would ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is no longer at the price you have to pay to join the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells remain silent as Harlem churches continue to fight
“The elders with whom I spoke said that before there was a bar and a church in every corner,” Adams said.
“Today, neither one thing nor the other.”
He said he could understand that the bars would disappear.
“Now people are socializing in other ways,” he said.
“The bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhoods that people usually go to.”
As for the churches, he fears that the money from the sale of assets won’t last as long as the leaders expect, and “they’ll sooner or later come back where they started.”
He added that churches could be replaced by apartment buildings with communities of owners full of the type of people who would not help the neighborhoods remain sanctuaries.
“The vast majority of people who will buy the apartments in these buildings will be white,” he said, “and therefore will accelerate the closure of all these churches, because new owners are unlikely to become members of those churches.”
The two churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis, metropolitan community in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The original White Methodist congregation changed in the 1930s.
A nearby Black Congregation built the building.
St. Martin was occupied by a black congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of the shops on 125th Street, a Harlem shopping street that resisted hiring and rising black people.
A fire produced in 1939 left the building severely damaged, but as Father Johnson's frigates made plans to rebuild it, they commissioned the carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor in St. Martin, proudly named the carillon "the bells of the poor".
The expert who played the ball in July called it another way: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
University of Michigan expert Tiffany Ng also noted that it was the world's first carillon played by a black musician, Dionysius A. Lind, who changed it to the largest carillon in the Riverside church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said no one took his place in St. Martin.
Those who have been occupying St. Martin for the past few months are a group of architects and contractors, some led by the lay leaders of the church and others by the episcopal diocese.
The parish assembly, the body that governs the parish and is composed of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July showing his concern that the latter "try to reflect the costs" at the meeting, although the latter did not participate in the hiring of the architects and contractors who sent the diocese.
Some friars complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
A shark kills a boy while fishing for lobsters in California
Police said a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while fishing underwater in search of lobsters in California on the first day of the crustacean season.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach, Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he spent about half an hour scuba diving with friends on Saturday morning when he heard the boy ask for help to scream, a moment when he was swimming with a group of people to help get him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was only excitement to fish a lobster, but that he soon realized that he was yelling "I was working!
They've worked for me!"
He had the keychain snatched." Hammel said he was sneezing when the boy arrived.
“I told everyone who came out of the water, ‘There’s a shark in the water!’”
The boy was transported by helicopter to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
The rescuer, Captain Larry Giles, said in a press release that they would divide a shark in the area a few weeks ago, but that they would determine that it was not a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic damage to the upper torso.
Officials closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach, in Casablad, to Swami's, in Ecinitas, for 48 hours to undertake an investigation and also for security reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's is competing with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with beauty corridors similar to the large warehouses full of specialist assistants.
As part of the considerable immersion in the UK beauty market, which amounts to <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion and continues to grow as fashionable sales and home products fall, the biggest runners with beauty products are put to the test in 11 stores across the country, and will soon pass to others next year if they succeed.
The investment in beauty comes at a time when supermarkets are looking to fill the shelves that occupied televisions, microwaves and home products in their day.
Sainsbury's said it would double its beauty product offering to 3,000 products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The current collections of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also gain more space with exclusive zones similar to those seen in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching its boutique makeup range so that most products are suitable for vegans, something increasingly demanded by younger customers.
In addition, the fragrance store, The Fragrance Shop, will try concessions at two Sainsbury's establishments; the first opened in Croydon, south London, last week, while the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, this year.
Online shopping and a change that translates into buying small amounts of food daily in small stores means that supermarkets have to do more to convince people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, executive chairman of Sainsbury's, said the establishments will look more and more like shopping malls as supermarket chains try to compete with discount stores like Aldi and Lidl, with more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury's has already introduced Argos and Habitat outlets in hundreds of stores, as it bought the two chains two years ago. Apparently, this boosted grocery sales and made acquisitions profitable.
The supermarket’s previous attempt to modernize its pharmacy and beauty departments was a failure.
Sainsbury's launched a joint initiative with Boots in the early 2000s, but the association came to an end after a dispute over how to distribute pharmacies' income in their supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its 281-store pharmacy business to Celesio, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
Lloyds would participate in the plan by adding a wide range of luxury cosmetic brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in 4 tents.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's Chief Commercial Officer, said: "We have transformed the image of our beauty corridors to improve the outline for our customers.
We also invest in specially trained staff who can be consulted for advice.
Our product range is designed to fit all needs and the attractive and practical locations mean that we are now a cosmetic destination that challenges old buying habits.”
Peter Jones 'angry' after Holly Willoughby pulls out of <0xC2><0xA3>11million business
Dragons Den star Peter Jones has gone "angry" after TV host Holly Willoughby withdrew from an <0xC2><0xA3>11 million business with her lifestyle brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn’t have time for her brand of truly clothing and accessories.
His company was compared to Goop, the trademark of Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old presenter of This Morning used Instagram to announce her farewell.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons' Den star Peter Jones batting sparks as she retired from her last-minute lifestyle brand to focus on her new gold contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources indicate that Jones was "angry" when the television gold girl admitted during a tense meeting held Saturday at the headquarters of her business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new business, valued at <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million, meant she no longer had access to Tru's brand of clothing.
The business was compared to Goop, the brand of Gwyneth Paltrow, and was projected to double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, went to Instagram to announce that he was leaving Truly, Jones picked up a plane to Britain and headed for one of his vacation homes.
One source said: "Truely was by far one of Holly's priorities.
It would be his long-term future for the next two decades.
His decision to leave left amazed all the people who participated in the project.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to the launch.
There was a warehouse full of merchandise in Marlow's offices ready to sell."
Experts believe that leaving the presenter of This Morning is among Britain’s most profitable stars could cost the company <0xC2><0xA3>1 million, due to considerable investment in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and home textiles, and that it could delay its launch even further.
And it could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin are parents of three children and have a close relationship with Jones and his wife, Tara, for ten years.
Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as president in March.
The couple went on vacation together and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's television producer.
Willoughby will become M&S brand ambassador and replace Ant McPartlin as host on ITV’s I’m a Celebrity show.
A source close to Jones said last night that “we should not comment on your business affairs.”
It's a tough conversation, and then we'll fall in love.
He joked with the criticism he would receive from the media for making a comment that some would consider "a president's own little" and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said he was putting his voice to “television presenter.”
"I don't give up anything."
He pointed out that Kim is interested in holding a second meeting after his initial meeting in Singapore in June, which Trump considers a major step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
Negotiations for denuclearization have stalled.
More than three pounds after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea’s top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that the North does not see the “corresponding response” by the U.S. to the first disarmament measures.
On the contrary, he stressed, the U.S. continues to impose sanctions aimed at continuing to exert pressure.
Trump adopted a much more optimistic view in his rally speech.
"Things with North Korea are going well," he said.
"We're going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
We now have this excellent relationship.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had positive results: ending missile tests, helping to free the hostages, and returning the remaining U.S. soldiers home.
And he defended his unusual strategy by talking about relationships with Kim.
“It’s very easy to act like a president, but instead of having 10,000 people out trying to get into this amphitheater, we’d have about 200 people out here,” Trump said.
An earthquake and tsunami devastate an island in Indonesia leaving hundreds dead
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were informed that they did not need them.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population has been displaced, no national disaster has been declared, which is an indispensable condition for catalyzing international aid.
“Unfortunately, in many cases they made it very clear that they did not seek international help, so it is a challenge,” Ms. Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is gathering a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet clear whether the foreign staff will be able to work on the ground.
Mr Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster management agency, said Indonesian officials were evaluating the situation in Palu to see if international agencies could contribute with their help.
Given the earthquakes that Indonesia constantly endures, the country is extremely ill-prepared to face the anger of nature.
Although shelters for tsunamis were built in Aceh, it is not usual to find them on other shores.
Although an alert was issued, the absence of a tsunami alert siren in Palu probably contributed to the loss of life.
At best, traveling between many of Indonesia’s islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make the logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that was deployed in Lombok to serve the victims of the earthquake is heading to Palu, but it will take at least three days to arrive at the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo’s election campaign revolved around the improvement of Indonesia’s deteriorated infrastructure, and produced money on roads and railroads.
But Mr. Joko's administration is affected by a major lack of funds in the final line for next year's re-election.
Mr. Joko is also affected by ongoing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority adopted a way of living the most conservative faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were forced to leave their homes due to clashes in the streets of Christian and Muslim gangs, which use machetes, bows and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.
See: Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge scores the draw goal against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat to Chelsea with a 89-minute goal on Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri while still about 27 metres away from Chelsea's goal with his team losing 1-0.
He touched the ball with his left leg before firing a shot at the second stick.
The ball flew over the area as it advanced towards the upper left corner of the net.
The ball ended up falling on a Kepa Arrizabalaga jumping in the air and entering the net.
“I was just trying to get to that position, get organized, and players like Shaq always play the ball forward as much as possible, so I tried to win as much time as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I came to Kante and said a touch without thinking too much and I just disappeared.”
Chelsea won 1-0 in the break after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The Blues' frontman passed the heel ball to Mateo Kovacic in that game, before turning close to the mid-change and entering the Liverpool field.
Kovacic built a wall in the middle of the camp.
I made a beautiful deep passage leading Hazard into the area.
Hazard overcame the defense and ended up in the second pole scoring with a left-handed shot that Alisson Becker was unable to stop.
Liverpool face Naples in the Champions League group stage or Wednesday at 3 p.m. at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will do their own with Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
Indonesia's tsunami death toll rises to 832
Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami death toll rose to 832, the national disaster management agency reported Sunday morning.
Many people would be trapped among the debris of the buildings that came down with the 7.5 magnitude earthquake that occurred on Friday and caused waves of up to 6 meters, according to a press release spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, is covered with debris from the demolished buildings.
Police Arrest 32-Year-Old Man Suspected of Murder After A Woman Died
A murder investigation was opened this morning after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. with gunshot wounds on John Street and was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police asked the people in the area who saw or heard something to take a step forward.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in its early stages, but I would like to make a call to contact anyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead who was seeing or hearing anything suspicious.
“I would also like to ask anyone, especially taxi drivers, to capture anything with the camera of the control panel that gets in touch with us, as they could have key information for our investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the body belonged to a neighbour of Birkenhead and that it was inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who thought they knew the woman came to the scene to answer questions about where she was that morning.
The investigation continues as the police say they are in the process of informing the closest relatives of the victim.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews just tried to return to his apartment, but the police informed him that they would not allow anyone to enter or leave the building.
The man was speechless when he found out what had happened.
The residents have just learned that they will not be able to enter again until within a few hours.
A police officer has been told to tell a man that the area is considered a crime scene.
There is a woman on the scene crying.
Don’t stop saying “it’s horrible.”
At 2 p.m. there were two police vans inside the cordon with another van just outside.
Several officers remain inside the cordon guarding the apartment block.
Anyone with information should send a direct message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101, or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 citing the September 30 record 247.
The statue of Cromwell becomes the last monument affected by the struggle to "rewrite history"
His ban would be poetic justice for his Taliban destruction of so many religious and cultural objects in England carried out by his fanatical and puritanical followers.
But the Cromwell Society called Mr. Crick's suggestion "disparate" and "trying to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable in the current debate about the removal of statues that the figure of Oliver Cromwell located outside the Palace of Westminster became a target.
The iconoclasticity of the English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps they would have sacrificed Cromwell wrongly for the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent depiction of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is evidence of the opinion existing in the 19th century, and part of the historiography of a figure that many consider to still deserves homage.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more late in the 19th century, than now, as an advocate of parliament against external pressure, in this case, of course, it was the monarchy.
Whether or not that is a complete representation is the subject of a continuous historical debate.
What is clear is that the conflict of the mid-17th century defined the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure that represents one side of the divide.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and commemoration.”
A homicidal pig snatches a Chinese farmer
According to local media, a pig attacked and killed a farmer in a market in southwest China.
Last Sunday, the South China Morning Post reported that the man, identified only by his nickname, “Yuan,” was found dead with a cut-off artery and covered with black blood from a knife in Liupanshui market in Guizhou province.
A pig breeder is preparing to put the pig vaccines in a cortex on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
Apparently, she traveled with her cousin the mercenaries from the neighbouring Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered an open door that gave another adjacent cutlery.
He said there was a large male with blood in his mouth.
The forensic analysis confirmed that the pig, nearly 250 kilograms, attacked the farmer until he was killed.
“My cousin had bloody and sneezing legs,” the cousin, nicknamed “Wu,” told Guiyang Evening News.
The security camera footage shows Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking anyone else, while police gathered evidence on stage.
It seems that Yuan's family and market authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although they are not very common, there have already been cases of pigs attacking humans before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm the couple had in Massachusetts, causing serious injuries to the man.
Ten years earlier, a pig weighing nearly 300 kilos hit a Welsh farmer against the tractor until his wife arrived and scared the animal.
After an Oregon farmer was devoured by his own pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs don’t usually be aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a “trigger.”
“They’re just playing.
They're like kids, very curious... they don't intend to do harm.
You just have to have the respect you need,” he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will bring heavy and widespread rains to the southwest of the United States.
Forecasts indicate that Hurricane Rosa weakens as it flies over cold waters off Mexico's northern coast.
However, Rosa will bring torrential rains north of Mexico and southwest of the United States over the next few days.
At 5 a.m. on Sunday, Eastern Time, Rosa was a Category 1 hurricane with winds of more than 135 km/h and was located about 620 kilometers from Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to advance north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a glacier begins to take shape over the Pacific Ocean and move eastward, towards the U.S. East Coast as Rosa approaches the Lower California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it will begin to push tropical humidity northward, which will penetrate the U.S. southwest.
Rosa will bring more than 250 l/m2 of rain to some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Subsequently, the interaction of tropical humidity with valgade will create abundant and widespread rainfall in the southwest in the coming days.
At the local level, precipitation of between 25 and 100 l/m2 will cause dangerous sudden flooding, debris flows and the possibility of landslides in the desert.
The high tropical humidity will cause precipitation that will approach 50 or 75 l/m2 in punctual areas, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In parts of the southwest, 50 to 100 l/m2 of rain is expected, especially over much of Arizona.
Possibility of sudden flooding with deteriorating conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
We strongly advise you to venture into the desert under threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rains could form cannons that could turn into floating rivers, and electric storms will bring locally cracked winds and dust.
The vald will bring locally heavy rains to parts of the southern coast of California.
Total precipitation could reach more than 12 l/m2, which in turn could cause flow of smaller debris and dirt roads.
This would be the first rainfall in the wet season of the region.
Dispersed tropical rains will begin approaching Arizona by the late hours of Sunday and early Monday, before the rain spreads by the end of Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rains will arrive at Four Corners on Tuesday, which will last until Wednesday.
October will witness large temperature fluctuations in the U.S. due to the cooling of the Arctic, although the tropics will remain quite warm.
Sometimes this involves significant temperature changes over short distances.
On Sunday we can see a great example of drastic temperature differences in the center of the US.
There will be a temperature difference of nearly 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, persistent summer heat will try to reappear and expand again.
For the central and eastern part of the country, a warm beginning of October is expected, with temperatures exceeding 26 degrees from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
New York could reach 26 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 12 degrees above average.
Our long-term meteorological forecast indicates high chances of above-average temperatures in the east of the country during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people have seen the trial of Brett Kavanaugh
More than 20 million people followed on six television channels the passionate testimonies of the Supreme Court-appointed judge Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual assault that allegedly took place in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, political stagnation continues and chains disrupt their usual schedule for a new last-minute Friday: an agreement designed by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake to allow the FBI to conduct a one-week investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was one hundred percent sure that Kavanaugh had touched him while he was drunk and that he tried to take his clothes off at a party at the institute.
In a passionate witness, Kavanaugh said that he was absolutely sure that this would not happen.
Nielsen reported Friday that more than 20.4 million people would have seen him.
The company reported to the average audience on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other channels that rebroadcasted it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen often has trouble measuring people who watch TV from offices.
To get an idea, it is an audience similar to a football final or an Oscar ceremony.
Fox News Channel, which greatly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, led all the chains with an average of 5.69 million viewers during a trial that lasted all day, according to Nielsen.
ABC was second with 3.26 million.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94, MSNBC 2.89 and CNN 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
After the trial, the interest persisted.
Flake was the central figure of Friday on television.
After the moderate Republican's office made a statement indicating that he would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, he was captured by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning being stabbed by protesters while attempting to get into an elevator on the way to the Judiciary Committee hearing.
He remained with his gaze down for several minutes while being reprimanded, televised live on CNN.
“I’m here in front of you,” said a woman.
“Do you think he’s telling the truth?
They said, “You have power while there are many defenseless women.”
Flake said that his office made a statement Flake, before the elevator was closed, added that he would have more to say at the committee hearing.
All television and cable channels broadcast live hours after the Judiciary Committee had to vote to advance Kavanaugh's appointment to the full Senate to submit to the vote.
But Flake said he would only do so if the FBI investigated the allegations against the nominee next week, something a minority of Democrats insisted.
Flake was convinced in part by the conversations he had with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a subsequent conversation with Coons and several senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake's election had power, because it was obvious that Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister accuses critics of ‘playing politics’ with Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused those who criticized her plans to leave the European Union of "playing politics" with Britain's future and harming the national interest.
Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview alongside her on the cover of the newspaper, her former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, insisted on attacking May’s so-called Chequers plan for Brexit saying the proposal that Britain and the EU should raise the tariffs on the other side was “totally absurd.”
Wayde Sims Killed: Police Arrest Dyteon Simpson as Suspect of LSU Player's Death
Police arrested a suspect in the shooting that killed Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU (Louisiana State University).
According to the Baton Rouge Police Department, Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and jailed for a second-degree murder charge.
Officials released the video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson and police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses from the scene and said they contained Simpson's DNA, according to CBS affiliate channel WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, the police said they admitted to being the shooter who killed Wayde.
The defense said it was imposing a $350,000 bail.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Forensic Office issued a preliminary report Friday indicating that the cause of death was a bullet wound to the head that reached the neck.
The department praised the Louisiana State Police's fugitive unit, the Louisiana State Police's Crime Lab, and the Southern University Police's neighbors for their help in getting the arrest.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked local law enforcement for his “justice and the pursuit of justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
The 2.01 was raised in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
His average last season was 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade stated that the team was "abandoned" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
“This is what we worry about all the time,” Wade said.
Volcano flows grey over Mexico City
The ash flowing from the Popocatepetl volcano reached the southern neighborhoods of Mexico’s capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention advised Mexicans on Saturday to move away from the volcano after activity was detected in the crater and 183 emissions of gas and ash were recorded in 24 hours.
The center was overseeing several thunderstorms and tremors.
Social media images showed thin layers of ash on the windshields of Mexico City’s neighborhoods like Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have detected an increase in the activity of the volcano located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Confrontation between Catalan police and separatists before the anniversary of the independence referendum
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters confronted riot police and as thousands of people joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the polarizing vote on Catalonia’s secession.
A group of masked proseparatists held by riot police sniffed them eggs and powder paint that created dark dust clouds on the streets that are usually crowded with tourists.
There were also frictions later that same day with the police, who used the shovels to contain the liorta.
For several hours, pro-independence groups chanting "Neither I Forget nor Forgiveness" faced Unionist protesters shouting "Long Life to Spain".
Fourteen people had to be treated for minor injuries received at the protest, according to local media.
The tension continues to blossom in the independence region a year after the referendum on October 1 held by Catalan separatists, although considered illegal by Madrid.
Voters voted overwhelmingly for independence, although participation was low and opposition to secession boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting at polling stations across the region in violent clashes.
The pro-independence groups camped all night on Friday to avoid a demonstration of support for the national police.
The event also took place, but was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who attended the independence demonstration with his wife, said he no longer had hopes of Catalonia achieving independence.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
“I came to my parents crying with joy when I was able to vote, but now we’re all together,” he said.
Despite achieving an adjusted, albeit decisive, victory in last December’s regional elections, this year the pro-independence Catalan parties struggled to maintain the momentum, with many of their best-known leaders in a self-imposed exile or held in custody pending trial for their participation in the organization and referral.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the demonstration in support of the police with his mobile phone, said the conflict was fueled by politicians from both sides.
“There’s more and more tension,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial detention since last year, announced that he would run for European Parliament elections next year.
"Presenting myself as a candidate in the European elections is the best way to denounce the regression of democratic values and the repression that we suffer from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry arrests man after car crashes into house
Three 33-, 34- and 39-year-old men were arrested after a car crashed into a Londonderry house on several occasions.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursdays around 19:30 (UK summer time).
Police investigator Bob Blemmings declared the crack and the building itself were the damaged parts.
It is also possible to shoot a beast against the car at some point.
Menga's goal gives Livingston a 1-0 win over the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston ended in victory
Livingston surprised the Rangers by leading Steven Gerrard to his second defeat in 18 games as an Ibrox club coach.
Dolly Menga's goal was decisive for Gary Holt's team to rise to a level placing after Hibernian, in second place.
Gerrard's team is still not out of the house this year in the Premiership and next Sunday they face the leader, the Hearts, from what separates them eight points.
But first, the Rangers will receive Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston remains undefeated in the division for the sixth consecutive game; head coach Holt has not yet known the defeat since he replaced Kenny Miler or me in the past.
Livingston lets go of opportunities in the face of impaired visitors
Holt's team had to advance long before they scored, as with their control they caused all sorts of problems to the Rangers.
Scott Robinson made his way but his cross shot did not cross the threshold of the goal; then Alan Lithgow's shot came out driven by a Craig Halkett header from the other side of the goal.
The host team agreed to let the Rangers play in front of them, aware that they could endanger visitors in the playoffs.
That’s how the decisive goal came about.
The Rangers granted a free kick and Livingston made a sack in which Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined their efforts to fix Menga, who touched the ball and scored from the center of the area.
At that time the Rangers dominated the possession but came across an impenetrable defense that avoided much work for goalkeeper Liam Kelly.
That pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced a stop for Kelly.
Rangers midfielder Allan McGregor took a shot from Scott Pittman, and Lithgow threw the ball out another game at Livingston.
Many cross-passes were made in the Livingston area that were repeatedly dismissed, while two penalty requests were rejected: one by hand and another by a Halkett entry to substitute Glenn Middleton.
'Phenomenal' by Livingston: analysis
Alasdair Lamont for BBC Scotland from Tony Macaroni Stadium
A fantastic performance and a fantastic result for Livingston.
“They have been excellent and continue to exceed expectations in their upward trajectory.
His style of play and players have barely changed since he returned to the top category, but part of the merit is from Holt for the way he has driven the team since his arrival.
He had a lot of heroes.
Halkett, the captain, proudly led a perfectly organized defense while Menga gave no breath throughout the game to Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall.
The Rangers lacked inspiration.
Despite working well on occasions under Gerrard's command, this time they did not reach that level.
They failed the last pass. They only managed to penetrate the host team once. All a call of attention for the Rangers, which is in the middle of the table.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an receives ambiguous welcome in Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, there were smiles and blue skies during the meeting of the leaders of Turkey and Germany for lunch in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which aims to settle relations between NATO allies.
They discussed many issues, including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s access to the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to inaugurate a gigantic new mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police claimed security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters of Erdogan approached to see its president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan (many of them Kurds) also raised their voices condemning both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to accept him in the country.
The duel of demonstrations reflects the division in front of a visitor acclaimed as a hero by some German Turks and criticized as an autocrat by others.
Deptford traffic accident: a cyclist dies in a car crash
A cyclist was killed in a car crash in London.
The accident took place near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, in the south-east of the city, around 10:15 (UK summer time).
The driver of the car stopped and the paramedics arrived, but the man died in the act.
The accident comes months after another cyclist died in a runaway car crash on Childers Street just over a mile and a half from Saturday's crash.
The Metropolitan Police said officers were working to identify the man and inform his family members.
There are traffic jams and buses are diverted and drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Jail: Six officers injured in riots
Six prison officers were injured in an altercation in a high-security prison, the prison official said.
The disturbance began at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 09:30 (Summer Time in Great Britain) on Sunday and still continues.
A "Tornado" unit of specialized officers came to deal with the riots, in which eight inmates are involved who are contained in a pavilion.
Officers were treated for minor injuries to the face.
A spokesman for the prison service said: "A prison staff specially trained to face a continuing incident at HMP Long Lartin has been dismissed.
Six staff members had to be treated for injuries.
“We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we are clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and could spend more time between bars.”
HMP Long Lartin is home to more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the director of the prison had to be hospitalized after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, rioting officers had to go to jail to calm a riot in which staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (places affected by drought could benefit)
It is rare for a tropical depression to affect Arizona, but it is very likely to occur early next week, when the remaining energy from Hurricane Rosa passes through the Southwest Desert leaving the possibility of sudden flooding.
The National Meteorological Service has already issued sudden flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday from western Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to pass directly over Phoenix on Tuesday and arrive at the last hour of Monday with rain.
The National Meteorological Service of Phoenix said in a Twitter post that "only ten tropical cyclones have maintained a state of depression or tropical storm within a 320-kilometre radius of Phoenix since 1950.
Hurricane Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that spread over a 64-kilometre radius of the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Meteorological Service forecast 50 to 10 l/m2 of rain, with isolated amounts of up to 150 l/m2 in the Mogoll<0xC3><0xB3>n River of Arizona.
Other areas of the Southwest Desert, such as the Central Rockies and the Gran Conca could reach 25 or 50 liters, with total insulation of 100 l/m2 being possible.
For those who are out of danger of sudden flooding, Rose’s rain could be a blessing, as the region is heavily affected by droughts.
Although flooding is a very serious problem, some of this rain may be beneficial, as the Southwest is experiencing droughts.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, more than 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme drought, the second-largest category.
First, Hurricane Rosa will touch land on the Mexican peninsula of Baixa California.
Rosa, which will still have a hurricane force on Sunday morning, with a maximum wind of 136 km/h, is 620 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and heading north at 19 kilometers per hour.
The storm is encountering cold water in the Pacific and thus losing strength.
For this reason, it is expected to touch land in Mexico with tropical storm force in the afternoon or evening of Monday.
It could rain heavily in some areas of Mexico, posing a significant flood risk.
"We expect total precipitation of between 75 and 150 l/m2 from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, and it is possible to find up to 250 l/m2," reports weather.com.
Rosa then heads north across Mexico in the form of a tropical storm before arriving at the Arizona border early Tuesday as a tropical depression, and then continues to climb across Arizona and enter southern Utah late Tuesday night.
"The main danger of Rose or what is left of it is heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the Southwestern Desert of the United States," the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
These rains are expected to cause sudden water clots and debris flows in the deserts, and landslides in mountainous lands.
Attack on Midsomer Norton: Four Arrested for Attempted Murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder in order to find a 16-year-old boy with gunshot wounds.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton on Saturday around 04:00 (UK summer time).
He was taken to the hospital, where he remains "stable".
According to Somerset police, three 17-, 18- and 20-year-old boys were arrested in the Radstock area during the night.
Officials requested the collaboration of anyone who had a recording on the mobile of the incident.
Trump Says Kavanaugh 'Suffered the Wickedness and Anger' of the Democratic Party
“Voting for Judge Kavanaugh is voting to reject the Democratic Party’s ruthless and outrageous tactics,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had “suffered the ugliness and cholera” of the Democratic Party throughout its nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, where she categorically and emotionally denied Christine Blasey Ford's accusation of sexually assaulting her decades ago as a teenager.
Ford also testified in the trial about his indictment.
The president said on Saturday that on that day the "Americans" witnessed Kavanaugh's brilliance, quality and courage.
“A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the best jurists of our time with a history of dirty public service,” he said.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's appointment as he spoke of the importance of Republican results in the midterm elections.
“We have five weeks to make one of the most important choices of our lives.
“I don’t do it, but I really do,” he said.
“That’s why I’m fighting everywhere for great candidates.”
Trump argued that the Democrats' mission is to "oppose and obstruct."
The first procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's appointment is expected to take place before Friday, a Republican Party assistant told CNN.
Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami kills hundreds and numbers continue to rise
Authorities reported on Saturday that at least 384 people died, many of them dragged by giant waves that broke down on the beaches, when a major earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Hundreds of people gathered on Friday to attend a festival on the beach of the town of Palu when waves of up to six meters broke on the ground, taking the lives of many and destroying everything in its path.
The tsunami followed a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
"When the threat arose, people were still with their activities on the beach and did not flee immediately, so they were killed," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia's BNPB disaster mitigation agency, told a news conference in Jakarta.
“The tsunami didn’t just come, it dragged cars, trunks, houses, it ripped everything it found,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami traveled high seas at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coast.
Some people climbed the trees to escape the tsunami and managed to survive, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
The aerial photographs circulated by the National Disaster Management Agency showed many tents and buildings destroyed, retorted and demolished bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
The replicas continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area with 2.4 million inhabitants.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) said the energy released by Friday’s massive earthquake was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The geography of the city, set at the end of a long, narrow bay, could magnify the size of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as "massive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels would come down.
The bodies of some of the victims were trapped under the debris of the demolished buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho announced that the casualties and damage could be greater along the northern coast of Palu, an area called Donggala, and that it is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communications were "totally paralyzed and there is no information" from Donggala, Nugroho added.
There are more than 300,000 people living there,” the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
“This is a tragedy, but it could be much worse,” he said.
The agency was harshly criticized on Saturday for not informing the arrival of a tsunami in Palu, although officials said the waves were coming at the time the warning was issued.
In an amateur recording shared on social media, you can hear a man standing on the top floor of a building frantically yelling warning of the arrival of a tsunami to the people who were on the street.
Within minutes the water collides against the shore by driving buildings and cars ahead.
Reuters was unable to immediately certify the authenticity of the recording.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major shutdown that caused communications to be cut off across Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue tasks.
Authorities say the army has already started sending cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuators continue to urgently need food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport was reopened but only for relief tasks and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from Indonesia’s tsunami exceeds 800.
It's terrible.
During the journey that World Vision staff travelled to get to the city of Palu, where the employees rescued themselves in canvas shelters erected in the courtyard of their office, they contemplated scenes of total devastation, Mr. Doseba commented.
“They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed,” he said.
It's terrible.
Even when the groups began the unpleasant task of continuing assistance in the event of a disaster, some complained that they were preventing him from travelling to Palu to foreign humanitarian aid workers with great knowledge and experience.
According to Indonesian legislation, funds, supplies and staffing from abroad can only flow if the place of calamity is declared a national disaster zone.
And that hasn't happened yet.
“It is still a disaster at the level of a province,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As long as the government says, ‘All right, this is a national disaster,’ we can open up to international aid, but that time has not yet come.”
As the second night fell in Palu after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, the family and friends of the missing clung to the hope that their loved ones would be one of the miracles that eased the depressing argument of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a child was taken out of a dumpster.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who was carrying her mother's body under the rubble for two days.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Mr. Mandagi added that some of the people trapped in the Roa Roa hotel were his students.
“As a person with extensive experience in the paragliding field, I have my own emotional burden,” he said.
Gendon told how, in the hours following the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel among the paragliding community, he desperately tried to send WhatsApp messages to competitors in Palu, who were participating in the beach festival.
However, only one grey mark was shown in the messages instead of two blue marks.
“I think that means the messages weren’t delivered,” he added.
$26,750 stolen while charging a cashier in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, burglars stole $26,750 from a Brink worker who was charging a cashier in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
In a press release, investigator Dennis McCarthy wrote that the driver of the car would empty a cash register at the leisure complex and prepare to deliver more money.
While he was busy, another man "came running from behind Brink's employee" and stole a purse of money that he had to hand over.
According to the note, witnesses saw several suspects abandoned the scene, but the police did not specify how many were involved in the incident.
If you have information about your identities, contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
The rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
The rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
To announce the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: “O be formerly known as Kanye West.”
West, 41, has been known for some time as Ye, which he used as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
The change occurred before her appearance on Saturday Night Live, where she is expected to release her new album Yandhi.
It will replace singer Ariana Grande on the show, who canceled her attendance for "emotional reasons," according to the show's creator.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West had previously explained that the word had a religious meaning for him.
"I think 'yes' is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," West said that same year as he was talking about his record with the Big Boy radio host.
"So I'm you, it's us, it's us.
I pass by Kanye, which means the one, the only Ye, which is a reflection of the goodness that is in us, of evil, of confusion, of everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are.”
Kanye is another of the famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs was previously known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, although this year announced that he would rather be called Love and Brother Love.
A former West collaborator, JAY-Z, also spooked by putting and removing the script and using the capital letters.
AMLO pledges not to use military against civilians
Mexico’s president-elect, Andrés Manuel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador, has vowed not to use military force against civilians again as the 50th anniversary of a bloody reprisal against students approaches.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador promised on Saturday in Tlatelolco square that "he would not use the military again to repress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, the troops fired at a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing about 300 people at a time when student movements were taking root throughout Latin America.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador promised to support Mexican youth by giving monthly aid to boys who study and opening more free public universities.
He said unemployment and the lack of educational opportunities drag the boys into criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double its investment in I.A.
According to AI investor and professional Kai-Fu Lee, former employee of Google, Microsoft and Apple, the US should double the amount it invests in AI in view of China’s growing activity in the field.
The comments came after several parts of the U.S. government made announcements about AI, even if the U.S. lacked a formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan the previous year: it intends to be the number 1 in AI innovation by 2030.
“Doubling the budget for AI research would be a good start, given that other countries are far behind the U.S., and we are looking for the next big breakthrough in AI,” Lee said.
Doubling funding could double the chances that the next AI achievement would be made in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World order was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, who has invested in one of China’s most prominent AI companies: Face<0x2B><0x2B>.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that won the highest-scoring American Othello player, and was later executive at Microsoft Research at Google's subsidiary in China.
Lee recognized former U.S. government technology contests as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Robotic Challenge and asked when it would be the next to help identify the next visionaries.
In the U.S., researchers often have to work hard to get government grants, Lee says.
“China is not the one who is leading academic leaders, but the companies,” he said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired college geniuses to work in AI.
Lee stressed that changing immigration policy could also help the U.S. to boost its efforts in AI.
“I think they should offer residency cards to doctors in AI,” he said.
The State Council of China published its new generation artificial intelligence development plan in July 2017.
The National Science Foundation of China offers funding to people from academic institutions in the same way that the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Center for Artificial Intelligence that is intended to include industry and university partners, and the White House announced the formation of the Select Committee on Artificial Information.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation seeking to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not registered movement for months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum to change the name of the country.
The Macedonian people voted Sunday in a referendum on whether to change their name to the "Republic of North Macedonia", a movement that would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece and block requests for admission to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its northern neighbors represents a claim of its territory and vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
The governments of the two countries reached an agreement in June on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would harm the ethnic identity of the majority of the Slavic population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign raised doubts about whether the result would reach the minimum 50 percent needed for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the ballot for the referendum was: "Are you in favour of joining NATO and the EU with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim it is a price worth paying to gain admission to entities such as the EU or NATO of Macedonia, one of the emerging countries of the fall of Yugoslavia.
“Today I have come to vote for the future of the country, for Macedonia’s youth, so that they can live freely under the protection of the European Union, because that means a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, many members of parliament said they would accept the result of the vote and make it final.
The change of nine would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state election commission stated that at 1 p.m. no irregularities were recorded.
However, participation was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent of the last 2016 parliamentary elections, when 66 percent of registered voters cast their vote.
"I came to vote for my children, our site is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, a 62-year-old voter from the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dusko cast their vote for the Macedonian referendum on changing the country’s name that would pave the way for his accession to the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small stage and placed chairs in front of tents mounted for those who boycotted the referendum.
"We are in favour of joining NATO and the EU, but we want to do it with our heads up and not through the door of service," Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t accept us as Macedonia, we can go to other countries like China and Russia and join the Eurasian Union.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
“I think the vast majority will be in favor because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favor of joining the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after he had cast his vote.
He said a positive result would be “confirmation of our future.”
A poll published Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Political Research revealed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum, a figure that is below the required.
Another survey conducted by the Macedonian television channel Telma indicated that 57 percent of the people consulted were planning to go to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
In order for the referendum to be valid, the result must be 50 per cent plus one vote.
A failure in the referendum would represent the first major blow to the policy of the pro-Western government since it came to power in May from the one in the past.
Sergio Agüero, Manchester City player, goes through all the defense of Brighton and ends up scoring a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling accounted for Brighton's defense with 2-0 against Manchester City on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it seem ridiculously easy to score the goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine forward received a midfield pass at the start of the sequence.
He ran between three Brighton defenders before heading for the open field.
Then Aguero found himself surrounded by four green shirts.
He defied a defense before overcoming several more on the edge of the Brighton area.
Then he passed the ball to his left and found Sterling.
The English forward used the first area touch to return the ball to Aguero, who hit Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a right-handed shot.
"Aguero is going through some problems in the pe," City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We're talking about playing 55 or 60 minutes.
And that's when it happened.
We were lucky to have scored at that point.”
But it was Sterling who gave the Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League confrontation.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Agüero received the ball in the depths of the Brighton field in that game.
He sent a beautiful pass to the hole for the right band towards Leroy Sane.
Sane gave several touches before driving Sterling to the opposite post.
The Blues threw the ball into the goal before leaving the field.
City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to throw the party to the Rockies
With the Nationals out of the fight for the elimination, there was not much reason to force another title.
But an ever-competitive joker hopes to throw Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are implications in the elimination for the Rockies, which lead to an advantage game to the Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western Division of the national league.
The Rockies secured at least one comedy position with a 5–2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but they are still trying to close their first-division title.
“Although we don’t play anything, at least we can play the rubber knowing that the atmosphere in Denver with the crowd and the other team would be probably playing at the highest level I’ve played this year.
“Why don’t I want to compete?”
The Nationals have not yet announced who will open on Sunday, but they seem inclined to see Scherzer be the one to launch in a situation like this.
Scherzer, for whom it would be his start number 34, made another bullpen session on Thursday and will likely launch on Sunday on his usual rest day.
Washington's right is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump celebrates a rally in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation surrounding the Supreme Court-appointed Brett Kavanaugh as he spoke of the importance of the outcome in the midterm elections.
“We played everything we did in November.
We have five weeks to make one of the most important choices of our lives.
This is something big, big... I don’t care, but really if I do, and that’s why I’m going everywhere fighting for great candidates,” he said.
Trump went on to say, “Look at this horrible radical group of Democrats, look what’s happening now.
And they are determined to regain power using any necessary means, evil, and petty.
They don’t care who they do harm, who they have to go over to get power and control, that’s what they want, power and control, and we’ll never give it.”
The mission of the Democrats is to oppose and obstruct."
“And you’ve seen that for the past four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “anxious, vague, nasty and lying.”
He enumerated the Senate Judiciary Committee citing Senator Dianne Feinstein by name, who received strong public appeals.
“Do you remember your answer?
Did you filter the document?
Mm-hmm, what?
No, mmm, no, wait... It was the worst body language, the worst I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer open.
They are not tolerant of those who express their opinions.
When Momentum activists from my local party voted to censor me, the truth is it didn’t surprise me too much.
After all, they are the last in a series of Labour deputies that we are not well received, and all to say our opinion.
My colleague in parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated in a similar way because she faced anti-Semitism with determination.
In my case, the motion for censorship criticized me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
on the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security and on Europe, casually issues that Jeremy discussed with previous leaders.
The announcement for the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday indicated that “we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
For most of my eight years as a Labour MP, the committee meetings on Friday night were exactly that.
Unfortunately, that’s no longer the tone of many meetings, and the promise of a “more kind and gentle” policy was forgotten a long time ago, if it ever began.
It is becoming increasingly evident that the Labour Party does not tolerate different opinions and argues that all opinions are acceptable to the leader of the party.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the leader of the party, when colleagues with whom he believed to share a similar political vision began to expect me to be portrayed and adopted positions with which he would never agree, whether in terms of national security or the EU single market.
When I speak publicly, and it doesn’t really matter what I say, there’s a tremendous upheaval and attacks on social media censoring center politics, telling me I shouldn’t be in the Labour party.
And it doesn’t just happen to me.
In fact, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, since the comments that are addressed to me are usually of a political nature.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination of the comrades who face a torrent of sexist or racist comments every day and who do not give up.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how the levels of insult were normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party had to promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer so open and that with every "non-confidence" movement or every change in the rules of selection, the party becomes narrower in sight.
Over the past few years I have received many advices that urge me to keep my head tilted, not to be so frank and that then "everything would be fine for me".
I didn’t go into politics to do that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago while still in school, led by the Thatcher government’s negligence that literally dropped my classroom, I have tried to claim better public services for those who need them most, both as local councillor and as government minister.
I never hid my politics, not even in the last election.
No member of Nottingham East could confuse my political stances and that I disagree with the current direction of the party.
To those who promoted Friday’s motion, the only thing I would say is that as the country moves toward a Brexit that will affect our homes, businesses and public services, I don’t understand that desire to waste time and energy questioning my loyalty to the party leader.
But in reality, the only message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my constituents, whether they are members of the party or not: I am proud of them and I promise that no threat or political convenience will discourage me from acting in the best interests of all of you.
Chris Leslie is a Member of Parliament for Nottingham East
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: an undefeated Ayr gets in the head
The last two attempts may have slightly altered the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win this mild Tenent Premier League game.
They now lead the table and are the only undefeated team of the ten.
It was finally the superiority of his defense, as well as the fact of risking, that led the team to victory. And coach Peter Murchie had every right to be happy.
"So far we've put the test in our games and we're still unbeaten, so I have to be happy," he said.
Melrose's Robyn Christie said, "You have to recognize that Ayr has taken advantage of opportunities better than us."
Grant Anderson's 14-minute rehearsal, transformed by Frazier Climo, put Ayr ahead, but a yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, handed over to the Warriors, allowed Melrose to speak the numbers and Jason Baggot snapped a pitch.
Climo increased the advantage for the Ayr with a penalty, before just in the middle of the time, he turned a shot into a solo, leaving the score 17-5 in favor of the Ayr at rest.
But Melrose started well in the second half and Patrick Anderson's rehearsal, transformed by Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
Then there was a prolonged stoppage due to the serious injury suffered by Ruaridh Knott, who left the field in a mudslide and, from the restart, Ayr advanced further through a Stafford McDowall rehearsal, transformed by Climo.
Ayr's acting captain, Blair Macpherson, received a yellow card and Melrose took advantage of having another player with an unconsumed Bruce Colvine rehearsal at the end of a period of heavy pressure.
However, the local team returned and when Struan Hutchinson received the yellow card for placating Climo when he didn't have the ball, McPjherson scored a rehearsal from the penalty line on the back of Ayr's maul.
Climo scored, as he almost did since the restart, after Kyle Rowe picked up the pitch in the area of David Armstrong and sent it to third line Gregor Henry to get the fifth rehearsal from the local team.
The protagonist of Still Game begins a new career in the catering industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran appears to be ready to enter the restaurant industry after discovering he was appointed director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he writes and co-stars with his old partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the next ninth season will be final, and it looks like Kierman is planning another life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment, although a Scottish Sun source suggested that Kiernan wanted to get involved in Glasgow's "prosperous restaurant business".
‘The sea is ours’: Inner Bolivia expects court to pave the way to the Pacific
The sailors were watching a naval headquarters covered in aircraft in La Paz.
Public buildings are waving a blue flag.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are flooded with the slogan: "The sea is ours by right.
Recovering it is a duty.”
In Bolivia without sea, the memory of a coast lost to Chile in a bloody 19th-century resource conflict remains alive, as does the desire to return to the Pacific Ocean.
Perhaps those hopes are at their highest point in decades, as Bolivia awaits a decision by the International Court of Justice on October 1st after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the necessary momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, expects a positive outcome," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the ICC ruling on giant screens across the country with the hope that the Hague Court will vote in favour of Bolivia’s claim and that, after decades of intermittent talks, Chile will be forced to negotiate the concession to Bolivia of a sovereign exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic indigenous president, who faces a controversial re-election battle next year, also has a lot at stake in Monday’s ruling.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” he promised in late August.
But some analysts consider it unlikely that the court would give Bolivia a reason, and that little would change if that happened.
The United Nations body based in the Netherlands does not have the power to assign Chilean territory, and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the ICC ruling comes only six months after the final arguments we have heard indicates that the case “was not complicated,” says Chilean international law expert Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate.
And far from promoting the cause of Bolivia, the last four years could be lagging behind.
"The issue of access to the sea takes a long time blocked by the current Bolivian administration," Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
Morales's belligerent rhetoric undermined the goodwill that remained for him in Chile, he suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will resume the talks at some point, but it will be very difficult to keep them after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court was to make an unusually quick decision.
Monday Bolivia will have "a fantastic opportunity to open a new stage of relations with Chile", and an opportunity to "end 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, was using this theme for political purposes.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“Judgement is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not occur unless it can trust the United States.
North Korea’s foreign minister, Ri Yong, said his nation would not proceed with nuclear disarmament if it could not trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to deliver on the promises made during a summit in Singapore between its leaders.
This comment comes at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be about to restart nuclear diplomacy stalled for more than three decades after the summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri claims it is "a utopia" that the continued U.S. sanctions and objections to a declaration that ends the Korean War can be doubled to the North.
In Washington, it resists accepting the declaration without Pyongyang taking the first step towards disarmament.
Both Kim and President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about renouncing an arsenal that the country probably sees as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to travel to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris fashion shows reveal the latest line of giant umbrellas that will soon be in the tents.
If you want to increase your collection of umbrellas or cover yourself completely in the sun, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled on the walkway a series of extravagant accessories for their spring-summer 2019 collection that embraced the public with the purest style of Paris Fashion Week.
The impossible shades filled Instagram this summer and these designers brought their most amazing creations to the walkway.
Valentino's main piece was an exaggerated beige hat adorned with a wide wing imitating feathers that flooded the heads of the models.
Other large accessories included watermelons, a wizard's hat and even a pineapple, but they were not designed to protect the head from the cold.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of strange masks... just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had lips sewn and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than high seam.
One of the creations looked like a complete diving team, with glasses and the tube, and another a melted ice cone.
And if you're a huge fashion fan, you're lucky.
The fashion senses predicted that giant hats could reach the tents.
The disproportionate hats come just after the "Bomb", the ball hat with a 60-cm blade that takes everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand that is behind the impossible hat that invades all social networks has brought to the walkway another great creation: a ball beach bag almost as large as the model worn with a swimsuit that carries it.
The orange raffia bag decorated with raffia flakes and finished with a white leather wing, was the highlight of Jacquemus' La Riviera spring summer 2019 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I hope big umbrellas and beach bags arrive at the stores next summer, as the designer had such an impact that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for oversize accessories.”
John Edward: Linguistic skills are essential for the citizens of the world
Scotland’s private schools maintain a track record of academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with another collection of outstanding exam results, which is only reinforced by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other community subjects.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Private Schools (SCIS), strive to offer the best level to students and their parents.
Private schools aim to prepare their students for higher education, for the career they choose and their place as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a tailor-made curriculum, we are seeing that modern languages continue to be a popular and desired topic within schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, it comes to his mind.
But if you speak to him in your own language, come to his heart.”
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely solely on English when we want to establish relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the results of the recent exams this year, we can see that languages are at the highest on the board and with the highest approved rates in private schools.
68% of students who studied foreign languages received an outstanding score.
The data, compiled from the 74 schools that make up SCIS, show that 72% of students obtained honorary enrollment in Mandarin, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French and 63% of those who studied Spanish, also achieved an outstanding one.
This demonstrates that Scottish private schools support languages and consider them key skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Today, languages are taking the same consideration as subjects such as science, technology, engineering and mathematics in private school programs of all kinds.
A survey conducted by the UK Commission on Employment and Training in 2014 found that among the lack of language skills, it constitutes 17% of the reasons why employers find it difficult to cover vacancies.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly essential in preparing young people for their future careers.
These skills are essential in a globalized world, as there are more job opportunities that need languages.
Regardless of the chosen career, learning a second language will have a real advantage in the future with a lifelong skill like this.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will put a bilingual person directly at the head of the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75% did not speak any foreign language well enough to hold a conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage, in this case 15%.
That’s why it’s so important to invest in a language for today’s kids.
Knowledge of several languages, especially those of developing economies, provides children with more opportunities to find a meaningful job.
In Scotland, the language of instruction differs according to the school.
Some schools focus on more classical modern languages, while others opt for languages considered more important for the UK by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of what the interests of their children are, private schools always have several languages to choose from and specialized teachers in this field.
Scottish private schools specialize in providing a learning environment that prepares children and staff with the skills needed to succeed, whatever the future holds for them.
We cannot deny that at this time, in a global business environment, languages remain vital to the future of the country, so this should be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered "international communicative skills".
Private schools will continue to offer this diversity and excellence to Scottish youth.
We have to do it right.
John Edwards is the director of the Scottish Council of Private Schools.
Lebron debuts with the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for the seers who want to see LeBron James playing for the first time with the Los Angeles Lakers.
The team's coach, Like Walton, announced that James will play the opening game of the preseason against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
It remains to be decided how many minutes he will play.
“It will be more than 1 and less than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell posted on Twitter that James would probably play a few minutes.
After training early this week, they asked James about their plans ahead of the Lakers' six games.
At this point in my career, I don’t need games early to be ready,” he said.
Trump's election moves to Virginia on YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins a series of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It will be Trump’s first of five planned rallies next week, including stops in nearby cities such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote paused for his candidate to cover the Supreme Court vacancy, Trump intends to gain support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans run the risk of losing control of Congress when they vote in November.
What time is the Trump rally in West Virginia and how can you see it on the Internet?
Trump’s rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for today, Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 7 p.m. ET.
You can watch Trump’s rally in West Virginia follow through live streaming on YouTube.
Trump will likely address the issue of the trial held this week to Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who has become tense over allegations of sexual misconduct and who holds the Senate confirmation vote suspended for a week while the FBI investigates.
But the main goal of this series of protests is to help Republicans face the November elections with a new impetus.
Therefore, these five rallies that Trump will give next week are aimed at “dynamizing volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives,” according to Reuters.
“Congress control is so important to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible towards the campaign season,” a Trump campaign spokesman said in a statement.
The rally tonight, which will be held at Wesbanco Stadium, could gather supporters of “Ohio and Pennsylvania and get coverage from Pittsburgh’s media,” according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in a month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state in which he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican candidate for the Senate, Patrick Morrisey, last in the polls.
“It’s not a good symptom for Morrisey that the president has to come to support him in the investigations,” Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows endurance to fight and keep hope alive until Sunday’s individual matches
After three individual sessions, Saturday afternoon's foursome could have been what this Ryder Cup needed.
The oscillating impulse pendulum is a fully invented sporting concept but in what athletes really believe, and especially in competitions like this.
So, where would you say the momentum is now?
"They had a six-point lead and now they're four, so I guess we took that as a little bit of a boost," Jordan Spieth said as he walked away at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe has four points of advantage with twelve more at stake.
Americans, Spieth said, feel they have a little wind in their favor and a lot to cheer on, among other things the technique of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each counts three out of four.
Spieth has been lethal from tee to green and is preaching by example.
These guttural screams became stronger as he advanced his round, making a crucial putt to hit the fourth game when he and Thomas were two points below after two.
By getting the putt that made them win the match at number 15, he threw a similar yell, the kind of yelling that he believes the American team is not out yet.
“You just have to focus and worry about your party,” Spieth said.
That’s the only thing left for these players.
18 holes to leave a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed history of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but adorable European couple have four out of four and can't go wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple that didn't make a bogey on Saturday afternoons, but they also avoided them on Saturday mornings, Friday afternoons and not the last nine holes on Friday mornings.
That trajectory, and the way it seems to flow its energy to and from the crowd, confirms them as rivals beat Sunday, and there could be no more popular players to achieve a victory when the sun sets over Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
However, talking about European glory is still premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly dispatched Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning fourballs, when he paired up with Alex Noren.
One bogey and two doubles in the first round ended up with the Spanish and the Swedish in a hole they were never close to leaving.
But on Sunday there will be no one to help get out of the hole.
Fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to see from the close by the interactions between couples, the advice they give, the ones they don’t, and the way they can change a strategy in an instant.
Europe played better as a team so far and have a significant advantage the last day, but this foursome session also showed that Team USA has stamina to fight, something that some, especially Stateside, doubted.
Europe took a 10-6 lead on the last day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe will enjoy a good advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup after leaving the fourballs and foursomes with a 10-6 advantage over the United States.
The inspired duo formed by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two wins over a Tiger Woods with difficulty climbing four points to the score at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, which seeks to preserve the trophy they lost two years ago at Hazeltine, dominated an American team that failed in the morning fourballs, putting the series 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the foursomes, winning four games, but they were unable to cut the lead.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points out of Sunday's 12 individual games to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European novice to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, dubbed "Molliwood", after a sensational weekend, are the second pair to win four points from the four initial games in Ryder Cup history.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, they matched perfectly to defeat a discarded Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with 5&4 more categorical.
Woods, who played two games without penalty or glory on Saturday, showed occasional bursts of brilliance, but now lost 19 out of 29 games in fourballs and foursomes and five in a row.
Justin Rose, who rested in the morning's fourballs, reunited as his partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes, scoring a defeat against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, number one and three in the world.
Europe could not always win on a nice breeze day in southwest Paris.
Three-time champion Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans by scoring two points on Saturday.
They achieved a 2&1 victory over the Spanish John Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs and returned to win Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the foursomes after losing the first two holes.
There have only been two times in Ryder Cup history in which a team scores four points in the individual, although as the current trophy holder, Furyk's team only needs to beat to keep it.
However, after being the second best in two days, a counterattack on Sunday seems to be out of reach.
North Korea says no to unilateral disarmament if there is no confidence
North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the ongoing sanctions increased its distrust of the United States and that the country would not hand over its nuclear weapons in those circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "important steps to show its goodwill" last year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling nuclear test camps and committing to the proliferation of weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we do not see the corresponding response from the United States," he added.
"Without confidence in the United States there will be no confidence in our national security and, in such circumstances, there will be unilateral disarmament first on our part."
While Ri resumed the already known North Korean complaints about Washington’s resistance to “gradual” denuclearization under which North Korea would be rewarded as it took action, his statement seemed important, as it did not reject unilateral denuclearization as it did with Pyongyang in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement made by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between an active U.S. president and a North Korean leader held in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to “denuclearize” the Korean peninsula while Trump guaranteed North Korea’s security.
North Korea has long sought a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has declared that Pyongyang must first lay down its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted loosening the harsh international sanctions on North Korea.
“The United States insists on ‘denuclearization first’ and increases pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal of coercive object, and even oppose the ‘declaration of the end of war,’” Ri said.
“The perception that sanctions can make us sneeze is an impossible dream for someone who doesn’t know us.
But the problem is that continuing sanctions exacerbate our distrust.”
Ri did not mention the plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump that the US leader mentioned at the United Nations earlier this week.
However, he spoke of three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: "If the other part of this denuclearization issue were South Korea and not the United States, denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have reached a dead end."
Still, the tone of Ri’s speech was radically different from last year’s, when he told the UN General Assembly it was inevitable to attack the United States with North Korean missiles after the “evil president” Trump called Kim a “man rocket on a suicide mission.”
This year at the U.N., Trump, who last year threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking action to disarm, but said there was still a lot of work to be done and that sanctions should be maintained until North Korea denuclearized.
Trump said there was no deadline for that, and that "it would take two years, three or five months."
China and Russia discuss whether the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that “the enforcement of the Security Council sanctions must continue with firmness and without exception until we observe total, final and verified denuclearization.”
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions in North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to cut funds for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and later commented that he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying he had made progress, just a few hours after North Korea denounced him for making “mafia demands.”
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile deployment, as well as a nuclear complex, if the United States took "corresponding measures".
He pointed out that Kim had told him that the "corresponding measures" he was requesting were the security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and the move towards normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to get enough rest
This year, a new Harvard University course is making all its students sleep more in order to combat the growth of the masculine culture of studying all night stimulated by caffeine.
One academic discovered that the number one university students in the world often do not know the basics about how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard School of Medicine and a specialist at Brigham and Muller Hospital, conceived the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a talk about the impact that lack of sleep had on learning.
“At the end of the course, a girl approached me and said, ‘Why are you only telling me this now, in my last year?’
He said no one had told him about the importance of sleeping, which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, which was launched this year for the first time, explains to students the basics about how acquiring good sleep habits helps with academic and athletic performance, as well as improves overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard School of Medicine and executive director of the university’s health services, said the university decided to present the course after discovering that students had a significant lack of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course involves a series of interactive tasks.
In a section there is an image of a bedroom, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, trainers, and books to get information about the effects of caffeine and light and how sleep deficiency affects athletic performance, as well as the importance of having a routine at bedtime.
In another section, participants are told how prolonged sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
A campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
“We know that the behavior of the students will not change immediately.
But we believe that they have a right to know this information, just as we have a right to know what the health effects are if we choose to smoke tobacco,” added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride to spend all night waking up still exists, he says. And he adds that modern technology and the increasing pressure for students that implied lack of sleep was a growing problem.
Ensuring that you sleep enough and have good quality sleep should be a student’s “secret weapon” to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety, it signals. Even avoid getting fat, as lack of sleep causes the brain to go into hunger mode, which makes it constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to push a course across campus.
The next step, hopefully, is to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar study program before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider setting an alarm for lying down, as well as for when they wake up. It is also recommended that they be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" emitting electronic screens and LED lighting, which can cause problems and cause a rip-off.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal knocks down Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another sad episode when Dolly Menga's attack relegated Steven Gerrard's disjointed team to a 1–0 loss at Livingston.
Ibrox's team intended to record their first home win since the 4-1 victory at St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team caused Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as a coach, which left his team at eight Hearts points.
Menga attacked seven minutes before the break and a low-inspired Rangers lineup never gave the feeling that he was going to hit.
While the Rangers dropped to sixth place, Livingston climbed to third place and is only behind the Hibernian with a difference goal.
And it could have been a lot worse for the Rangers after line judge Calum Spence had to deal with a head injury after the supposed launch of an object.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that threw Ayr in the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup, the Scottish League Cup.
On the other hand, Holt was with Livingston's same 11th who scored a point for the Hearts last week and would have been delighted with the way their organized team suffocated their opponents at all times.
The Rangers may dominate possession, but Livingston did much more when they had the ball.
They could have scored in just two minutes when the short pass of Menga's first time sent Scott Pittman towards Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder wasted this great opportunity.
A powerful free throw from Keaghan Jacobs reached Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner, Alan Lithgow, only managed to tie him in the second pole.
The Rangers took control, but it seems they had more hope than conviction about their game in the offensive area.
Undoubtedly, Alfredo Morelos felt that they would have been penalized at 15 minutes when he and Steven Lawless clashed, but the referee, Steven Thomson, ignored the Colombian's claims.
The Rangers only made two shots at the door in the first half, but Ibrox's former goalkeeper Liam Kelly only had problems with Lassana Coulibaly's head shot and Ovie Ejaria's attack.
While Livingston's opening in the 34th minute might have gone against the logic of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it for their hard work.
The Rangers again failed to face the strong formation of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher fitted the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept the blood cold to choose Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard acted in the break by switching Coulibaly to Ryan Kent, a change that almost had an immediate effect when the left made a pass to Morelos, but the imposing Kelly ran from his line to block him.
But Livingston continued to devour visitors by playing exactly the type of game they liked, with Lithgow and Halkett picking up one ball long after another.
Holt's team could have expanded the lead in the final moments, but McGregor stood perfectly up to reject Jacobs before Lithgow headed from the corner.
The Rangers' replacement, Glenn Middleton, claimed another penalty when he tied up with Jacobs, but Thomson again made the blindfold.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our Sunday Morning almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and CONTACT... it was the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led him to the device known as the Geiger counter.
A staple of science since then, the accountant Geiger has also become a fundamental element of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", starring those seemingly unusual cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: “What’s that in the world?”
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, which is used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
By putting on these headphones, you can hear the effects of the atoms emitted by the radioactivity of the minerals.”
Evans: "Say, I'm sure it's exploding now!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days after his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name survives.
The new cancer vaccine may teach the immune system to “see” defective cells
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" defective cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize defective cells as part of treatment.
The method involves the extraction of a patient's immune cells, altering them in the laboratory.
They can "see" a protein common to several types of cancer and inject it back
A test vaccine is showing promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize defective cells, has seen her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of a patient's immune cells, which are altered in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein common to several types of cancer called HER2 and then reject the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 "impulses the growth of several types of cancer," including those of the breast, ovaries, lung and colorectal, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to extracting immune cells from patients and "teaching" them to address cancer cells worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West embarked on a speech in favor of Trump by wearing a MAGA (Make America Great Again) hat after his appearance on Saturday Night Live (SNL).
And the result was not good.
During a Saturday Night Live show, they grabbed Kanye West in the studio after a confusing presentation in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump, and said he would run for office in 2020.
After playing the third song of the night, called Ghost Town (“Ghost City”), in which he wore a make America Great Again cap, he criticized the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“I often talk to a white man and say, ‘How can you like Trump if you’re a racist?’
“If I were concerned about racism, I would have left the United States a long time ago,” he said.
SNL began the show with a satire starring Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee about the sexual assault lawsuits made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it wasn't released, Chris Rock uploaded images of West's criticism to social media.
It is not clear whether Rock was trying to make fun of West with this publication.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he had had a bad time behind the scenes because of his hat.
“They were behind the scenes with me.
They said, "You don't go out with that hat."
They intimidated me!
And then they said I was going for a picnic,” according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "You want to see how I'm going to pee?", saying that he was going to "use my superman cap because it means you can't tell me what I have to do."
Try it with love.”
His remarks sparked booze in the audience at least twice and SNL cast members seemed to be embarrassed, he told Variety magazine, with the following testimony that a person who was there gave the publication: "The whole studio was in absolute silence."
They had named West as the last replacement for Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West left many people puzzled with an interpretation of the song I Love It ("Love Me"), dressed as a Perrier water bottle.
West got the support of TPUSA leader Candace Turner, who wrote the following tweet: "For one of the most daring spirits: THANK YOU FOR FROM THE MAFIA"
However, the host of an interview show, Karen Hunter, wrote a tweet saying that West was simply "being who he is and that's completely wonderful."
So anyway, I chose NOT to reward anyone (by buying their music or clothing or supporting their “art”) that I think is embracing and spreading an ideology that is harmful to my community.
It's free.
Just like us,” he added.
Prior to the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying he was now "officially known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name; he follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The rapper Snoop Dogg was named Snoop Lion and, of course, the last music legend, Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then the artist formerly known as Prince.

Game of Thrones star Kit Harington attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his sword-managed role as Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy series HBO Game of Thrones.
The actor, 31, attacked the stereotype of a macho hero, saying that these roles on the screen translate into what seems like young people often have to be tough to respect them.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said "something went wrong" and wondered how to address the problem of toxic masculinity in the <0x23>MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that she feels "strong enough" to address the problem.
"Personally, I feel pretty strong right now. Where are we wrong about masculinity?" he said.
“What do we teach men when they grow up, in terms of the problem we see now?”
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity thanks to its very masculine characters.
He continued, “What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on television and in the streets; what makes young people feel they have to be that certain part of being a man?
I think that’s really one of the big questions of our time; how do we change that?
“Something went wrong with the kids.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he will not do any prequels or sequels to Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, stating that "enough of horses and battlefields".
From November, Kit will star in a remake of Sam Shepard's True West, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that he believes his meeting with his wife, Rose, was the best of Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife on this program, so in a way, I provided my future family and my life from now on,” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the love of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on the land of Leslie's family heritage in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV or AIDS.
It affects more than 820,000 people in the country, health authorities said.
40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases have been sexually transmitted, which marks a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly through parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people contracting HIV in this way had been reduced to virtually zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, on an annual basis, the number of people living with HIV or AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV poses a serious problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was discriminated in China in 1997, but it is said that discrimination against LGBT people has spread.
Because of the country’s conservative values, studies estimate that between 70 and 90 percent of men who have sex with other men will end up marrying women.
Many of the transmissions of the disease come from inadequate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV mediation as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies a staff member leaking data from Republican Senators, "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
On Saturday, U.S. Representative Maxine Waters denounced allegations that a member of her staff had posted personal information of three U.S. Republican Senators on lawmakers’ Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed the statements were being made by websites and commentators of the "ultra-right".
"Lies, lies, and more infamous lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The leaked information included private addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch from Utah.
The information appeared online Thursday, published by an unknown person at Capitol Hill, the U.S. government headquarters, during a Senate panel hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak appeared shortly after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the origin of the publications was associated with the Waters department and revealed information from a Waters staff member, Capitol Hill reported.
“This unfounded accusation is totally false and a complete lie,” Waters said.
“The member of my staff, whose identity, personal information and security were compromised as a result of these false and fraudulent accusations, was not responsible in any way for leaking this information.
This unfounded accusation is totally false and a complete lie.”
Waters's statement immediately sparked online criticism, including that of former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This denial was made in anger,” Fleischer wrote.
“It means you don’t have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone accuses you of something you didn’t do, you shouldn’t be angry.
It should not be challenging.
You must not question the motives of the defendant.
It must remain apracible and serene.”
Fleischer seemed to be comparing Waters' reaction to Kavanaugh's Democrats' criticism, which critics accused of appearing too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who appeared to ban Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
“If you’re right,” he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said his department had alerted "the law enforcement agencies and appropriate authorities of these fraudulent accusations.
“We will make sure that the culprits are found,” he continued, “as well as that they are legally responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to each and every member of my team.”
Review of Johnny English Strikes Again, Rowan Atkinson's unpowered spy parody
It is already traditional to seek the transcendence of Brexit in new films from a British point of view and it seems that this can be applied to the return of the franchise of this parody and action comedy by Johnny English, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and came back to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn ("Johnny English Returns").
Will the ironic satire about the matter of the obviously stupid that we are in the nation’s new export opportunity become?
Anyway, Johnny English's incompetent jump-eyed and rubber-faced character renewed his license to ruin things for the second time. His name is already a clear indication that this is a general comic creation designed for non-English-speaking cinematic territories.
Of course, he is the stupid secret agent who, despite his bizarre claims of flattering glamour, has a bit of Clouseau, a Mr Bean spark and a bunch of that kind who contributed with a single note on the theme of Fire Cars at the 2012 London Olympics Opening Ceremony.
It is also originally based on the cosmopolitan and mysterious international agent Atkinson once interpreted in Barclaycard's now-forgotten television ads, in which he planted chaos in his path.
There were a few good moments in Johnny English's last exit.
I love it when Johnny English approaches a helicopter while wearing a medieval armor suit and the rotor's footsteps make a brief stride against his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy comes to light, but it gives the impression that humor has little strength and is strangely superfluous, especially when such "serious" movies like 007 and Mission Impossible already use comedy convincingly as one of its ingredients.
It seems as if the humor was aimed at children, rather than adults, and in my opinion Johnny English’s extravagant misadventures are not as ingenious or concentrated as Atkinson’s shifting movie jokes when embodying Bean’s character.
Now the permanently topical argument is that Britain has serious problems.
A cyber-pirate infiltrates Britain’s super-secret web spy network and reveals the identities of all British agents in the area, to the distress of the agent in service, an unfortunate little role for Kevin Eldon.
It’s the culmination of a pompous and conflicting prime minister who is already suffering a total crisis of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing her best with this character that almost looks like Theresa May, but you can’t do much with the script.
Your intelligence advisers inform you that as all active spies have committed themselves, you must take someone out of retirement.
And that refers to the incompetent Johnny English in person, who now works as a teacher at some snob institution, but gives unofficial lessons on how to become an infiltrating agent; in this part there are some jokes, when English offers the espionage academy to a rock school.
They take English back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and meet with their former and suffering partner Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man with a submarine captain, an enthusiastic role in which Vicki Pepperdine is somewhat lost.
Batman and Robin from Her Majesty's Secret Service mistakes come back into action, colliding with Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatale, Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously succumbing to the charm of the charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve British computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of ridiculous falconers: disguised as waiters, they set fire to an ostentatious French restaurant; they create a turmoil that illegally puts them aboard Volta’s luxury yacht; and English provokes total anarchy by trying to use virtual reality helmets from the home.
Obviously, all the arrests come from this last sequence, but in the kind and outrageous way it is, it seems to be taken from a children's television show.
The result is quite regular.
And, like the other Johnny English films, I couldn’t help but think: can’t the British film industry offer Rowan Atkinson a role that really does justice to his talent?
The Labour Party denies it is designing a plan for the British to work four days a week, but pay for five days
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is considering a radical plan that will make the British work four days a week, but pay for five.
Presumably, the party wants employers to pass on the savings achieved through the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to workers by offering them an extra day off.
In this way, employees would enjoy a three-day weekend, but would still receive the same salary.
Sources say the idea would “adjust” the party’s economic agenda and its plans to tilt the country in favor of workers.
The Congress of Trade Unions supported the four-day-a-week wave as a measure for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party source told The Sunday Times: “A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
“It won’t happen overnight, but a four-day working week is an ambition that fits the party’s approach to balancing the economy in favor of the worker, as well as the party’s general industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day working week during its campaign for the 2017 general election.
At the moment, however, the Labour Party does not support the ambition in its entirety.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "A four-day working week does not enter the party's politics and is not being considered by it."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour Party conference last week to reinforce his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to regain power from “anonymous directors” and “speculators” in public service companies.
The Chancellor's plans in the shadow also imply the possibility that current shareholders of water companies will not recover all their investment, as a labor government could make "deductions" due to the perceived irregularities.
He also confirmed plans to put workers on the boards of companies and create inclusive ownership funds to deliver 10% of private sector companies’ shares to employees, which bag annual dividends worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell '60 Minutes' if the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could make them change their mind
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed at least a week's final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court, raising the question of whether the department's findings could influence Republican senators to withdraw their support.
On Sunday, 60 Minutes reporter Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could bring to light something that would lead them to change their minds.
Kennedy was more open-minded than his South Carolina counterpart.
“I mean, of course,” Kennedy said.
"They said I was going to the hearing. I talked to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the indictment came out and asked him if he had done it.
He was firm, determined, round.”
However, Graham’s vote seems to be immovable.
“My opinion about Brett Kavanaugh is decided and I would make an explosive indictment,” he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened; but I know the following: Brett denied it roundly," Graham added in reference to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And the people he mentioned couldn’t verify it.
It happened 36 years ago.
I don’t see anything new.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and did you do something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that features an impressive poster of acting stars and an equally impressive mission to end world poverty.
In its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see thousands of people coming to the Great Lawn area of Central Park, not only to enjoy performances such as those of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness about the event’s real goal of ending poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international support group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket for the event (unless you want to pay for a VIP ticket), the attendee audience had to complete a series of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call or any other meaningful way to help you get around.
But what is the degree of success achieved by the Global Citizen after 12 years of achieving its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a genuine way to persuade people to ask for action, or is it just another case of so-called “clickivism,” people who think it makes a difference by signing an online petition or by sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has registered more than 19 million "actions" of its followers, driving a set of different goals.
It claims that these actions helped stimulate world leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion set up to influence the lives of more than 2250 million people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements derived from its actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been disbursed or raised.
The group estimates that so far the guaranteed funds have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK company of investors and executors that is committed to “helping children develop to their fullest potential,” with the promise of providing Rwanda $35 million to help end global undernutrition in the country after receiving tweets.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national authorities, and Global Citizen supporters like you, we can turn social injustice from malnutrition into a footnote of history,” The Power of Nutrition’s London ambassador Tracey Ullman told the crowd during a 2018 live concert.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions to improve nutrition for mothers and children in the UK, the government announced funding for the The Power of Nutrition project that will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on your website, "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?",
Global Citizen replied: "It will be a long and difficult road and sometimes we will fall and fail.
But just as it was with the big anti-apartheid movements and the civil rights that preceded us, we will achieve it, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are some of the artists who will perform at this year’s event in New York, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. could use the navy to carry out a “blockade” to hinder Russia’s energy exports, the U.S. Secretary of the Interior announced.
“In case it is necessary,” Washington may resort to the Navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including the Middle East, U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke argued that Russia’s commitment to Syria, especially where it operates at the instances of legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
“I think the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to negotiate with energy the same way they did in Eastern Europe,” he said.
According to the official, they also have the means and the means to deal with it.
“The United States has the capacity, along with the navy, to ensure that the seaways are open and, if necessary, block them to ensure that their energy does not go to the market,” he said.
Zinke addressed the participants of the event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that calls itself the “voice of the energy consumer” in the US.
He compared Washington’s strategies to deal with Russia and Iran, considering that in practice, it is the same.
“The economic option in Iran and Russia is more or less to take advantage of and replace fuels,” he said, while referring to Russia saying that “it has only one tactic” with a hydrocarbon-dependent economy.
The statements were made while the Trump administration was on a mission to boost exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, in order to replace that of Russia, the most economic option for European consumers.
To that end, Trump administration officials, including the president himself, tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the “unsuitable” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, turned Berlin into a “captive” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which was set to double the capacity of the existing pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a mere economic project.
The Kremlin has argued that Washington’s fierce opposition to the project is only argued for economic reasons and that it is an example of unfair competition.
“I think we share the idea that energy cannot be a tool to exert pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry, who took place in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position obtained Germany’s reaction, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The industry-leading German Federation of German Industries (BDI) has called on the US to move away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply,” BDI President Dieter Kempf said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren Will Carefully Examine Her Candidacy for President in 2020, Says Massachusetts Senator
On Saturday, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would carefully examine her candidacy for the presidency after midterm elections.
During a public meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider his candidacy.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and reprise the fractured government and that includes a woman in power,” she said.
“After November 6th, I will carefully examine my candidacy for the presidency.”
Warren commented on President Donald Trump during the public assembly, stating that he was “bringing this country in the wrong direction.
“I’m very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” he said.
Warren has been frank in his criticisms of Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren said in a tweet, "Of course an FBI investigation is needed before the vote."
However, in a poll published Thursday, it was shown that most of Warren’s own voters do not believe he will be running in 2020.
Fifty percent of Massachusetts' "probable" voters said the senator would not run for office, according to a poll by the University of Suffolk's Political Research Center and the Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported the nomination.
The poll showed more support for the former governor's candidacy, Deval Patrick, with 38 percent support for a possible candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other prominent Democrat names in relation to a possible 2020 candidacy include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision before January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin cites Track Palin Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) in the midst of Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enrolling in September
On Monday night, they arrested and charged with an incident of domestic violence.
"What my own son is going through, what is going on again, I can see myself reflected in other families who feel the consequences of PTSD and some of the wounds our soldiers return with," Trump told the audience at a rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin said his arrest was a taboo subject and that his son and other war veterans "return different, hardened, wondering if there is any respect for what the militia and aviators, as well as other members of the army, have offered to the country."
They arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of domestic violence against a woman, which interferes in a report of domestic violence and possession of a gun while he was drunk, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesperson for Wasilla police.
18 states and the District of Columbia challenge the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a court appeal in connection with a new U.S. policy that denies asylum for victims of domestic violence or criminal organizations.
On Friday, representatives from 18 states and the district presented a court-friendly report in Washington to support a policy-challenging asylum seeker, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff of the Grace Sessions v. Court that the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against federal policy was not revealed.
She said her partner "and her children members of a violent criminal organization" abused her, but that U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
Detainee in Texas.
Lawyers from the states that support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce a large number of asylum seekers for the United States, as nations facing widespread problems with criminal organizations and related to domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy repealed a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The District of Columbia Attorney General, Karl Racine, said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international legislation."
“Federal legislation requires that all asylum applications be adjourned according to the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and the ban violates that principle,” the court’s friend said in a statement.
Taxpayers continued to debate in the report that the policy of refusing entry of immigrants harms the U.S. economy, explaining that they are likely to become entrepreneurs and that they “provide labor.”
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant any more asylum to victims of domestic abuse and the violence of criminal organizations.
“Asylum is available to those who leave their country due to persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a particular social group or political opinion,” Sessions said in its June 11 policy announcement.
Asylum has never been meant to alleviate all the problems (including all the serious problems) that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as the number of victims doubles in a career to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation is getting worse.
"The circumstances are very tense," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, comforting her febrile baby in the evacuation center of the besieged city of Palu.
“Every minute there is an ambulance with bodies.
“Clean water is scarce.”
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, collecting their drowning belongings, trying to save anything they found.
Hundreds of people are injured and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, are overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who fractured his back and shoulder, rested outside Palu Military Hospital, where patients were treated outdoors due to continuous and strong replicas.
Tears filled his eyes as he explained how he felt that the violent earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor that he shared with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save us.
The ruins of the wall crushed me, I think,” Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was at a wedding in the city.
“I listened to my wife asking for help, and then just silence.
I don’t know what happened to her or my daughter.
I hope you're safe."
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of Abuse with ‘Propaganda Ads’
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in a U.S. newspaper advocating the benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump referred to the China Daily payment supplement on the Des Moines Register, the state's best-selling newspaper, after accusing China of meddling in the U.S. Congressional elections to be held on November 6, which China denies.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing was trying to intervene in the U.S. election marked what U.S. officials devised on Reuters as a new phase of a growing Washington campaign to coerce China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to publish advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently trapped in a growing trade war witnessing tariff leveling on their respective imports.
According to China and U.S. experts, China’s countervailing tariffs at the start of the trade war were designed to harm exporters from states such as Iowa, which supports Trump’s Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, one of the leading exporters of agricultural products to China, said Beijing has harmed workers, farmers and U.S. entrepreneurs.
In an opinion article written by Branstad and published in the Sunday edition of the Moines Register, it was stated that China is “intensifying that campaign of harassment by spreading propaganda ads in the US press free of charge.”
“In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government takes advantage of the cherished American tradition of freedom of expression and the press by publishing a payment announcement in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
On the contrary, at the newsstand at the end of this Beijing street, there are few dissenting voices and there is no real reflection of the dissenting views that the Chinese may have on China’s worrying economic trajectory, given that the media are under the firm thumb of the Chinese Communist Party.
He also said that “one of China’s most important newspapers declined the offer to publish” his article, although he did not confirm which newspaper it was.
Kavanaugh Disaster Loses Women's Republican Vote Just Days After Half-term Elections
Although many of the top Republicans support and defend Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, despite various allegations of sexual assault, analysts warn of a violent reaction, especially from female voters, in the upcoming midterm elections.
Reactions around these accusations were numerous and the majority of Republicans positioned themselves to proceed with the vote.
“These things cannot be undone,” Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, said in an article published Sunday in The Hill.
Reeher also stated that he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake's (R-Arizona) last hour for an FBI investigation would be enough to calm the mood of angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, nor will they forget it in the near future nor in November," Karine Jean-Pierre, chief advisor and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, told the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, opponents of the "Acercase November!" flu protested in the Senate corridor, while Republicans, under the control of the Judiciary Committee, decided to proceed with Kavanaugh's appointment, despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, Mic reported.
"The motivation and enthusiasm of the Democrats will exceed any expectations," Stu Rothenberg, a neutral political analyst, told the news site.
"It's already high,
But it will be even more so, especially among the undecided women in the suburbs or those between the ages of 18 and 29, who, although they don’t like the President, don’t usually go to the polls.”
Before Ford's public testimony detailed his allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court candidates, analysts suggested it was possible to suffer a violent reaction if Republicans continued with confirmation.
“This has become a disaster for the Republican Party,” Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News earlier this week.
"This goes beyond the committee vote, the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will sit in the defendants' bench or not. The problem is how the Republicans handled this and how they treated it," said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps Democrats vote on the news channel.
However, it seems that Americans are divided between whether to believe Ford's or Kavanaugh's testimony, although they are more inclined to support the latter.
A new YouGov survey shows that 41% of people surveyed believe fully or probably Ford's testimony, compared to 35% who support Kavanaugh's testimony.
In addition, 38% believe that Kavanaugh is more likely to lie during his testimony, compared to 30% who think the same about Ford.
Following pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the charges filed by Ford, as well as those of at least one other indictee, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Last week, Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath that Kavanaugh attacked her in a drunken state when she was 17.
Ramirez, on the other hand, claims that the Supreme Court candidate showed the genitives at a university party while she was studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The creator of the World Wide Web wants to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the latest project of this technology legend, is a company based on Solid, the open source platform of Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people can access what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee chanced that Inrupt's hideous intention was "to dominate the world".
“We have to do it,” he said of the startup.
“This is a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own "online personal data store" or POD.
It can include contact lists, lists of pending tasks, calendars, music, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were available in a single browser at the same time.
All this makes this personal data store unique is that the user has complete control over who can access what information.
The company classifies this as “personal empowerment through data.”
Inrupt’s idea, according to its president John Bruce, is that the company provides appropriate resources, processes and skills to help Solid be available to the world.
The company is currently formed by Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security company owned by IBM, some developers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
From this week, developers around the world could create their own decentralized applications with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee stated that neither he nor his team spoke with Facebook nor Google about whether or not to introduce a complete change that would modify their business models from one day to the next.
"We don't need your permission."
In an article published Saturday in Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of a new Solid-based web."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by establishing the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has emerged as an influential voice in the debate over net neutrality.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, as well as the Web Foundation and Open Data Institute organizations.
“I’m very optimistic about this new era of the web,” added Berners-Lee.
A tribute to Bernard Vann, clergyman decorated with the Cross of Victory in World War I
The only clergyman of the Church of England who was decorated with the Victoria Cross during World War I received a posthumous tribute in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel and Reverend Bernard Vann was awarded on September 29, 1918, in the attack of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later without knowing that he was awarded the highest British military decoration.
On Saturday, his two grandchildren were tasked with discovering a memorial in his honor at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
Michael Vann, one of his grandsons, emphasized the symbolism of discovering this monument just 100 years after his grandmother’s masterpiece earned him the title.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann directed his battalion through the Saint-Quentin canal "through a dense fog and under the yoke of an intense machine gun fire".
He later rushed to reach the line of fire and, with "great courage", directed the line forward before rushing with a cannon and without the help of anyone, and shot down three people from the enemy detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918, just a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandmother's actions were "something he could never live with, but a lesson still like that."
He and his brother Dr James Vann also placed a flower crown after the parade, which led the youth band Brentwood Imperial.
Michael Vann said he was "very honored to participate in the parade" and added that "the courage of this genuine hero demonstrates the support of so many people."
Peppa Pig cuts the roll to MMA fans at the best time
Imagine taking all night smart to enjoy the full show of Bellator 206, and when the best part comes, something stops you.
The San Jose cartel included 13 fights, six of which were the main, and was being broadcast live in the UK on Channel 5.
But at 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were going to face each other, UK viewers were stunned when they saw Peppa Pig appear.
Some were not impressed after having spent so many smart hours waiting to see the fight.
One fan described the change to these children's drawings on Twitter as "a very tasteless joke".
"State legislation says that content wasn't appropriate for 6am, and that's why it had to change to child programming," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of Marketing and Communications, when asked about the relay.
"Peppa Pig, that's it."
Scott Coker, president of Bellator, said they will take UK viewers into account in future programming.
“I think we can solve it when we think about repetition,” Coker said.
"But if it's 6 in the morning there, we can't solve it until Sunday, which will already be Monday for them.
But we are working to find a solution.
When the change occurred I started receiving a lot of messages and not all were pleasant.
We were trying to solve it because we thought it was a technical error.
But no, it was a government issue.
I promise it won’t happen again.
We'll limit ourselves to five fights, instead of six. We wanted to give our fans the most, but we went and
I have a lot of anger."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior because of his sexuality
Olympic jumper Tom Daley says he has grown to feel inferior to the rest of the world because of his sexuality, but this has given him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old says he didn’t realize that not everyone was like him until he got to the gym.
A guest on the first show of the Desert Island Discs program on Radio 4 led by Lauren Laurene, he explained that he began talking about gay rights to give hope to others.
He also shared that the fact of being a father helped him to relativize the importance of winning the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the usual presenter of this program, is low on illness.
As a guest on the first Laverne-led show, Daley shared that he felt "inferior" to the rest of the people because "it was not socially acceptable that he liked boys and girls."
“To this day, that feeling of inferiority and being different is what has driven me and given me the strength to succeed.”
I wanted to prove that I was “someone” so that people wouldn’t feel disappointed in discovering their sexuality.
With two bronze Olympic medals, he became a prominent LGBT activist and used his appearance at the Commonwealth Games in Australia to ask more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He decided to speak because he felt lucky to be able to live openly and without fear of repercussions, and wanted to give hope to others.
The three-time world champion said that dating American director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, "was all a surprise".
Daley married this Oscar winner last year and claims that 20 years of difference between them have never been a problem.
"When you live so much in so little time" (when you were only 14 years old at the Olympics for the first time and your father died of cancer three years later), it's hard to find someone your age who experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple had their first child in June, Robert Ray Black-Daley, and this birth caused Daley to completely change his perspective.
“If you asked me last year, my biggest motivation would be to win a gold medal,” he said.
“But now I know that there are things much more important than an Olympic gold medal.
For me, my medal is Robbie.”
His son is named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Daley's father did not accept that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked his son was for tickets to London 2012, he wanted to be in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him I wouldn’t be here to fill that first queue,” Daley said.
“I was holding her hand when she stopped breathing and it was at that exact moment, at the moment of her death, when I realized that she wasn’t really invincible,” he added.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"At that moment I knew that was the dream of my life: to jump in front of a crowd in my country participating in the Olympics, there was no better feeling," he said.
The choice of Heather Small's Proud song is also not on the van, as it is the melody that accompanied him during his preparation for the Olympics and still puts his hair on the tip.

A low-form Mickelson ended up on the Ryder Cup bench this Saturday
Phil Mickelson will beat a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to improve his technique so that it doesn't turn into an unfortunate event.
Mickelson, who participated in the biennial event for the 12th time, stayed in the bench at the decision of captain Jim Furyk and was unable to participate in the fourball or the foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being the center of the action, like so many other times for the United States, the five-time champion spent the day cheering and working to improve his movements.
Although he was never the most accurate of the players, not even at the peak of his career, at the age of 48 he does not fit into the match-fixed Le Golf National, where tall grass tends to punish the wrong shots.
And if that wasn’t enough, Mickelson would face in Sunday’s ninth game against the British Open winner Francesco Molinari, who joined Tommy Fleetwood to win the four games this week.
If the Americans, four points below the start of the 12 individual games, start with a good foot, Mickelson’s performance could be totally crucial.
Furyk trusted her husband, though he could not say much more.
"He perfectly understood the role I played today, gave me a palm on my shoulder, passed my arm and told me that tomorrow I would be ready," Furyk said.
“I had full confidence in myself.
He has a prominent place in the Hall of Fame and has contributed a lot to the teams in the past and this week.
I didn’t think I would play two games.
I thought I’d play more, but in the end that’s how things are and we thought they should be.
Like everyone else, he wants to be out there.”
On Sunday, Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo’s record in the largest number of games played in the Ryder Cup.
He could mark the end of his career in the Ryder Cup, a career that never reached the level of his individual palmarés.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven halves, although Furyk claims his presence also provides intangibles to the team.
"He's a funny, sarcastic person, he's brilliant and he likes to hang out with people, he's a good guy to have on the team," he explained.
“I’d love to see how well the youngest players have played this week.
It’s a lot more than just a good player.”
The captain of Europe, Thomas Bjorn, fears the disappearance of the advantage
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a considerable advantage in the last day of Ryder Cup individuals can easily turn into an inconvenient journey.
The Great Dane made his debut in 1997 in a match at Valderrama, where a team captained by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but ended up reaching the finish line with a minimal lead by winning 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“You still think we had a big advantage in Valderrama; just like in Brookline, where we lost, but in Valderrama we won for little,” Bjorn reflects, in the photo, after seeing the 2018 promotion win 5-3 on Friday and, yesterday, 10-6 at Le Golf National.
History shows that this is not over yet.
I have to go for it all tomorrow.
You have to go out and do the right thing.
This does not end until the points are on the marker.
Our goal is to win that trophy, and we have to focus on that.
“I’m not tired of saying it, I’m focused on our 12 players who are on our side, but I’m also very aware of what’s on the other side: the best players in the world.”
Enchanted by the performance of his players on a hard golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never sing victory before time.
Tomorrow, we’ll meet another beast.
Tomorrow is the day of individual performances, and there we also have to prove our worth.
It’s great to be with a partner when things go well, but when you face things individually, then you put your ability as a golfer to the test.
That’s the message you need to convey to the players, who get the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind, and he must also get the best out of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk will look for his players to perform better individually than his teammates, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who added three points out of four.
Furyk himself was on both ends of those last-day spins, being part of the winning team at Brookline, but finishing as a loser after the European miracle at Medinah."
"I remember every damn word," he replied when asked if he remembered how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, would reunite the players for the last day.
“We have 12 important games, but you’d like to have a quick start like Brookline or Medinah.
When you see that the momentum is going in a direction, there is a lot of pressure in these intermediate games.
We prepared our alignment with this in mind and put the players as it seemed to us, we want to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas has the task of trying to lead the fight and face Rory McIlroy in the first game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans, in the top half of the qualifying.
“I decided this order because I think it covers the whole way,” Bjorn explained about his selection for the individuals.
Germany's new warship postponed once again
The German Navy's newest frigate should have been delivered in 2014, to replace the old warships of the Cold War era, but it will not arrive until at least next year due to faulty systems and increasing costs, local media reported.
The service of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the leading ship of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class flamenco frigates, was delayed until the first half of 2019, a military spokesman told Die Zeit newspaper.
The ship should have been incorporated into the Navy in 2014, but problems after delivery affected the fate of this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships, commissioned by the Navy in 2007, will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
It is understood that they will have a powerful cannon, with different anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as with occultation technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods, it should be possible to deploy the youngest frigates up to two years outside the ports of origin.
However, as Die Zeit well points out, these continuous delays mean that warships with the latest technology, and which will allow Germany to project its power abroad, will be outdated when they enter service.
The unfortunate F125 frigate was reported last year when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons behind this return, but the German media spoke of "crucial software and hardware defects" that made it impossible to use the warship on a combat mission.
The software defects were particularly important, as the Baden-Württemberg-class ships will be operated by a crew of 120 sailors; that is, half of the personnel needed in the former Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, it was found that the ship had a dramatic excess weight, which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add improvements in the future.
The 7,000-ton Rhineland-Palatinate is thought to weigh twice as much as the similar-class ships the Germans used in World War II.
In addition to the defective hardware, the total cost of the project, which includes the formation of the crew, is also becoming a problem.
It is said to have already reached the astonishing amount of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3100 million, compared to the initial <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2200 million.
The problems of the youngest frigates are of particular importance in light of recent warnings that the naval power of Germany is making water.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defence committee of the German parliament, acknowledged that the Navy is running out of ships capable of deploying.
The officer states that this problem is increasing, as the old ships were withdrawn, but not replaced by others.
He also regretted that none of the frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could join the Navy.
The National Trust is spying on the secret life of bats.
A new research being carried out on a farm in the Scottish Highlands aims to reveal how bats use the landscape to search for food.
The results are expected to shed light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
This study led by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland association will follow the bats Pipistrellus pygmaeus and Pipistrellus pipistrellus, as well as the bats Myotis daubentonii and Plecotus auritus in Inverewe gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment will be placed in key locations around the property to track the bats’ activities during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys with manual detectors.
A sound analysis carried out by experts of all recordings will determine the frequency of calls from bats and what each species is doing.
Next, a habitat map will be developed to create a detailed picture of the landscape scale of your behavior.
Rob Dewar, NTS Nature Conservation Advisor, hopes that the results show that habitat areas are most important for bats and how they use each of the species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as the creation of meadows and what is the best way to maintain forests for bats and other associated species.
Flesh populations in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom have declined considerably in the last century.
These animals are threatened by construction and development works that affect children and the loss of habitat.
Wind turbines and aluminium also pose a risk, as well as traps with adhesive for flies, some chemical treatments of building materials, and attacks from domestic cats.
Butterflies are not blind.
But because of their night hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when hunting.
They use a sophisticated echolocation technique to locate insects and obstacles in their flight trajectory.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who conduct periodic surveys, child inspections and sometimes even rescues.
The organization even has Scotland's only and first bat reserve at Thrave Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
David Thompson, estate manager, says this is the ideal territory for them.
“At Threave we have a large butterfly area,” he says.
“We have old buildings, historic trees and a great habitat.
But there are a lot of things we don’t know about bats yet, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us better understand what they need to thrive.”
It underlines the importance of controlling the presence of bats before carrying out maintenance tasks on the property, as it is possible that the involuntary destruction of a single child of maternity may kill up to 400 females and offspring, which could exterminate an entire local population.
Fleas are a protected species and it is illegal to kill, harass or harass them, as well as destroy their children.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official of the Bat Conservation Trust, encourages people to help:
“There’s still a lot to learn about bats, and in the case of many of the species, we don’t know how it’s going to their populations.”
Ronaldo dismisses rape lawsuits and his lawyers prepare to sue German publication
Cristiano Ronaldo qualifies the allegations of rape against him as false, claiming that the only thing people want is to get to know each other using his name.
His lawyers will sue the German magazine Der Spiegel for publishing these accusations.
The frontman of Portugal and Juventus was accused of raping Kathryn Mayorga, an American woman, in a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
The footballer is said to have paid the woman $375,000 to not say anything about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Hours after his release, Ronaldo, 33, spotted this fake news in a live video from his Instagram account, which has 142 million followers.
“No, not a thousand times.
What was said today is false,” the five-time Golden Ball winner told the camera.
“People want to get to know each other using my name.
It's normal,
They want to be famous just by saying my name, it's part of my job.
I’m a happy and respectable man,” added the player smiling.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the charges, which they call “an inadmissible statement of suspicion in the area of privacy,” according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for "moral damages for an amount corresponding to the seriousness of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The incident was reported to have occurred in June 2019, in a suite at the Palm Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga would have returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anal, according to documents filed in the Clark County District Court of Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo, after the alleged incident, was acquitted by saying that he was 99% a gentleman, but that that 1% betrayed him.
The documents say that Ronaldo confirms that both parties had consensual sexual relations.
Mayorga also claimed that she went to the police and had photographs of the wounds, but later agreed to an extrajudicial agreement because she felt frightened by the reprisals and was concerned about public scathing.
The 34-year-old woman says she seeks to revoke the deal while she continues to be traumatized by the alleged incident.
At the time of the alleged crime, Ronaldo was about to reunite with Real Madrid from Manchester United, and this summer he joined Italian giant Juve in a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million deal.
Brexit: car makers would leave the UK <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
The UK would forever regret the loss of its position as the world’s leading carmaker after Brexit, according to business secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it is worrying that Toyota UK stated on the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production of its Burnaston plant near Derby.
“We need to reach an agreement,” Clark added.
The Japanese automaker said that in the event that Brexit did not come to any agreement, the impact of the delays at the border could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which is responsible for manufacturing Toyota's Auris and Avensis models, produced about 150,000 vehicles last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the EU.
“In my opinion, if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will witness how production stops at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, CEO of Toyota at Burnaston.
Other UK automakers also voiced their fears of leaving the EU without reaching an agreement on the functioning of cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW has confirmed that it will close its Mini plant in Oxford a month after Brexit.
One of the major concerns of automakers is the risk of the supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is tightly adjusted, with parts from UK and EU suppliers arriving every 37 minutes for custom-made cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without reaching an agreement on 29 March, the border could be affected and delays and shortages could arise.
The company says it would be impossible for Toyota to keep a normal pace for more than a day at the Derbyshire plant, so production would have to stop.
Clark says Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is "precisely calibrated to avoid such border checks."
"It is essential to have an agreement. And we want it to be the best agreement, in order to enjoy the current success but also to make the most of this opportunity," he said on BBC Radio 4's Today program.
“The experience of Toyota and other manufacturers is that it is necessary to continue these excellent supply chains.”
Toyota could not estimate how long the production would stop, but warned that in the long run the added costs would reduce the plant’s competition and could even cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, a 24-year Burnaston employee and union coordinator of Unite, said his members are increasingly concerned: "From experience, I know that once these jobs disappear, they never return.
A government spokesman said they had presented a precise and credible plan for the future relationship between the UK and the EU.
Trump’s meeting with Rosenstein could take place again
The White House said the high-risk meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Justice Rosenstein could be delayed by another week due to the fight for Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the elections, the links between Russia’s and Trump’s aides, and the possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether or not Trump fires the deputy attorney general, which would jeopardize Mueller’s independence, has fueled rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein spoke of using a microphone to record talks with Trump and the possibility of dismissing the president through the 25th Amendment.
However, Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, among reports that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was in New York on Thursday, was announced.
Trump said he would prefer not to have to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was delayed to avoid a shock to the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accuse him of sexual misconduct, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the Senate vote.
Sarah Sanders, Trump’s press secretary, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he replied: "There is not yet a fixed date, it could be this week or be delayed one more week, given everything that is going on in the Supreme Court.
We’ll see, but you know I like the press to be informed.”
Some journalists have questioned that claim, as Sanders has been running since September 10 without holding a press conference.
When Chris Wallace asked him why,
Sanders said the lack of an informative session was not due to an aversion to reporters' grandiosity, though he added that it would not be her who denies that attitude.
He also suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president grants more interviews than the previous president," he said, although he did not cite any sources that supported the data.
Informative meetings will continue, Sanders said, but insisted that "if the press has the opportunity to ask directly the President of the United States, that's much better than directing the questions to her.
You are witnesses to how we have been doing this over the past few weeks, and that will replace a press roll where you can talk directly to the president of the United States."
Trump often answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Solitary press conferences, however, are scarce.
Perhaps the president demonstrated the motive this week in New York, with a free and sometimes foreign appearance before the journalists gathered.
A letter from the Ministry of Health to calm the mood in the face of Brexit
The Ministry of Health sent a letter to EU workers at Scotland’s NHS expressing the country’s gratitude and expressing its desire to remain in the country after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter less than six months after the UK left the EU.
The Scottish government has pledged to cover the cost of covered status applications for EU citizens working in its decentralized public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on abandonment continued, and decisions are expected to be reached this fall.
However, the UK government, for its part, has also stepped up its preparations for a possible situation of non-agreement.
I know this is a period of infallibility for everyone.
Therefore, I would like to reiterate how much I value the contribution of each member of the staff, regardless of their nationality.
Comrades from the European Union and beyond provide indisputable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here with us.”
Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after a head injury
Christion Abercrombie, linebacker of the Tennessee State Tigers, was undergoing emergency surgery after suffering a head injury during Saturday's (31-27) defeat to the Vanderbilt Commodore, Tennesseean's Mike Organ reported.
Rod Reed, the Tennessee State coach, told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before the break.
He seemed to have fainted when he reached the band.
The trainers and medical staff gave him oxygen on the band line before taking him on a comb for a later evaluation.
A Tennessee State technician informed Chris Harris, a WSMV journalist in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was recovering from surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
He also added that no details of the type or extent of the injury are yet available, and that Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year student in a red shirt, is in his first season with Tennessee State after being transferred from Illinois.
He made five total innings on Saturday before leaving the game, raising his total of the season to 18.
A ringing tax will apply to foreign buyers who purchase a property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher ringing tax when they purchase a property in the UK. This additional money will be used to help homeless people under the new Conservative plans.
This measure will neutralize the success of Corbyn’s campaign to attract young voters
The increase in the ringing tax will apply to those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Treasury expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help homeless people
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher ringing tax when buying a property in the UK. Theresa May will announce that this additional money will be used to help homeless people.
The move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s campaign to attract young voters with promises to promote more accessible housing and focus on high-income people.
The increase in the phone tax will apply to people and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK, and the money raised will serve to support the government’s campaign to reduce the number of people sleeping on the street.
The surcharge, which is added to the current ringing tax, including the highest levels introduced two years ago for second homes and purchases to rent, may be up to 3%.
Fazenda expects the change to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
Approximately 13% of new constructions in London are marketed by non-residents in the UK, which is driving up prices and making it difficult for people who want to buy a home for the first time more difficult to access the real estate market.
Many rich areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become "ghost cities" due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
This new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a tax cut on the transfer of estates to help new people acquire their first home.
She accused the big housemakers of keeping house prices high by buying land and not using it, and urged Mrs May to eliminate tax revenue rates on moderate-priced houses to settle the "shame of the housing sector" that is living in Britain.
Mr. Corbyn announced an attractive series of housing-related reforms, including the control of tenants and the banning of challenges in which the tenant is not to blame.
It also wants to give the municipalities greater powers when it comes to building new homes.
May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my mandate to restoring the British dream: that life should be better for every new generation.
To do this, we need to fix the disastrous housing market.
Britain will always be open to what it wants to live, work and start a life here.
However, it is not fair that it is as simple for those who do not live in the UK as it is for companies based abroad to buy housing as it is for working British residents.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home is too far away, and the indignity I suppose not to have a roof remains too real.”
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is to train Scotland"
Sunderland manager Jack Ross has stated that his "last ambition" is to become Scotland's manager at some point.
This 42-year-old Scot is enjoying the challenge of reviving the Northwestern club, which currently occupies third place in League One, three points away from the head.
He arrived at the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
“When I was a player, my dream was to play for my country.
I played once in selection B, and that's all," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
“I had to see Scotland play in Hampden many times with my father when I was a child, something I always wanted to live again.
But that opportunity will only come if I succeed in running a club.”
Ross's predecessors as Sunderland coach included Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former manager of Alloa Athletic claims that he felt no concern about the success of such consolidated figures in such a large club after previously rejecting proposals from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“Will success for me at this time depend on whether I can return this club to the Premier League?
Because the structure and facilities of the club are undoubtedly the property of a Premier League club,” he said.
“It’s not going to be an easy task to come by, but it’s likely that you will only consider that I was successful here if I can return the club to the Premier.”
Ross only spent three years as a coach after an assistant period at Dumbarton and a 15-month period within the Hearts technical staff.
In that period, he helped Alloa recover from the descent to the third division and managed to get St Mirren to move from peaking down to winning the Championship title the following season.
Ross claims to be more comfortable now than he has ever been in his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"I probably found myself at a real crossroads," he recalled, about taking care of Alloa.
“I really thought training was perfect for me, even more than playing.
It sounds weird because it wasn’t bad for me, I earned a reasonably good life and enjoyed some successes.
Playing can be hard.
There are a lot of things you need to do every week.
I still suffer from stress and work pressure, but I like to train.
I’ve always enjoyed training and now that I’m doing it, I feel more comfortable than ever in my adult life.”

According to a survey, the perfect time to take a pint is at 5:30 p.m. on a Saturday
The summer heat wave increased consumption in British pubs with more difficulty, but put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Pubs and bars experienced a 2.7 percent growth during July, but restaurant consumption dropped 4.8 percent according to the figures.
Peter Martin, member of the CGA trade advisory board, in charge of compiling the figures, said: "The sunny days and England's stay in the football world for longer than expected caused a similar pattern to June's in July, in which the pubs enjoyed a higher consumption rate of 2.8 percent.
The 1.8 percent drop in restaurant turnover during June worsened during July.
Pubs and bars specialized in drinks were the best results obtained with increases in consumption higher than the reductions experienced by restaurants.
Pubs specializing in food also suffered from the sun, though not as dramatically as restaurant operators.
It's like people just want to go out for a drink.
In controlled pubs and bars the consumption of beverages increased by 6.6 percent during the month, and that of meals decreased by three percent.
Paul Newman, an employee of RSM’s leisure and hospitality analysis company, said: “These results suggest a continuation of the trend that has been occurring since late April.
The time and impact of major social and sporting events continue to be the main factors in out-of-home consumption.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to suffer, however, a drop of 4.8 percent a year will be especially painful if this adds to the continuous increase in costs.
The warm and long summer could not have come at a worse time for the catering business and the weather will be in charge of telling if the temperature moderation experienced during August will provide the much-needed breath for the sector."
Total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 percent during July, reflecting the slowdown in brand launches.
The UK pubs, bars and restaurants sales indicator Coffer Peach Tracker Industry collects and analyzes data on the performance of 47 operating groups with a combined profit of more than <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion and is considered the industry benchmark.
One in five children have secret social media accounts that hide from their parents.
One in five children (some just 11 years old) have secret social media accounts that hide from their parents and teachers according to a survey
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in the number of pages of "Fake Insta"
This news has led to an increase in fear that sexual content will be published.
Twenty percent of students said they had a "main" account to show it to their parents
One in five children (some just 11 years old) are creating social media accounts that keep adults a secret.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed an increase in the number of fake Instagram accounts (referring to the social photo sharing network Instagram).
This news has led to an increased fear of sexual content being published.
Twenty percent of students said they used a softened “main” account to show their parents while they had other private ones.
A mother who came across her 13-year-old daughter’s secret account found a teenage girl who asked her to be “violent.”
The research, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of boys and girls between the ages of 11 and 18 had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of HMC, said: “It’s alarming that there are so many teenagers trying to create online spaces where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" on the council of the Scottish Athletics Federation
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the board of the Scottish Athletics Federation as non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the board of directors.
Doyle is the most award-winning Scottish athlete and President Ian Beattie has defined this decision as an excellent opportunity for those who run the sport to benefit from his extensive international experience over the past decade.
"Eilidh enjoys tremendous respect within the Scottish community, the UK and globally, and we are confident that Scottish athletics will greatly benefit from its incorporation into the board," Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I’m looking forward to being a spokesperson for the athletes and I hope to be able to contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won the 200m and 400m at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics between a total of four olympic bears and currently works as a regular commentator for the BBC, suffered a transient ischemic attack that prevented her from walking.
He wrote on Twitter: “I’ve had an apoplexy for a month.
I couldn’t walk.
The doctors said that only time could determine if I could recover and to what degree.
It was exhausting work, but I managed to recover completely, I learned to walk again and I currently do acceleration exercises.
Thank you for your message of encouragement.”
An ad of a breast milk extractor in comparison to women with cows divides public opinion on the networks
A maternal milk extractor company has divided public opinion on the networks with an ad comparing breastfeeding mothers with cows to which they are mugging.
To announce the launch of the proclaimed “world’s first silent portable breast milk extractor,” Elvie has released an ironic music video-style announcement to demonstrate the freedom the new breast milk extractor offers.
Four royal mothers dance in a barn full of ugly for the cows at the rhythm of a song with lyrics such as: "Yes, move me to myself, but I don't have a tail" and "If you don't notice, they're not drunk, they're my breasts."
The chorus goes on, “Mom, mom, I’m feeding the babies, mom, mom, I’m mom, my friends.”
However, the announcement, which was posted on the company’s Facebook page, sparked controversy on the networks.
With 77,000 plays and hundreds of comments, the video provoked different reactions among viewers. Many of them claimed that this manifests the "horror" of the dairy sector.
"Using cows to advertise this product was a very mediocre decision.
“Like us, they need to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but in their case, we steal their children days after giving birth.”
The Elvie milk extractor can be placed discreetly inside a maternal suction cup (Elvie/nai)
Another viewer commented: "Clearly traumatic for the mother and the baby.
But if so, why not use them to advertise a milk extractor for the mothers who are left with their babies?”
Another viewer added the following: "What an announcement with so little tact."
Other spectators defended the ad, even one woman claimed the song seemed "meaning funny".
“I think it’s a great idea.
If I was still breastfeeding, I would buy one.
It made me feel exactly like a cow.
The ad is a bit crazy, but I think it’s a joke.
“It’s a great product,” one wrote.
Another commented, “This is a fun ad aimed at mothers who extract their milk (often in their workplaces or in their bathrooms) and feel like “cows.”
This is not an announcement to praise or judge the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, this group of women reveals that they were dancing with the discreet extractors inserted into their fans.
The concept behind the campaign is that many women who extract their milk claim to feel like cows.
However, the Elvie milk extractor is completely silent, has no cables or tubes and can discreetly fit into a maternal suction cup, which gives women the freedom to move around, sue their babies and even walk out while they are extracting their milk.
Ana Balarin, partner and executive creative director of Mother, commented: “The Elvie extractor is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
In describing the parallel between women and dairy cows, we wanted to focus on milk extraction and all the challenges it involves while demonstrating in an entertaining and close way the incredible sense of freedom that the new extractor will offer.
This is not the first time Elvie has taken over the headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two animals paraded in the hallway for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a camp on the Texas border
The number of migrant children detained increased despite the fact that the monthly number of border crossings remained relatively unchanged, in part due to stringent rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration making it difficult to assign paternal grandparents to the children.
Traditionally, most of the pagans were also immigrants without papers and were afraid of endangering their ability to stay in the country by taking a step forward to claim a child.
This risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential pawns and other adult members of their households would have to send their fingerprints and that such data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement official, testified before Congress that the agency arrested dozens of people who requested to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
Later, the agency confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no criminal record.
“About 80 percent of people who are paternal or part of their home are in the country illegally, and a large proportion of these are foreigners who have committed crimes.
That is why we will continue to pursue these individuals,” Mr. Albence said.
In order to process the children more quickly, officials introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court before a month has elapsed since their detention instead of 60 days, which was the previous rule, according to refugee workers.
Many will appear through videoconferencing rather than in person to try to legalize their case before an immigration judge.
Those who do not meet the requirements for assistance will be quickly deported.
The longer they remain in custody, the more likely they will be to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent kidnappings or attempts to escape, according to refugee workers and system reports published in recent months.
Lawyers claimed that these fears increase in larger centers such as Tornillo, in which there is a greater chance that symptoms that a child is having a bad time go unnoticed due to their size.
They also added that moving children to the camping area without giving them enough time to prepare them from an emotional point of view or to say goodbye to friends could be a trauma that many continue to suffer.
Syria calls on U.S., France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem, addressing the UN General Assembly, also called on Syrian refugees to return home, despite the country's current war in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also holds the position of Deputy Prime Minister, stated that foreign forces found themselves on Syrian soil illegally, on the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that they would "take care of them in a timely manner."
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the “war on terrorism is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions of them have had to flee their homes.
He also said Damascus would continue to “fight this sacred battle until we clear all Syrian territories” of terrorist groups and “of all illegal foreign presence.”
The United States has approximately 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly to train and advise Kurdish forces and Arab Syrians who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in this war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem stated that the conditions for their return were adequate and blamed "some Western countries" for the "dissemination of irrational fears" that caused the refugees not to return.
“We are turning to the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns,” he said.
“They are politicizing what should be a mere humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not offer reconstruction aid to Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats say the recent agreement reached between Russia and Turkey to establish a neutral zone in the last major rebel stronghold of Idlib has allowed political talks to continue.
The deal between Russia and Turkey prevented a large-scale assault by Russian-backed Syrian troops in the province, in which three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had “clear deadlines” and expressed his hope that military actions would target the jihadists, including soldiers from the Al-Nusra front linked to Al-Qaeda, who “will be eradicated.”
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the government and the opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and to facilitate the holding of elections.
Moualem set out the conditions to ensure the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the body's work should be limited to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution" and warned of possible interference.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Mandate
Following that logic, Mr. Trump would get re-election in 2020 unless, as many liberals are waiting, impeachment and scandals put an end to his presidency prematurely.
It would be “the most dramatic end of a presidency.”
At the moment, there are no signs of fatigue among the observers.
Since 2014, prime-time audiences have more than doubled, reaching 1.05 million viewers on CNN, and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers on prime-time schedule, an increase of 1.7 million from four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has led the cable channel's audience index with 3.5 million viewers on the night.
“It’s like a fire that attracts people because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Baer, showrunner of the drama for ABC’s Designated Survivor, which is about a secretary of the cabinet who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club," has ten other theories.
Remember a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told him he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? he asked.
“He said, ‘Because it makes me laugh,’” said Mrs. Scovell.
There is entertainment in the chaos.
Of course, unlike everything else on television, Washington’s plots can determine the future of the Roe v. Wade case, whether immigrant families can reunite and the state of the world economy.
Disconnecting from reality is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Still, I suppose something that goes beyond being an informed citizen spending six hours seeing a panel of experts debating Bob Woodward's use of "anonymous" sources for his book "Fear," the bomber jacket described as Paul Manafort's 15,000-dollar ostrich coat.
I won’t look at Super Mario again the same way.
"Part of what it does to make a reality show look like is that it's giving you something new every night," said Brent Montgomery, senior executive at Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", a space that deals with the changes in Trump's characters and the daily twists of the show.
You can't afford to miss an episode or you'll be left behind.
When I got in touch with Mr. Fleiss this week, I was sunbathing and a 26-degree temperature off the north coast of Kauai, but I was locked in the house watching MSNBC while I was recording on CNN.
He was unable to disengage while Brett Kavanaugh was about to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hanging from a thread.
“I remember when we were doing all those crazy programs at the time and people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Fleiss said.
“I thought it was a kind of joke, but it turns out they were right.”

The foreign money reaches the banks to fund the candidacy to the House for the election of the half of the legislature
It is not surprising that the 17th congressional district of Pennsylvania is receiving a large flow of money due to the reorganization of a congressional district with two acting representatives in the race to occupy the same position.
This district located on the outskirts of Pittsburgh that was recently reorganized is represented by Democratic candidate Conor Lamb, who won his place in another district in a special election held last spring.
Lamb is presented against another acting representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is largely overlapped with the new 17th district.
The maps were reorganized after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that Republicans would manipulate the electoral constituency of the old districts in their favor.
The electoral career in the new 17th congressional district unleashed a campaign funding festival between the main financial arms of the parties, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after achieving an adjusted victory in the March special election for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district, which enjoyed a wide following.
That position was occupied by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Politicians give the Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States assessed the possibility of penalizing the Savior for his support of China and then pushed back.
The diplomats warned that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little response from Washington.
Mr. Trump held a pleasant meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and even owned a hotel in Panama until his partners pitched the Trump Organization’s management team.
State Department officials have decided to order the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama to return "for the recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan," department spokesperson Heather Nauert said in a statement this month.
However, only the possibility of sanctions against El Salvador, which received approximately $140 million in U.S. aid during 2017, including to control drug trafficking, development and economic aid, has been challenged.
The proposed sanctions, including cuts in financial aid and visa restrictions, would be very negative for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, U.S. and Central American officials postponed the holding of a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to hold a similar meeting last year, which was considered a step forward in efforts to avoid emigration of people to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to move forward, effectively ending any possibility of sanctions for O Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is scheduled to lead the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, in a symptom of the importance it attaches to the administration, the diplomats said.
The three American envoys discreetly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new messages or harsh punishment from Washington.
A White House spokesperson for Mr Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate, which were described by three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to talk about internal deliberations whenever and when the participants remained anonymous.
His accounts were corroborated by an external analyst close to the administration and who also agreed to speak whenever his anonymity was kept.
Studying History
The next negative case could be Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report on the possible obstruction of Mr. Trump's justice, of which there is currently ample evidence in the public archives.
Mr. Mueller is also directing his investigation to find out if Mr. Trump’s campaign conspired with Russia in his attack on our elections.
If Congress changes hands, Mr. Trump will have to be held accountable in that body, just when he has to prepare for the election, and he may finally have to face a popular jury.
They are many unknowns and I don’t want to suggest that Mr. Trump’s fall is inevitable, just like that of his European counterparts.
We all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the duration of the battle.
In 1938, German officers were determined to give a coup d'état against Hitler if the Western Front resisted and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We have failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of massacres that took place afterwards.
The course of history revolves around these turning points, and the inexorable advance of democracy is accelerating or backward.
The U.S. is facing several of these turning points at this time.
What are we going to do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been carrying water to his neck since the newspaper reported that, last year, he suggested secretly recording the president and speculated that he was incapacitated for the position.
Mr. Rosenstein stated that the Times' information is not true.
“How are we going to respond if the F.B.I. investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or unbiased, or if his appointment to the Supreme Court is confirmed despite the criminal allegations of sexual abuse and false witnesses?
And, above all, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that demands responsibilities from Mr. Trump?
If we do not pass these tests, democracy will be subjected to a long winter.
But I think we will not fail, thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that also occupied my house, which was the head of the embassy.
He survived, emigrated to the United States, and, 60 years later, sent me to put Shabbat candy on that table that included a swastika.
With that legacy, how can I not be optimistic about the future?”

Rangers player Graham Dorrans is optimistic about the match against Rapid Vienna
The Rangers receive Rapid Vienna on Thursday knowing that a win against the Austrians, after the impressive draw achieved in Spain against Villarreal this same month, would put them in a very favorable position to qualify in the Europa League group G.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his debut in a 2–2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use that result as a springboard to achieve more important things.
"It was a good point for us, as Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old.
“We entered the game believing we could achieve something positive and we reached a point.
We had a chance to win in the final, but in general, the tie is probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half, but in the second half we were better.
Next Thursday will be another great European night.
We hope to reach all three points, but it will be difficult, because they achieved a good result in their last match, but with the support of our audience, I am sure we will be able to fight to achieve a positive result.
“Last year was hard between everything that happened with my injuries and the changes that were made to the team, but there is an excellent environment at the moment.
The team is good, the boys are having a good time and the training is good.
We hope to be able to fight, forget last season and succeed.”
Women need to pay attention to their retirement savings.
Despite the fact that the survey participants were clear about how they wanted them to be looked after, few people spoke to their family about the matter.
Approximately half of the participants in this study conducted by Nationwide said they commented with their peers on the cost of extended care.
Only 10 percent said they would talk to their children about it.
“People want her to be looked after by a family member, but they’re not taking the necessary steps to have that conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of the nationwide life insurance department.
You can start with the following.
Talk to your partner and children: You can’t prepare your family to take care of you if you don’t communicate your wishes to them well in advance.
Collaborate with your counselor and your family to agree on where and how to receive care, as these decisions can be a determining factor in determining the cost.
Call your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
Among the long-term care financing options are a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a cash-value hybrid life insurance policy to help cover these expenses, or self-insurance covered with your own funds, whenever you have the money.
Negotiate your legal documents: Avoid legal battles.
Get a health care representative to designate a trusted person to oversee your health care and make sure that the professionals meet your wishes in case you are not able to communicate.
It also assesses the possibility of signing a notary power to manage your finances.
You will need to choose a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and make sure that your bills are paid if you are disabled.
Don’t forget the little details: Imagine that your older parent has a medical emergency and goes to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about your medications and allergies?
Write down this information in detail in a written plan to be prepared.

A man receives several shots with a compressed air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man received multiple shots with a compressed air rifle as he walked back home after leaving at night.
The 40-year-old victim was found in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
The agents described the shooting, which occurred at approximately 02:30 (British Summer Time) as a "random act".
The victim did not see the attacker.
His injuries are not serious and the police are looking for possible witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
A powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to official sources, caused the deaths of at least 384 people, a figure that is expected to continue to rise.
Due to the cut off of communications, the rescue corps were unable to obtain any information from the Donggala Regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-degree magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Below we provide you with some key data about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Célebes:
Palu is the capital of the province of Célebes Central, which is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Célebes, with an approximate population of 379,800 people in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a relic that is found along more than 300 km of coastline northwest of the island of Célebes.
This regency, an administrative region lower than a province, had an approximate population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main pillars of the economy of the province of Célebes Central, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but are concentrated mainly in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Celebs.
Palu and Donggala have been affected by tsunamis several times over the past 100 years, according to Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck the western part of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific Belt of Fire with high seismic activity, so it suffers earthquakes regularly.
These are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis that have suffered in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra, on 26 December, caused a tsunami that affected 14 countries, killing 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them, in Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-degree earthquake struck the southern island of Xava, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that devastated the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-degree earthquake occurred near the city of Padang, the capital of the Western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-degree earthquake hit the Mentawai Islands, located in front of Sumatra, causing a 10-metre tsunami that destroyed dozens of people and killed about 300 people.
2016: A mild earthquake affected the residence of Pidie Jaya, located in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, as people recalled the devastation caused by the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
No tsunami occurred on this occasion, but more than 100 people died as a result of the collapse of buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes occurred on the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, which killed more than 500 people, most of them in the northern part of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, a 29-year-old from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of a domestic violence crime, preventing a complaint from being filed for domestic violence and resistance to authority, according to a statement released by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a friend tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, the police removed her phone.
Palin remains in pre-trial detention at the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility with a $500 bail, KTUU reported.
He was brought before the court on Saturday, in which he declared himself "not guilty, ever since" when he was asked, the prison reported.
Palin faces three minor type A offences, meaning he could go to jail for up to a year and receive a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with a minor type B offense, punishable by a day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time a criminal case has been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently in court for Alaskan war veterans.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic assault, of preventing a complaint from being filed for domestic violence and for possession of weapons in a drunken state in connection with the incident.
His wife accused him of punching him in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans groups in 2016 after linking her son’s violent behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder that suffers from serving with the army in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia cause hundreds of deaths
There are at least 384 deaths after the earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday.
The magnitude 7.5 earthquake caused a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are not available, and the death toll is expected to increase over the course of days.
The quake occurred just opposite Celebes Central, in the northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
They circulate videos on social networks showing the timing of the impact.
Hundreds of people gathered at a festival on the beach of the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors seek to enforce a rarely-imposed death penalty for suspected terrorist attack in New York
New York’s federal prosecutors are trying to impose the death penalty on Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York terrorist attack that resulted in the deaths of eight people, a punishment that has not been applied in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out an attack on a bike lane on Lower Manhattan’s West Side Highway, following the lives of pedestrians and cyclists he found on his way in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and caused them serious injuries "intentionally", according to the notification of the intent to apply for the death penalty filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both offences involve the possibility of applying the death penalty according to the judge's document.
Weeks after the attack occurred, a federal juror charged Saipov with 22 crimes, including eight murder crimes in collaboration with an organized crime group, a practice commonly used by prosecutors in organized crime cases, and a crime of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "notable planning and premeditation," prosecutors said in describing the way Saipov carried out the "atrocious, cruel and depraved" attack.
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injuries, damages and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnocco" as indicated in the notification
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
The Southern District of New York has not prosecuted a death penalty case for a decade.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug traffickers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was applied in a New York federal case was in 1953, in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a marriage that was executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, showed a lack of remorse during the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators he felt good about what he did, police said.
Saipov told authorities that in order to carry out the attack, he was inspired by the videos of ISIS that he viewed on his phone according to the accusation.
He also asked to be able to see the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He was found not guilty of 22 offences.
David Patton, one of the federal attorneys in charge of representing Saipov, said they were "obviously disappointed" with the indictment's decision.
“We believe that the decision to request the death penalty instead of accepting a life-chain guilt statement without the possibility of revocation will only prolong the trauma caused by these events for all the people involved,” Patton said.
Saipov’s defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
A Tory MP says Nigel Farage should be put in front of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize an army of people" today during a protest at the Tory conference.
The former leader of the UK Independence Party claimed that politicians had to "feel the pressure" of Eurosceptics (when one of Theresa May's own parliamentarians suggested that he should take charge of negotiations with the EU.
MEP Peter Bone told the Birmingham rally that the UK would have “already left” the EU if Mr Farage was Brexit secretary.
But the challenge facing Mrs May to reconcile the divided lines of her party came to light when she joined the Tories in favour of staying in the EU in an independent protest against Brexit held in the city.
The prime minister is struggling to keep the commitments of her Chequers plan between the attacks of Brexit supporters, opponents and the EU.
His allies insisted that he would continue to fight to try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the negative response, to force Eurosceptics and workers to choose between his plan and chaos.
Mr. Bone stated in the concentration of Solihull's Leave Means Leave movement that he wanted to end Chequers' plan.
He suggested that he should have consulted Mr Farage to take responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he had been in charge, we would be out of the EU at this time,” he said.
Wellingborough MP added: “I will continue to defend Brexit, but we must abort Chequers’ plan.”
To his opposition to the EU, he said: “We do not fight world wars to be servants.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Mr Bone denied the suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British people have changed their mind and want to stay in the EU is completely false.”
Andrea Jenkyns, a member of the Tories and a supporter of Brexit, said: “The only thing I’m saying is, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chequers’ plan is not popular among the public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular between our party and our activists who, to begin with, are the ones who occupy the streets and allow us to be elected.
Cancel the Chequers plan and start listening.”
In a message addressed to Mrs May, she added: "Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Mr Farage said in the concentration that it is necessary to make politicians “feel uncomfortable” if they intend to betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
“This is a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” he said.
“They are trying to betray the Brexit decision and here we are gathered today to tell them that we will not let them go with theirs.”
In a message addressed to an enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make our political class, which is about to betray the Brexit decision, feel uncomfortable.
“We are mobilizing the army of people in this country that has given us victory in Brexit and that will not rest until we become a proud, independent and autonomous United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, supporters of staying in the EU made a march through Birmingham before holding a two-hour concentration in the city centre.
Some activists waved banners with the Tories Against Brexit message after the group’s launch this weekend.
Labour leader Lord Adonis was ridiculed by the Conservatives for the security problems they suffered in an application of the party at the beginning of the conference.
“This is the people who tell us that they can have the IT systems in order and all the best technology for Canada, to have a border without friction, to enjoy a free market without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“It’s an absolute farce.
The concept of a good Brexit does not exist,” he added.
Warren plans to seriously think or run for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren has said she will seriously consider her candidacy for the presidency after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future on Saturday during a municipal session in a town in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, will run for re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was co-chair of Trump’s 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
She has been the focus of speculation that places her as Trump’s successor in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with his constituents using the format of the council since Trump took office.
An assistant asked if he was planning to run for president.
Warren responded that it is time for “women to go to Washington to fix the problems of our government, and for that a woman in the presidency fails.”
An arrest was made in connection with the shooting of Sims, the LSU player.
Baton Rouge Police, The Angels, announced on Saturday that a suspect was arrested for the murder of Wayde Sims, the LSU basketball player on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at a press conference held at 11 a.m.
They posted a video of the shooting on Friday asking for help identifying a man who was in the pictures.
Sims, 20, was shot dead near the Southern University campus early Friday.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and finally died as a result of this," Murphy J. Paul, the chief of police, told the media on Saturday through 247sports.
Wayde intervened to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being present on the scene with a gun and admitted to shooting the Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and placed in custody in the East Baton Rouge Parish police department.
Sims, a 2-metre youth who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games with 10 titles last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title thanks to team orders, which allowed him to achieve victory over Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes’ team orders would be decisive in the race.
Bottas, who left from pole, had a good exit and almost left Hamilton only while defending his position during the first two laps and inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel entered boxing first and let Hamilton run with traffic in the back of the group, which would prove decisive.
Mercedes stopped in boxing a lap later and left behind Vettel, but Hamilton advanced him after several wheel-to-wheel maneuvers that caused the Ferrari driver to be left free of bad taste inside at the risk of falling behind after a double defensive maneuver in the third corner.
Max Verstappen left from the last row of the exit grid and went back to seventh place at the end of the first lap on the day of his 21st birthday.
He then led the race for much of this thanks to which he kept his tyres to be able to go faster in the final and advance Kimi Raikkonen to fourth place.
He finally entered boxing in lap 44 but was unable to advance any position in the last eight lap, which ended with Raikkonen in fourth place.
It was a difficult day, because Valtteri did an excellent job throughout the weekend and was a real gentleman.
“The team did an extraordinary job to get the first two places,” Hamilton said.
An Inappropriate Body Language
President Donald Trump made a mockery of Senator Dianne Feinstein on Saturday for her insistence that she would not leak Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
In a speech at an event in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly of Ford's testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee and commented instead that what was happening in the Senate proved that people were "miserable, disgusting and lying."
“The only thing that could happen and the most beautiful thing that is happening in the last few days in the Senate, when you see the outrage, when you see the people who are angry and who are miserable, disgusting and lying,” he said.
“When you see these posts and filters and they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t.
I didn’t go.”
Remembrance?
Dianne Feinstein, did you do any filtration?
Remember your answer... did you filter the document?: "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't go.
Wait a minute.
“No,” he added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein was sent a letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh made by Ford in July and leaked in early September, but Feinstein denied the leak came from his office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s accusations, I didn’t filter his story,” Feinstein told the committee.
“I asked him to remain confidential and do what he asked me to do.”
But his denial did not seem to sit well to the president, who commented during Saturday night's act: "I tell you that body language was not the right one.
He may not have filtered it, but he used the worst body language I’ve ever seen in my life.”
Continuing with his defense of the candidate for the Supreme Court, who was accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats were using the accusations for their own purposes.
They are determined to regain power by any means necessary.
They are evil and repugnant, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to fight to regain power and control,” he said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars repaired Friday's Elite League defeat against the Belfast Giants by winning the game back 5-3 at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants scored an early lead by two goals, Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied for the local set before Dwyer re-established the Giants' lead.
Francois Bouchard tied for Dundee before two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen allowed them to win.
It was Adam Keefe's third Elite League defeat of the season, who managed to make it back to win Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth match of the season between the two teams, with a balance of the previous three victories for the Giants.
Dwyer's initial goal came in the 3:35 minute thanks to an assist from Kendall McFaull, and the second came four minutes later by Beauvillier after David Rutherford's assist.
In a hectic start period, Sullivan rejoined the local team in the match at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt assisted Cownie to score the tie goal at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants advance to the scoreboard before the first break when he scored his second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The local team regrouped and Bouchard again scored a power play goal in the 27:37 minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen advance to Dundee for the first time in the game at the end of the second period and secured the victory by their team's fifth goal in the last half of the period.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will play their next game at home in Milton Keynes, which will be held on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies to make sure hundreds of passengers on a plane can escape an earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller considered a hero after dying to ensure that a plane loaded with hundreds of passengers could safely take off.
The death toll is 800 and many are missing after a major earthquake shook Sulawesi Island on Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong replicas continue to be felt in the area and many people are trapped under the rocks of the city of Palu.
Although his co-workers fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his position in the control tower of Palu's Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport that was violently balancing.
He remained in his position to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could safely take off.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he thought it was going to crash.
He later died in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision could allow hundreds of lives to be saved, Australia’s ABC News reported.
We have prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
“Breathe our hearts when we learn,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could be thousands and the country's disaster management agency said access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The death toll is believed to continue to rise because there are many bodies under the rocks and many of them have not been reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the agency's spokesman.
Waves of up to six meters devastated Palu, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are carrying aid and foodstuffs.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute an ambulance is bringing in bodies.
Drinking water is scarce.
People are looting the mini-markets.”
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is struggling to help the survivors, but we don’t know what they will find there.
It’s a tragedy, but it could get a lot worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?" he told CNN.
Indonesia suffered earthquakes in Lombok earlier this year in which more than 550 people died.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini now claims there is one missing after plane crash in a lagoon
The airline that operates a flight that crashed in a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now says there is one missing after previously claiming that the 47 passengers and crew would leave the plane that was sinking without incident.
Air Niugini said in a statement that they had not been able to locate a passenger since Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working together with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to locate this man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more detailed information about the passenger, such as their age or nationality.
Boats from the area helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while attempting to land at the Chuuk Island airport.
Authorities said on Friday that seven people had to be taken to a hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday and that all were stable.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy confirmed that the aircraft landed in the lagoon before reaching the runway.
Some witnesses claim that the plane passed long distances on the runway.
Bill Jaynes, a passenger of American nationality, commented that he entered with very little height.
"That's something extremely positive," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that both he and other passengers were able to advance between the water reaching their waists to the emergency exits of the plane that was sinking.
He also recalled that the flight attendants were screaming and frightened, and that he suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy indicated that seafarers who were working near the site to improve a pier also assisted in the rescue using an inflatable boat to transport people to the coast before the plane sank about 30 meters.
According to the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in airline accidents in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, but none have affected Air Niugini.
Analyst composes the chronology of the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecutor's office referred to the evidence on Saturday in a retrial of a man accused of burning a woman alive from Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
During the trial he described to the jury how he used the records of a cell phone to recompose the movements of 29-year-old Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old Jessica Chambers on the night of his death.
Rowlett said he received location data from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers the night of his death contradicting his earlier claims, according to The Clarion Ledger newspaper.
When these data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford rose to the ranks on Saturday and testified that he was not in the city that day.
When the D.A. asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "lying, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another contradiction was that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers for about two weeks when he died.
The cell phone records indicated that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett stated that sometime after Chambers' death, Tellis removed Chambers' messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
“It’s a mess of your life,” Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its final claims on Sunday.
The judge said he hoped the trial would be judged by the jury on the same day.
The High Breed: What is Hip Hop Consciousness?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative perception that the genre has by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, a group from Bristol, claims that hip hop has moved away from its origins with political messages and the fight against social problems.
They want to go back to their roots and get hip hop fighting back to being popular.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common recently experienced a revival in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black man?!
A New York City babysitter asks for a couple after a "racist" message
A New York babysitter will sue a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a message that was not addressed to her from the mother complaining that she was "another black."
The couple denies being racist and compares the demand with "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, showed her distress when she discovered that babysitter Giselle Maurice was black when she introduced herself to her first day of work in 2016.
“NOOOOOOOOOOOOON, OTHER BLACK,” Ms. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Maurice twice.
After realizing her mistake, an "inconvenient" Plasco-Flaxman fired Mrs. Maurice, claiming that the caregiver who had just left, who was an African-American, had done her job badly and was expecting a Filipino according to the New York Post announcement.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for her work day and sent home in an Uber.
Maurice will now sue the couple for compensation for the dismissal and demands a compensation of $350 a day for six months of internal work for those who were initially hired even though there was no middle contract.
“Look, I want to show you that those things don’t happen,” he told the Post on Friday, adding later, “It’s a case of discrimination.”
The couple responded to the accusations of racism by stating that dismissing Maurice was the most reasonable, as they were afraid they would not be able to trust her after insulting her.
“My wife sent him a message that I didn’t intend to send him.
It's not racist.
We are not racists,” husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
"But would they leave their children in the hands of someone they offended, even if it was because of a mistake?
Is your baby just born?
Come on!"
After comparing the demand with an "extortion", Plasco stated that his wife had just had a baby by two months and that she was in a "very difficult situation".
“Are you going for someone like that?
That’s not very ethical,” added the investment banker.
As the legal process continues, the court of public opinion quickly denounced the couple on social media, attacking them for their behavior and the logic applied.
Paddington's editors feared that readers would not identify with a talking bear, according to a new letter.
Karen Jankel, Bond's daughter, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, commented on the letter: "It's hard to put on the skin of a person who reads it for the first time before it's published.
It’s fun to know now what we know about Paddington’s huge success.”
After claiming that his father, who worked as a camera for the BBC before inspiring himself to write the children's book about a small toy bear, would be optimistic about the possibility that his work would be rejected, he added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was "agritious" after his death last year.
De Paddington, to whom he describes as a "very important member of our family", added that his father was discreetly proud of the success he finally achieved.
"He was a quiet man and nothing presumptuous," he said.
“But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost as if you had a son who gets something: you’re proud even if you didn’t really do it to yourself.
I think I felt Paddington's success a bit that way.
Although it was a creation of his and the product of his imagination, he always gave all the merit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye over the phone.
After the landing, her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors worked unsuccessfully to save her life.
“Nad called regularly to say that he was very bad, that he wasn’t expected to survive.
“Then I got a call from Nad to tell me he was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And they did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much, my love.
We'll meet with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications that doctors gave her to keep her heart beating were slowly consuming and leaving her body.
He had died before, and now he was gone.
I just had to sit and wait, knowing it was happening.
I couldn’t scream or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by families and people.
I had to hold on.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, at that moment of struggle for the loss of her daughter, entered the plane along with the other passengers, without noticing the cauldron she was suffering.
"Nobody detected it," he said.
“I had my head down and I had tears all the time.
It’s hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt this impressive sense of solidarity for Nad.
I needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much I loved her.”
Postage stamps of distressed women to avoid suicides on a bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones due to suicide are working to prevent others from doing the same.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys put cards on a Welsh bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers they can call for help.
Tyler, the son of Mrs. Davis, was 13 when he began suffering from depression, and committed suicide at 18.
“I don’t want any parents to feel like I have to feel myself every day,” he said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising cook with a contagious smile.
“Everybody knew him by his smile.
It was always said that his smile would light up any room.
However, he left the job before he died and was "a very deep depression".
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, was the one who found his brother after he committed suicide.
Mrs. Davis commented: "I am continually concerned that a side effect will occur."
Mrs. Davis created the cards "to inform people that there are people you can go to and talk to, even if you're a friend.
Don’t be silent, you need to talk.”
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been a friend of Mrs. Davies for years, has lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, shortly after her mother's death.
“He didn’t tell me I was sad or depressed or anything like that,” he said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
The day of Christmas has touched deep (when the children opened their gifts, he did not make eye contact with them or anything)."
He claimed that his death caused a huge trauma to them, but they must overcome it: “He torn the family apart.
Defect us.
But we have to move forward and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs on a wire as the FBI launches investigation
"I thought that if we could get something like what I was asking for (a limited time and limited scope investigation), it is possible that we could get a little bit of unity," Mr Flake said Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would be "deleting" due to the paralysis of the parties.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to conduct the investigation?
His reluctance is due to a question of deadlines.
There are five weeks left for the mid-term elections (November 6th). If, as expected, Republicans get bad results, they will be severely weakened in their attempts to get the man they want elected to the country’s highest court.
George W. Bush was calling senators, putting pressure on them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush, thanks to whom he met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush’s personal secretary.
What will happen when the FBI executes your report?
A vote will take place in the Senate, which currently holds 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can achieve at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the tie and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
The number of deserters in North Korea drops under Kim’s mandate
The number of North Korean deserters targeting South Korea has been reduced since Kim Jong Un's accession to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from South Korea's unification ministry, said 1,127 desertions had occurred last year, away from 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said the tightening of border controls between North Korea and China and the increase in tariffs charged by people charged to move people across the border were key factors.
Pyongyang did not make any public comments.
The vast majority of deserters in the North are finally granted South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
The majority of them flow through China, which has the largest border truce with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone between the two Koreas.
China considers deserters as illegal immigrants instead of refugees and often repatriates them.
Relations between the north and the south (which technically continue to be at war) have improved significantly in recent months.
That same month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to hold talks focused on the negotiations on the elimination of nuclear weapons that were parked.
This came after the historic June meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un held in Singapore, where they largely agreed to work to eliminate nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the sanctions imposed by the United States for the lack of progress since then.
“If we don’t have confidence in the United States, we can’t trust our national security and, under these circumstances, there is no possibility that we will unilaterally disarm first,” Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he's not fit to go to the Supreme Court
House minority leader Nancy Pelosi called the candidate for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was not fit by nature to access the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help thinking that if a woman ever behaved in this way, she would be called hysterical," Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's statement before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied the allegations of sexual abuse against Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
During the initial statement, Kavanaugh was very excited, at times almost yelling and speaking while describing his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly denounced the committee's Democrats, cataloguing the accusations against him as a "gross and coordinated murder of the reputation" organized by liberals angry at Hillary Clinton's defeat in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi stated that he believed Kavanaugh's statement proved he could not access the Supreme Court because it proved he had prejudices against the Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with those statements and the way he attacked Clinton and the Democrats," he said.
Pelosi objected when asked if he would try to challenge Kavanaugh if he is confirmed in the post and if the Democrats get a majority in the House of Representatives.
"What I have to say is this: if he is not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he is not fit to be not only in the Supreme Court, but in the court he is currently in," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the Washington D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she was concerned about possible resolutions that Kavanaugh could adopt against the law on patient protection and accessible health care or the Roe v. Wade case, as he is considered a conservative judge.
In confirmation, Kavanaugh evaded questions about whether certain decisions of the Supreme Court would be annulled.
“This is not the time for a hysterical and prejudiced person to come to court and still above wait for us to say, look at that!” Pelosi said.
And women need to exercise it.
It is a justifiable diatribe, months and years of raging anger, and it cannot be expelled without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's that rare, do I?"
She went on to say, “I got a lot of help from a woman who was executive somewhere, who said she was also crying when she was angry, but she developed a technique that, when she was angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to, ‘You’re better off.
But I'm angry."
And then I continued.
It seemed brilliant.”
Tears are allowed as an escape valve for anger in part because they are essentially not understood.
One of my sharpest memories in one of my first works in a men-dominated office, where I began to cry with an indescribable rage, was that a bigger woman grabbed me from the back of the neck, a distant superior who always caused me a slight fear, and led me to the hollow of the escalator.
“Never let them see you cry,” he said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They believe that you are sad and that they will comfort you if they obey you.”
Patricia Schroeder, a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado at the time, worked with Gary Hart on her presidential nominations.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was stranded on an off-wedding adventure on a boat called Monkey Business and was withdrawn from the presidential race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, thought there was no reason why the idea of running for president could not be considered.
"It wasn't a well-thought-out decision," he said with a laugh 30 years later.
“There were seven candidates in the race and the last one they needed was another.
Some called it "Brancaneves and the Seven Dwarfs".
Because the campaign was advanced, it was delayed in fundraising, so he vowed not to enter the race for the presidency unless he could raise $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She found that some of those who supported her donated $1,000 to male candidates would only give her $250.
“What do you think, do I have a discount?” he asked.
When she made her speech to announce that she would not present a formal campaign, she was overcome by emotions (from gratitude to the people who supported her, from frustration with the system that made it difficult to raise money and address voters rather than delegates, and anger over existing sexism) that left her speechless.
"You'd think I'd suffer a nervous breakdown," Mrs. Schroeder recalled how the press reacted with her.
“You would think Kleenex was my sponsoring company.
I remember thinking, what did you write in my tombstone?
"Chorou?"
How the U.S.-China trade war against Beijing could turn out to be positive
The initial bombings of the trade war between the United States and China were chilling and, although the war is far from over, a distance between the countries could be beneficial for Beijing in the long run, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued the first warning earlier this year by recording key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation this week came with the application of new tariffs affecting an equivalent of $20 billion, charging half of the items coming to the United States from China.
Beijing has repeatedly counter-attacked the most recent, raising tariffs from five to ten percent to $60 billion in American products.
China has promised to mimic U.S. measures and it seems unlikely that the world’s second-largest economy will change in the short term.
To get Washington to retreat, it would be necessary to yield to its demands, but to bow publicly to the United States would be much more shameful for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Still, experts say that if Beijing knows how to play its cards correctly, the pressures of the trade war with the United States could favor China in the long run by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the necessary conditions to start an economic crisis in both countries is actually far more dangerous than was previously recognized,” said Abigail Grace, an Asia-centric researcher at the Center for New American Security, a research center.
Syria is 'ready' for refugees to return, says foreign minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is asking for help to rebuild the country devastated by a more than seven-year war.
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem stated that the country's conditions are improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is much more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normalcy.
All the necessary conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that had to leave due to terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and their livelihoods are now in place.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Another six million people continue to live in the country and need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would appreciate the help it can receive to rebuild a country that is devastated.
But he said he would not accept conditional aid from countries that supported the uprising.
Europe wins Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the American team by a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at the Le Golf National club located outside of Paris, France.
It is the sixth consecutive defeat of the United States in European territory and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn reached the 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who was the most batted during the tournament, sent the ball to the water in hole 16 of par 3, losing his game against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer shined in all his series, becoming one of the only four players to achieve a 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament was implemented in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was defeated 5&4 by the worst-placed player of the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen, of Denmark.
The world's first-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2&1 to Englishman Ian Poulter, who is likely to play his last Ryder Cup.
A veteran with eight Ryder Cups played, the Spanish Sergio Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a became the European player with the most wins of the tournament, with 25.5 points.
“I don’t cry often, but today I can’t help it.
It's been a tough year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to be able to get the cup back.
The important thing is the team, and I’m glad I was able to help,” Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a said after the European victory.
He gave testimony to his compatriot John Ram, who managed to defeat American golf legend Tiger Woods by 2&1 in Sunday's singles game.
"It's amazing how proud I am today to have defeated Tiger Woods. I grew up watching that boy play," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost his four games in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
This is a strange statistic for one of the best players of all time, winning 14 majors, located just behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled throughout the weekend not to leave the streets, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-calibre golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk said after his team's frustrating performance: "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning for a while they put the Europeans in trouble.
We're fighting.
I took off my hat to Thomas.
He is an excellent captain.
The 12 players played very well.
We will reorganize, work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and move forward.
I love these 12 boys and I'm proud to be captain.
