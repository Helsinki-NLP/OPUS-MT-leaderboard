28-year-old chef found dead in San Francisco shopping mall
The 28-year-old chef, who recently moved to San Francisco, was found dead in a staircase at a local mall this week.
However, the victim’s brother says he can’t imagine someone who would want to hurt him, noting: “Finally, things went well for him.”
"The body, found in Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning, was identified as 28-year-old San Francisco resident Frank Galicia," the San Francisco Forensic Experts Bureau said in a statement.
The San Francisco Police Department reports that the death was classified as murder and the investigation is ongoing.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told ABC's KGO channel in San Francisco that Frank, the past chef of Boston's distribution line, got his dream job as a chef at San Francisco's Sons & Daughters restaurant six months ago.
A spokesperson for Sons & Daughters said they were “shocked and depressed” by his death.
"We are a small team that works as a friendly family and will be very much lacking," the representative said.
Our thoughts and condolences to Frank’s family and friends during this difficult time.
Luis Gal<0xC3><0xAD>cia said that Frank had stayed at the hostels at first, but lately, “Finally, things are going well for him.”
“He found an apartment, he met a girl,” Luis Galisia told KGO.
Luis Gal<0xC3><0xAD>cia said he couldn’t imagine someone who wanted to hurt his younger brother.
He had a good heart and a good heart.
His way of communicating with the family has always been to prepare us some dish, to prepare us dinner,” said Luis Galicia.
He never wanted to be involved in any kind of conflict.
He was the brother who floated on the stream.
“With all the bad things that happen to this world, it was the unbounded diamond that shined brightly every day,” he said.
Anyone who has the information is asked to call the SFPD Hotline at 415-575-4444.

Scientists have found an animal that can live 500 years
An international group of biologists has concluded that the longest-living vertebrate animal is the Greenlandic polar shark, which can live for about 500 years, RT reports.
Scientists conducted a radiocarbon analysis of the eye crystals of 28 Greenland sharks.
The largest shark, whose length exceeds five meters, can be from 272 to 512 years.
Biologists believe that an important role in shark longevity is played by low metabolism, which leads to slow development.
Females of Greenland sharks reach sexual maturity only by the age of 150.
Previously, it was believed that longer than all vertebrate animals live the "neighbor" shark - the Greenlandic whale.
The oldest known individual, the scientist, was just over 210 years old.

Is it worth going to the sanatorium if there are no health problems?
Our expert is the chief doctor of the sanatorium Olga Bohus.
And if a person is healthy, just tired of work, should he go to the sanatorium?
Sanatorium and resort rest is needed not only for the treatment, but also for the prevention of diseases.
Under sanatorium conditions, a person can check the condition of his body and get the recommendations of a doctor how to live, so that his health is not destroyed.
Such recommendations will not be superfluous to anyone.
"Just tired of work" is an important signal of the body, it should not be ignored.
Persistent stress, mental and physical overwork can lead to depression and chronic fatigue syndrome.
And stress is experienced by about 90% of visitors.
And people from large cities between the ages of 45 and 55 are the most vulnerable to it.
So it is better not to complicate the situation and give yourself time to rest.
Studies show that 98% of people reduce their biological age during their stay in a sanatorium.
Modern sanatoriums offer a comfortable rest for the whole family.
So if you want to spend the holidays with the kids, you won’t have to break up with them.
For children, even the youngest, health programs are provided, which include both diagnostic services, pediatric consultations, analyses, and therapeutic.
For example, swimming (in many sanatoriums there are children's pools), inhalations, special diets, massages, oxygen cocktails, therapeutic exercise.
The course of procedures is determined by the doctor taking into account the individual indications and characteristics of the growing organism.
In addition, in sanatoriums, there is usually a children's club with animators, where children can attend game classes, various master classes.
Some sanatoriums open their doors even to guests with babies, provide the necessary conditions for infants and provide the services of an experienced nanny.
The mild winter, the long summer, the abundance of sunny days in the year (over 300) create good conditions for year-round rest in the resorts of the Caucasus Mineral Waters.
And then the body needs rest not only in the summer.
So do not be afraid of the weather outside the window, especially since most procedures are carried out in the room and do not depend on the season.
In general, sanatorium and resort treatment is desirable to be carried out 2 times a year, especially for people of mature age.
The main chip of the region of Caucasian Mineral Waters, of course, the healing mineral sources: Slavyanovsky, Smirnovsky, Essentuki, Narzan.
Their water has unique properties and affects various systems of the body.
Water varies by temperature, number of salts, general mineralization, chemical and gas composition.
The doctor selects the water depending on the patient’s well-being.
Thus, "Narzan" has an anti-inflammatory, immunomodulating effect, restores the functions of the gastrointestinal tract and metabolism.
"Essentuki<0xE2><0x80><0x90>4" affects the gastrointestinal tract, lowers sugar levels.
"Essentuki nova" has anti-inflammatory, bile and urinary action.
The same effects have the water "Slavyanovskaya".
When prescribing water, the doctor must take into account the state of the cardiovascular system.
If there are signs of hypertension, it selects less salty water, because salts retain fluid, which leads to an increase in pressure.
The intake of mineral water requires compliance with the regime: the water should be drunk at a certain time, in the right amount and a specific temperature.
At present, various cosmetic procedures for the face and body are available in the sanatoriums.
What types of healing, based on the natural features of the North Caucasus, can be obtained in the resorts of this region?
Near Pyatigorsk, for example, there is a salt lake Tambokan, from which yarn dirt is useful for the joints, spine, internal organs.
It has an anti-inflammatory, resorbent, immunomodulating effect.
These are wellness walks along individually-made routes.
They are especially popular in Kislovodsk, where there is a huge resort park (the second largest in Europe).
Popular in Kislovodsk, which is in close proximity to the mineral source "Narzan".
There you can also take wine, pearl, iodine, selenium, chalphin-lacrylic baths, depending on what the doctor will prescribe.
Prolonged fruiting.
What to do to keep the harvest going until the end of the season?
Tells Yulia Belopukhova, a farmer and daughter.
It is time for high-grown tomatoes to arrange a haircut: to remove new spiders, cut the snails, remove all the leaves until the last brush with fruits and blossoms with small bandages - they will not be able to mature.
Tomatoes, regardless of the "constitution", as well as peppers and eggplants are fed with salt-superphosphate extract, processed with biopreparations (Adult - for the acceleration of the influx and the growth of the fruit, phytosporin-M, phytolavin, gamair, baker).
Of the chemicals at the end of the summer, you should only use copper copper, colloidal sulfur and green soap.
Let's do the last watering of plants.
Long-drawn cucumbers in the greenhouse are soaked from the wallpaper so that the lower, bare part of the stem (25-40 cm) lay on the ground, watered with warm water and a solution of zircon, soak the stem 5-7 cm of compost.
Prolonging the fruiting of the duck is also easy: cut old leaves, pour warm water and a solution of complex fertilizer, sprinkle the fertile soil under the bush.
To protect against the night cold, install above the bed a bow with sheltering material.
Keep the plant open during the day and close after sunset.
Signs of the end.
What indicates that Russia is coming out of the crisis?
Economists have seen signs of Russia’s exit from the longest recession in twenty years.
According to Bloomberg analysts, the GDP of Russia is showing a positive dynamic - in the second quarter GDP decreased by 0.8% year-on-year.
This figure has been minimal since the beginning of 2015.
According to the latest data of Rosstat, the decline of the Russian economy in the second quarter slowed to 0.6%.
The Central Bank and the Ministry of Economic Development have also recently announced the stabilization of the situation.
Slow growth is ahead.
According to the experts of the Central Bank, the recession in the Russian economy has remained in the past.
“The index estimation of Russian GDP indicates that the recession has remained behind and ahead is the slow growth of the economy,” the Bank of Russia’s bulletin reads.
The modular estimate of GDP for the current quarter has been increased to 0.4%, the estimate for the fourth quarter is 0.5%.
According to the representative of the Ministry of Economic Development, during the second quarter, the decline of GDP of the Russian Federation stopped in the second quarter, amounting to 0.2%.
In the second quarter, seasonally adjusted GDP decreased by 0.2% to the previous quarter.
But during the quarter, the decline stopped: in April it amounted to 0.2%, and in May and June the change in GDP was within 0-0.15", - quotes the representative of MER RIA "Novosti".
The slowdown in the Russian economy over the past five quarters is a sign that the bottom has been crossed.
Among other markers pointing to signs of a revival of the national economy, Bloomberg calls the rising demand for electricity and rail transport a revival of business.
If you make an adjustment to the fact that the year is high, then it is clear that the dynamics in plus 1% of electricity consumption can be half caused by an additional working day.
Add to this a lower annual average temperature in the first quarter.
The next argument is the growth of freight transport, but here it is difficult to get accurate data, and plus-minus 0.5% of the half-yearly volume can also be explained by seasonality", - explains Kirill Yakovenko from ALOR BROKER.
However, there are other, more obvious signs of stabilization of the Russian economy.
For example, a reduction in price pressure.
In July, the consumer price index was 7.2% compared to 15.6% in the same month of last year.
Moreover, in the last two weeks, Rosstat has recorded deflation.
Prices in Russia have fallen for the first time in five years.
If you look at the price dynamics of the ruble, which, although showed strong fluctuations at the beginning of the year, according to the results of August has strengthened by 12% since the beginning of the year.
This is also one of the signs of recovery, which should be followed by indicators from the real sector of the economy," Yakovenko stressed.
In addition, since April, there has been an increase in the volume of industrial production in Russia.
In June, the figure increased by 1.7%.
The rate of decline in foreign trade turnover slows from -32.8% in January 2016 to -20.7% in May.
The positive momentum is also demonstrated by the situation in the labour market, where the unemployment rate has fallen to 5.4%.
Below it was only in September 2015 (5.2%).
Despite the prosperous situation in the labour market, the question of the real disposable income of the population leaves to desire the best.
In annual terms, the figure decreases by 4.8%.
This factor could hamper the recovery of the economy, as household spending contributes a considerable amount to GDP.
As a rule, in the structure of the economy their share exceeds 50%.
In addition to low consumer activity, the Bank of Russia’s tough policy can also be called as risk factors for economic growth.
The regulator keeps the bet at 10.5%, which does not have the best effect on the real sector.
A negative factor is also the insufficient level of investment, which inhibits the development of industrial potential.
But in general, it can be assumed that by the end of the year, the rate of decline of the Russian economy will slow down to -0.5% versus -3.7% in 2015," said Irina Rogova, analyst at Forex Club.
The naturalization process of athletes, recently launched in Russian football and well experienced in winter sports at the Olympics in Sochi, is not yet as actively developed in summer sports.
If at the Olympic Games in Rio for Russia and ex-aliens perform, then in most cases it is about the natives of the countries - the former republics of the Soviet Union.
But in Rio de Janeiro we can observe the reverse process - quite a large number of Russians are performing under the flags of other countries.
In each case, the history of the change of citizenship is different.
Parents took someone to another country as a child, leaving no choice.
Someone did not stand the competition for a place in the Russian team.
And someone thought that abroad will create the best conditions for development in the sport.
AIF.ru has found at least 16 athletes who have decided to change their Russian citizenship.
The German passport of the 27-year-old girl says her name is Lisa Ryzhych.
But before that, she was, of course, Elizabeth.
She was born in 1988 in Omsk.
Just four years after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Lisa’s parents decided to emigrate to Germany.
The girl had no choice.
There she decided to follow in the footsteps of her older sister - to engage in light athletics.
Like her sister, Lisa chose jumps with six.
If she stayed in Russia, she would hardly be able to “take off the throne” Elena Isinbayev.
Unfortunately, at the Olympics in Rio Lisa will be our only landlord, albeit former, in the sector for jumping with six.
Her best achievements in this sport are bronze of the 2010 European Championship and silver of the Continental Championship in 2016, which she won again in the absence of Elena Isinbaeva.
29-year-old Elena Pirozhkova was born in Novokuznetsk in 1986.
Her parents are religious propagandists of the evangelical direction.
Mostly because of their faith, they left for the United States when the girl was only three years old.
In addition to Elena, there were eight other children in the family.
They all lived in a small town in Greenfield, Massachusetts.
Lena began to be passionate about fighting while she was still in school.
Showing good results, she moved to the city of Colorado Springs, where at the U.S. Struggle Training Center she continued classes under the leadership of another former Russian, Vladislav Izboinikov.
At the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, Elena lost in her first fight.
But at the World Championships in the same year - a victory.
Before that, she, by the way, managed to win silver at the 2010 World Championships.
Then there were bronze in 2013 and silver in 2014.
The 26-year-old Maria was born in the city of Yaroslavl, where she first met with synchronous swimming.
But to say that she was raised by our coaches in Russia would be wrong.
Soon the family of the girl decided to emigrate to the United States and settle in the city of Colorado.
Mary continued her studies there.
Soon she was already on the U.S. team and showed great results at the Pan American Games.
It is clear that at a serious international level Russian synchronists can not compete, but for America its indicators are the ceiling.
The new name, which sounds strange in Russian, was given to Kristina Shaldybina at the age of 11, when her parents decided to continue teaching the girl artistic gymnastics abroad.
Until then, the girl was engaged in her favorite sport in her native Yaroslavl.
After emigrating to the United States, she quickly joined the country’s youth team and later joined the main national team.
At the Pan American Games, 19-year-old Kristen won gold and silver.
For the first positions on the world stage, of course, she did not have to fight, but for the United States she organized a real breakthrough - brought out the star-tracked team at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
Another one of our former “artists” is Jan Berezko-Marggrander, who stands for Germany’s national team.
She was born in Toledo.
In 2008, when the girl was 13 years old, the family decided to move to Germany, where the girl had more prospects of joining the national team.
She soon represented her country at the 2012 Olympic Games in London.
There, however, she was able to take only 17 places, not enough to get into the final competitions in the personal championship.
But two years before that, she managed to win the bronze medal of the Youth Olympic Games.
Another gymnast, only this time athletic - Irina Sazonova.
If the ways of emigration of the aforementioned athletes can be called standard, then the choice of the Irina family is very unusual - Iceland.
Ira is a student of Volgograd Sports School.
Of course, in Iceland, she immediately became the champion of the country.
True, Ira is still training in Russia - she comes to her homeland in order not to lose her skills.
In Rio, she did not perform as well as she would like.
The best place is 40 in a personal multiplayer.
Information about the swimmer Maria Ukolkova in the Russian information space is extremely small.
For a very long time Maria has lived and trained in Switzerland.
For a long time, however, she performed under the Russian flag, showing good results - there was even a country record at a distance of 200 meters butterfly.
In 2015, she was granted Swiss citizenship and began to perform under the red and white flag.
In Rio, her best performance is 14th place in the complex relay 4<0xC3><0x97>100.
To get to the games, the girl launched a crowdfunding project, thanks to which she was able to collect about 6 thousand francs, which allowed her to pay for the preparation for the Olympics.
31-year-old freestyle fighter Adam Batirov spent almost his entire career under the Russian flag.
During this time, the native of Hasavurt managed to become the three-time winner of the European Championships, the champion of Russia, the master of sports of Russia of international class.
When he stopped coming to our national team, it was time to think about changing his nationality.
For several years, a talented fighter disappeared from the sports bridges.
The triumphant return took place at the 2016 Asian Championships - Batirov was already represented by Bahrain, for which he won the gold medal and received a trip to the Olympics in Rio.
Another ex-Russian, Mikhail Kudinov, is known even less at home than even about the Swiss swimmer Maria Ugolkova.
The fact is that his parents emigrated from Vladivostok to New Zealand when the boy was very young.
It was there that Mikhail began to practice sports gymnastics.
It has not achieved great success at the international level.
In Rio, his best result was 40th place in the qualifying on parallel poles.
But for New Zealand, even getting to the Olympics in sports gymnastics is already a breakthrough.
When Naste, who was born in Moscow in 1985, was only 9 years old, her family emigrated to Israel.
There, the girl continued her synchronous swimming classes, showing high results at the national level.
In 2014, at the European Championships in Berlin, the girl took 6th place in synchronous swimming.
In the duet with Eugene Tetelbaum, Anastasia took eighth place.
She was fifth in the solo program.
Like Anastasia, 23-year-old Dmitry Cruiser is in favour of the Israeli national team.
When the boy was only 6 years old, his mother decided to repatriate to Israel.
In 2009, at the age of 17, Dmitry already became the champion of the country.
That same year, he won the World Youth Championship.
A year later, Cruiser also won the gold of the Singapore Youth Olympic Games.
In addition to jumping in height, Dmitry engages in long jumps and triple jumps.
The 31-year-old Albert is another native of Hasavurt, who after long performances for Russia decided to change his sporting citizenship.
However, unlike Batirov, Albert chose Romania, which he would represent in Rio.
In Russia, he played for the School of Higher Sports Mastery of Krasnoyarsk, in 2011 he even became the country’s champion.
28-year-old Oleg Antonov was born in Moscow in the family of the USSR volleyball player Yaroslav Antonov.
Literally a year before the birth of his son Yaroslav was recognized as the best volleyball player on the planet.
Soon he decided to continue his career in Italy.
The family stayed there for a permanent residency.
In 2015, as part of the national team, he became the bronze winner of the European Championship, held on the territory of his new homeland.
Hadzhiev was born in Chechnya in 1994 and was at the height of the war with his family.
Ten years later, my parents decided to emigrate.
The original goal was Norway, but it was not possible to get to this northern country - I had to go to France, to Nice.
There, Zelymkhan continued to train for free struggle.
Soon he won the World Junior Championships, and later qualified for the Olympic Games as well.
In Rio, he will be the only representative of France in the tournament.
And once again a free fight, and once again a former Russian.
This time we will talk about the native of North Ossetia, who emigrated to Spain, - about Tymuraz Freeve.
At the end of December 2012, he was granted Spanish citizenship, and he is currently representing the national team of that country.
Before that, however, the 30-year-old athlete managed to score high results in Russia.
He became the bronze medalist of the country's 2007 and 2008 championships.
A statute of absence from the team, Tymuraz decided to change his sporting citizenship.
The last on our list is a Chechen boxer, born in 1995 in the capital of Dagestan Mahachkale, - Arthur Biyarslanov.
When the boy was ten years old, his parents took the family through Azerbaijan to Canada.
There Arthur, on the advice of his older brother, began to do boxing.
Since then, Arthur has been the champion of Canada three times, and in 2012 became the world champion among young people.
In 2015, Biyarslanov won the gold of the Pan American Games, the first for his new homeland since 1975.

Why do children have Cossack classes in schools?
According to Governor V. Kondratyev, "cossacks need to be educated not by actions and parades, but systematically."
They must grow up and at least from the age of 7 understand that they are Cossacks and education should be Cossacks.
But so far this work seems to be being done formally and, I suspect, more on paper.
If the Cossack classes take in all the positives that have accumulated before, on a qualitatively new level, I will be glad.
If everything is suffocated and we don’t know how, the new idea will turn into cheap populism.
The LHC continues to be one of the most criminal sectors of the country’s economy.
There is an influencing force for funds allocated to the needs of the communal sphere from budgets of different levels.
According to the Office of the Prosecutor General, over-tariffs are one of the most common crimes in the field of LHC.
As a result, consumers of the region overpaid to energy companies more than 170 million rubles.
On the days and the prosecutor’s office of Krasnodar region revealed the facts of inclusion in the tariffs of unjustified costs.
And in the expenses of LLC "IV-consulting" (in terms of cold water) was put 4 million rubles for car rental at a price above the market price.
Examples of this are in the country of masses.
The people give the last money for the "communal" and pay correctly, - according to the Ministry of the Russian Federation, the average collection of payments from the population is 94%.
He is accused immediately of several articles of the Criminal Code: waste, legalization of income earned by criminal means, abuse of authority, etc.
According to the investigation, as the head of the fund, which was engaged in the repair of urban facilities, Makarov concluded contracts with entrepreneurs, work on them was not actually carried out, but paid.
The businessmen just gave him back most of the money.
And as the owner of the UK, Makarov collected money from the population, but did not pay service providers and spent it on his own needs.
As a result of the damage to the budget and residents - millions of rubles.
Makarov’s scheme of machinations is, unfortunately, typical for Russia.
There was a wave of arrests and detentions of UK leaders, who allotted money to citizens, across the country.
In Kamchatka, the trial of A. Kochan, by the way, also a former deputy of the city council, who is accused of fraud at 91.7 million rubles.
According to the investigation, in 2012-2013 in Elizovo of Kamchatka region, he established 6 management companies and created 3 limited liability companies.
One of them carried out work for the UK, two others played the role of cash-cash centers, i.e. took money from the population.
However, the energetics A. Kochan did not list the funds, but spent on himself, the beloved.
Judging in the field of LHC is quite difficult.
Things don't get excited, they get delayed.
And "helps" in this extremely complicated housing legislation, - believes Svetlana Razvorotneva, the executive director of NP "ZKH Control".
We fail to earn one law as we invent a new one that must make the previous one work.
Specialists, including among judges, on the issues of the HCH are also few.
Lawyers themselves admit that the right to housing in universities is given very little attention.
Refusals in the initiation of criminal cases, fibers in the course of investigations are also spoken in the Prosecutor General’s Office.
Of the 3,500 crimes in 2015, less than half have been brought to court.
The rest of the investigation was of a protracted nature, and one in five was suspended due to the non-identification of the accused person.
Often, deficiencies in the activities of law enforcement agencies are attributed to gaps in the current legislation.
There is a law, but the investigative bodies are not in a hurry to initiate and investigate such cases.
In the second half of 2015, there were about 230 reports of forgery - only 60 criminal cases were initiated.
In the five months of this year, their number has increased only slightly - 99.
What is the falsification of the Protocol of the Assembly of Residents?
This means: change of house management, financial and other issues are bypassing the opinion of the owners.
And this also means that the market of housing and utilities can not penetrate normal companies, who want to work honestly, and not "breed" the population.
It turns out, the residents in the minus, small and medium-sized businesses as well.
Above all, by eradication of corruption as such in the whole state, - Anton Zharkov, a member of the Committee of the State Duma on Property.
And now this work is actively being done.
It’s not just a single action – it’s a targeted course to fight corruption.
Of course, this is not the case in all regions.
In particular, the capital does not smell scandals.
Why are there no such scandals in Moscow in the field of LHC, as in many other regions?
But because the capital government has shown iron will and brought order, "AiF" Anatoly Vyborny, a member of the Committee of the State Duma on Security and Anti-corruption.
I mean both the personnel issue, and the legislative amendments, and the legal education.
The management companies are under close supervision, and all of them have gone through licensing.
Complaints of citizens are promptly resolved in the public space (and the address of residents, and response measures are posted on the portal of the government of Moscow).
Many don’t just pay monthly bills, but pay close attention to what’s written there, how the house is.
Awareness among the population about the rights of owners and the obligations of resource-providing and managing organizations is very high.
Plus, Moscow checks the rationality of tariffs on housing and utilities - because a large part of the budget funds goes to subsidies and benefits for numerous categories of the population.
Probably all of this together and explains the calm situation in Moscow.
Is everything based on the will of the regional authorities?
Is it possible to change the place of work?
The Turkish Gambit.
Will Erdogan be able to give up friendships with the EU and the United States?
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has proposed an ultimatum to the United States, suggesting a choice between Turkey and Fethullah Gülen, an Islamic preacher accused of organizing a coup.
That is what he said when he spoke to his supporters in Ankara.
Erdogan called on the Americans to refuse to support the “terrorist feudalist organization.”
This is not the first statement from Turkey in which the United States is calling for a change in its position.
Experts believe that the split in Turkey’s relations with the West is growing and could lead to a new attempt to change power in the country.
“Sooner or later, America will make a choice between Turkey and FETO (“Terrorist Organization of Fethullahists”).
Either the organising of the FETO coups, or the democratic Turkey.
It has to make that choice,” the Anatolian news agency quoted Erdogan’s address in Ankara on Wednesday evening as saying.
The president of Turkey once again, but already harsherly demanded from the United States to comply with his demand, made by him for the first time immediately after the suppression of the mutiny.
Recall that on the night of July 16 in Turkey, high-ranking representatives of the Turkish army made an attempt to overthrow legitimate power in the country, as well as an attempt on the life of the head of state.
However, after Recep Tayyip Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an spoke out against the population, the rebellion was suppressed and its organizers and participants arrested.
In total, about 8,000 people were suspected, among whom, in addition to the military, were teachers and scientists.
According to Recep Tayyip Erdogan, their mentor was Fethullah Gulen, who lives in the state of Pennsylvania in the United States.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an’s supporters also admitted that Americans could be directly involved in the coup d’état.
The U.S. denied all claims, refusing to hand over Gulen and advising to change the tone.
The latest statement by the representatives of the State Department on this account was made at the time of Erdogan’s visit to St. Petersburg last Tuesday.
However, this does not stop the Turkish president - he insists on his own and also makes demands on his other Western partners.
“Ankara will cease to fulfil its obligations under the migration agreement with the European Union if Brussels does not set a date for the abolition of visa restrictions for Turkish citizens,” Turkish Minister for EU Affairs Omer <0xC4><0x8C>elik said on August 9.
According to him, Ankara’s amendments to the anti-terrorism law, as required by the EU, would jeopardize Europe’s own security.
On August 1, Vice Chancellor of Germany Sigmar Gabriel demanded that Turkey stop blackmailing the European Union by promising to open borders for migrants in order to achieve visa facilitation with the EU.
His words came in response to a statement by Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu.
Another provocative statement made by Cavusoglu last Wednesday, suggesting that Turkey could leave NATO.
The head of the Turkish Foreign Ministry has not ruled out that the country will consider exiting the alliance if it does not receive the expected support from it.
The decision to increase cooperation with Russia in the defence sphere is not a step against NATO.
There are NATO countries that cooperate with foreign countries in the field of defense, - import missiles," - said Cavusoglu in an interview with the agency Anadolu.
According to him, Turkey now needs to create its own defense system based on its technologies, as well as to cooperate with other countries.
“Turkey has so far tried to cooperate with NATO member countries, but the results have not satisfied us and we have started looking for others,” he said.
Experts believe all of this speaks to Turkey’s serious disagreements with the West and the country’s reorientation to the East.
The head of the International Institute of Political Expertise, Evgeny Minchenko, believes that Recep Tayyip Erdogan is now playing his game and cannot go to a tough confrontation with the West.
He is very much attached to the West both from a business point of view and from a military point of view (Turkey is a member of NATO), so I think Erdogan will try to balance by maintaining a framework relationship with the West.
Although, of course, it would be more convenient for Americans to see a fully obedient person in this post," the AIF.ru expert explained.
According to him, it is not excluded that after the statements of the Turkish leader (on non-payment of EU compensation, on the requirement of visa-free space with Europe and the issuance of Gulen from the United States) he will be pressured.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan will face a deterioration in relations with both the United States and the European Union, and they will put pressure on him precisely on humanitarian issues, dictatorial methods of governance of the country and so on,” Minchenko said.
The head of the Center for Political Information Alexei Mukhin admits that the president of Turkey will change his view on relations with Russia as soon as it benefits him.
Eight months ago, Erdogan took an extremely hard stance on Russia and sought favor in the West by all means.
In a very short time, the situation changed to the opposite.
There are guarantees that after a while the Turkish president will not change his priorities again, no.
I think Erdogan has entered a period of front-line diplomacy.
When he finds himself between the two poles - the West and Russia, he will try to get the maximum benefit for himself", - believes Mukhin.
In his opinion, the main task for the president of Turkey today is to retain political power in the country, and for this, he needs Russia and partnership with Vladimir Putin, so that the United States stop supporting Gulen.
Turkey needs both the EU and the United States, which with its help controls the situation in Syria and the Middle East.
Therefore, a consensus with Turkey will be reached,” the expert said.
Another point of view is the head of the Center of Asia and the Middle East, Anna Glazova.
Turkey’s relations with both the EU and the US are now quite tense, and this is primarily due to Erdogan’s own domestic policy.
I think that this crisis in relations will exacerbate, and against the background of this crisis, the Turkish leadership will try to relaunch policy both in the Middle East and in relations with Russia.
It is no coincidence that the president of Turkey, as well as a number of Turkish politicians, declare that they are ready to change their position on a number of issues on Syria, relations with Israel have been settled, and there is an active political interaction with Iran, "- explained AiF.ru Glazova, allowing.
According to her, Erdogan’s current policy is a return to the course of the foreign policy concept that Turkey followed before the Arab revolutions began.
It was then that Turkey began to develop very actively its relations with the Middle East and the Asian region at the “zero problems with its neighbours”.
Now we have had very successful visits of the President of Turkey to Russia and the countries of Africa.
Therefore, this foreign policy vector will develop and contribute to strengthening Turkey’s positions both in the regional and international arena,” the expert said.
Glazova believes that returning Turkey to its former relationship with the EU will be incredibly difficult, now the question is whether the EU will start to respond harshly to Turkey, which can go to the opening of borders for migrants and thus create serious problems for Europe.
Younger Doctors Strike: Calls for New Collective Protests
Representatives of the younger doctors appealed to the trade union to sanction new collective protests in their dispute over the new employment contract.
The British Medical Association’s (BMA) Committee of Young Physicians (JDC) is going to ask its full council to support more collective protests since the beginning of September.
JDC says ministers have failed to answer questions about the employment contract.
Younger doctors and medical students voted in July to cancel the employment deal agreed with the BMA.
It was rejected by 58% of its members who participated in the secret ballot.
In a letter to members posted on Twitter on Thursday evening, JDC chairman Ellen McCord said the government continued to “persistently remain silent” about the issues that she said led to the rejection of the employment contract.
She said: “Given the situation, the head of the JDC voted in favour of rejecting the proposed new employment contract in full and called for formal renegotiations on all of your issues.”
In response to the silence of the government, the leader of the JDC made an official request for an extraordinary meeting of the BMA Council to approve an ongoing program to expand collective protests beginning in early September.
The controversy led to young doctors taking part in six strikes this year, including the first general strikes in the history of the State Health Service.
The leader of BMA’s junior doctors, Dr. Joan Malavana, resigned after a vote to cancel the agreed terms of the employment contract recommended by the BMA.
He told BMA members that the deal was a good deal to accept during meetings ahead of the vote of 54,000 junior doctors and medical students.
After the vote, Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said that the employment contract would be used for health workers in England.
Russia and Turkey: The Alliance of the Bad?
It was a gesture that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and announce the official end of the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin greeted his Turkish counterpart in the golden hall of the palace in St. Petersburg, I had the lasting impression that Ankara wanted this reconciliation more.
There was a handcuff, yes.
But Mr. Putin’s smile seemed tense, and he barely radiated heat even by his own restrained standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the contrary, has repeatedly spoken of his “dear friend” Mr. Putin — five times, according to one report.
I lost my account.
He also promised that relations with Russia would return not only to their pre-crisis level, but even higher.
The next day, a newspaper described Mr. Erdogan’s actions as if nothing bad had ever happened.
In my opinion, his enthusiasm meant the opposite.
But the shrinking cold coming from Mr. Putin has shown that the Russian leader has not forgotten anything.
In fact, the first cause of the crisis was what he mentioned in his introductory comments: Turkey shot down a Russian fighter on the Syrian border.
Moscow’s reaction at the time was unequivocal.
Mr. Putin was outraged by the tyranny, accusing Ankara of striking Moscow in the back.
The grief was even stronger, based on the supposed friend.
Restoring real trust will be difficult, perhaps impossible.
The Russian public opinion has also changed since November.
For months, the state-controlled media carried out an astonishing, total attack on Ankara.
All of a sudden it seemed that the Turks should be considered guilty of everything.
The most serious were accusations by senior officials that Mr. Erdogan’s own family had resorted to the illegal oil trade from Syria’s zones controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He strongly denied it.
But there was an official signal in St. Petersburg that it was time to move on.
In the end, this meeting only happened because Mr. Putin received the apology he was demanding from President Erdogan.
Russia could claim a victory of its kind.
For Ankara, the benefits of declaring a ceasefire are clear.
First of all, Erdogan needs all the friends he can get after he was nearly ousted from his post last month in an attempt at a coup.
The recurring terrorist attacks on Turkey have shocked him, too.
There is also an economic reason.
Russian sanctions have hit hard — especially a ban on charter flights, which usually bring a few million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.
The number fell sharply to almost 90 percent.
As for Russia, tour operators and charter companies here will, of course, feel relief when the flights finally resume.
They are at the peak of the end of the season in the Mediterranean.
And even this week, state television predicted cheaper fruits and vegetables, as soon as Turkish imports of agricultural products will be allowed again.
“Tourists over there, tomatoes back here,” the report said in the Vedomosti newspaper.
But the visit also had an additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry at the West for what it sees as a weak response to the coup attempt.
Add to this her prolonged dissatisfaction with the tortoise of the EU accession talks and the step of Mr. Putin — who seeks to take advantage of the cool and gradually destroy Turkish ties with the West.
The Russian leader, of course, won bonus points with Ankara for a call to support the elected authorities after the attempted coup d'état.
Keep in mind, this is a data for Moscow, which has its own deeply rooted fear of regime change.
So, the summit in this brilliant palace on the sea coast allowed Russia and Turkey to imagine what one analyst described to me as an “alliance of the bad”: two countries that feel rejected and humiliated by the West are uniting forces.
However, despite the public display of reconciliation, the two still have significant differences in their relationship.
The key is Syria, where Moscow has recently positioned itself as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support the opposite sides.
Perhaps it says for itself that after almost three hours of initial negotiations, while the two presidents gave a press conference, they didn’t even touch on the topic.
The President of Turkey deliberately avoided answering the question about their differences, while Mr. Putin preferred to focus on them.
There is no clear consensus on how they can find a common language in Syria.
But after months of open hostility — and considering the possibility of a complete catastrophe when a NATO member Turkey shot down a Russian jet fighter — it is certainly better that the two leaders at least talk again.
Royal Bank of Scotland to Disappear for Customers Outside Scotland
The RBS brand should be reduced to the role of a back office, according to the bank’s executive director.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for customers outside of Scotland.
Ross McEvan told the BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank’s global ambitions.
The bank has retreated from them since it nearly collapsed eight years ago and had to be saved.
During this period, brand strategists used RBS to protect other consumer lending brands.
It was backed by millions of pounds of sponsorship support for international sport, from the Six Nations Rugby Cup to Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.
But now it has been decided that it is right to allow more national brands to come to the fore.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used with Scottish customers, but will not be launched.
In England and Wales, all references to RBS, including the external head office and stock exchange, will be changed to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller brands for private banking that will gain more influence — Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
Mr. McEvan gave an interview during the tour of clients and employees in Invernessshire.
He told BBC Scotland: “The RBS brand will eventually become our investment brand and one that our staff will be engaged in because we are now becoming more and more a bank of brands.”
As the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
I’m saying now that we no longer have global aspirations, we have local aspirations.
Each of these brands will represent something completely different in their population groups, and our staff will work with customers under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will not continue its sponsorship support of the Six Nations Cup, and it is increasing the profile of various brands in sponsorship of the sport.
“This is the right time for us to move a bank of brands, because basically (we asked ourselves) how do we focus on improving a bank for customers?” said the CEO.
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we said we were going to be a great bank for customers and shut down all of these brands.
But with the work we did, focusing on the needs of our customers, not our own, I think you see a lot of changes.
We can bring those brands back, so I think the time is right.
Frankie Dettori reaches 3,000 winners with Newmarket victory on the Pride
Dettori splashes champagne after a duel in Newmarket leads it to 3,000 victories
Jockey Frankie Dettori scored his 3,000th British victory at the Newmarket on Friday.
He came to this outstanding mark with the help of his second winner of the night on his home track - on the Passion, trained by John Gosden.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach this outstanding mark in the smooth races.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Duke Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Iddery, and Willy Carson.
Three-time champion Jockey Dettori, who had previously won the Ghayyar, said: “It’s something special.”
I'm very excited because my family is here too.
I’m very happy that it happened in Newmarket, because that’s where I settled 30 years ago.
It’s not a big secular event, it’s not Royal Ascot – it’s an ordinary Friday night with 20,000 people.
I am free and very unpretentious.
Dettori takes applause when leading to predisposition after victory
Two jockeys have reached this point in obstacle races: Jockey champion Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who had more than 4,300 victories in a record career.
Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4493 career victories
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of the modern era and it is not surprising that he has reached this mark that so few have reached before him.
It is stylish and strong, but it is its tactical softener that distinguishes it from others in the weight room.
He is a great representative for racing, his enthusiasm and charisma have attracted fans to this sport for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago in Epsom, he would have brought 6,000 winners if it wasn’t just a jockey of weekends and big races!
And seriously, Frankie has led the winners in the UK for most of 30 years, which is great to see.
He’s an energetic character, which is good for British racing, but more than that, he’s an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated this outstanding mark with a branded rapid jump from the horse
From fast-paced finishes to fast-paced jumps, Frankie Dettoria has been a symbol of British smooth running for two decades.
They were ups and downs.
Many major race winners, including his famous "Amazing Seven" in Ascot in 1996, but he also survived the plane crash and was disqualified due to doping.
Three years ago, he first faced difficulties when he returned after a six-month disqualification, but he showed a huge willpower to challenge the skeptics and get back in shape.
And he may not have finished for some time — Dettoria said earlier that he would like to continue participating in competitions, at least until the age of 50.
Putin dismisses the head of the administration Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly fired his head of administration Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of Putin’s trusted close circle for many years.
The 63-year-old has now been appointed as an environmental and transport representative.
A statement from the Kremlin says that Putin “decided to release Ivanov from his duties as head of the Russian presidential administration,” but did not state the reason.
Mr. Ivanov's deputy since 2012, Anton Weino, was appointed his successor.
Mr. Weino, 44, former diplomat.
Born in the Estonian capital Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State University of International Relations (MGIMO) and served at the Embassy of Tokyo.
Later, he was the head of the administration of the protocol of the president and the apparatus of the government, according to the website of the Kremlin (in Russian).
During his appointment, he said to Putin, “Thank you for your trust.”
I think the most important task of the administration is to support your activities as Heads of State in terms of drafting laws and monitoring how your instructions are being carried out.
Putin told a Russian TV channel on Friday that Ivanov had asked for him to be released from the position and recommended that Vyno replace him.
Do Smiles Convince?
This is a move that has puzzled Moscow.
Sergey Ivanov was one of Vladimir Putin’s closest supporters for a long time and, like him, served in the Soviet security service, the KGB.
As the head of the administration, he was one of the most powerful people in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, which was shown on state television, both men said that the head of the administration resigned at his own will.
But despite the smiles on the camera, it has convinced few here — especially now, right before the parliamentary elections.
So, are these the unforeseen consequences of some power struggle?
As long as no one knows.
But the official statement — that the man, who was once agitated as a potential president, suddenly wanted to run Russia’s environmental policy — was met with enormous scepticism.
In Putin’s remarks quoted on the Kremlin’s website, Ivanov said: “It is true that in early 2012 I asked you in a conversation to entrust me with this very difficult position, even a problematic position, for four years.
Well, it turns out I was the head of the president's administration for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
He had previously served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the KGB State Security Service, as is Mr. Putin.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was head of the Federal Security Service (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov among the five people he trusted the most.
It was once believed that Ivanov could become president of Russia after Putin’s second term, since the third term for Putin would contradict the constitution.
However, this post was occupied by another close supporter of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister until he returned to the presidency just three and a half years later.
'Think Like a Criminal' Star Thomas Gibson Released After Fighting With Producer
Gibson was a cast member at a Los Angeles filming show last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce the series, announced his dismissal in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, made an apology on Thursday before his removal was announced.
There were creative differences in the shots and differences of opinion.
I regret that it happened,” he said in his statement.
Detailed information on how Gibson's character will be removed from the show, which is overseeing a team of FBI agents, is expected to come later, according to statements by ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
The 54-year-old actor, who previously starred in the sitcom Darma and Greg, has been on the show since the first season in 2005.
“I love ‘Think like a criminal’ and have put my heart and soul into it for the past twelve years,” Gibson said in a statement released Friday.
I was hoping to be in it until the end, but now it will be impossible.
I just want to thank the writers, producers, actors, our amazing team, and, most importantly, the best fans the show could only dream of.
The show is scheduled to return with its twelfth season on September 28.
Mystery: Fish Landed in the Banff Garden
A man from Banff sought help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bane believes that 75 fish could have been sand ducks left by a water lizard.
Bain, who lives 500 meters from the sea, set the scene in Periscope in the hope that someone could shed light on the appearance of two-inch fish.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connected to Fife
The <0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion project should now be completed by May 2017
Engineers have connected the northern spring and the viaduct of Queensferry Crossing, which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.
This is the first of four interlocks between the “winds of the canvas” that are now close to completion near all three pillars of the bridge.
The section of the bridge from Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It contains 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 vats of bridge.
The <0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion project is due to be completed by May 2017.
Economy Minister Keith Brown visited the site today and was among the first to walk from the ground to the bridge.
He said: “This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of Queensferry Crossing.
We are all witnesses of the engineering art of a truly epic scale in this project, where more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel have been used only to build this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the closure between the viaduct and the bridge canvas is a virtuoso operation using extremely accurate assembly tolerances.
In total, about 79% of all the bridge canvas is now in place, for the last section of the canvas, the concrete coating is poured in Rosaita today, which means that the canvas is ready to rise to the spot on the bridge.
Michael Martin, Project Director of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: “The first shutdown on every bridge project is always a significant milestone.
In this stunning project, this closure represents the most modern construction art in the world.
After installing the last section of the roadway and connecting it to the expanding roadway of the North Pole, we then had to close the remaining gap on the north side — or facing the shore — side.
This was done by pulling the northern approach viaduct 700 millimetres southerly.
It was a large-scale and at the same time a very polite operation.
Scalable, because the 222-meter-long viaduct weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be raised to an angle of inclination of about 3%.
Elegant, because the allowances that the team worked on were tiny — just a few millimeters in each direction.
Thankfully, it all went very well.
Salvation in Moelph Bay: Three men 'lucky to stay alive'
The three men were "lucky to stay alive" after being dumped from a fishing vessel in England.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station raised the alarm at 13:20 British Summer Time on Friday after the team saw an incident unfolding in the Gulf of Moelfre.
The three men tried their best to sail to a safe place, while their ship continued to walk on its own.
“We saw their ship swirling next to them and assumed the worst,” said Moelfre lifeboat pilot Vince Jones.
"Fortunately, by the time we got down on the water, a strong wind took it away from them," he added.
Two men were rescued with the help of a local fishing vessel, and a third man, aged 60, was found exhausted and stuck in a buoy without a life jacket.
All of them were taken aboard a shore rescue boat and taken to a rescue station.
Jones said: "Three men who were dumped in the water were lucky to be alive and completely harmless.
The boat's engine had an emergency shutter, but it somehow separated from the man who was driving the boat when it crashed.
Someone's been protecting these guys today.
Pokémon Go, a worthy hunt for health and happiness
It’s interesting to watch the world change.
The fact that teens and children no longer go out to play, preferring to spend their free time looking at screens, has been a complaint for many over the past decade.
Pokemon Go takes people off the couch and engages in some physical activity.
The time on the screen was initially limited to television, then video games and lately smartphones.
So great to see that technology and activity on the street are not mutually exclusive.
I mean, of course, the popular hobby that is Pokémon Go, an app based on the characters originally created for video games in the 1990s (which subsequently spawned a series of cartoons, game cards and other derivatives).
Like many other pop-cultural phenomena, all of this has lost its former relevance just before this new game became available in the U.S., Australia and New Zealand in early July.
Launching in other countries at the time was delayed due to a mass response that overloaded the servers.
In a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
So how does it work?
In other words, players with smartphones go looking for Pokémon that are tracked by GPS and, when detected, can be ‘photographed’ (through a screenshot on your phone) or ‘caught’.
The generation that played the game when they were younger joined the all-enthusiast, breaking away from the sofas for the search.
In the U.S., the game has led to a significant increase in the number of steps taken by an “ordinary” person on a daily basis.
Cardiogram, an app for the Apple Watch that tracks 35,000 users, recently reported to the Washington Post that within two days of launching the game, the number of people tracked by it who performed 30-minute exercises daily jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company doesn’t know who is playing Pokémon Go, it just sees the primary data on passing levels.
Many health campaigns that persuade people to “find 30 minutes,” “get off the couch,” and “be active every day” have not found the answer because most health messages are boring and are voiced by people who look unhappy.
However, the importance of physical exercise should not be underestimated.
Those who exercise regularly reduce the chances of developing cancer or depression.
Physical activity helps with weight correction, high blood pressure, diabetes, and a long list of benefits, too long to bring here.
But the beauty of Pokémon Go is that it drags people out into the street to do what they love.
Thus, three basics of health are covered: movement, fresh air, and sunlight and joy.
Some people even make new friends on the hunt.
As usual, there are boring boredoms who are looking for something to complain about.
And yes, someone might come across the door.
Well, what?
A breakthrough happened.
After all, despite the fact that apps for smartphones like Fitbit have been able to track our physical activity before, they gave us no reason to do things like this game does.
The novelty will come, and the use will weaken over time.
However, due to the success of Pokemon will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with physical activity in the real world, helping many people in the hunt to be more active, in good shape and healthy.

Simona Bails wins the gold of absolute primacy in women's gymnastics
Forget the pressure.
Forget about the trouble.
Simone Bales is invulnerable to all of this.
Dynamic on the back-up jump.
Unforced at the bar.
Stunning on the floor.
Awesome everywhere.
And now, finally, the Olympic champion.
A 19-year-old American gymnast rose to the title of absolute champion on Thursday, placing a gap between herself and the rest of the world at a convincing demonstration under the acclaimed Olympic attention.
Her overall score of 62,198 was at a sufficient distance from silver medalist and teammate "Final Five" Ali Reisman and Russian bronze medalist Alia Mustafina.
Bills from the United States is performing at a gymnastics bar during the final of the women’s individual absolute gymnastics championship at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
She became the fourth American woman in a row to win the title of absolute champion and the fifth overall, cementing her reputation as the best of her generation and perhaps ever.
She was torn apart when she was shown her final overall score and her long journey to that point was over.
This achievement puts her in the same league as extremely rare lightweight athletes such as Michael Phelps, who have taken their sports to new heights:
The Beatles have spent the last three years dominating their sport, winning 15 World Championship medals – including 10 golds – with such stunning programs in their mix of hard work and precision that when the 1984 Olympic Champion co-leaded, Mary Lou Retton called her the "Welcome Champion".
One last test was waiting in Brazil, the competition is not so much between Bailes and the rest in this field, but between it and the load of over-expectations.
Anything less than going back to his family’s home in Spring, Texas, with a handful of gold medals, would be considered an unjustified expectation.
Simona Bailes from the United States, on the left, and Ali Reisman hug after winning gold and silver respectively in the final of the women's individual absolute championship in artistic gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.
The Beatles won their first gold on Tuesday, becoming a beautiful final chord for the farewell party of resigning national team coordinator Marta Caroli.
While Billes insisted she had never looked into the future during her long journey to the top, it wasn’t quite so.
Part of her free exercise program—the one that includes her signature passage—is set to Latin American music, which would come just like a home on the street just outside the Rio Olympic Arena.
It's no coincidence.
The girl, adopted by her grandfather and grandmother, as a child and an open mother of coach Amy Burman during a visit to the hall where Burman was a coach, became a force.
She hasn’t lost a single absolute championship since the summer of 2013 — a streak of luck that has to go on as long as Bills wants.
Despite the fact that Mustafina got a small advantage with the help of two spins, it was a mirage.
The gymnastics bar and free exercise—where Bailes defends the title of world champion—are at the back.
She again went ahead with 15,433 on the bar and finished with 15,933 on the floor.
Riceman softly embraced her while they waited for the final countdown — a pure formality — and tears appeared around a brilliant red with white and blue eyeliner for the Bills, when the plan that she once recorded in the cut-out album was realized.
Riceman’s performance was a small spot over the past four years when she shared third place, but lost the Mustafa bronze on the tiebreaker.
This time the 22-year-old captain of the team, which the Americans call "grandmother" was far ahead.
She sent kisses to the crowd after her free exercise covered with a return, which sometimes seemed to be in question.
As for Bills, the 19-year-old viral tweet from the beginning of this week now has a whole new meaning:
Police: 3 victims in serial killer case shot while listening to music in car <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Two women and a 12-year-old girl who died during the deadliest attack on the first serial killer of the Phoenix in the last decade were sitting in a car, talking and listening to music when they were shot, according to police reports, published in the paper.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stephanie R. Ellis and Ellis’ daughter Malia were shot dead on June 12 when their car was parked on the sidewalk, authorities said.
The perpetrator fired about eight shots from the gun, standing on the passenger side of the car, after which he hid in another vehicle, the report said.
Police say the triple murder is apparently not the result of the robbery, as the perpetrator did not take the wallet or $2,900 at the disposal of one of the adult victims.
A Phoenix police spokesman, Sergeant Jonathan Howard, said the shooting prompted investigators to check whether it was related to the four previous attacks.
A total of seven people were killed and two others injured as a result of nine attacks in two predominantly Latin American areas over a period of four months.
“This is happening in a residential area in front of the house,” Howard KPHO, a CBS affiliate, said earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to have used several vehicles, including a brown Nissan in the late 1990s, a black BMW in the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators refused to reveal the evidence that led them to conclude that the attacks were linked to each other and were carried out by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized with injuries and later died.
Liner, 31, and his daughter Ellis, Malia, were killed on the spot.
The witness told the police that there was nothing unusual about them sitting in a parked car listening to music.
Authorities have also published a police report on the shelling, which was targeted by an empty pickup truck half an hour before the triple murder, and which is believed to have been the case of a serial killer.
Investigators found the shells and pulled the bullet from the seat and the bullet fragments from the engine compartment.
Mother of 6-Year-Old Child with Microcephaly: "Become Better"
Like most six-year-olds, Edmund Pixivto loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But unlike most of his peers, Edmund’s microcephaly is the result of a genetic disorder his mother Elizabeth Pixivto didn’t know about during pregnancy.
When he first came home, my first thought was that I couldn’t do it.
I can't do that.
I didn't sign it.
Which, in fact, isn’t true – of course you’re signing up for it,” she said.
She and her husband Vincent were told that Edmund might never recognize them and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be placed in a specialized medical facility.
“My first response was, ‘I didn’t think people were still doing that,’” she explained.
Edmund walks with the help of walkers.
Edmund didn’t sit and sneeze until he was three, and he still doesn’t speak.
But he is slowly going through some stages.
He walks with a stranger and rides a bicycle.
He also loves to play with his two brothers and sing.
Elizabeth shows the gesture that Edmund devised for "please sing to me."
“We’re teaching him the language of gestures,” Picxitto told CBS News.
But it’s not just the usual language of gestures — she says Edmund invented his own gestures.
Microcephaly can occur due to a number of different conditions: genetic, such as in Edmund, infections during pregnancy from viruses such as measles and Zika.
Symptoms and prognosis may vary significantly.
It is still too early to talk about how it will affect the lives of those infected with the Zika virus.
Pixivto recalls emotional losses due to an uncertain future.
Did I always say what would happen?
What's going to happen?
And she still doesn't know.
I haven’t actually asked for a lifetime forecast because I’m not waiting for someone to really tell me.
But Pixivto has a promising advice for mothers of children with congenital defects because of Zika.
It's getting better.
You know that everything will be better for you.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Heavy Rain, Flooding Causes Rescue Work in Louisiana, Mississippi <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Heavy rains and large-scale flooding in Louisiana have forced the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday, with even more rains expected to fall over the state by Saturday inclusive.
Numerous rivers in southeastern Louisiana and southern Mississippi have come off the coast and are threatening large-scale flooding following extreme rainfall, the National Meteorological Service said.
Louisiana Governor John Bell Edwards said state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and assistance has already gone out to the affected arrivals.
Mike Stile, the representative of the Office of the Governor of National Security and Emergency Preparedness, said that requests for transportation for high water, boats and sandbags are being received.
Stil said that only the arrival of Tangipahoa asked for tens of thousands of bags of sand.
The threat of flooding remains in place until Saturday in most of southern Louisiana.
The meteorological service said in a statement that an additional 3-5 inches could inflate the area.
In southern Alabama, the task force in anticipation of the flood was active until Friday, as rain continued to flow in the area of Mobilah.
The Komit River near Baton Rouge and the Amit River near Springs Day, both in Louisiana, were projected to set a record flooding level over the past weekend.
Synoptic Alec Krautmann said both rivers could have flooded many houses in suburban areas near Baton Rouge.
He also said that flooding downstream in the Assenshen peninsula is a threat, as these inflated rivers will slowly flow into Lake Morpa.
The Ticfo River, just south of the Mississippi border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest level ever recorded at 9 a.m. on Friday.
Rescuers were still pulling people out of the floods in the Ammit and Wilkinson counties in southwestern Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and nephew were among those rescued early on Friday near Gloucester.
Hansford, 62, says the Beaver Creek waters, which are usually more than 400 feet from his home, rose rapidly overnight.
He said another son-in-law, who lives nearby, warned him.
“We woke up, and the water kept coming,” Hansford said.
She reached the level of my belt.
His wife told Hansford that it was the largest influx she had seen in 48 years that she lived here.
Hansford said he and all his family members had a disability, and he was the only one who could swim.
Hansford said rescue workers had rescued all three with the help of an army truck and brought them to a fire station in Gloucester, where they were sheltered on Friday.
Krautmann says the flooding is "rapidly spreading" as rains continue, noting that officials are considering an evacuation order.
Krautmann says one observer near Livingstone reported 13.75 inches of rain falling from midnight to the morning of Friday.
Krautmann said the soil was saturated with rainfall from Wednesday.
Heavy rains and flooding of streets have led to work to rescue residents from homes in the outskirts of Tangipahoa and to cancel classes in five school districts, authorities say.
WWL, a branch of CBS, reports that Tanjipahoa’s advisor told about 200 flooded homes.
The residents were evacuated to two churches, but they are both now flooding.
President Robbie Miller said the authorities had rescued 72 people and seven pets who were in the high water.
The shelters were opened in the city of Amrit and the city of Hammond to accommodate those who had been evacuated.
“They will have the opportunity to return home as soon as the water starts to recede,” he said.
In the town of Hammond of Tangipahoa, about two dozen streets were closed due to high water levels, and sandbags were available to give away to residents in the hope that they would keep the water away from homes and businesses.
“The last major flood that we had was in March,” City Manager Lacey Landrum said in a statement.
It is on the way to becoming a similar event.
In Mississippi, Harrison County, the head of the Emergency Service, Rupert Lacey, said heavy rains continued to run off the Gulf of Mexico.
According to him, several houses were registered as flooded on Thursday, but none were registered on Friday.
Kate Towson, manager of Shopper Value Foods in Amyit, has lived in the area for 40 years.
“I’ve seen water in places I’ve never seen before,” said Tauson, “and it’s still flying on the ground.”
Mah<0xC4><0x81>j Brown, 6, "Balled", Remains Alive After Philadelphia Shooting
Police say a 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, registering a second shot in a 6-year-old in the city this week.
Grandma and grandpa identified him for CBS Philadelphia as Mah<0xC4><0x81>j Brown.
Grandma and grandfather say Brown had numerous gunshot wounds, including his odor, leg, arm, and abdomen, but was conscious when he was taken to the hospital.
“He got very hard, his little body was fired by bullets,” his grandmother Delores Melendez told the station.
I just can't believe it.
The boy is hospitalized in critical condition and has undergone several surgeries.
The family told the station that it was expected that he would be fine.
He had to go to the first grade at the local primary school.
Brown was one of four people who were shot in the Germantown neighborhood.
Three men were also shot: two 29-year-olds and one 32-year-old.
One of the 29-year-old men is reportedly in critical condition; two other victims have been recorded in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The child was found shot in the front seat of the car next to the 29-year-old in critical condition, the station reports.
Two other victims were not in the car, and police are investigating whether any of the injured men could have been shot.
Investigators report to CBS Philadelphia that there appears to have been a shootout between several armed men.
Weapons of semi-automatic weapons, attributed to various examples of semi-automatic weapons, have exhausted the place of action.
It seems to have been a long battle.
There were shells on the street, on both sides of the sidewalk.
Therefore, it appears that there were several armed fighters there and they were actively involved in the shooting,” said Philadelphia Police Captain Anthony Ginaldi.
Many homes and cars in the area have also been hit.
No arrests have been made, and the police are reportedly watching the surveillance cameras.
Another 6-year-old boy, a girl, was hit in the hand by a handball on Tuesday as she was playing in front of her home in the West Oak Lane area.
She is recovering, and the police are still looking for the suspect.
Why We Need Simon, Gabby, and Lori
This is what I call the women’s Olympic gymnastics team this year and for several reasons.
First, I’ve been at every Summer Olympics since 1984, and the United States has never been so dominant.
And secondly, there are three gymnasts in this team: Simona Bails, Gabby Douglas, and Lauren "Larry" Hernandez, who have already inspired so many white girls.
The composition of this team, complemented by Eli Reisman, who is Jewish, and Madison Koshan, who is Catholic, makes everyone proud.
This team, at last, looks like America.
It also reinforced the black and Latin American female presence at the top of this sport.
For the past four years, female gymnast number one has been an African-American.
Last year, Simon and Gabby were No.1 and No.2.
That's powerful.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was an unexpected Olympic champion, and America welcomed him with a warm welcome.
Now the world could have witnessed the incredible performances of the three-time World Champion Simona Bailes, Douglas and Lori Hernandez performing unexpected, yet virtuosic gymnastic exercises.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American in a row to win gold in the women’s individual absolute championship.
And teammate Ali Reisman earned a silver medal.
We are witnessing the peak of this sport, but it doesn’t look like that in gymnastics sections all over the country.
Simon, Gabby and Lori all chose the same path as Eli and Madison to form the Olympic team.
They are the "final five" because the next Olympic gymnastics team will have only four gymnasts on the team, and this is the final year of Martha Carolie's coaching.
But in reality gymnastics is an expensive sport, and gymnasts are first trained in private gymnastics clubs, supported with the help of parents, paying the cost of education, equipment, travel and training, form, contributions for participation in competitions, payouts.
Most of these gymnastics clubs are located in rich suburban areas that can support this business.
These clubs are located where gymnasts get everything from their workouts, and it is an expensive and long-term duty for families of gymnasts.
Amy Burman, coach of Simona Bails, and Maggie Hanni, coach of Lori Hernandez, have both been coaching their athletes since they took on gymnastics.
We need to create more affordable and affordable gymnastics education for communities of countless young girls inspired by Simon, Gabby and Laurie.
I founded my gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.
In my organizations, we have already provided free and inexpensive gymnastics classes in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban youngsters (mostly black and Latino) and have raised national and international champions.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to provide high-quality gymnastics to young people that deserves the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body, as well as resistance to exhausting work, discipline and persistence for the mind.
This combination has a life-long positive impact on good health, success at school and at work.
It is the inspiration of this team that will send thousands of girls to do gymnastics, and this is great.
Playing sports is so important, especially for girls.
It's such a wonderful time.
Thank you, Simon, Ali, Lori, Gabby and Madison for this serious demonstration of the Women’s Force to win team Olympic gold and for motivating so many girls of different backgrounds to be healthy, strong and successful young women.
Younger doctors take on further strikes after rejection of Jeremy Hunt’s offer
Ministers hoped to end the dispute over the changes by agreeing a revised agreement with the leaders of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37,000 young doctors who participated in the vote rejected it.
In July, Hunt announced plans to introduce the deal, saying the NHS was on "no-land" and any subsequent delay would harm staff and patients.
The first junior doctors have been transferred to a new contract, which includes changes in work activities at night and on weekends to improve out-of-hours service.
Dr. Ellen McCott, chairman of the BMA’s Young Physicians Committee, said in a statement last night: “Young doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it will fuel the existing labor crisis and that it cannot be applied.”
There are only eight weeks left before the first group of doctors will be transferred to a new contract, progress is needed, and time to finish.
The WMA’s attempt to resolve the dispute through negotiations was met with a reluctance to take action and sometimes with complete silence on the part of the government.
And it's despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month that his door is always open.
“Jeremy Hunt needs to act now, encourage the introduction and respond to the concerns of younger doctors.
If he does not, then the younger doctors are unequivocal in that they are ready to organize subsequent strikes.
The latest strike at the end of April put off some 13,000 scheduled surgeries and 100,000 nurse appointments, while nurses and consultants were drawn to ensure the replacement of doctors on the picket line.
The ministers hoped to end the dispute over the changes by agreeing an amended agreement with the leaders of the British Medical Association.
The WMA wants a better weekend payment for the 54,000 younger doctors who will fall under the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, CEO of NHS Employers, called on younger doctors not to continue the strike.
Mortimer said: “The strikes achieve little or nothing, but put pressure on teams and services that are already on the line, and cause anxiety, physical pain and disturbance to patients, sitters and their families.”
Over the past two months, we have spoken with the Committee of Young Physicians and, together with the Department of Health and others, have responded positively to their concerns regarding the role of caregivers and corporate information policy.
Workers were hoping that there would be a continuing positive contribution to Health in other important topics - such as staff distribution, flexibility of training, additional training for those who return after a break in career, cost of training, mutual recognition of the curriculum, and academic.
The drug for <0xC2><0xA3>2 a day can reduce the risk of a heart attack
Thousands of patients with a heart attack are going to take the drug for <0xC2><0xA3>2 a day, after authorities have recommended giving it to more people for a longer period of time.
The anticoagulant drug ticagrelor reduces the risk of recurrent attacks for people with heart disease.
The drug is already prescribed 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of a stroke or a new attack.
The NICE National Health Service’s oversight service advised people to give it for four years to continue to rule out the risk of cardiovascular problems.
However, the NICE National Health Service (NHS) has now recommended giving it to people for four years to continue to rule out the risk of cardiovascular problems.
A heart attack occurs in about 140,000 people in England each year, and a quarter of them have another attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes occur as a result of the accumulation of fat on the walls of the arteries and the formation of plaques.
If the plaque is broken in pieces, it can cause a thrombosis that blocks blood access to the heart and causes a heart attack.
And if the thrombus moves, it will be able to move through the bloodstream and block the blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already suffered one attack are at greater risk of getting another.
Ticagrelor, produced by the British company AstraZeneca and sold under the name Brilique, reduces the risk, making thrombosis less likely.
The NICE Instructional Project, published today, recommends that people be given 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months, then 60 mg of aspirin twice a day for the next three years.
Professor Carol Longson, director of the NICE Center for the Evaluation of Medical Technologies, said: “Despite the availability of effective secondary prevention methods, about a quarter of people who have already had a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke.”
Fear of repetition can have a significant negative impact on a person’s quality of life.
There is evidence that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing the risk of subsequent heart attacks and strokes in people who have already suffered a heart attack.
Pre-recommended Ticagrelor, we are pleased to be able to increase the treatment options available to many thousands of people who are ready to use it.
Because the information on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited after three years, the draft instructions do not recommend treatment longer than this period.
The culture of ownership of the PC allows to thrive the falsification of the counting of votes in Muslim areas
Ex-Mayor of Tower Hamlet Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year due to corruption, serving as a push for the government’s report.
The culture of political correctness has led to the closing of the eyes, which has turned into a widespread falsification of the counting of votes in Muslim communities, according to the government’s devastating report released today.
Former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles has been slammed with criticism of the police, election observers and city administration for ignoring evidence of election violations due to "excessive sensitivities regarding racial and religious affiliation."
The former secretary of local communities, now an anti-corruption tsar, said the intimidation of voters on religious grounds was so strong that police needed to be allowed to put borders outside the polling stations to protect the intimidated voters.
He proposes that voters take identity cards to prove who they are when they vote.
At the moment, voters only need to state their name and address.
The report even suggests applying non-washable inks to people’s fingers when they give up their ballots, in order to exclude someone from voting twice.
“We need to provide better protection to informants,” said Sir Eric.
It called on the press to have greater access to local council documents and decisions taken by informal committees or working groups.
“This is done not only to protect against election fraud, but also to protect the local government from a more open culture of corruption and financial fraud going hand-in-hand,” he said.
The report was ordered downing street following a scandal with a vote in Tower Hamlet in East London.
Last year, a special court dealing with election issues ruled that the current mayor, Luftur Rahman, had to be removed from office due to a long list of corruption and illegal activities.
The court found that Rahman "cynicically distorted" the religious sentiments of his Muslim community and silenced his critics, accusing them of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman, as it was said, "held his campaign based on the fact that it was the duty of believers to vote for him."
Up to 300 votes cast doubt or were the result of a characterization when a person casts a vote representing someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud all over the country.
He voiced particular concerns about fraudulent mail voting, in which senior members of the Muslim community reportedly put pressure on people to vote for the candidate they had chosen.
Sir Eric, in the photo, made a few recommendations on how to clean up the voting system, including the requirement to bring your identity card to prove who you are.
In his report, he said: "There was evidence of pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, in particular women and youth, to vote for seniors, especially in communities of Pakistani and Bangladeshi descent.
“There have been concerns that ... public institutions have closed their eyes to such behavior because of the excessive sensitivity of ‘political correctness’ regarding ethnicity and religion.”
Cheese Eric gave 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including removing political activists from working with ballot papers to stop the “harvesting of votes.”
The report, under consideration by Theresa May, also calls for tightened registration checks to prevent the use of voter lists for immigration fraud and privileges.
The option is considered to require voters to present an identity card before the vote.
Use non-washable inks on people’s fingers as soon as they drop their ballot to prevent anyone from voting twice.
Conduct systematic checks of people’s nationality to ensure that they have the right to vote.
Introduce a three-year restriction on applications for automatic mail voting.
Eliminate political campaigners and activists from working with full ballots and envelopes with postal ballots.
To give the police the authority to set the boundaries around the constituencies.
To amend the law to facilitate the prosecution of intimidation by people according to the Presentation of the People's Act 1983.
It is illegal to take photographs at polling stations.
To make a requirement that only English be used in electoral districts (except Wales).
Strengthen the training to ensure that the staff forces the voters to go to the booth on their own.
Sir Eric is furiously attacking the city police, stating that it is "astonishing" that no criminal charges have been brought after the Tower Hamlet case.
“The court, which examines election issues, disqualified Lutfur Rahman and his agent for a long list of corrupt and illegal actions,” he said.
He was found guilty in the absence of reasonable doubt — the criminal standard of evidence — for a number of reasons.
He also criticizes the unsuccessful "checks for the sake of the halo" of the electoral registration departments of the city administrations.
Sir Eric said: “Last year’s court order in Tower Hamlet was a wake-up call.
Our nation has a proud legacy as the mother of parliamentary elections, and yet the alarming and covert spread of electoral fraud and the state of denial by some bodies threaten this good reputation.
Crazy about the bike analogue of Kate and other celebrity doubles of the Olympics in Rio
Fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio this week went crazy about the French cyclist Pauline Ferran-Prevo, who turned out to be impressively similar to the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympic athlete is by no means the only athlete fighting for gold this summer, who can boast of her own famous double, at least according to social media reports.
So, in honor of the Rio Games and all the celebrities appearing on our screens at the moment, FEMAIL has compiled a list of Olympians that have more than a superficial resemblance to Hollywood stars.
Hunter and wolf: Brady Allison, a member of the U.S. men's archers team, on the left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child
In addition to the twin Kate on the bike path, many people online rushed to point out how a certain rainbow could be the twin of superstar Leonardo DiCaprio.
A member of the U.S. men's archers team, Brady Allison, was the cause of the hurricane on Twitter after images of him, which looked terrifyingly like a Wolf star from Wall Street, appeared.
And in fact, the archer learned about the madness of social networks and admitted that he had heard that he looked like Leo since he was a child.
“I personally don’t see a huge similarity, perhaps with the exception of vegetation on the face,” said Brady Huffington Post.
"He's an attractive guy, so I think it's a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons from London 2012 will undoubtedly point to even more this year: the striking similarity between British jumper Greg Razerford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Alia Mustafina, with her big expressive eyes, is said to be an exact copy of Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the pool of South African swimmer Cameron Van der Burg has been compared to the star of the Horus Matthew Morrison for many years.
Moving on to the more unexpected: This user believes that Nathan is the "sports version" of the actor "The Beginning"
Another long-standing comparison was between tennis player Rafael Nadar and actor Josh Harnett, who can boast of similar heavy eyebrows and lips.
Silver medalist swimmer from Russia Yulia Efimov can boast not only the same burnt skin and light hair as actress AnnaLynn McCord, while Nathan Adrian from the US team, according to fans, resembles "a sports version of Gossip.
Raw Women: Football star Hope Solo, left, and actress Jennifer Carpenter from Dexter, right, have the same face and eye shapes
Not the only one: One Twitter user was very happy that others also saw similarities
Creating the theory: According to this user, there may be a reason underlying the similar appearance of this pair
One Twitter user recently turned to the site to publicize his enthusiasm that “the rest of the Internet thinks Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical.”
In fact, the U.S. football star and actress Dexter have incredibly similar face and eye shapes.
Other popular comparisons included Carrie Walsh Jennings and her smile, which is close to the identical smile of actress Laura Lynney, as well as a gold medal-winning gymnast, Gabby Douglas, who can boast of her own beautiful broad smile.
The commentator of the Olympics at CBC apologizes for saying about the Chinese swimmer "died like a pig"
Byron McDonald's analysis of fourth place in the finish of 14-year-old Ay Yanhan on a women's freestyle relay 4x200 m upset CBC viewers on Wednesday in a live broadcast of the Olympics
Canadian broadcaster CBC was forced to apologise after one of its commentators said a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer “started up like an odour” and “died like a pig” during a flood.
Commentator Byron McDonald thought his microphone was turned off when he began to express his own opinion at the end of the final women's relay 4x200m freestyle.
It was possible to hear how McDonald, who was drawn to the CBC commentator team to “dilute it with color,” said: “This 14-year-old Chinese woman dropped the ball, baby.”
Too excited, started like a scent, died like a pig.
Thank you for that.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanghan, who is 14, missed the second stage of the relay for 1:57.79 — 1.61 seconds slower than Canadian Taylor Cancer, allowing Canadians to eliminate the backlash from China.
Viewers across Canada reacted quickly on the net after being shocked by the tone and the expressions used.
Emmett McFarlane tweeted: “Does the CBC speaker just say that a 14-year-old swimmer from China ‘died like a pig’???
This idiot didn't realize they were still on the air."
About Ai Yanhan from China in the final of the women's relay 4x200 m freestyle said: "This little 14-year-old Chinese girl dropped the ball, baby."
Criticism on Twitter immediately fell on Byron MacDonald, with many calling for him to be fired.
Twitter users did not hesitate when they heard how insensitive Byron MacDonald was.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: “Nothing to herself <0x23>ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and make us look like a bunch of racists. <0x23>disgusted.
Shortly thereafter, Scott Russell, who led the CBC broadcast, apologised live for MacDonald's comment, saying: "We apologize for the comment about the swim performance being aired."
It was an unsuccessful choice of words, we're sorry that it happened."
The IOC concluded by apologizing to more than 90 people who tweeted in response to the statement.
A friend of commentator Scott Russell had to apologise on behalf of McDonald
CBC then copied and apologised to more than 90 other Twitter users who complained about McDonald’s comments.
The television also hastened to apologize and publish the statement.
We sincerely regret that these statements were made and that they were allowed to air.
“Last night we acted swiftly to apologize to our live viewers and our subscribers on social media.
Let’s be clear, Byron’s comments were about the swimmer’s performance, not her as an individual.
And yet it was an inappropriate and unsuccessful choice of words, and Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized live and tried to clarify his comment, saying he did not think his words would be interpreted as an attack on an individual.
"I would like to take the moment to apologize for the comment I made last night after the women's relay," he said on CBC's Olympic Games broadcast.
“I was talking about a swimmer’s performance, not her in person.”
'Of course, it wasn't any disrespect, and I'm very sorry.'
Primark buyer insulted a woman who shamelessly sampled underwear in the middle of the store
Buyers didn’t know where to take a look when some woman was naked to sample panties, on the ground floor with shops in the middle of Primark.
Worse still, she used the way she looked in them, bolted them and put them back on the shelf.
She continued the search and eventually moved four pairs of underwear into the store at the Bouverie Place shopping mall in Folkstone.
Primark store at Bouverie Place in Folkstone, where a woman sampled knitted panties before putting them back on the shelf
The mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was in the store at the time, said that after a sample of underwear, the mysterious woman "would again dress and leave the store without buying anything."
She said, "People couldn't believe what they saw."
Standing in the middle of the hall, she took a pair of panties from the showcase, took off her own panties and panties and put them on.
“She wasn’t trying to find a modest place to do it — she was just standing there shamelessly.”
“Everyone got tired when she took off her panties again, and she clearly didn’t like them because she put them back on the shelf.”
She did the same with the other three couples before she finally decided that there was nothing here that she would like, dressed again and went out.
“She didn’t seem to care who was watching her, or that she was thinking about the man who eventually bought those panties that she modeled.”
The 33-year-old Jenny Davidson of Kent said: “How disgusting to think that someone is going to take home panties that someone else has already worn and they haven’t been worn.”
The incident took place on Tuesday afternoon.
Davidson added: “I’m inferring that the staff, apparently, tried to remove these items of clothing from the sale after she left — well, the better.”
"I wouldn't want to come home with a new pair of women's panties and find out that another woman dressed and took them off and they weren't posted."
A spokesperson for Primark said: “Primark is aware of the incident that occurred at our store in Folkstone on Tuesday, August 9.
All the goods in question have been withdrawn from the sale.
How to Protect Yourself from Gun Attacks Using Cow-Magic
The world around you is dangerous, but this video from Dailymail.com might help make it a little safer for you.
We spoke with Ron Mizrachi, a Master of the Cow-Magic Federation in New York, to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close range.
Whether they come to you in front of or behind, this video will show you how to beat a robber with his own weapon.
If they come from behind, according to Miracles, the first thing to do is to turn around so that you see the attacker and ‘liberate the line of fire’.
Then you tightly squeeze the gun between your forearm and shoulder before hitting them in the face with a free elbow.
Then follow the knee in the stench, and while the attacker bends from the pain, you twist the gun out of his hands, punch him in the face with a gun and go back, holding the gun pointed at him.
For the armed, fit front, the way to perform is similar - remove your body from the line of fire, quickly grab the gun and twist it so that the villain can not shoot.
At the same time, move the weight on the gun and hit the attacker with a fist in the chest, then pull the gun out of his grip before going back and aim at it.
Sounds complicated?
Watch the video to see exactly what the Mirrors are doing.
But remember that the safest way out of any robbery — if you’re not a master of cow magic — is to give away your cash.
For the guide, the traveler Jan Wright spends his language in the dirtiest places in Europe
A British traveler has put his immune system and vomiting reflexes to the test, licking some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.
Leading and author of travel books, Jan Wright, 51, from Suffolk, spent the language on the euro banknote, Circus Piccadilly’s perils, a washbasin button on the train and a Russian public telephone to prove the strength of his immune system.
Before licking each object, he used a luminaire to show himself and us what it goes into.
But the experiment, which is set to become a film called “Lisbon’s Traveler’s Guide to Inner Power,” gave some astonishing results.
The idea of licking the wash button on a train used by thousands of others can be extremely disgusting, but there are actually worse bacteria in the kitchen sink.
Throughout his trip to Europe, Wright talked to doctors and health professionals about the increase in intestinal bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, nothing of the licked brought him more than a bad taste in his mouth.
Wright became famous for testing the strength of his gut, traveling around the world and eating strange and amazing things.
From the public railroads at the stations to the toilet wash button, this task undoubtedly tested its immune system.
In the film he shot, he said, ‘From childhood I was completely careless about my health and I pulled a lot of different things out of the ground eating worms and dirty water.’
He certainly proved his reputation during the course of the film.
The only thing he refused to do was the dirty Russian public toilet.
Its test slurry demonstrated the value of a luminaire exceeding 4,000 units.
For comparison: just washed hands should be within 60.
But there was one Russian public toilet that he refused to lick after his luminaire value was more than 4,000 units, while just washed hands showed less than 60
Wright and the Finnish dairy producer Valio filmed a film about a traveller called “Lisbon’s Traveler’s Guide to Inner Power,” which demonstrates the number of bacteria in different places, such as the toilet.
In the film, he said, “It’s close to one of the worst things I smelled in the toilet.”
There's nothing dirtyer than that!
I'm not gonna lick anything because it's disgusting.
The "Lissabon Traveler's Guide to Inner Power" was filmed together with the Finnish dairy producer Valio.
The company provided Wright Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria, as well as vitamins C and D, to help accelerate the growth of human gut bacteria and develop the immune system.
Valio Senior Vice President for Snacks, Juices and New Categories, Niko Vuorenmaa, said: “We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
What would be interesting to see and at the same time could explain the benefits of probiotics.
We had a brainstorm that ended with the idea, "Let's call Jan."
They claim that interest in the health of the intestines is becoming a global phenomenon
Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to put them in a larger context: good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health, and how it is related to the immune system.
The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon, and with this documentary we were able to present consumers with more information about it in an interesting form.
I also think the movie shows that we have a good sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who was the director of the film, added: “Let’s say I would lose respect for Jan if he licked some of the things I asked for, such as the disgusting Russian toilet that is shown in the film.”
Of course, some of Janu’s things were easier to lick, and some were pretty hard.
I’m glad that some of these licks were filmed.”
In a 2015 Valio survey, 84 percent of respondents linked lactic acid bacteria exclusively to a good condition of the stomach and intestines, and 58 percent said they consume, at least occasionally, bacon products containing added acidic acid.
The family of hooligans destroyed Saltash, Cornwall municipal house, on the eve of eviction
A family of hooligans left their municipal home with <0xC2><0xA3>50,000 in losses after they were evicted for intimidating their neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner, Sean Trebilcock, were kicked out of their property in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long list of complaints against them.
After they were forcibly evicted from the property, shocked officials of housing and construction cooperatives found the property in a condition that required repairs.
The walls were left with glittering holes, the halves were opened, the garbage was scattered on the floor, and the walls were packed with graffiti.
The family is now relocated and is supposed to live in a private apartment.
Donna McEvoy, a settler at Cornwall Housing, said she was afraid she would not save him.
She said, ‘It was an absolute nightmare for people here, and I don’t think people should live that way.
There are a lot of things that need to be weighed because this property is likely to be known as a not very good aspect of Cornwall.
This family has a bad reputation, and their name has a bad reputation.
The couple have three sons who have lived in the property from time to time, and the police report that the kingdom of horror caused by the family included fighting in the street with baseball bats, intimidating residents through riots in nearby areas, drug use, sex trafficking, and screaming drugs.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, received an order for antisocial behavior in June.
In several rooms of the house, which can be removed, found old garbage
The floor boards in the house, where drugs were sold in the past, were removed
Neighbors say they saw fighting on the street and called the police regularly
Cornwall Housing forced her and her partner out of the house this week after being granted an extended period of 11 weeks for a voluntary departure.
The eviction was greeted with relief by neighbors who said that their lives had been turned into an actual hell.
One said, “They didn’t care about anyone.”
We’ve been with them for 20 years, and it’s always been bad.
The number of times we saw the police here is unbelievable.
"We couldn't sleep this morning."
We got up because it was so quiet here - we're not used to it!
Now that they're finally gone, everything will be fine.
Adam Fitzpatrick, the head of the Cornwall Housing Neighbourhood Welfare Group, said the family was unable to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, with the police, and then regularly called the police
Waste and old toys were scattered below the crowded side of the municipal house
He added: “It’s a shame that the tenant was unable to accept any responsibility for her and her family’s behavior, as eviction is always the last method of action Cornwall Housing considers.
It was a very difficult case, as the behavior was extreme, and their actions must have been horrifying to its observer neighbors.
I appreciate all the work that my team, the police, and the Devon and Cornwall community have done to give us information.
I hope that this development will give some comfort to the neighbours and send a signal that social behavior will not be allowed.
Fitzpatrick reported that all three sons lived in the house at different times, but said they were all a little over 20 at the time.
Dirty mattress left on the floor in one of the bedrooms of the house after eviction
Resettlement workers will now have to remove the rubbish breasts that surround the house
In 2014, police searched the house and found more than 70 g of hemp, as well as weights corresponding to belongings and <0xC2><0xA3>1,700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined after pleading guilty to possession of Class B drugs for the purpose of delivery.
She said the money went to pay the grave for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After being made homeless, there is information that Tanya and her partner now live in Plymouth.
The walls of many rooms of the house were filled with graffiti all over the surface.
Police say they will try to evict tenants who are not subject to the rules of renting the premises
Angela Crowe, of the Devon and Cornwall police, said the eviction sent a clear warning to other tenants who continue to violate the rules.
“This is a message for those who feel that they can behave without the accusations of the prosecutor, as well as those who are harmed by such behavior,” she said.
Criminal and antisocial behavior will never be tolerated by the Devon and Cornwall police, who will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal came in horror when a low-flying military plane barely touched the beach
In the city of Aveiro, Portugal, tourists who love to sunbathe in the sun were terrified for their lives
The P-3C Orion aircraft of the Portuguese Air Force flew incredibly low.
The Air Force has reported that it carried out a training flight, but insisted that there is no risk to safety.
This is the moment when scared tourists start to panic, while the moment when a low-flying plane spun over an overcrowded beach.
The dramatic footage shows a military plane flying almost at a distance from the hunters on the sand strip in Aveyro, northern Portugal.
The resters jumped on their feet as soon as they became for obvious reasons concerned by the noise of the aircraft’s engines, but not being able to see what was moving in their direction through the clouds.
The incident took place last night near the town of Aveiro in Costa Nova.
Daniel Fernandez, one of several vacationers who posted a video of the shocking flight on social media, said: “He flew quite low twice, and there was a moment at some point it seemed that he was going to break up.”
Nono Arroja added: “I was surfing and I swear there was such a feeling that the plane would fall on me.”
Tourists on the beach of Aveiro were horrified when the plane appeared from the fog and flew to an extremely low altitude
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft performed a training flight to detect fishing vessels off the coast, and was forced to descend so low as it was the only way to check them.
The pilot said the plane had flown slightly lower than usual due to insufficient visibility caused by smoke from nearby burning forests, but the air force insisted that no one was in danger.
This summer, forest fires damaged the mainland of Portugal, and also killed four people on the island of Madeira.
Portugal’s air force said today that the pilot had to fly so low due to the circumstances — dense fog and smog from forest fires, which deteriorated visibility.
The plane carried out a training flight, and the pilot was instructed to detect fishing boats as part of the mission.
The HASSP system has been mandatory for public consumption for more than a year, but most cafes and restaurants in St. Petersburg have not yet implemented it.
Checks are becoming more active, and the business is threatened with fines of up to 1 million rubles.
For more than a year, the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) system - risk analysis and critical control points - is mandatory for use by food manufacturers and carriers, as well as companies in the public sector in Russia.
Business checks by Rospotrebnadzor on compliance with these rules in St. Petersburg began in February 2015.
But for now, officials are issuing fines only for individual violations of the regulations (see "List of documents"...).
Failure to comply with the regulation in general will cost the enterprise 600,000 rubles for the first violation and 1 million rubles for the second.
HASPs were invented in the U.S. in the 1960s as a system that takes into account and prevents risks when working with food.
Then it was about the safety of food for astronauts.
Today, the system is used in all food businesses not only in the US, but also in Canada, and in the European Union.
Since February 2015, HASP is in operation in the territory of TS.
For the development and implementation of the system, the business had 4 years (the requirement of HASP appeared in the technical regulation of the TS in 2011).
However, the entrepreneurs themselves and officials admit that most companies have not even heard of this norm.
Unfortunately, we have long been convinced that the norm applies only to food production, not to restaurateurs, - explained the head of the Public Council Elena Tsereteli.
Now everyone is trying to make up for what is missing.
The expected deadline for the resumption of charter flights to Turkey is the end of August - the beginning of September.
But they will not cause a hectic demand, as their target audience - families with children - is already preparing for school, experts note.
The Alliance of Travel Agencies yesterday sent a letter to the government asking to allow charters now.
"For many Russian tourists, the issue of choosing a quality and affordable sea holiday is insoluble, because in the resorts of Krasnodar region and the Republic of Crimea, most of the accommodation facilities are already reserved for seafarers by the end of September", - note the authors of the letter and signature.
As reported in the North-Western regional branch of the Russian Tourism Industry Union (RST), in case the aviation authorities of Russia and Turkey agree quickly, the resumption of charter flights to Turkey can be expected within a month.
A clear understanding of when charters will be resumed as of yet, it depends first of all on the aviation authorities.
Technically, the aircraft can fly in September, even in August, if the tour operators quickly build programs and agree with the airlines on the necessary directions on board," says Pavel Rumyantsev, Deputy Director of Communications and International Projects of the North-Western Regional Branch.
According to him, the possible resumption of charters is good news, but not too much will affect the placement of forces in the market, because the main buyers of charter tours - families with children - have already returned from vacation and are preparing for school or spending holidays in other countries.
In the lush season, tours are bought mainly by single travelers and couples.
Charter programs can count on those who have the opportunity to rest spontaneously,” says Pavel Rumyantsev.
"Turkey has a chance to attract a lot of tourists if it now gives very budget offers - 50-60 thousand rubles for a tour for two, because there are people who are deliberately waiting for very cheap tours," says Valeria Rosental, CEO of the travel agency Optio-Travel.
Otherwise, it is definitely not worth counting on excitement - the main mass of travel is already planned.
Pavel Rumyantsev also believes that since there is a demand for regular flights to Turkey, charters will also be in demand, but ajyotaja is not worth waiting.
“For Turkey, launching charters now is a rehearsal of the next season,” says Pavel Rumyantsev.
"The opening of charters in Turkey is positive news for the next season," said Valeria Rubtsova.
The Tax Code provides for the exemption from the VAT of compensation payments established by law within the established norms related to the compensation of damage caused by injury or other damage to health.
The extradition of milk to workers employed at work with harmful working conditions according to the established norms is provided for in article 222 of the TC of the Russian Federation.
At the same time, the rules and conditions of extradition are established by the order of the Ministry of Health and Development of Russia dated 16.02.2009 No 45n.
According to this document, free delivery of milk or other equivalent foodstuffs is made to workers in the days of actual employment at work with harmful working conditions, due to the presence in the workplace of harmful productive factors.
Based on the above norms, the FNS of Russia in the present letter came to the conclusion that on the basis of paragraph 2, paragraph 3, article 217 of the NK of the Russian Federation are exempt from the taxation of the NDFL of incomes in the form of the value of milk.
The Moscow Gazstroybank was left without a license from the Central Bank.
On Friday, August 12, 2016, the Central Bank of Russia revoked the license to carry out banking operations with the credit organization Shareholder Commercial Bank "GAZSTROYBANK", registered in Moscow.
According to the regulator, GAZSTROYBANK JSC carried out a high-risk credit policy related to the placement of funds in low-quality assets.
Adequate assessment of the risks taken at the request of the supervisory authority and a reliable reflection of the value of the assets of the bank have led to the creation of the credit institution grounds for the implementation of measures to prevent bankruptcy.
In addition, the credit institution has been involved in the conduct of dubious transit operations.
A temporary administration is appointed in the bank for a period of validity until the appointment of a competitive manager or liquidator.
The powers of the executive bodies of the credit organization are suspended in accordance with federal laws.
JSC GAZSTROYBANK is a participant in the deposit insurance system.
Recall that the payment of insurance reimbursement to bank depositors, including individual entrepreneurs, in accordance with Federal Law No. 177-FZ "On insurance of deposits of individuals in the banks of the Russian Federation" is provided in the amount of 100% of the balance of funds, but not more than 1.4 m.
Payments, according to the Deposit Insurance Agency, will start no later than 26 August 2016.
According to the report, according to the amount of assets of JSC GAZSTROYBANK on August 1, 2016, 335 places in the banking system of the Russian Federation.
A London schoolgirl who joined ISIS has died in Syria.
Kadiz Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIS, reportedly died in Syria.
Lawyer Tasnim Akunji said her family learned of her death in Raqqa, Syria, a few weeks ago.
She is believed to have died from a Russian airstrike in Raqqa, a siege of the group in the country, ITV News reported on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old, and according to her family, she died just when she planned to leave the war-torn country and return to England.
"We can only hope that the only advantage of all this - as a graveyard and a testament to others, that these are the risks involved when traveling to a military action zone - is to dissuade people from ever making the same choice," Akundji said.
In February 2015, Sultan and two other schoolgirls from East London boarded a plane to Turkey and then took a bus to the Syrian border.
The Sultan's family said she married an ISIS militant in Syria and became a widow for several months.
Reid says Clinton will remain loyal to Garland as a candidate for the post of Supreme Justice in the event of an election
Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid says he is confident that Hillary Clinton’s Democratic presidential candidate will nominate Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if she is elected as president.
Republicans in the Senate blocked Garland’s assertion, as President Barack Obama nominated him in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says the next president will choose the person who can replace the last Supreme Court judge, Antonin Scalia.
Reid said at a conference call on Thursday that he predicts that Clinton will choose Garland “with some degree of confidence.”
Reed's spokeswoman later said he didn't talk to Clinton directly about whether she was going to raise Harland, and just made assumptions.
He praised Garland and said the Clinton team would not want to "jump the boat" with a new choice.
Garland is the Chief Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
Reid said Republicans who are blocking Garland’s nomination were “applause” and “assistant” to Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He said Trump was not fit for office.
Treats Claims Erotic Calendars for 'Women Just Like Men'
Treats magazine collaborates with photographer David Bellmer to release a 2017 calendar inspired by Pirelli in the 1970s.
But instead of nude celebrities, they set out to find the next generation of top models for their 2017 nude-music calendar.
Treats President Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his magazine with a large number of nude models is different from the old-fashioned Playboy because “Playboy is for men.”
I do it for women.
Obviously, he thinks the calendar is the same.
“We need to go back to a demonstration of an eternal and classic nude figure where women, as well as men, feel comfortable and inspired by these images of the female body,” Shaw said in a press release announcing the calendar.
Women want to be part of this project because it’s a wonderful work of art.
Models can submit photos online or in person at open castings in Los Angeles and New York.
Moscowers will be given memorabilia about dishonest online stores.
In Moscow, they are going to release a memorial that will tell you how not to become a victim of an online store.
This was reported in Rospotrebnadzor, writes M24.
It is reported that the specialists of the department are preparing a monument that will help citizens choose the right online store and identify possible fraudulent schemes.
The concept of this pamphlet includes several sections.
These will be general information and the legal basis, rules of delivery of goods, ways to protect their legitimate rights.
The appendix will give recommendations on how to properly make a claim and so on,” Rospotrebnadzor said.
The memorandum for the moment is being updated.
Subsequently, it will be posted on the website of Rospotrebnadzor in Moscow, it is also planned to release a printed version and distribute to Moscow.
The Russian Foreign Ministry published a statement naming the name of the second suspect in the organization of a diversion in the Crimea.
Detained persons from among the citizens of Ukraine and Russia, who have assisted in the preparation of terrorist acts.
Among them are Panov Evgeny Aleksandrovich and Zachtey Andrey Romanovich.
“They are all giving a thank-you statement,” the statement said.
Previously, Zaporizhzhya region resident Evgeny Panov, who was arrested on suspicion of organizing terrorist attacks in Crimea, admitted his guilt on interrogation.
FAS fines Google 438 million rubles.
The Federal Antimonopoly Service of Russia (FAS) has imposed an administrative fine on Google Corporation in the amount of 438 million rubles, according to the agency's website.
The fine for Google for violating the antitrust law amounted to 438 million rubles.
We hope that the company will comply with our decision and pay a fine in the near future," said Alexey Dotsenko, deputy head of FAS.
In the course of the investigation, FAS found that Google is supplying smartphone manufacturers that are sold in the territory of Russia, the Google Play app store only provided that other apps of the corporation will be installed on the device.
Among these applications is also a search engine, which should be placed on the main screen of the smartphone.
Thus, the corporation violates Art. 1, Art. 10 of the Law on the Protection of Competition (abuse of the dominant position).
We are confident that compliance with the regulation will provide an opportunity for the development of competition in the mobile software market in Russia, which will have a favorable impact on our consumers.
The law “On protection of competition” must be observed by all companies whose products are delivered to the territory of the Russian Federation, and transnational corporations, including,” said Elena Zaeva, Head of the Department of Communications Regulation and Information Technologies of FAS of Russia.
The agency suspects the conspiracy of 16 Russian stores.
The New Book Network was fined for selling the book 50 days before my suicide.
The New Bookstore chain has been fined for selling Staise Kramer’s book “50 days before my suicide,” according to the Moscow city news agency.
As reported in Rospotrebnadzor, without specifying the amount of the fine, the text of the book can be considered "provoking or motivating to suicidal behavior of children and adolescents".
The Ostankinsky District Court confirmed the violation of the established requirements for the distribution of information products among children and decided to impose a penalty in the form of a fine with the confiscation of 49 copies of the printed products arrested by the Rospotrebnadzor administration.
A source in the New Book has confirmed that this is a work by Stace Kramer.
In March of this year, it was reported that in the largest bookstores in Moscow are being checked for the availability of the book "50 days before my suicide".
In Moscow will be held the evening of the memory of Ernst the Unknown.
In Moscow will be held the evening of the memory of the sculptor Ernst Unknown, reports TASS.
The event will take place on August 15 at the Central House of Literators.
Unfortunately, not everyone will be able to say goodbye to the Unknown in the United States personally.
That is why it has been decided to organize this evening for those who want to remember it in their homeland,” the press service of the Russian Jewish Congress said.
It was noted there that it was important for the widow of the sculptor Anna Graham and his friends around the world.
To the evening are invited close friends of the Unknown, including the poet Yevgeny Yevtushenko, the artist Boris Messerer, the president of the GMIA named Pushkin Irina Antonov, director Mark Rozovsky, as well as the Minister of Culture of Russia Vladimir Medinsky.
Earlier it was reported that the relatives of Ernest the Unknown plan to hold a panicid on the sculptor in New York, presumably until August 14.
The final consumer of vinyl: who actually buys records?
Lonely middle-aged men love vinyl.
And until you stop blocking the comment section with gross insults under the pseudonym NewLonely MenMiddle-Years, this claim stems from the factual data.
According to YouGov, so much of the debated revival of the records is not caused by the boom among the generation of 2,000 who want to penetrate the novelty of the material object, but by the nostalgia of the middle years.
Those who recently bought a vinyl album are more likely to be between the ages of 45 and 54, according to the data.
Moreover, those who belong to the age group of 18-24 years are the least likely.
It’s also not just an act of compilation by amateurs – it has an emotional significance: senior vinyl buyers are somewhat more likely to hold their feelings in themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy loneliness (69% vs. 66%).
Are the results of YouGov correct?
If this blog was a TV news report, the camera would follow me as I walked around the center of a bustling Soho street, in a modest gray suit and blatantly gestured before a stop, folding your hands and saying something impressive like, "Tuck."
Okay, let's see.
While the heart of Soho is slowly losing its charm and dirt—hotels, cafes, and Paperchase stores have now filled the buildings once occupied by independent vendors—several music stores with fantastic specialists remain.
I’d probably ask the camera to stop for the next scene where I’m close to different people in some of these stores and try to assess their age and emotional mood by watching.
A native of Glasgow Stewart, 55, who I followed from Sister Ray (data count: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (data count: eight middle-aged men, one hour would have passed, one hour would have passed, probably over 20 years old), in London, on the floor
He's a collector, I ask?
“I think so,” he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These plates, shown above (he sent me a photo by e-mail, I didn’t chase him home), go through the lines on the walls of his living room.
His reason for acquiring such a huge number of albums and singles stems in part from his disposable income: he can now buy records that he couldn’t afford when they just came out, and buy items that he sold when he was young and at the mall.
“A lot of what I’m buying is the late '60s, the early '70s, the things that came out when I was 11 or 12, the things I was probably too young to buy for,” he says.
He agrees that those who buy records are probably introverts who like their own company, adding, “I don’t smoke, I don’t drink too much.
That's my flaw.
Wes, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many of the clients he meets match the YouGov profile.
He, however, noticed a new wave of people who were affected by the noise in the media, people who heard about the return and felt obliged to buy their old records.
According to the conversations I had, people got rid of their collection, usually around 1998 or 1999.
“Customers who once sold their vinyl to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their CDs,” he says.
This may explain the boom among the renaissance characters of a certain age.
And what about the supposed emotional importance of the plates?
It is enough to spend a few seconds in a store like Phonica to understand that record stores offer a comfortable society to people with similar views.
According to Uez, some senior customers, in particular, are offended by the cashless payment system.
Some vinyl enthusiasts may feel the shock from the digital world and prefer to stay away from the permanence of familiar envelopes for records, items that arouse memories of unrelenting adolescence.
“I think sometimes it can be filling the void or possessing material things as a kind of reassurance,” Wes says.
Since I’m a collector myself, I have it, and I think a lot of people have it too.
It's a simple way to take your head.
"We're like their social workers!" said a colleague from the plate shelf.
An ICM survey in April showed that nearly 50 percent of people who bought a vinyl album last month hadn’t listened to it yet.
The survey also found that 41% have a player that they never use, while 7% of those who buy vinyl do not have a record player.
At this stage of news reporting, I would probably have looked seriously puzzled, a glittering shelf with Bosanov’s collections.
The “trophy” aspect of the rebirth is what Johnny, 42, observed, who works at Sounds of the Universe (Data calculus: three middle-aged men).
“Someone came in recently and said, ‘I don’t have a record player, but I want to buy a Radiohead record so we can put it on our shelf.’
It’s not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.
The more components of the product, the less music.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player."
These are younger people, not older, they are a little less than twenty, who only get to know this.
Fopp, who has now removed almost the entire floor of vinyl, has a much more diverse audience when I arrive.
There are couples over 70, tourists who photograph, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
Although the atmosphere is less relaxed than in the above-mentioned stores — the latest synth and sexy-pop Wild Beast, not jazz improvisation, breaks through the columns — it’s nice to see the diversity in its customers.
None of them seem particularly lonely, but it is difficult to establish a painful psychological trauma that existed for 30 seconds next to someone.
Eleonora, 27, walked on Fopp for a few minutes, looking at the various records available for sale.
She's looking at goods, not spending money.
She doesn’t earn much, according to her, so collecting records is not a very suitable option.
It's expensive.
Listening to music on a computer or other device is simple, but the beauty of vinyl is . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I don’t know how to explain it – it’s really unrepeatable.
My last stop is the store, which is said to have contributed to the emergence of a new generation of vinyl lovers: City Fashions.
While I’m creating the illusion that I’m looking at jeans lying on shorts, I’m watching a group of teenage girls gather around the Polaroid camera every minute before the father and his daughter start discussing the purchase of a Crosley player.
To the left is the staircase, the wall of which is set with records of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of modern style and classics, obligatory records for any medium collection.
No one is looking — perhaps because they are just ornaments, some are so high on the wall that it would be impossible to touch them.
It's a real "artistic vinyl."
But considering that any attention to these items can mean more money for the industry and send several customers to the depths of Soho for a while longer, there’s almost nothing to complain about.
Not surprisingly, the layer of the population that is more likely than most to have more time and money than most is the one that spends most of the money on luxury items, such as vinyl.
But while my findings suggest that YouGov’s results are accurate, at least in Soho’s record stores, they do not rule out the existence of a huge number of women collectors and vinyl lovers who exist in reality, in online record stores.
These people are likely to be working in schools or offices at all.
But they clearly don’t spend Thursday mornings strolling through plate shops on Berwick Street, slipping plates, and avoiding the looks of a nasty 30-year-old fake leader who hangs over the shoulders of middle-aged men who don’t suspect anything.
Greenland’s polar shark is the longest-lived vertebrate — video report
Scientists say Greenland’s polar shark has the longest life expectancy of all vertebrates on the planet.
Julius Nilsen, who studies these sharks, says the record set a female between 272 and 512 years old and five meters in length.
French court rejects offer to remove shops in Dungli refugee camp
The French court rejected Kale’s offer to remove dozens of home-made shops and restaurants at the Jungle Camp, where thousands of refugees live.
At court hearings this week, the Kale authorities said that the state should be able to carry a total of 72 homemade shops, where people inside the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to restocks for energy drinks, offer to cut or sell tea for 50 cents.
The Kale Prefecture stated that these places should be removed because they represent a parallel economy that does not pay taxes, and because they carry fire and sanitation risks.
Humanitarian groups have told the court that shops and restaurants are vital, stating that the free meals offered by the pro-government association and other groups do not provide enough food for the growing number of people in the camp.
They argued that home-made shops and restaurants often provide blood and free food to those who need it.
Lille’s court ruled that there was no legal basis to expel people running 72 self-made shops, but said the problems of Kale Prefecture “were fully understood.”
Judge Jean-Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Molla said that bakeries, cafes and restaurants played a much bigger role than just feeding people who “live in extremely shaky conditions.”
He said that the spaces provided quiet meeting points for refugees and volunteers.
One of the places that was under threat of demolition was the Children's Café Book of the Jungle at the camp, which works not for profit and offers 200 lunches a day, classes in English and French, and consultations on flightless shelters for hundreds of vulnerable people.
More than 170,000 people signed a petition to protect a children’s café.
The letter, sent to the Guardian, stated that its closure “would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are no older than eight.”
Two charities, Aid to Refugees and L’Auberge des Migrants, on Friday estimated that the number at the Jungle Camp had increased and exceeded 9,000 people — the highest in history — after a sharp increase in new arrivals over the summer.
Libraries of microdistricts invite young libertarians to cognition programs.
This week, the branch libraries will hold meetings dedicated to the Day of the City, the Year of Russian Cinema and even the Day of the Physician.
The programs are aimed at the children’s audience, so most of them will take place in game form.
Today, August 10, the branch library No. 2, in the saline microdistrict, invites to a cruise presentation "My little town".
On August 11, the No. 1 branch library will host a regional seminar “I live in this city, I know this city”.
In the branch library No. 2 on the same day will be held a multimedia lesson "Land of the Fatherland of the Past".
And in the branch library No. 4 in Surazhevka - the game program "Film, film, film".
On Sunday, August 14, for children from the northern micro-district of the No. 3 branch library will conduct the game program "Physicult-Hello!".
Britain stops on silver in Rugby 7 after Fiji’s master class allows them to take gold
Britain’s impressive series in the Rugby 7 was disruptively stopped at the Fiji team’s final hurdle in the final on Thursday evening, when they were completely defeated 43-7 at the Deodoro stadium here in Rio.
The Fiji gave a master class in possession of the ball, scattering, evasion, support of the game, running lines, and rough force to win gold—their first Olympic medal of any color.
The defeat came with not too poor consolation in the form of silver — Britain's third in a day — and they could be proud of their efforts in the first Olympic tournament on Rugby 7, in which they defeated New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa along the way.
The Box’s painful beating, 7-5 in the semi-final earlier in the day, could return to negatively affect them in the final.
But, no matter what, Fiji has won a team of 15 in such a form as no better team can.
This may be some consolation for the UK — but probably not — that at least one Britishman will hang a gold medal on his neck tomorrow: Fiji’s head coach Ben Ryan, a former head of England from Wimbledon.
It was a journey for the United Kingdom.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game at the Adelaide Sevens.
They lost only one here.
These blows will hurt, but the progress is amazing.
The Fiji started off great, for fun, repelling Britain’s attempts to intercept the ball.
It was like bumping into a column of moving buses for Captain Tom Mitchell and the company, and the World Series champions went up 5-0 when Ossee Colinisau plunged into the corner.
Having four minutes on the clock, Jerry Tuvay added another touchdown on the right flank, which was implemented.
12-0 and the UK barely touched the ball.
Mitchell’s magnificent attempt to intercept the man-mountain Leon Nakarava from scoring the third, but that only held Fiji back.
In the seventh minute, Jass Veremalou made a right-handed touchdown, and the United Kingdom lost 17-0.
Nakarava added another one after the resumption and there was still more than a minute on the clock... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravovo then broke through a few more whimsical attempts to intercept Britain and stormed the line to get a point.
The result was a 29-0 break.
It looked as if the Fijis were born to play rugby-7, while the UK still mastered the craft.
Which is, to a large extent, so.
The UK made mass replacements in the half of the game, and they locked the Fiji dam... for all four minutes, which by the standards of the first half was good until Joshua Tuisov passed after several brilliant Fiji interactions.
Dan Norton made an attempt for the United Kingdom by making a tachdown in the left corner to score 36-7, but the game long went the way of the South Sea Islanders, whose fans sang, waved flags and danced on the stands.
It was impossible not to admire the full joy of Fiji’s approach.
Mata William decorated a Fiji cake, which did not need to be decorated, with another attempt in the last seconds.
A whistle sounded, the Fijis embraced, and the United Kingdom fell on a lawn, completely defeated.
Earlier on the same day Fiji defeated Japan 20-5 in their semi-finals, and the UK slightly bypassed South Africa in the tense semi-final of one attempt each — the difference in British implementation.
Kyle Brown takes the Box forward in the first half, but Dan Norton, with some magnificent work of his feet, broke the line and hit under bars in the second half.
A brilliant last attempt to intercept Marcus Watson, brother of England’s 15th side, Anthony, secured a victory — and ultimately a silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning Inspired to Win a Raft by a Cancer Coach
There will be no more exciting gold at these games, and that says something.
From the first move to the last, 220 heavy climbs in history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found the added value of their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.
Although they were the two who pulled the paddle, there were three voices in this boat, the echo of coach Robin Williams was always as long as they aspired to the second consecutive Olympic gold in women's pairs, the first women in the annals of British sport to reach such a high.
Their supremacy was absolute, in the end it was their 39th undefeated performance, again unprecedented.
What we can see is that two brilliant athletes, sliding on the surface with the elegance of swans, do not fully reflect the nature of the triumph.
Behind each gold, a battalion of ready-made hands smashed, contributing to progressively growing victories that mattered, and there were no hands that played a more important role than the hands of a coach who 30 months ago, when he was diagnosed with cancer, did not know whether he would live it until the day he died.
Like he said, it was a dangerous thing.
I had bladder cancer, which is one of the things they can operate on, and they did.
If they don’t, they go everywhere.
It could have been a pretty bad situation.
It changes your view of the future a bit.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
Trio was lucky that he could have started treatment in early 2014 in the inter-season, keeping the schedule gap to a minimum if it could be the right expression in circumstances like these.
I needed a payment, so I needed to fix it quickly.
It was a stimulus.
I was in the hospital and I was walking around the compartment — 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time, although they said it was quite a few steps.
Here's how it starts.
Grim in itself is a journey, but it makes it a little more.
The next moment after the victory, their first thoughts were about Williams, who spent a nervous morning talking a little more than usual in an attempt to overcome his own experiences.
Stanning, captain of the artillery regiment serving in Afghanistan, said: “I was an emotional wreck this week, maybe it’s a little too much, but it means so much.”
It just confirms how much it means to me, how much Helen and I worked, and so does Robin.
It was a fantastic three years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin we would be nobody, so thank you very much, he is the best coach in the world.
I couldn’t ask for a better partner for training or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a single race in five years.
This pair sets a tense rhythm to which their competitors have never been able to match.
Even in the last 500 metres, when teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to approach, Stanning and Glover had too much in stock.
We were very much in the phase.
Helen said, “Stay in the process, stay in the process.”
It's very important not to be amused.
We had a good start, and at the same time we didn’t try to do something amazing.
“We didn’t wait for the fireworks today, we just waited to be able to heat up and get out and win this race, which we did.
It will take a couple years to decide their future.
Glover is due to be at the wedding next month, on her own with TV adventurer Steve Beckshall.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn’t want to say this was my last race.
That would mean too much pressure.
It took about six months in London to realize that I had become an Olympic champion.
It was all so new, and I was so tense.
It took about four minutes here.
I feel so much better,” she said.
The Government has extended the period for the destruction of sanctioned products
The government has extended until the end of 2017 the period of destruction of foods banned for import to Russia.
The relevant decree was signed by the Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, it is published on the official portal of legal information.
The embargo against countries that have imposed anti-Russian sanctions because of the situation in Ukraine was introduced in our country in August 2014.
Subsequently, the ban was repeatedly extended, now it is in effect until December 31, 2017.
It is forbidden to import certain types of agricultural products, raw materials and food from the United States, the countries of the European Union, Canada, Australia, Norway, Ukraine, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland and Liechtenstein.
In particular, meat and meat products, fish, seafood, vegetables, fruits and dairy products have been banned.
The utilization of food imported into the country to circumvent the embargo is carried out in Russia since August 2015.
In the first quarter of 2016 alone, about 100 tons of prohibited products were withdrawn from sales.
The Hunt for the Prohibition
On Friday, rains and storms are expected in Moscow.
Through the capital region will pass an atmospheric front that will bring rainfall and lower the air temperature.
During the day, the air warms up to 25 degrees of heat.
So, on the night of Saturday in Moscow places will be short-term rain, possible thunderstorms and winds of up to 15 m / s.
Rain is expected in the day with thunderstorms and winds up to 12-17 m/s.
Rains with thunderstorms are also forecast in Orlovskaya, Kurska and Voronezh regions, reports "Dni.ru".
Next week, the rainfall is unlikely.
The WTO panel of arbitrators found that Russian import duties on paper, refrigerators and palm oil contradict the rules of the organization.
Import tariffs exceed the commitments made by Russia at the time of its accession to the WTO.
“This is the first time the WTO has taken a decision against Russia,” the official website of the organization said in a statement.
However, the arbitrators stressed in their conclusion that the European Union did not provide sufficient evidence that Russia’s measures were “systematic” or “comprehensive in nature.”
Russia, in turn, has promised in the near future to adapt the import duties on paper and refrigerators.
This is stated in the message of the Ministry of Economic Development of Russia.
On July 4, it was reported that Kiev intends to complain to the World Trade Organization about the actions of Russia, which introduced additional restrictions on the transit of Ukrainian goods.
This is stated in the statement of the Government of Ukraine.
In May, the Financial Times wrote that the behavior of the United States in resolving disputed issues in the WTO undermines the principles adopted by the organization.
Such a statement was made by Brazil, Japan, the European Union and other WTO members over the refusal of the Americans to approve for a second term the South Korean judge Chan Son Hwa.
In this regard, Russia will not appeal to the WTO on the issue of Western sanctions imposed against Russia.
The WTO is an international organization established in January 1995 to liberalize international trade.
It currently consists of 162 countries.
Russia joined it in 2012.
In the administration of the President changed the head
Russian President Vladimir Putin has appointed the head of his own administration of the former deputy Sergei Ivanov Anton Vyno.
Vladimir Putin carried out shifts in the administration of the president and expressed hope that the new head of his administration will contribute to the constructive work of the government and the Kremlin.
In turn, Anton Weino said during the meeting that he considered the important anti-corruption work, which began to be carried out as the head of the administration of President Ivanov, and promised to cooperate with the government.
Earlier, Izvestia wrote that experts consider the situation with the resignation of Sergei Ivanov from the post of head of the administration transparent and understandable and the shift will not fundamentally change anything in the activities of the Kremlin administration.
They note that the leader, who had been in the administration of the president for a long enough time, has effectively built up the AP’s activities.
Instead came the deputy head of the administration Anton Weino - a man who knows the specifics of this work perfectly.
In Poland, they are allowed not to buy fuel from Gazprom.
The Polish state-owned oil and gas company PGNIG does not rule out that in a few years' time the supply of gas from the Russian Federation may become unattractive to it due to the reorientation to fuel from Norway and other countries.
This was reported by the vice president of the Polish company for finance Boguslav Mazez.
His words are conveyed by TASS.
“It may happen that we are not going to buy gas at all [in Gazprom], we are now diversifying our supplies.
Within the next four years, the main areas of supply for us will be the East, raw materials from LNG terminals and Norway," - said Majetz.
Currently, Gazprom is in the dominant position in the supply of gas to Poland.
On Friday, August 12, PGNIG reported that the Russian supplier in the first half of 2016 supplied it with almost 5.3 billion cubic meters of gas, which is 30% above the level of 2015.
The share of the Russian gas giant in PGNIG purchases increased to 49.8% compared to 40% a year earlier.
On July 22, the Polish anti-monopoly office did not agree to the creation of the joint venture Gazprom and its European partners for the construction of the Nord Stream-2 gas pipeline.
At the same time, a month earlier, Poland left a request to Gazprom for the supply of 11 billion cubic meters of gas on the North Stream-2.
This was stated by the deputy chairman of the board of the holding Alexander Medvedev.
The auction for the North Stream 2 capacity will take place in 2017, and in the autumn of 2016 it is planned to hold an auction on its laying.
At the end of May it was reported that Gazprom does not yet plan to take any action in connection with the intentions of the Polish side to abandon long-term contracts for the supply of gas from Russia after 2022, said Alexander Medvedev, deputy chairman of the board of directors of the company.
He recalled that in the first quarter of this year, the Poles only increased the purchase of gas from the Russian Federation by 42%.
Zampred Gazprom added that the very fact of filing a Polish PGNIG application to the Stockholm Arbitration Court does not yet mean the termination of negotiations.
Previously, the Polish company appealed to the court to achieve a reduction in the purchase price of Russian gas.
Peter Naimsky, the authorized government of Poland on the issues of gas and energy infrastructure, said that the Polish authorities have decided not to extend the contract with Gazprom for the supply of gas.
Poland's contract with Gazprom was signed in 1996 and expires in 2022.
In March, Peter Naimsky, the Polish government’s gas and energy infrastructure commissioner, said that his country could refuse to deliver blue fuel from the east in six years’ time.
According to him, Warsaw plans to build a new terminal for the supply of liquefied natural gas Baltic Pipe, which will connect the country with the Norwegian shelf.
"Northern Stream 2" provides for the construction of two strands of marine gas pipeline with a total capacity of 55 billion cubic meters of gas per year from Russia to Germany on the bottom of the Baltic Sea.
The OSCE Special Monitoring Mission (SMM) has increased the number of observers near the Ukrainian border with Crimea.
This was reported by the first deputy head of the SMM in Ukraine Alexander Hug.
“I can confirm that the SMM has increased the number of observers in this area,” he said, responding to a relevant question from journalists, reports RIA Novosti.
According to the OSCE, the situation on the border of Ukraine and Crimea is calm, incidents affecting security, there is not recorded.
Observers tracked what was happening at three crossing points across the Russian-Ukrainian border.
A video of a Jak-42 passenger plane landed at Ufa airport, which rolled beyond the 400 m runway and crashed on the left wing, appeared in the network.
The video was broadcast on the TV channel "360".
The CP occurred at 4.30 Moscow time.
The flight of the airline "KrasAvia" has arrived from Sochi.
They were quickly evacuated to a safe place, no casualties.
The aircraft was transported to the parking lot.
Ufa Airport is operating as usual.
The SCR’s observatory’s investigative management was concerned with finding out the reason for the hard landing of the airliner.
The UN is investigating the use of chemical weapons in Syria.
The UN Special Commission is investigating the possible use of toxic gas in rebel-held areas of the Syrian city of Aleppo.
All parties to the conflict deny the use of chlorine, but the UN special envoy for Syria, Stefan de Mistura, believes the fact of the incident is undeniable.
Such statements were made on the eve of the third round of inter-Syrian talks, which are due to begin in late August in Geneva.
UN experts have launched an investigation into reports of the use of chemical weapons in the Syrian city of Aleppo.
The first information about the attack using toxic gas, supposedly chlorine, came out on August 2.
At the time, the opposition said that in the area where a Russian military transport helicopter was shot down the day before, the aircraft dropped bombs with a toxic substance, but in Moscow these accusations were called an intrusion.
Later, the Russian Defense Ministry accused the opposition group “Harakyat Nur ad-Din al-Zinka”.
It soon became known that there were two bombs made of toxic gas.
This was confirmed by the BBC by one of the victims.
"A few minutes later, I smelled the gas, started burning my eyes, it became difficult to breathe," the publication quoted the eyewitness as saying.
As a result of the attack at least 7 people were killed, 23 were hospitalized.
If the use of poisoning gas is confirmed by experts, the actions will be considered a war crime.
U.N. Special Envoy for Syria Staffan de Mistura told reporters: “There is a lot of evidence that this really happened.”
The inadmissibility of the use of chlorine for military purposes is stipulated in the Convention on the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (CWWC).
Despite the fact that all sides of the Syrian conflict deny the use of toxic gases, in 2015 human rights defenders recorded 35 cases of use of chlorine by the Syrian army against “moderate opposition.”
The situation in Aleppo is complicated by the fact that shelling of its districts is carried out daily, and terrorists are preventing residents from leaving the city.
According to Reuters, the UN expects Russia to establish a “humanitarian pause” in military actions.
The organization’s current three-hour day-to-day silence regime is “not enough to help the nearly 2 million civilians trapped.”
Staffan de Mistura’s humanitarian adviser, Jan Egelann, said that a 48-hour ceasefire would be needed to deliver relief and evacuate the sick and injured to the city every week.
"We have to send bulk cargo from a column of trucks in areas where roads are almost destroyed and those that remain are mined," Mr. Egelann said. "But the Russian delegation has confirmed its willingness to sit with us at the negotiating table."
Consultations in Geneva between the representatives of the United States and Russia on the establishment of a “humanitarian pause” are ongoing.
How Russia has opened “humanitarian windows” in Aleppo.
In the context of the ongoing battle for Aleppo, the second largest Syrian city, Russia announced on August 11 the introduction of a three-hour ceasefire regime, which will operate daily from Thursday.
The creation of “humanitarian windows” is intended to provide the conditions for the delivery of medicines, food and essential items to the city.
The decision of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation has been made against the background of increasing international pressure on Moscow with the requirement to cancel the military operation and contribute to the resumption of the negotiation process.
As a result of a series of explosions at resorts in Thailand, four people were killed.
Several explosions broke out in southern Thailand on Friday morning.
As a result of the attack, four people died, 19 were injured.
The epicenter of the explosions came to the city of Hua Hin.
Among the victims were ten foreigners, citizens of four states, Russians are not among them.
The responsibility for the incident has not yet been taken by any of the terrorist groups, but the country’s Ministry of Internal Affairs has hastened to declare that the Islamists are not involved in it.
Several people have already been arrested on suspicion of organizing the explosions.
According to preliminary data from the local police, the scale and features of the explosions indicate that they were directed against the country's leading military personnel.
The attacks took place at popular tourist resorts, including Patong Beach in the area of Phuket and the cities of Hua Hin, Trang and Surat Tani.
After the military junta came to power in the country in 2014, economic growth fell from 7.2% (2012) to 2.8% (2015), but tourism remained one of the few industries to demonstrate development.
In 2016, 14 million people visited the country, which is 1.5 million more than in 2015.
The first suspects in the preparation and organization of the attacks have already been arrested, police colonel Krisana Patanacharoen said.
While it is too early to talk about the goals, he added, however, the country’s Ministry of Internal Affairs is “confident that they are not affiliated with international extremist groups.”
“It’s too early to draw conclusions,” Mr. Patanacharoen said.
But we know exactly that these incidents are not directly related to any kind of terrorism, they are actually local diversions, and we are trying to establish the identities of those behind them.
The explosions occurred on the birthday of Queen Sikrit of Thailand.
The Thai junta considers the protection of the monarchy one of its top priorities, so the incident is likely to be directed against it.
According to police general Sithichai Srisopacharoenrat, the bombs were detonated remotely with a difference of half an hour.
They were hidden inside the trees in the bustling streets filled with tourists dining in the restaurants.
It is already known that one of the four dead was a Thai girl who traded street food.
The identity of the other victims is not yet known, but it is known that they are residents of four foreign states.
According to the Royal Thai Police, among them four German citizens, three Dutch subjects, two Italian citizens and a citizen of Austria.
The Russians are not among the victims of the explosions, the Rosturism press service reported.
Local experts also linked the explosions to the August 7 referendum, in which 61.4% of the country’s population supported the draft new constitution.
It was prepared by the Constitutional Commission appointed by the military junta.
Voters had to determine whether they supported a system in which the upper house of parliament was fully appointed by the military and played a significant role in the election of the country's prime minister.
The new system was adopted and will be tested for the first time in the 2017 parliamentary elections.
On May 22, 2014, a military coup took place in Thailand under the leadership of the country’s army commander, Praut Chan-Ocha.
He said the army was hit by an ongoing political crisis and a lack of progress in the negotiations between the government and the opposition.
The military created the National Council of Peace and Order, introduced the commander-in-chief and censorship, dismantled the protesters and the upper house of parliament.
How Bangkok was in a state of emergency
The Thai government, led by Prime Minister Yinglak Chinawat, announced in January 2014 the introduction of a state of emergency in Bangkok and adjacent provinces.
The special regime lasted 60 days.
There were two explosions in Bangkok.
In January 2014, at the Victory Monument in central Bangkok, where one of the main protests took place, there were two explosions that injured 28 people, five of them in critical condition.
The explosions were unidentified on motorcycles.
Authorities have stepped up security measures in the capital and have drawn military forces to protect the demonstrators.
The development of conditions began in the Dry Lodge.
As the “I” became known, the government was asked to agree on the draft terms of the auction for the Gold Mining site of the Dry Log with the preservation of two key restrictions.
It is proposed not to allow a company where 25% or more belongs to foreigners, and those applicants whose capital will not be at least 25% of the state share.
Industry participants do not expect the government to rewrite the terms, noting that many players do not risk taking on a complex and expensive project.
The auction can be announced in August and held in October.
The Ministry of Nature submitted to the government the draft order and conditions of the auction for the largest undeveloped gold mine in Russia Dry Log (Irkutsk region, stocks and resources - 130 million ounces), two sources "I" familiar with the situation told.
The project was submitted on Wednesday evening, one of them clarifies.
The Ministry of Nature confirmed that the project was submitted to the government.
The representative of the courier of underground use Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Khloponin said "I" that the official's apparatus has not yet entered the project.
“The auction can be announced as early as August, immediately after the government’s order is issued, and taking into account the deadline for collecting applications from potential participants (at least 45 days) the tender can be held as early as October,” the Ministry of Nature said.
According to the “E”, the project retained two key requirements for potential participants, prescribed in the version, which was sent for approval by the ministries and FOIs in July (there are “E”).
The first is the presence in the capital of the claimants at least 25% of the state share.
The second is the refusal of access to the auction for companies under the control of foreign investors, based on the understanding of FZ-57 about non-investments in strategic societies.
According to the two articles of the FZ mentioned in the draft, as already written by "U" on August 2, companies whose beneficiaries (25% of shares and above) are not tax residents of the Russian Federation or have dual citizenship may not be allowed to be auctioned.
The Government has the right to impose such restrictions, as the Dry Log relates to federally-valued subdivisions (reserves of more than 50 tons of gold).
The Ministry of Nature confirmed that the project "contains restrictions on the admission of foreign companies", but refused to comment on the details until the government's order.
The demand for state participation in the capital of the auction participants was raised by the Irkutsk region, spoken in December 2015 "I" in the Ministry of Nature and later confirmed by the governor of the region Sergei Levchenko, noting that the "Inveyost" was sent to the Ministry of Nature by "Inveyost" by his predecessor Sergei Eme<0xC5><0xA1>tevo.
Who lobbyed the restriction on the admission of foreigners, the interlocutors of the "I" do not specify.
“But it’s in the spirit of time: not to give control to Russia’s largest gold mine against the background of Western sanctions,” says the interviewer “E”, familiar with the preparation of the auction.
On August 1, the head of the Ministry of Nature Sergei Donskoy stated that foreigners "can go to the consortium" if the applicants attract them "as a financial structure, technological partners".
Interlocutors “I” consider it unlikely that the government will adjust the conditions.
The main contender for the Sukhoi Log in the industry is considered a consortium of the largest gold miner of the Russian Petroleum Corporation "Polus", controlled by the son of Suleiman Kerimov Said, and "Rostech".
In July, the partners created the SP "SL Zoloto", where "Polus" has 51% shares, and the structure of "Rostech" RT-GR - 49%.
In "Rostech" declined to comment, in "Polus" stated "I" that "obviously are interested in this asset" and have all the necessary competences and resources for its development.
"But the final decision on the possibility and format of our participation will be made after the announcement of the conditions," - added in the Polus.
ALROSA may participate in the auction, but the decision by the Russian government, sources said.
The Russian GV Gold and Canadian Kinross, which develops assets in Chukotka, announced the possibility of participating in the development of the Dry Logo, while Polymetal and Nordgold, according to I, are not interested in the asset.
In December 2015, Sergei Kashuba, the head of the Union of Russian Gold Industry, estimated the investment of “I” in the Dry Lodge at $2.5-4 billion.
Most potential applicants deter not only the volume of investments, but also the complexity of the project: serious exploration of stocks and technology of working with complex mines is needed, explain the interlocutors of the "I" in the industry.
On the pension market, the largest M&A deal - "KIT Finance Pension Administrator" started the process of merging four controlled NPFs.
As a result, on the basis of the Gazfund Pension accumulations will be created NPF with accumulation volume of about 373 billion rubles.
On the launch of the procedure of the merger of four pension funds - "KIT Finance", "Promogrofund", "Inheritance" and "Gazfond Pension accumulations" - yesterday reported the owner of 100% of funds of "KIT Finance Pension Administrator".
“Reorganization is carried out in agreement with the Central Bank, subject to compliance with the requirement of non-deterioration of the terms of the current contracts,” the company said in a statement.
The merger is carried out on the basis of the Gazfond Pension accumulations.
As noted by the Director General of this NPF, Oleg Byalo<0xC5><0xA1>itskiy, the pooling of funds allows to solve several tasks: expanding the geography of the presence, concentration of resources for development, reducing costs, copying the best practices of each of the funds and optimizing corporate governance.
According to him, the indicative deadline for the completion of the consolidation is the second quarter of 2017.
As a result of the merger of NPF "Gazfond Pension accumulations" will become the largest player in the OPS market.
According to data as of March 31, the amount of pension accumulations of the combined funds exceeded 373 billion rubles.
According to the reports on the website of the funds, the beneficiaries of their owner - "KIT Finance Pension Administrator" - are currently Anatoly Gavrilenko (through controlled LLCs owns 65%) and NPF "Gazfond" (35%).
However, only the merger of the group launched much later competitors.
So, the controlled group O1 NPF "Future" absorbed "Stalfond" at the beginning of this year.
Currently, this joint NPF joins the Uralsib and the Russian Standard funds.
“Unification into a single structure, in addition to reducing costs, is necessary to solve structural problems,” says Nikolay Sidorov, Director General of the Future National PPP.
Active work on fund consolidation has been going on since April and in the pension group "Safmar" - NPF "European", "Education and Science" and "Region Fund" should be merged into NPF "Safmar" until the end of this year.
In 2017, NPF "Trust" will join them.
"The pooling of funds will give the effect of strengthening control over risks, operational processes and costs," Safmar said in the pension group.
A pause in the pooling of funds, which was sustained by the KIT Finance Pension Administrator, can be caused by several reasons, experts say.
Until recently, NPFs were not able to redeem more than 40% of the volume of issuance of infrastructure bonds in which the group was actively placed.
After the amendments to the Central Bank’s decision in March of this year, a number of issuers complying with the regulator’s requirements no longer have such restrictions.
If necessary, the entire issue can be purchased by one major player", - says Yuri Nogin, director of the rating group of financial institutions of AKRA.
Several NPF executives from the top 15 by assets another possible cause of the pause are called division of spheres of influence and, as a result, staff appointments in a single fund, which were to be agreed upon by the owners of the group.
Yesterday Anatoly Gavrilenko was unavailable for comments.
The request of "I" in the NPF "Gazfond" was also not answered.
Although fund consolidation is a labor-intensive and inexpensive event, in the long run this decision will be justified.
As the CEO of the consulting company "Pension Partner" Sergey Okolesnov notes, the "Gazfonda Pension accumulations" has fewer outflows, the accession will allow to stabilize the base of other funds of the group.
At the same time, a more successful experience of NPF "KIT Finance" and "Promogrofond" in the construction of retail sales of OPS, as well as the use of more modern software will be required.
The requirements of the Central Bank for NPF processes and personnel are constantly growing, so it is inappropriate to duplicate the infrastructure on four funds under a single investment policy, says Pavel Mitrofanov, Managing Director of Corporate Ratings “Expert RA”.
“The effect of reducing the duplicating functions will clearly override the possible costs for the merger,” Mr. Mitrofanov said.
The cost of the merger of four funds Sergey Okolesnov estimates at 30-50 million rubles.
"The cost of holding four funds of this size is about 400 million rubles per year, with consolidation in the medium term, the budget is actually reduced by half," - Mr. Okolesnov is sure.
The best Disney movie "Pet and His Dragon" has been released in Russian rental.
Beautiful New Zealand species, seductive dragon, soulful history, and country-style songs are enough to once again believe in old-fashioned magic, says Elena Kravtsun.
A frightened baby was picked up by a dragon, who became a human child and a tender nanny, and a devoted friend.
Pete calls his friend Elliot, in honor of the puppy from the book of fairy tales, plays with him in the dungeon and falls asleep in the picture.
Six years later, he grew up and in a braided bandage, no longer distinguishes from another deliberate woodpecker - Maugli.
In this form, Pete is discovered by a red-haired woman-egger Grace (Brice Dallas Howard), while the brigade of Gavin (Carl Urban), her husband's brother, storms the forest.
Now she will have to not only believe in the existence of the dragon, but also help save him.
Pete takes an accelerated “being a man” course surrounded by idyllic Americans who wear cowboy shirts, moral code in the heart and smile more dazzlingly than in any commercial.
No character looks or acts too horrible for the viewer to really start to hate or be afraid of him.
Even Gavin, who discovered the hunt for an atypical inhabitant of the forests under his control, is far from an irreparable villain.
The huge fluffy dragon also turned out not to be scary, with a good face of the bulldog, the airliner wingspan and the ability to become invisible.
The dragon sneezes, sneezes, even sneezes and, fortunately, does not speak, but he wants to sneeze all the time, so he is advantageously different from all the famous cinematic dragons.
Elliot’s visual image and his manner of holding provide such a high degree of emotional involvement that at the most tense moments, not only small spectators, but also adults begin to cry desperately in the three rivers.
Astonishingly good and underage Oaks Figli as Pete, who is torn between a possible family and a real friend.
And Robert Redford virtuosoly gives out a canonical grandfather who would be happy to have literally every child.
How did director David Lowry manage to make a fantastically cute remake of the forgotten 1977 Disney movie "Dragon Pete", mediocre from the nose to the tail end and memorized only by a mix of animation and game cinema, and make it the most soulful of summer?
It's not like a miracle helped.
In his painting, Lowry took only two things from the original: the orphan Pete and the dragon.
There were music numbers on board and most of the strange jokes.
This good story reads features borrowed from Bambi, Alien and many other cute heart of children's paintings.
Disney Studio continues to successfully expand the gallery of high-quality remakes of the 21st century.
Of course, Pete and the Dragon isn’t as stunningly beautiful as the Jungle Book itself, and it doesn’t have a skilled villain like Kate Blanchett in the role of a stepmother in the new Sunshine.
But this naive film no less successfully helps to believe in miracles and goodness in the best of Disney traditions.
By the way, the keys from Disney’s magical castle will be given to director Lowry once again – for the artistic adaptation of the story of “Peter Pane”.
Worked out in "Piet and his Dragon" tandem David Lowry and writer Toby Halbrooks entered into a new ambitious project about a non-adult boy after the fairy tale of the same name by James Barry.
RBC journalist Aleksandar Sokolov to be indicted
Lawyers of RBC journalist Alexander Sokolov, accused of organizing the activities of the extremist structure, said that the prosecutor’s office found shortcomings in their case.
That the prosecutor's office made such a statement, we learned from the investigators literally yesterday.
We were scheduled to participate in the court hearing on the issue of limiting access to the materials of the criminal case, but the meeting was not held in the end, and the investigators informed us about the presentation issued by the prosecutor’s office,” - says RBC lawyer Olga Dinze.
She said the prosecutor’s office had indicated to investigators that the qualifications of the case and the materials collected were inconsistent.
Now the investigators will have to close the gaps in the evidence base and present Alexander Sokolov with a new charge.
Either another article of the Criminal Code will appear in the case, or it will remain the same, but with other arguments and new evidence, Ms. Dinze said.
As reported by "I", Alexander Sokolov was arrested on July 29, 2015.
In June of this year, it was reported that the investigation excluded from the RBC journalist’s accusation of “destabilizing the political situation towards instability” and “defeating power by illegal means.”
The correspondent "Kommersantboscosport" ALEXANDER ZILBERT lived the life of an Olympian in the Olympic village, inspected the house of the Russian team, had lunch in the local dining room and even passed the WADA test afterwards.
I don't think life's going to die here for a second.
Even at night.
The final starts sometimes end at midnight, after which the athletes need another hour and a half or two to return to the Olympic village.
In addition, there is an uninterrupted settlement and eviction from the village, as some athletes finish their performances and leave Brazil, and some, on the contrary, only come here.
At 7:30 a.m., the heads of all the Olympic delegations will be drawn in one of the temporary tents.
At these meetings, we usually discuss some operative household issues, - says the head of the sports delegation of the Olympic team of Russia Igor Kazikow. - Despite the fact that the house, in which all the toluns were located in the first place, and the toluns, consider, the exemplary - it has been handed over to the ek.
It's a hot water problem, then, I'm sorry, with the toilets.
We've been fighting for cleanliness for a long time.
At first, no one came to clean up.
Then the clinicians started coming, but they only popped some substance on the floor, and so on.
They have floors, you see, some innovative ones.
Mol, you can't wash them humanly.
We know these floors - laminate ordinary!
All in all, we got a change of the cleaning company and now it's OK.
The Olympic village is such South Butovo, a sleeping area, surrounded by mountains on one side, on the other - an impressive well, places flooded with water.
Well, for reliability, there is still a two-meter iron fence all around the perimeter, along which automatons walk.
In total, the village can accommodate up to 17,000 people in 3604 apartments located in 31 houses.
On one of the 18-storey buildings hangs a huge Russian flag - this house is completely dedicated to the needs of our team.
Looking at the small foyer at the entrance, you can immediately determine what problems are apparently the most pressing for the domestic team.
There are two advertisements at the check-in desk: "Please don't throw the paper in the toilet!" and "I'll get the badge.
The rack itself sinks in the booklets.
Their cheerful color contrasts with the headlines of the brochures: "Note on infectious diseases for those leaving Rio de Janeiro", "First aid in drowning", "recession of the foreign body", "recession of the respiratory tract", "loss of consciousness"
The text on the inside is very hopeful.
For example, such as: "Infection is accompanied by fever and subsequent healing.
However, not everyone expects a favorable outcome.
Of course, in the location of the team of Russia there is a medical center, which at any time is ready to provide the residents of the house qualified assistance, including relaxing and sports massage.
On the contrary, the medical center is the headquarters of our delegation.
Next to the door is an inspiring poster: “No matter what, we will win!”
And, of course, the poems:
All the arguments are absolute bullshit!
Only those who believe in them are the ones who fear them.
Let less of us, the sweeter the taste of victory, Russia will not retreat, will not break!
And in order to raise the spirit even more, there is an announcement: "Dear brothers and sisters!
At the blessing of the Holy Patriarch of Moscow and all of Russia, Kirill spiritual care for athletes of the Olympic team of Russia is carried out by protoyers Andrey Vladimirovich Alekseev.
You can order prayer and other requests by phone...
In general, on the territory of the village there is a Center of Meditations and Religious Rituals for representatives of all denominations.
Well, the Russians, it turns out, in a privileged position - they have their own chapel.
Due to the loading of the elevator from the ninth floor to the fourth, I decided to go down the stairs, which is recommended to use during the fire.
And in the dark he stumbled upon the bodies lying on it.
Apparently, they were the sleeping co-workers of the new cleaning company.
I guess, in readiness at any time to throw on the washing of innovative floors they decided to arrange a quiet hour directly on the cold steps.
On the fourth floor I was waiting for a meeting with a longtime acquaintance - Vitaliy Fedorovich Dubko, the coach of our batsmen, who led them to Olympic gold 16 years ago in Sydney.
He and Yana Pavlova, the European Champion, kindly agreed to show their rooms.
Complaining on a large scale is not about anything, - shares the impressions of the well-deserved trainer of Russia. - We live on two, the beds, of course, are almost inconvenient, but this is not critical.
The bathroom is one in four, but spacious.
The cabinet, of course, is funny, made of fabric, does not cause trust, but things can be put.
"No, you're pretending, their tea is over!" the tennis player Svetlana Kuznetsov, who met me in the main dining room, shakes her hands.
The main one is called at least because it represents a space of 2,7 thousand square meters and is ready to receive at the same time 5,000 visitors.
There are over 60,000 servings a day, completely free of charge.
The menu options are: "Best of Brazil", "Kitchens of the World", "Asian dishes" and "Pizza, pasta".
The last option, as I looked at it, is very popular with our volleyball players.
At the same time, say, the soups I did not find in any of the units of the giant restaurant.
What kind of soup? - Surprised Kuznetsova. - No tea!
It's good that I took a Chinese with me, a welded one.
And a teapot.
But in general, for you to understand, our food on the court is even worse.
There is at least one thing you can choose, despite the unbearable uniformity.
I personally picked a pair of fever and a tomato sauce frying pan.
Next to each dish there is a plate with its name in three languages - English, French and Portuguese, as well as an indication of the food value of the product and the presence of allergens in it.
Well, to be honest, it was edible.
I don’t even understand why this line is always worth at the local McDonald’s.
Sate, relaxed, you can say "warm" athletes on the way out of the restaurant are waiting for our best friends - representatives of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).
Cheating cleverly - a quiz, the winner of which gets a T-shirt.
Provocative, you might say!
To get a gift, you need to answer at least eight out of ten questions correctly.
There are questions in Russian! - attacked me by a girl from WADA.
But that's not what I was attacking.
So I'm in a patriotic mood, of course.
The situation has already exacerbated the second question: “If I have been notified of a doping check, should I immediately go to the doping checkpoint?”
I stopped at option B: "No, I have an hour."
Lost, so to speak, vigilance.
I forgot that WADA does not have to wait for deficiencies.
All in all, we need to show up immediately.
Well, in the seventh stage of the quiz, my situation became quite critical.
For some reason I thought that if I find it difficult to adhere to a balanced diet because of my dense schedule (and for me, by the way, it’s hard!), I can use bio-additives to get “additional nutrients to boost my performance.”
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
More precisely, the answer is formulated in such a way that it is categorically not forbidden, but insistently, in several sentences correspond.
It's not fair to play WADA!
How's it going, Russia? - the leading quiz questioning.
To retreat nowhere - behind Efimov, Isinbayev and all our disfigured team.
That’s why I focused and won an unfortunate T-shirt from the last few.
Know what they say, ours!
In a victorious mood, I slammed into the neighborhood fitness center.
Get away from the number of trainers.
He fell by 250.
With surprise, he noted that in this accumulation of runways not a single Russian athlete was found.
But maybe it's right?
Let the one who does not know how to play be trained!
But there was one of our guys sitting in the clinic next door.
Turn to the oculist.
Don't worry, no shooter.
In the polyclinic, however, as in the whole village, wherever there is a splash, there is a device for the issuance of condoms.
There is an inspiring call on it: “Come out with a condom!”
All that remains is to twist the iron, reminiscent of the door lock handle, and the condom, made of the Amazonian natural latex, is ready to fall out of the apparatus.
I took one for myself, to remember.
Athletes will not be bored - they have brought them 450,000.
Just for the festive and festive time in the Olympic village there is a whole entertainment center.
Next to it, there is a badge that reminds us that the International Olympic Committee spends $3.25 million a day on athletes in a variety of ways.
The center is flooded with video games, billiards and tennis tables, table football and hockey, and some weird devices similar to video gyms.
What is it? - I am interested in a fellow in the form of a Ukrainian team, which actively uses a wild toy.
I could, of course, just say that he does not want to talk to a person in the form of a team Russia, and so on.
Here, by the way, by some strange confluence of circumstances in the eyes ripped from the guys in yellow-blue.
The best team to play, it turns out.
To get around the whole village, looking at every corner of it, it takes at least three hours.
But, if you do not want to walk, and do not go on electric cars, you will open the house of the Canadian team with a shed at the entrance and a tent with a restorative bath, and a ticket office, and a laundry, and a dry cleaner, and a hairdresser, and a flower shop, and a shop with goods and goods up.
And late in the evening, you will sit beside an olive tree lined with colorful ribbons in memory of the friends and relatives of the athletes who left this world.
And you'll be accompanied by a machine that's messily spraying fluid to kill insects, thinking of the eternal.
In other words, the Olympic movement.
Which in this village doesn't stop for a minute.
While the rest of the Russian world was watching as the Australians had barely punished the American Dream Team, the real fans went online.
Little is known: the news that Inna Deriglazova won gold in rapping at the XXXI Olympic Games, I got the first.
Maybe I’m the only Moskvich who saw this happen – not counting those, of course, who watched the Carioca competition that night.
Only a real fan can understand this.
Let’s say it’s a dark Moscow night.
Neighbors downstairs, as always at night, wake up and begin to shout at each other without anger, but very loudly.
And it's threatening to move the furniture.
In the kitchen there is a tap - there is no time to go to the market and buy, as the plumber asked, a new one.
In the TV schedule nothing is clear, so he just kept control of the channels "Match", "First" and, in any case, "Russia" - although this is almost meaningless.
"Russia" - the home of repeats, the whole sport there for some reason in the record.
There, the series is broadcast live.
Hope, of course, for "Match" - an entire evening young man shouted in news releases first about the great semi-final Deriglazova--Shanayev, then about the coming battle for gold.
It would be logical to show.
But instead of basketball, the United States--Australia.
By the way, I can't say anything bad about this decision.
The Australians were on equal footing, the first half overall won.
They put in the place of those who were robbed of their own greatness by the Americans.
As a result, they lost, but as it is now expressed, the Olympic basketball tournament will no longer be the same.
It's all good, but it's close to a fight with D.F., and on the screen without change.
In a slight panic, I begin to write channels.
That's the feeling, the second time in a row.
All right, let's go deep into the cables.
There is no fencing on any of the thematic "matches".
And, in my opinion, the fight is about to begin.
Text and tweet broadcasts of some sports sites do not suit me.
Cross-country surfing gives an unexpected, but brilliant result.
On the "First" site, it turns out, a direct technical broadcast of all competitions that take place at this time.
I click on the fencing, I get a gold match.
Deryglazova counter-attacks well, goes forward in points - and quite obviously begins to stretch time.
The Italians play almost the entire game.
Ours is one point ahead, just over two seconds until the end.
Di Franchisca throws at Deriglazov, but retreats, time runs out, the Italian gives an injection.
Victory! Victory!
In a few seconds, an Olympic messenger on the phone reports about the fourth gold medal.
Turns out I'm the first to see it with my own eyes.
Crazy, faithful, involved.
The Spiritual Authority of Muslims (DUM) of Tatarstan refuses to use the Russian language in mosques.
Yesterday, the plenum of DUM required its imams to preach Friday only in Tatar to force young Tatars to "learn their native language".
The government says it does not "under any circumstances violate" the rights of Muslims of other nationalities.
In some Kazan mosques it is said that the Tatar language is not understood by up to 60% of the parishioners, including foreign students, migrants and the Tatars themselves.
The Imams fear that their sermons in Tatar “will not reach the entire audience.”
Yesterday, the plenum of the Duma of Tatarstan unanimously decided to hold Friday sermons in the mosques of the Republic only in Tatar language.
As Tatarstan mufti Camille Samigullin said, it should be an incentive for young Tatars “to learn their native language”.
“For those who will say ‘it’s hard,’ in every big mosque we intend to organize lessons in the Tatar language absolutely free of charge,” Mr. Samigullin promised.
He added that “the decision has already come into force” and today in all mosques the sermons “should already be in the Tatar language.”
He recalled that the DUM of Tatarstan publishes the magazine "Shura" with typical sermons in the Tatar language.
Imam, who does not speak well enough in Tatar, "can be thoroughly prepared for it".
The DUM of Tatarstan brings together more than a thousand revenues in all the municipalities of the republic.
According to Mufti, Friday sermons are held exclusively in the Tatar language.
At the same time, Russian language was used in a number of mosques in Kazan.
In particular, as Mufti pointed out, this was practiced in the Burnaev Mosque, Zakabanna and Eniler.
However, Mr. Mukhametshin stressed, the leadership is tasked with ensuring that all students possess both state languages of the republic, regardless of nationality.
“There can be no mention of any harm to a non-Muslim,” Mr. Muhammedshin said, explaining that the sermon itself “is not a mandatory, basic part of the prayer.”
At the same time, the prayer itself will still be read in Arabic, lectures and lessons in Russian will be kept in the mosques.
At the same time, Rafik Muhametshin said "I" that there was no serious threat of expelling the Tatar language from the mosques.
In addition to Russian and Tatar, other languages, such as Uzbek or Tajik, are not used in the sermons in the republic.
The decision of the DUM was actively supported by the Executive Committee of the World Congress of Tatars (WCC).
The head of the executive committee of the VCT, Rinat Zakirov, said "I": "Smeets are an important part of our national life."
It would be sad if the Tatar language had gone out of this sphere.
He noted that preaching only in the Tatar language "is the wish of the imams themselves", but in the executive branch of the ICC "it is considered right".
The interrogated "I" imams, who preached in Russian, are ready to fulfill the decision of the DUM, but believe that the parishioners will have difficulty with understanding the clergy.
Both the Tatars and the Russians go to the mosque.
Many do not understand the language.
They will, of course, be sad.
“It will have to be rebuilt,” says the imams of the Burnaev Mosque Farhat Mavletdinov.
According to him, preaching in Russian is closer even to many Tatars, because "Russian in schools, and in kindergartens, on the radio - everywhere originally".
However, he believes that the mosque will be able to continue lessons and lectures in Russian, which are held on other days.
We trust in God.
Allah will show you the way out of this situation," he concluded.
But about 60% of us do not know the Tatar language.
These are Uzbeks, Tajiks, and Azerbaijanis.
There are a lot of foreign students coming to us: Africans, Arabs.
“That’s why we switched to Russian for four years,” says the imam.
He believes that in the Tatar language, the sermons will “reach to a narrower circle and will not reach the entire audience.”
But we will be subject to the decision of the plenum.
The end of the sermon will be different.
But time will show.
"For me, for example, it will only be easier, because the Tatar language is my native language," said Gabdulla Galliullin.
Former FSIN Director Sentenced to Court
The Prosecutor’s Office of Moscow has approved an indictment on the investigated criminal case of theft of budget funds allocated for the needs of the FSIN of Russia.
Former head of the prison department Alexander Reimer and his deputy, who caused more than 2.7 billion rubles of damage to FSIN, will be brought before the court.
The capital prosecutor’s office has sent a criminal case against the former director of FSIN of Russia Alexander Reymer, his former deputy Nikolai Krivolapova, as well as the director of the FGUP “Information and Technical Security and Liaison Center” to the Zamoskvoretsky district court.
Depending on the role and degree of participation in the commission of crimes, they are accused of GSU SKR in Moscow pursuant to Article 3 of Article 285 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (abuse of official powers, which has had serious consequences).The number of the service is a serious consequence, Article 4 of Article 159 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (fraud).
In addition, Kryvolapov is charged under Article 1 of Article 222 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (illegal acquisition and storage of ammunition).
According to the CRC, in 2010-2012, these persons were fraudulently kidnapped from the state treasury by the budget funds allocated to the FSIN to provide the department with electronic monitoring systems of controlled persons, so-called electronic bracelets.
For the theft of budget money, the group members developed a scheme according to which the company under its control FGUP CITOS, with which the relevant public contracts were concluded, produced technical means of control and supervision in this field, including "electronic bracelets", and relays.
Despite the fact that FGUP CITOS did not have production equipment, buildings, facilities for the placement of production capacities, allowing to create the final cycle of production of "electronic bracelets", between it and the FSIN of Russia were concluded five state contracts for a sum of 3 more.
As a result of this scheme, the accounts of the Samar branch of FGUP amounted to more than 2 billion rubles, of which 1.2 billion rubles were stolen.
According to the investigation, more than 140 million rubles of cash received personally by Mr. Reimer in his office from one of the accomplices, the criminal case in respect of which is allocated in separate proceedings.
Nikolai Krivolapov, who participated in the machinations, was found of unknown origin of the cartridge for the reward gun, which allowed him to submit an additional charge.
In the present case, which amounted to 133 volumes, FSIN has filed a claim for damages of 2.7 billion rubles against the accused.
Footballer Hakan Shukur is suspected of involvement in the coup.
The Turkish authorities issued a warrant for the arrest of a former footballer and then a member of parliament Hakan Shukur and conducted searches in two houses of his family.
Turkish football star of the 1990s - early 2000s striker Hakan Shukur is sought by the country's authorities in connection with an attempted coup d'état last month.
Forward, who finished his sporting career in 2008, is accused of belonging to an "armed terrorist group".
It is about the movement "Hizmet" - a society associated with the famous Turkish religious figure and oppositionist Fethullah Gulen.
It is his President Erdogan considers the organizer of the attempted military coup that took place on July 15.
Fethullah Gülen lives in the United States, the Turkish authorities demand his extradition.
According to local media, an arrest warrant for Hakan Shukur was issued today, police have already searched two homes that belong to the family of the former footballer.
According to the investigation, Fethullah Gulen's organization included, in addition to Hakan Shukur himself, his father.
However, neither the former footballer nor his relatives were there.
He and his family now live in the United States.
As a footballer, Hakan Shukur defended the colours of several Turkish clubs and played for the national team.
He spent most of his career at Galatasaray.
The list of foreign clubs includes the Italian "Torino", "Inter" and "Palermo", as well as the English "Blackburn".
He hasn’t spent more than one season in any of them.
Hakan Shukur remains Turkey’s most successful striker: 112 matches for the national team and 51 goals scored in his career.
In 2013, Hakan Shukur resigned as a deputy due to an ongoing corruption investigation into Erdogan’s party and its surroundings.
According to the Turkish newspaper Hurriyet, at least 42 journalists were ordered to be arrested in Turkey on July 25.
They are accused of aiding a military coup and ties to the opposition Islamic preacher Fethullah Gulen, who lives in the United States.
Given the severity of the charges, media employees can wait for lengthy prison terms - from ten years to several life sentences.
Egor Konchalovsky wants to create a network of cinemas only for domestic films.
"I would have created a network of cinemas exclusively for Russian cinemas, which cost 2-3 times less tickets than for foreign-produced films," he said.
Mr. Konchalovsky notes that Russian films are difficult to compete for viewers with large Hollywood ribbons.
We have more than 100 paintings a year in the country, of which the screens reach an average of 20-25 tapes.
“And even they find it very difficult to compete with ‘Transformers’ and ‘Iron Man’, whose promotions are loaded with huge budgets,” the film director said.
On July 1, the All-Russian Youth Educational Forum "Tavrida" began to work in Crimea.
Among the participants are teachers of creative professions and young professionals from various creative and humanitarian fields from all over Russia and a number of countries of the near and far abroad.

“Today, together with the Minister of Sport of Russia Vitali Mutko, we visited the building, Vadim Alexandrov, the Director General of Metrostroya, was with us.
He said he would give up the stadium by December 26th.
This is a serious St. Petersburg company, it never breaks the deadlines.
Vitaly Mutko and I remained happy to be seen and heard,” the agency quoted him as saying.
Previously, Vitaly Mutko arrived in St. Petersburg with the aim of inspecting the location of the upcoming large-scale competitions.
Mr. Tulipanov also noted that the Sovfeda Commission, headed by him, will continue to monitor the construction of the stadium and will regularly visit the building.

In Miassa (Chelyabinsk region), the lawyer of the former Deputy Governor Nikolai Sandakova Konstantin Akulich was detained.
As reported by the "Ural of the South" another lawyer of the accused - Sergei Kolosovsky, Konstantin Akuli<0xC4><0x8D>a today called to the investigation department of the SCR Miassa to bring charges in the case of annual annoyance of the infliction of beatings.
Then Konstantin Akulich went to the scene of the accident as a lawyer to help one of his participants.
"Initially it was excited about the unidentified persons. Now that he started to defend Nikolai Sandakova, it turned out that it was Akuli<0xC4><0x87>," - believes Sergei Kolosovsky.
Konstantin Akuli<0xC4><0x87> became a lawyer for the former deputy governor in early August.
At the same time, half an hour before the lawyer's call to the MIASS, the defense side was informed that on Monday the deadline for familiarization with the materials of the fraud case, in which Nikolai Sandakova is accused, expires.
We will remind, in relation to Nikolai Sandakova, two criminal cases have been initiated.
Within the framework of the first (the case of fraud) he is charged with a promise of 1.5 million rubles to assist in the appointment of the mayor of Magnitogorsk to the head of the administration of Ozersk Evgeny Tarasov.
The second criminal case concerns the bribe Nikolai Sandakov allegedly received from the director of the Piton Company Igor Kalugin in the form of illegal provision of services of a property nature in the amount of at least 1.3 million rubles.

The Russian Copper Company (RMK) is ready to take on social responsibility and pay more attention to the environmental aspects of its business.
This is confirmed, for example, by the fact that the RMK has undertaken to modernize one of the country’s oldest and environmentally “dirty” enterprises – the Karabakh Honeycomb.
The Carabash Honey Smelting Plant was founded by an English stock company headed by Leslie Urkwart in 1910.
In Soviet times it was a significant industrial enterprise for the economy of the country, and it actually provided the life of the whole city.
However, in the 1990s due to financial problems, production was halted, which led to serious social problems in Karabakh.
In 1998, it was decided to resume work of the Karabakh Honeycomb.
It was also necessary to solve one of the main problems of the Karabakh plant - environmental.
By the early 2000s, Karabach was already sadly known as an environmental disaster zone.
The situation at Karabashmedi began to change in 2004, after the enterprise was transferred to the management of the Russian copper company.
The company began to carry out the modernization of production, which began to gradually reduce the environmental burden on the environment.
This was recently noted by the governor of the Chelyabinsk region, Boris Dubrovsky, who visited Karabakh in early July.
The head of the Southern Ural called the huge changes that have occurred with the enterprise since "Karabashmed" moved into the group of RMK.
The main event for the modernization of Karabashmedi in recent years has been the construction of a new sulfuric acid workshop, which allows to capture up to 99.9% of metallurgical gases.
According to the president of the Russian copper company Vsevolod Levin, the volume of investments in this project amounted to about 7 billion rubles.
The next stage of the modernization of ZAO "Karabashmed" is the reconstruction of the conversion plant.
The replacement of three converters, vacuum cleaners and gas pipelines is planned for the end of 2017.
The cost of the project is 2.5 billion rubles.
In addition, at the end of 2016 it is planned to launch a new factory for the treatment of industrial waste at the cost of 1 billion rubles.
In turn, the amounts of taxes deducted into the city budget of Karabas will also increase.
For the entire duration of the implementation of the Tominsky GOK project - from the beginning of construction to the commissioning of the second row - the federal fine will receive 8.9 billion rubles.
And after the introduction of GOK into operation, the income of taxes in the budgets of all levels can amount to 80.9 billion rubles.
For the year of production work in the Varna district, the budgets of different levels are listed 346,3 million rubles.
And that's for the first year.
"The longer the enterprise works successfully, the amount of deductions may be more," - added Valery Ulanovsky.
The RMK clarified that in 2015 the tax deductions from the Mikheev GOK were approximated to 1 billion rubles.
However, the participation of RMK enterprises in the life and development of the territories of their presence is not limited to tax deductions.
RMC enterprises help to repair and maintain schools, kindergartens, sports facilities, to build cultural and entertainment facilities, to improve the territory.
In 2016, one of the largest social projects of the Russian copper company in Karabakh was a major repair, and in fact - the almost complete renovation of the kindergarten N9 for 95 pupils.
The building, built in 1960, was in a state of emergency.
Also on the territory of "RMK Arena" there will be a landscape park with an artificial pond, underground and underground parking spaces for 600 cars, cafes and sports shops.
"RMK Arena" will allow to conduct spectacular professional sporting events of international level.
But the main task of this project is to make physical education and sports in comfortable conditions accessible to the inhabitants of Chelyabinsk, primarily for children.

WSJ: The U.S. is considering imposing sanctions against Russia for hacking the servers of Democrats.
U.S. officials are considering the imposition of new sanctions against Russia in response to the hacking of the Democratic Party’s servers, the Wall Street Journal writes, citing sources.
It is reported that in order to impose sanctions, the administration of US President Barack Obama will have to formally accuse of attacking Russian servers or Russian-backed hackers.
According to the sources, the FBI and other U.S. intelligence agencies are almost certain of Russia’s involvement in the cyber attack.
WSJ notes that the U.S. usually prefers not to name those who carry out hacking attacks.
The exception is a 2014 hack of the Sony Entertainment Pictures database, for which responsibility was officially assigned to the DPRK.
Last year, however, Obama issued a decree that simplifies the procedure for imposing sanctions on those who carry out or promote cyberattacks.
It was originally aimed at China, but could also be used against other countries.
The decision-making process on sanctions can be lengthy, writes the publication.
Even if officials came to the conclusion that the hackers acted with the support of Russia, before deciding to disclose the information they will have to weigh the possible consequences.
They have to determine whether the incident is so serious that it exacerbates the tensions in the bilateral relationship.
Earlier it was reported that the Obama administration allows the possibility of sanctions against the state, whose hackers hacked the servers of the National Committee of the Democratic Party.
WikiLeaks has published an e-mail from the National Committee of Democrats.
The media reported that hackers working with the Russian authorities could be involved in the hack.
In the Kremlin, such messages were called absurd.
FAS fined Google almost half a billion rubles
The reason was a violation of competition in the mobile app market.
The anti-monopoly trial was initiated on the initiative of Yandex.
The Russian company claimed that Google provides smartphone manufacturers with access to Android components under conditions that prohibited the pre-installation of apps from other developers, in particular from Yandex.
The FAS found confirmation of these claims and found that the company abused the dominant position in the market and imposed on mobile device manufacturers the installation along with the Google Play store of other apps.
According to the results of the check, the Federal Antimonopoly Service has decided to punish Google, Deputy Head of the FAS Alexey Dotsenko said.
The fine must be paid within 60 days of the entry into force of the decree.
The FAS concluded that the law on competition protection must be respected by all companies, including transnational corporations.
In turn, Google intends to first study the solution and only then determine with further actions: to execute it or to challenge it.
The Federal Antimonopoly Service recognized the company as a violation of the competition law back in September last year and prescribed to adjust the contracts until December 18.
However, Google did not agree to this.
Since then, the company and the department have been conducting legal proceedings.
The FAS noted that, despite the fine, the possibility of a world agreement is being discussed with Google.
This measure will not lead to anything.
This view was expressed by the leading analyst of Mobile research group Eldar Murtazin.
Murtazin also noted that the fine will not affect neither the users nor the competitiveness of the corporation.

The Anime Effect of Snapchat Criticized as a Caricature of Asians
Snapchat claims that this filter is inspired by anime, but some reviewers say it’s racially intact.
Using the Lenses tool, Snapchat allows about 150 million users a day to change reality and play with individuality in ways that border on absurdity.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog or a character to underpin Roy Lichtenstein’s painting.
Lenses are rough, curvatured features of tools that create more than 30 million corrected selfies a day.
Mistakes are quickly becoming commonplace.
Snapchat lenses have been criticized in the past when they were accused of promoting dark skin of the face or encouraging whitened faces as an ideal of beauty.
So when some users were offered a lens this week, which provided them with hairy eyes, curved teeth, and plump cheeks, some critics considered it a racist caricature on Asians — "yellowheads."
And they wondered if these recurring contradictions point to a more serious company’s diversity-related problem.
On Wednesday, messages and subsequent outrage spread in reports on The Verge and Motherboard, the day after Snapchat said it had removed the feature.
The company commented: the lens was designed as a tribute to the characters of the anime, not as a caricature of Asians.
But to experts who know about racism, the lens reminded the offending stereotypes in action.
Others completely rejected the comparison with the anime.
In an e-mail, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet about the photographs was actively shared, said the lens was "offensive and at least uncomfortable."
She added that “it’s hard to argue with the comparison of a very rough caricature on Asians and the effects of the filter.
This shows that the filter is not just yellowish, but to a higher degree degrading yellowish.
Snapchat is not the only company that crosses these cultural bridges.
American culture seems to be involved in an endless struggle for diversity and inclusiveness, ranging from corporate meeting rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all carry with us.
And the huge audience of young people on Snapchat — who are more racially diverse than their older generation — may mean they’re more likely to be expected to understand.
When one of Snapchat’s lenses creates an image that is offensive to the user, then, 25-year-old Katie Zhou said in an interview on Thursday, “it’s much harder to stay unnoticed as it was before.”
On Thursday, Zhou, a product manager and engineer who works at Medium, decided to remove her Snapchat account and urged others to do the same.
In an article for Medium and in a telephone interview, she said that she believes racial contradictions are the cause of insufficient diversity in recruiting personnel in Snapchat.
Zhu criticized the predominantly white management of the company, which consisted only of men, and ended her article with a hashtag: <0x23>DeleteSnapchat.
Zhou, who is an American of Chinese descent, wrote: “Either they didn’t have enough white people in the state who could make such decisions, or they have white people working, but they don’t hold positions that can be safely and openly stated.”
Other reviewers share her point of view, expressing dissatisfaction with Snapchat not answering most of her questions.
The company does not publish information about the representation of national minorities in its state, emphasizing its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat declined to discuss the racial origin of its staff, but according to a trustee, the company recently hired a recruiter to focus on under-represented strata of the population and on active attempts to involve domestic resources.
Zhou, for her part, said she would keep her Snapchat account closed, adding: “I wonder if they really need more users like us so they can say that’s not going to happen.”
The military leadership distorted intelligence about ISIS, reports the congressional commission
U.S. Central Command officials have altered intelligence reports to present a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, rather than giving grounds for the event on the spot, the congressional commission said in a report released by Reuters.
The Interim Report of the Task Forces of the States, established by the Republican Chairs of the Committee of Representatives on Military Affairs, the Intelligence Committee and the Subcommittee on Military Assignments, has found "widespread dissatisfaction" among analysts.
The Central Command, known as the Center, is the main military command in the city of Tampa, Florida, which controls U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
“The intelligence documents approved by the Centcom High Command generally gave a more optimistic picture of U.S. counter-terrorism actions than is confirmed by real data from the place of events, and were more stablely optimistic than the analysis provided by others.”
“What happened in Centcom is unacceptable: when the top leadership is presented with an unreliable analysis, our military suffers,” said Ken Calvert, a member of the House of Representatives, a Republican from California.
Problems with management in Centcom reach the very top of the organization.
The ten-page report describes in detail the shortcomings that have arisen in 2014 and 2015 in describing and analyzing the US actions aimed at training the Iraqi Armed Forces provided by the Central Command.
Although it does not contain definitive evidence that members of the Obama administration’s leadership have ordered to falsify the reports, it claims that analysts felt that the leadership of the Centcom is forcing them to either present a more optimistic view of the threat from the Islamic State.
“During the first half of 2015, many of the press releases, statements and testimony of the Central Command in Congress were significantly more optimistic than the actual events,” the report said.
For example, a Centcom official publicly stated that a major military attack aimed at the return of Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq’s second-largest city, remains under Islamic State control.
"After months of investigation, this is certain," House Speaker Mike Pompeo, a Republican from Kansas, said in a statement.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the U.S. Central Command’s top intelligence leadership forged the intelligence documents of the command to mitigate the ISIS threat in Iraq.
The Republicans set up an operational group when they learned that analysts had expressed concern that intelligence on the Islamic State had been falsified.
As the investigation progresses, according to a report published on Thursday, more extensive data will follow.
The additional, unfinished investigation of the Centcom intelligence is carried out by the Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Defense.
Representatives of the Democratic Party in the U.S. House of Representatives’ Intelligence Committee published their own data on Thursday, which is in line with some of the Republican operational group’s conclusions.
“Between 2014 and 2015, the Centre has created an overly closed procedure for conducting intelligence assessments of ISIS and Iraqi security forces,” said Adam B. Schiff, senior representative of the Democratic Party on the committee.
This procedure, according to Shiff, “impeded the issuance of intelligence documents,” harmed the morale of analysts and “did not adequately reflect divergent views.”
But Schiff and the Democrats say they have found no evidence that the White House has tried to force centcom analysts to adjust their findings to a “determined or political interpretation.”
The preliminary results of the congressional investigation were presented on Tuesday by the portal The Daily Beast.
Last August, The New York Times reported on the existence of an investigation by the Pentagon’s chief inspector, which was opened after complaints by analysts from the Centcom.
Lt. Commander Patrick Evans, a Pentagon representative, said in a statement that the Department of Defense would not comment on the congressional report as the Chief Inspector’s investigation continues.
But he said that “experts sometimes differ in the interpretation of complex data, and the intelligence services and the Department of Defense welcome a healthy dialogue on these vital issues related to national security.”
The consequences of the investigation go beyond the question of whether the US-led bombing in Iraq and Syria is reaching its target (as is now claimed by more and more representatives of the Department of Defense).
But last year’s statements cast doubt on President Obama’s ability to rely on the Central Command to provide accurate assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis points.
Criticism of the 2003 Islamic State probe echoes the controversy that took place more than a decade ago when Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker wrote a research article claiming that the Ishmael and Ishmael administration did not succumb to President George W. Bush because of the protests of many.
The hacker also played a key role in the protest caused by Islamic State intelligence.
Last year, according to officials, Hooker’s team came to the conclusion that, despite public statements about the reverse, the air strikes on oil refineries owned by the Islamic State, which were not owned by the Islamic State, did not cause a significant deterioration in the financial situation of the group.
But the discovery was not spread outside the Central Command, the Times reported in September.
The then commander of the Centcom, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized last year after testimony in the Senate, which many deputies considered an overly optimistic assessment of the war.
General Austin resigned in April and was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel in the Central Command.
U.S. wins women’s grass hockey four times in a row, bringing closer to a decisive fight with Britain
Having once scored three goals in a match that ended in a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam opened the account on Thursday with the first two goals for the U.S. women's grass hockey team, when the Americans won a 3-0 victory over India's team with a 1-0 draw.
Five goals in two games should be a memorable achievement, but 27-year-old Bam says she is not sure if she would ever do something like that.
“I won’t mind,” she said.
I'm not really one of those people who track their nudes.
Here’s what she knows: the American 4-0 in the Olympic tournament, and they compete for the first place in their group with Britain, which remains unbeaten after losing to Japan with an account 2-0 on Thursday.
The UK and US teams will meet on Saturday in the final game of the first round.
Both teams claim the quarter-finals, and the result of the game will determine who will take the first place in their group of six teams and who will be the second.
The winner will avoid meeting with a strong team of rivals from the Netherlands, the leaders of another group, a bit of weather when the quarter-final games begin.
However, Saturday's game shows that the Americans here made noise with their unexpected series, four years after they took the last place among the 12 teams at the London Games.
Bam was on that team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, took a grass hockey doll for the first time when she was 3 (her older twin sisters played this kind of sport at Drexel), and joined the national team at the age of 16.
She missed the 2008 Olympics when she did not pass the qualifying round in the finals.
Then came 2012, when everything didn't work out with her and her teammates.
The following year, Coage Parnham, an Englishman, was appointed coach, and everything began to change.
“Cultural change, psychological change, change in physical training,” Bam said.
In London, we didn’t have the performance that we have now.
We have completely changed our views.
On Thursday evening, Bam opened an account in the first half of the game with an uncomfortable hand at a short distance.
India approached the game without a single win in the tournament, but the team showed themselves to be surprisingly tough and kept the score 1-0 until the end of the third period, when Bam took the initiative in his hands.
She made a long pass with the ball down on the left side of the field, then spiraled into the middle and sent the ball sharply into the goal, thus giving the Americans a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez added a final goal in the middle of the fourth period.
The "dry" win was the first at the tournament for U.S. goalkeeper Jackie Briggs, who missed one goal in each of the first three wins.
She's on strike.
Like Bam.
"We're in a good position right now," Parnham said, but how good it depends on the result of Saturday's game.
In the midst of the nuisance of the Olympic Games - "Zen" jumps on a bat
Wherever you are, no matter how long it takes, it’s the Olympics.
The events in Rio de Janeiro seem unavoidable and inevitable, it is a furious combination of competition and aspiration.
Like the Olympic fire itself, there is that burning torch that passes from the bow to the swimmer, to the gymnast, to the triathlete.
You can't turn on the TV, read the newspaper, or listen to your neighbors' conversations in a queue in a cafe, and you can't hear about Simone Bails, Katie Ledeka, or the hostility between Michael Phelps and Chad de Clou.
And there's Logan Dolly.
Dolly, the first time to participate in the Olympic Games, a handsome boy with fins on his cheeks, could well be among those celebrities shown in the prime time, promoted by sponsors and life-affirming promotional videos, if he were a swimmer, gymnast or yes.
But 28-year-old Dolly from Lake Forest, California, is battling for gold in the Olympic jumping competition.
The Olympic fire does not illuminate all events in the same way.
Far from the center, partly in the shadow, are those sports that are not generally recognized: shooting from a pneumatic gun, shooting from a bow, badminton, tequila.
Brass will always be with us, his long reign.
But if I'm allowed to speak out in defense of my personal passion, let me draw your attention to the modest charm of jumping on a bat.
Although jumping on a bat is an Olympic sport since 2000, when they debuted at the Sydney Games, over the past 16 years they have received so little recognition that many of the people I interviewed were not aware that they belong to the Olympic sports at all.
It could be regional ignorance.
Although the United States sent athletes to competitions, they never won medals in jumping on a bat, and their athletes did not go to the finals until 2012.
The Chinese and Russians usually share male awards with each other, while the Chinese and Canadians are female.
Dun Dun of China and Rosie McLennan of Canada will defend their London gold medals this year.
But jumping on a bat has the charm of an outsider, in particular because for an uneducated ear it is more associated with a circus college than with the Olympic Games.
Here I have to admit that I am not an expert, but only a grounded enthusiast.
They really have comedic potential – it’s a cartoony smash of endless jumps – but also the elegance of gymnastics and jumping in the water, two kinds of sports that they basically combine.
The word "butt" comes from the Spanish word "el trampol<0xC3><0xAD>n", meaning "tramplin for jumping into the water".
Candidates for victory jump on a giant batut, flying in the air for almost 30 feet, and must perform a series of acrobatic tricks (turns, bends, and jumps) until the final landing on their feet.
They are assessed by performance, complexity and "flight time", according to the official program of the Olympic Games.
Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio.
The most common olympic course is ahead.
Candidates for the medal must go further, faster, higher and higher in the pursuit of gold, sometimes to the finish, and sometimes back and forth, over and over the field.
They aim not only for the finish line or the starting wall, but also, in the eyes of the cameras, for another annoying border: the world or the Olympic record.
This persistent pursuit is noble, admirable, even fanatical — and it is enough to make even the viewer slip away.
But I think it's a little tired of watching the games.
From him, the jumps on the bat give a breath.
The direction of the batutist is up.
Moving forward is not a goal.
He or she jumps, seems weightless, like an astronaut, flies up, then down, then effortlessly back up again.
And in them, of course, does not go without competition or difficulties, but throughout the program there is no crazy zeal to finish, no leaps in length, only a strange, graceful disappearance of time and gravity.
It is the closest Olympic sport to Zen.
Women's qualifying competitions, and then the final will be held on Friday afternoon, broadcast in one hour of the day at Eastern European time; men's - on Saturday, also at hour.
NBC will broadcast the final as part of the daily program starting at 2 p.m. on both days.
At the height of the Olympic madness, a calm, beautiful moment is expected, which can be easily seen in the common landfill.
And if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by subjecting male athletes to driven views and objectification — as, according to the Wall Street Journal, recently suggested by male gymnasts from the United States — the Dolly is just waiting for its new enchanted crowd of fans.
"Generation protests" in Ethiopia, long-time U.S. ally
Angry protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrators demanding political change in Ethiopia have been confronted with a fierce confrontation by the government.
Eyewitnesses say dozens of protesters were fatally wounded during clashes with police.
Is Ethiopia really on the brink of fragmentation?
Over the past decade, it has been one of Africa’s most stable countries, a strong ally of the West with a rapidly developing economy.
But in recent months, anti-government protests have shaken the country, spreading to an increasing number of its territories.
In the past week alone, thousands of people have taken to the streets demanding radical political changes.
According to human rights defenders, the government’s reaction was brutal.
Eyewitnesses claimed that police officers shot dozens of unarmed demonstrators.
Video footage from the protest sites, supposedly shot late last year or early this year, shows how security officers beat young people with sticks when they put their hands against the wall.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights is now calling for a thorough investigation.
“It has always been difficult to keep this country from falling apart, and it will continue to be even more difficult,” said Rashid Abdi, head of the African Horn project at the international research crisis group.
Ethiopia is the second most populous country in Africa after Nigeria, and its stability is supported by the West.
The U.S. military and intelligence services are working closely with Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats in the region, especially in Somalia, and virtually no country in Africa receives such support from the West.
Ethiopia’s economy is developing at an impressive rate.
Its infrastructure has improved significantly – there is even a new suburban train in the capital Addis Ababa.
And its streets are usually quiet, safe, and clean.
However, Ethiopia was hardly an example of democracy — human rights organizations are constantly mentioning government repressions — the opposition on the territory of the state was cut off because dissidents were actually silenced.
Many of them were sent to prison, killed, or exiled to remote deserts.
But it can change.
“If people are constantly oppressed and left no choice but to protest, the uprising will rise,” said Seyum Teshoma, a lecturer at the University of Central Ethiopia.
All young people are protesting.
The generation is protesting.
Complaints are numerous, starting with land use, ending with the seizure of power by the government coalition.
After the widely criticised elections last year, the government party and its allies have completely pushed the opposition out and now control 100 percent of parliament.
At the same time, tensions along the border with Eritrea are increasing; the struggle for this uncertain, controversial border killed hundreds of people in June.
Analysts fear that separatist groups, which have been more or less destroyed in recent years, such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, may try to exploit unrest and re-arm themselves.
A number of factors explain why bitter feelings, boiling in the depths of the soul for several years, explode now.
The first, it seems, is completely harmless: smartphones.
In the last couple of years alone, a large number of Ethiopians have been able to communicate on social networks, as cheap smartphones have become commonplace, and internet service has become better.
Even when the government shuts down access to Facebook and Twitter, as it often happens, especially during protests, many people still find the opportunity to communicate through proxy servers that hide where they are.
Several young Ethiopians said that this is how they were organized for protests.
The second is that there is more solidarity between Oromo and Amhar, the two largest Ethiopian ethnic groups.
Oromo and Amhara are not natural allies.
Over the centuries, Amhar, from Ethiopia’s predominantly Christian highlands, flourished in politics and business, exploiting Oromo, many of which are Muslims and live in lowlands.
But it also changes.
"We will act together under a single start," said Mulatu Gemechu, the leader of Oromo.
The largest protests took place in the Amharic and Oromo districts.
Many of Amhari and Oromo feel that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the Tigray ethnic group, which accounts for about 6 per cent of the population and which controls military and intelligence services, trade and politics.
The third cause of unrest is the loss of Meles Zenaoui.
Meles, a former rebel leader, served as Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years, until his death from an unknown illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could foresee danger.
Analysts claim that he was particularly skilled at identifying the first signals of discontent and using scouts to retrieve data and de-injure opponents.
"The current regime lacks common sense," said Abdi, an analyst for conflict situations.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Dessalen, appeared from nowhere and took the place of Meles.
Unlike Meles, who was native to the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam is a southerner.
Analysts say he does not trust the security services controlled by Tigray.
Many fear that as a result, it will lead to even more bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such unrest was in 2005, after thousands of people protested what analysts said appeared to have been elections that the government stalled and then falsified the results.
During the ensuing repressions, many Protestants were killed, albeit in smaller numbers than in recent months, and this period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts expressed their appreciation to Ethiopia’s leaders for the long-term development of infrastructure, such as a new intercity train and significant progress in combating poverty.
But it is clear that this has not stopped the growth of domestic dissatisfaction with the Ethiopian government.
And it takes on a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, protesters in Gondar, the city of Amhar, attacked businesses belonging to Tigray, and anti-Tigray hatred on social media is becoming widespread.
Analysts say the protesters are putting the United States and other Western allies in an uncomfortable position.
The U.S. government has used Ethiopia as a base for unmanned flights over neighbouring Somalia, although it recently announced that it has closed the base.
On the one hand, it is clear that the West wants to support democracy, but on the other hand it does not want its ally to lose power in an already unstable region.
“And it will be difficult to get through this tight rope,” Abdi said.
Donald Trump explains his statement that ISIS was founded by Obama, “sarcasm”
Donald J. Trump tried to silence the latest conflict that covered his election headquarters on Friday, claiming he joked several times this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the “founders” of the Islamic State group.
The clarification raised new questions about the ability of the Republican presidential nominee to approach the American people wisely.
It also put his deputies, who were trying to protect him during a period of unrest, in an uncomfortable position, as they had to explain statements that he probably did not mean.
Speaking at a congress on Wednesday evening, Trump resolutely insisted on his assertion on Thursday, repeating in an interview that he really wanted to say that the president and Clinton founded ISIS.
But in a post on Twitter early in the morning on Friday, Trump wrote that he was just going.
This post was the direct opposite of the claim made just the day before, when Trump said in several interviews that he was absolutely serious about his accusations.
When conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump soften his speech, reminding him that Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican nominee for president did not take advantage of the opportunity.
The latest scandal erupted when Trump tried to refocus his campaign on the economy against the backdrop of a downgrade.
Trump and Clinton spoke in competing speeches on the economy in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Trump tried to get back to the topic.
Turning to Twitter again, he warned that Clinton's plans would lead to a tax increase, and said she thought her speech was boring.
Trump has used sarcasm as an excuse.
At the end of July, after he drew general criticism, practically expressing the idea that the Russians should hack Clinton’s email, he later explained his remarks, saying, “Of course I’m joking.”
Such an approach allows Trump to go beyond what is permissible in political speech and take his words back if necessary.
“I think it’s his way of testing some of the messages that find a response among his fans, watching how they act, and then “explaining” them in one direction or another, depending on the reaction,” said Ruth Sherman, a communications expert who conducted a language analysis.
But I also think that he is cautious in his statements and knows that they are fluent enough to interpret them differently.
Instead of softening remarks for the broad electorate, Trump has taken an even more offensive tone in recent days as his rating continues to fall.
The new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist rating, published on Friday, showed that Trump is stepping down on Clinton with a large margin in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado and going with it to the level in Florida.
While Trump usually tries not to apologize for the provocative things he says, he often accuses his critics of misinterpreting his words and misunderstanding his sense of humor.
But as Trump has been the subject of increased attention in recent months of the presidential campaign, his jokes have put his loyal allies in an uncomfortable position: they have to publicly support him, no matter how provocative his remarks are.
Rudolf W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York, who is one of Trump’s most famous deputy figures, has made serious efforts to protect the candidate in an interview with CNN on Thursday.
"I think what he's saying is an acceptable political comment," Giuliani said when asked about the credibility of Trump's claim that Obama and Clinton founded the Islamic State.
This is true in the sense that before Obama, ISIS was an almost unknown little organization, he called it a non-threat, absolutely unfair, and that’s why it all happened because he pulled troops out of Iraq.
Most average Republicans believe that the Obama administration, in which Clinton held the post of Secretary of State, has allowed ISIS to thrive as it has not been able to resolve the situation in the Middle East.
Before a rally in Pennsylvania on Friday, Trump continued to attack the media on Twitter for defaming each of his words and bias toward him.
He mocked the “poor unfortunate” television experts who were trying to figure it out, and said, “They’re weak!”
Some Democrats have ridiculed Trump’s excuses as an overstatement that he is not fit for presidents.
One day, an ejected coffee shop returns to Greenpoint.
The Verb coffee shop was overcrowded, taking only cash places in Williamsberg, where there was no Wi-Fi, but served good coffee for 15 years.
Naturally, she was pushed out of her room with a showcase on Bedford Avenue.
Soup Sherry, which took the place of Verb in the summer of 2014, sells soap in the form of biscuits.
The locals complained of it as the last loss in a renovating city.
Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter: “New York is constantly changing, I know, but I still can’t believe that the CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel is destroyed, and Verb is now a soap shop.”
But even though New York is constantly changing, it in turn is being updated.
The renaissance Verb coffee shop opened in November last year in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new Verbe has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but there are still some of the same employees and a similar simple atmosphere.
And the coffee is still good.
At the head of the new "Verba" is Sisco Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez, a longtime employee of the old cafe, who is the owner and general manager of the new location.
He started working at Verbe in 2001 and was there until the very end.
When one of the clients offered to promote it in a new place, he said that he would be happy to go for it.
Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez, who is 36 years old, left a lot in his old form.
"Verb" works with the same distributor of beige and bought the same model of coffee maker.
It even installed chandeliers from the old "Verba".
But Rodriguez said he would like to experiment as well.
He offered me new meals.
The menu presents sandwiches with bacon, egg and cheese, and there are toppings from capers or fried onions.
There's a dish of brown rice.
The cafe no longer serves beer, but now freshly squeezed juices are prepared.
Nine months later, Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez said he paid attention to the steady flow of old permanent customers.
“Many former customers have also been driven by prices from Williamsberg,” he said.
In one of Rebecca Oliver's recent resurrections, she was one of those clients.
Oliviera, 34, previously lived in Williamsberg and frequented the Verb.
Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she still went there.
After the closure of Verba, she said that she had stopped drinking coffee for a while.
“I realized that it was coffee and the atmosphere that impressed me at Verbe,” she said.
Now she is drinking coffee again, although that day instead of the usual iced coffee she ordered a cup of tea, another novelty.
Tom Rosenthal, another longtime client, has been visiting Verb since 2003.
He went to work and ordered the same thing invariably.
“At fifteen minutes eight, every day, like the clock, I came in, and my bagel was made with oil and all the fillings for me,” he said.
Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez said he wanted to experiment and introduced new dishes to the menu.
Today Rosenthal still makes the usual order, but someday he will change something with the help of bacon, eggs or cheese on a beagle with all the fillings.
Rodriguez said he was not offended by the fact that the soap shop once owned an old place.
What’s more, the owners of Soup Sherry offered to make a special soap for Verba using coffee from a cold-caffeinated coffee shop as an ingredient.
“I think we might agree to their offer,” Rodriguez said.
The permanent residents of Greenpoint of Polish origin also loved this coffee shop.
One of these new customers translated the menu into Polish, and Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez said he plans to find a place for him in the showcase so that his new neighbors feel desirable.
There are other benefits to the new place.
The local juice point plans to pour on bottles and sell coffee, prepared in a cold way.
There is a possibility that the coffee shop will connect to a nearby building.
For many customers, it is enough that the new "Verb" will include their favorite dishes in the menu.
Joseph Whitt was a regular and shared that he was killed with grief when they closed.
When the coffee shop opened at a new location, Whitt said that when he came in and ordered a cup of coffee, he felt like he had come home.
“It’s been a long time since I wanted to smell that,” he said.
The depressive food of depression in the "Final Table"
In March 1933, shortly after he became president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down for dinner in the Oval Office.
As a gourmet, President Roosevelt loved fashionable Fifth Avenue dishes, such as fua-gra and Maryland turtle soup.
His menu on that day was more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, potato puree and for dessert - a pudding of blackberry.
“It was an act of culinary solidarity with the people who suffered,” said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Cow added: “It was also a message to Americans about how to eat.”
Spouses living in Brooklyn Heights are specialists in the history of food.
Koua's last book, Raghu in Chinese, was devoted to Chinese cuisine in America, and Ziegelman told the story of life in a detached apartment in the Lower East Side through food in his book, House 97 on the Street of the Fruit Garden.
Their new collaborative work, The Thin Table, which will be published by Harper on Tuesday, is the story of American food into the Great Depression.
Showing to some extent their own culinary solidarity, they met with a reporter for dinner at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a tiny simple snack bar in the Flatyron neighborhood that has been operating since 1929, the year of the Stock Exchange Crash.
Zigelman, 54, ordered cream cheese and sandwiches with pieces of olives, and Cow, 57, took turkey, potato puree and vegetable mixture.
When a reporter ordered a meat roulette, the couple considered it an appropriate starting point for a discussion of food in the Depression era.
"Roulettes have been in great demand," Zigelman said.
There was peanut roulette, liver roulette, bean roulette.
They were made from the main ingredient and inexpensive products that allowed to stretch the ingredient.
Imagine that you have eaten as much peanuts as you need for dinner.
Cow's sneezing.
“He must have been lying in his stomach with a stone,” he said.
In the years before the Depression, the American table, especially in rural areas, was a Swedish table.
Groups of women prepared for the farm workers, and the freshly baked cake was served for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to the hungry Europeans during World War I. The "Full Table" describes how the country coped with the fact that suddenly ceased to be a country of abundance.
“It was a time when food became a central, difficult topic for Americans,” Cow said, explaining why he and his wife decided to write about it.
Equally difficult was the new budget diet: mysterious dishes, such as roulettes and baked goods, became the main foods; baking is a "great way to dispose of wraps", - noted the slugs under the slugs, - because the chefs could hide unappetizing.
Fresh fruits have been replaced by cheaper dried fruits.
Meat, which has been the basis of American food for many years, has become an economically distributed luxury.
People tried strange mixtures because energy and nutritional value became more important than taste and even culinary common sense.
While researching for a book that includes recipes, Zieglerman prepared a dish of that era: a baked onion stuffed with peanut butter.
“This addition to the dining table was not a success,” Kou said.
Zigelman added: “It was very strange.”
Peanut butter is not suitable for roasted onions.
This was typical of many homemade recipes.
As never before and ever since, household specialists—including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Household Bureau from 1923 to 1943—managed the country’s eating habits.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they advised women to become “budget makers,” to take on the challenge, and turn a bunch of roasted spaghetti with carrots into delicious dishes.
"The Closed Table" is a celebration of curious historical facts.
Particularly spicy are the stories of the government’s reaction to starving citizens, for example, President Herbert Hoover’s position in the spirit of “let cakes eat.”
Publicly boasted of the simple farming craze of the state of Iowa during his childhood, he was fed as a refined millionaire, which he became.
“He liked continental cuisine, like fish with cucumber sauce,” Kou said.
He ate almost in a gilded dining room, wearing a smoking suit.
He was fantastically detached from reality.
President Roosevelt could have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor had not advised him to set an example with his own stomach.
As the book tells us, Eleanor Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who was completely uninterested in taste, and this led to the White House “consuming not only the most nasty food in Washington, but sometimes the most disgustingly cooked.”
Many of the culinary traditions of the Depression era were forgotten as soon as the country got back on its feet.
Their legacy is our constant focus on calories and nutrition, says Ziegelman, and on how science has been used in cooking.
The couple said that while writing the book, they had a better understanding of Zegelman’s mother’s eating habits – that she could not throw away food, for example.
“She was seriously afraid of a careless attitude to food,” Kou said.
Zigelman recalls: “She seriously poisoned people.”
There was one unpleasant case with prophylaxis.
When the plates at Eisenberg's were deserted, they and Coe got a dessert that they made at home: a blackberry dessert that President Roosevelt had for lunch.
“It’s called blackcurrant mousse,” Zigelman said, adding that it was a common habit to give modest recipes the goose names.
There were no whipped creams, only black pepper, some flour, sugar, water, and cinnamon.
Everyone reluctantly soaked the spoon in a viscous, brown, sticky substance.
Surprisingly, it was not bad.
Cow asked for supplements twice.
With the voice of a certain budget maker, he said to his wife: "A little ruble of Greek walnuts wouldn't have interfered here."
The arrest of the figures in the case of the mass battle in the Hovan Cemetery was extended until November 14
The Presnenskiy court has until November 14 under arrest of the figures in the case of a mass battle in the Hovansky cemetery, satisfying the relevant request of the investigation.
There are 14 people in the case as defendants.
On May 14, several hundred people from Central Asia and the North Caucasus were killed in a mass battle at the Hovan Cemetery, which resulted in the death of three people.
The former head of the cemetery Yury Chabuev and the lawyer, co-founder of the public organization "Healthy Nation" Alexander Bocharnikov have been charged with the organization of the murder.
The issue of the second pension index for 2016 could be resolved within the next two to three weeks.
This was announced on August 12 by Deputy Prime Minister Olga Golodec during a visit to the Bryansk region.
We have set specific parameters for how much pensions need to be increased in order to mitigate the inflation that exists in the country.
All calculations are made.
Now the economists are summarizing the results of the half-year, and we will complete this work within the next two to three weeks,” Golodetz quoted Interfax as saying.
Commenting on the proposed scheme of increasing the retirement age by six months each year by the head of the Center for Strategic Development Alexei Kudrin, the Deputy Prime Minister said that this issue is not considered in the cabinet.
At the end of July it became known that the Government agreed on a position on the full indexation of pension payments in 2017.
Kamensky and Grigoryan went to the final of the competitions for shooting from a small-caliber rifle.
Russian athletes Sergei Kamensky and Kirill Grigoryan have passed the final of the competitions for shooting from a small-caliber rifle from the position of lying at the Olympic Games in Brazil.
According to TASS, Sergei Kamensky scored 629 points and took the first place - it is a new Olympic record in qualification.
Kirill Grigoryan was second - 628.9 was.
In total, eight of the best athletes were in the final.
Kamensky is a world record holder in this discipline (633).
Turkish opposition leader Fethullah Gülen is demanding an international investigation into the circumstances of the attempted coup d'état in Turkey.
“I demand that an independent international commission conduct an investigation into the attempted coup d’état,” Giuliana told the French newspaper Le Monde.
The Turkish opposition leader also said that “if any part of the accusations is confirmed, I will return to Turkey.”
However, Gülen denies participation in the coup d'état in any way, stressing that his organization never claimed political power.
The court in Istanbul has previously deliberately arrested the opposition Islamic preacher Fethullah Gülen.
The attempted military coup took place in Turkey on the night of July 15-16.
Gilead Companies Will Reimburse Costs of Lawyers During Hepatitis C Patent Dispute With Merck
Gilead Sciences Inc. is entitled to reimbursement of the costs of the legal services it has incurred in connection with a patent for a hepatitis C drug with the pharmaceutical maker Merck & Co Inc., a federal district judge has ruled.
In June Gilead was exempted from paying $200 million in damages for a violation of two patents by Merck related to Gilead's medications to sales leaders, Sovaldi and Harvoni, after a U.S. judge found a number of violations on the part of Merck.
On Thursday, U.S. Federal District Court judge Beth Labson Freeman said Gilead was entitled to reimbursement of the costs incurred during the litigation.
Merck is trying to reach Gilead, which dominates the market for a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure more than 90 percent of patients with liver disease.
The case took place in 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other, claiming their rights to the laboratory work that underlies sofosbuvir, the active ingredient of Gilead’s medicines.
The Armed Forces, created with U.S. support, claim to have seized full control of Manbij from the Islamic State.
U.S.-backed armed forces seized full control of the northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border after the last remaining Islamic State militants left the city, the group's representative said on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now clearing the city after the remaining group of militants who were hiding in the city left.
They released more than 2,000 civilian hostages held by militants, Sharfan Darvish of the allied SDS military council of Manbij told Reuters.
“The city is now completely under our control, but we are conducting clean-up operations,” he told Reuters.
Clinton earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2 percent of the federal tax rate.
Hillary Clinton released her 2015 tax returns on Friday, which showed that a Democratic presidential candidate and her husband had $10.75 million in income this year and had paid an effective federal tax rate of $34 million.
In 2015, the Clintons received $1 million in donations for charity, mostly to the Clinton Foundation, former President Bill Clinton received about $5.3 million in donations for speeches, and former Secretary of State Simon & Goullah announced an income of 3 million dollars.
Potential Vice President Clinton, U.S. Senator Tim Caine of Virginia, along with his wife Anna Holton, has released tax returns in 10 years.
In 2015, they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3 per cent.
“Hillary Clinton and Tim Kane continue to set the standard of financial transparency,” Clinton’s Chief Executive Officer Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
In the exact opposite of him, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and violates his past promises to make his tax returns public.
It is common practice for candidates for U.S. presidents to publish their tax returns, although the law does not require them to do so.
New York businessman Trump and his lawyers called the State Tax Service’s check as the reason for his refusal to release his tax returns.
“Your move,” Clinton’s chief of staff, Jan Sams, wrote on Twitter, referring to the Democratic Party candidate’s declaration.
On Thursday, Trump’s special adviser Michael Cohen told CNN that he would not allow Trump to release them until the checks are over.
Critics of Trump, including Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other fellow Republicans in 2012, said his refusal raises questions about his condition, his charitable contributions, his business operations and other ties, including with Ro.
Clinton took hold of the issue and released an online video on Friday, which focused on prominent Republicans who had persuaded Trump to release a tax return on the issue.
On Thursday, she raised the issue during a speech on the economy in Michigan.
“He refuses to do what everyone has done, without exception, a presidential candidate for decades: to publish his tax returns,” she said.
The Politico newspaper reported that Trump paid no or almost no taxes for two years in the 1990s, and a business analyst for the New York Times on Friday cited many tax lawyers and accountants as believing that maybe the cases still exist.
The federal tax rates became the subject of controversy in the presidential elections.
Clinton backed a rule named in honor of billionaire investor Warren Buffett, which would ensure that people who earn more than $1 million a year would pay a tax rate of at least 30 percent.
President Barack Obama also backed the proposal.
At a meeting with Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate is based there, asked Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said he was also under the control of the IRS, and that Trump was "afraid" not of the tax collection agency, but of voters.
Clinton’s election office has released tax returns until 2007, according to the report.
The Clintons, who now live in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average federal tax rate of about 32 percent from 2007 to 2014 and an effective aggregate tax rate of about 40.5 percent.
The Clinton Declaration for 2015 showed that, unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income came from salaries.
Their main investment was an inexpensive index fund, and the Clintons reported dividends and capital income of $109,000.

Condoms with chili powder and fireworks increase the protection of Tanzanian elephants
Environmental activists in Tanzania use an unconventional way to prevent elephants from entering the settlements – dropping condoms filled with chili powder into them.
The method proved to be effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which came up with this idea a few years ago, together with the U.S. Committee on Conservation of Nature, took over its promotion, training volunteers in the villages of northern Tanzania to be able to use non-violent, non-violent, non-violent, non-violent.
In the past, many people used spears to protect themselves.
On Friday, World Elephant Day will be dedicated to animal protection.
“Since we’ve invented a set of tools ..., we’ve been seeing a change in attitudes within these communities, as a result of which they’re much more confident that they’ll be able to avoid letting elephants into their fields without harming elephants,” said Beemde Dregui, executive director of the company.
The first two steps consist of igniting the torch before the crossing of the border with the elephant and sending signals using the horn.
If he failed to deter, the so-called “Chile Cloud” is dropped.
The chili powder mixed with the soil is placed with the cotton in the condom, and its end is screwed, only the filler remains outside.
When igniting, the condoms are blown with peanuts, spraying a small powder of chili powder into the air.
One dungeon is usually enough to roll the elephant in the other direction.
The ultimate measure is a launch device that fires Roman candles into the air, producing a loud, bright explosion.
32 Turkish diplomats have not yet returned to Turkey, who left the country after the coup attempt in July this year.
Such data was brought to the head of the Turkish Foreign Ministry Mevlut Cavusoglu in a conversation with local journalists.
In the first phase, we recalled 208 personnel diplomats to continue working in the centre.
Of these, 32 people did not return without objective reasons and explanations," the head of the Turkish foreign policy ministry said.
In July, there was an attempted coup d’état in Turkey.
The country's authorities have officially declared that the coup d'état has failed, and have also reported arrests of more than 6,000 people, among them the military ranks of the upper and middle units.
As a result of the attempted coup d'état, according to the Turkish Foreign Ministry, 290 people died.
The Jewish director sharply criticized the Berlin hotel for removing the telephone code of Israel at the "request" of the Arabs — reported RT News channel
A French filmmaker of Jewish origin unleashed a scandal in the media, finding that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin does not have Israel's phone code on its list, with officials citing "requests" from Arab customers.
Claude Lantzman, the author of the documentary about the Holocaust "The Show", expressed his dissatisfaction with the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin, writing an open letter in the German media FAZ.
During his recent stay at the hotel, Lanzman tried to find Israel in the list of phone codes provided to the hotel.
The country, however, was not mentioned among the states where you can call directly from the room.
How could it have happened that in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, Israel was excluded and exterminated?
Written by Lancman.
In return, Kempinski Bristol provides the opportunity to dial Israel through its own telephone service center.
In search of an explanation, the director raised this question at the hotel administration stand.
The response he received there, according to Lanzman, “shocked him.”
The hotel clerk said the measure was "a deliberate decision of the Kempinski hotel chain management."
The reason behind this move has provoked even more anger from the director.
“Most of our guests are Arabs, and they have demanded that the Israeli code be removed,” Lanzman, a hotel official, said.
Israel’s ambassador to Germany, Jacob Hadas-Handelsman, called the case a “terrible disgrace,” according to the Suddeutsche Zeitung.
We were shocked and shocked by the incident.
This is, in fact, a terrible disgrace.
What has happened in Germany, and in this hotel chain, is even more shameful.
There is no need for explanation here.
We expect the hotel to make the right conclusions,” the official said.
The case caused a lot of resonance on the internet; people called it a scandal.
Some have argued that the Kempinski Hotel simply “walked on” the alleged demands of Arab customers.
"We would be ashamed," another post said, indicating that the hotel, located on the famous Kurfurstendamm street, is located near the synagogue.
The hotel itself hastened to rebut any charges, calling the incident a "disappointment" and apologizing to Lanzman, reports the newspaper Der Spiegel.
“There was no direct order not to include Israel in the quick-release list,” said Kempinski Hotel representative for the Suddeutsche Zeitung.
She adds that the code has now been added.
Police use tear gas and rubber bullets against protesting Brazilian students <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Students clashed with police in the Brazilian city of S<0xC3><0xA3>o Paulo on Thursday when they gathered to protest against government reforms of the state education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the protesters.
The riots began when police officers tried to disperse students, as a result of which the police used rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstration to express their concerns about the plans.
According to the proposals of the governor of the state of S<0xC3><0xA3>o Paulo, Geraldo Alckmin will close nearly 100 public secondary schools, and 300,000 students will be redistributed to save money.
Some of the protesters could be seen writing graffiti on the walls directed against the acting president, Michael Temer.
The latest protest came just days after protesters took to the streets to support the deposed president, Dilma Russef, when the country’s Senate voted in favour of her impeachment.
Trade between Russia and Iran increased by 71%, according to the portal RT Business
With the lifting of trade sanctions between Moscow and Tehran, trade increased by 70.9 percent compared to the previous year, according to Russian Ambassador to Iran Levan Jagaryan.
As international sanctions against Iran have been lifted, there is a growing interest on the part of Russian firms in conducting business in the country, the ambassador said.
Russian companies are renewing ties with Iran, and new firms are ready to gain access to the market.
Of course, further expansion of trade is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran,” Jagaryan said.
He noted that in the first five months of 2016, the trade turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to 856 million dollars.
In particular, Russian exports to Iran increased by 91.5 per cent and amounted to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 per cent, to 158 million dollars.
The increase in trade was achieved thanks to the supply of machinery, land vehicles and weapons,” the ambassador said.
Jagaryan also predicts that a record number of Iranian tourists will visit Russia this year.
Last year, Russia’s diplomatic mission in Iran issued about 35,000 visas, mostly tourist visas, to Iranian citizens.
In addition, for the first time, Iran entered the top 20 countries by the number of tourists visiting Russia.
“We can say with confidence that last year’s record of the number of Iranian tourists who visited Russia will be broken,” he said.
At the same time, relatively few Russians visit Iran, which the ambassador hopes will change.
“I personally recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Jezd, where the monuments of ancient Persian civilization are preserved in good condition,” he said.
The state continues to screw nuts in the defense-industrial complex.
The reason for the dismissal was the “systematic failure” of the mandates of the CEO of the group “Almaz-Antey”, “out of work” and “loss of trust”.
Gennady Bendersky has been appointed head of NGOs for the next three years.
Information about the dismissal of Neskorodov appeared only on Thursday evening and did not cause a wide resonance in the media.
What is the reason for such silence in the conditions of large-scale rearmament of the army?
Most likely, the leadership of the Russian Federation does not want to spread any rumors or negative assumptions in the public environment.
This once again confirms that there are many problems with the defense-industrial complex (OPC) and the state does not want to attract increased attention from society.
The removal of Neskorodov is undoubtedly an important event from the point of view of ordering the industry.
The NGO "Almaz" is the main enterprise of the group, which specializes in the production of air-to-missile complexes (air-to-air and ground-based missile systems).
Currently, Diamond is working on the creation of the Polyment-Redut and Morpheus reconnaissance missiles, which are planned to be installed on new corvettes, frigates, destroyers and cruisers.
The founder of the portal Military Russia Dmitry Kornev believes that the dismissal of Neskorodov is due to the interruption of deadlines on these projects.
This version is the most logical.
For example, the development of Morpheus began in 2007, and the implementation was expected in 2013.
Polyment-Redut should become the main air defense system on the newest navy ships.
According to the information I am getting, in a few years of testing, not a single really successful test has been done.
However, as far as I can judge, it is not the unequivocal fault of the Almaza,” Kornev said.
The expert fears that a delay with entry into service may also occur with the S-500.
Experimental and design work on the project has not yet been completed, but during 2016 the first complexes should enter the troops.
The Ministry of Defense assures that “work is planned and everything will be completed within the set deadlines”, although in 2014, the department recognized problems with the development of the S-500.
It is extremely difficult to assess the professional qualities of Neskorodov, who has been running the Diamond since 2011.
Kornev noted that interruptions in the deadlines for the projects could be both the reason and the reason for the dismissal.
In his opinion, it has become extremely difficult in recent years to obtain information about internal processes in the OPC and business management plans.
The industry has received long-term orders for tens of billions of rubles, and big money is known to love silence.
As a rule, the directors of defense companies leave the positions at their own will, under the agreement of the parties or are transferred to another job.
In this case, the removal took place in public, although it did not receive a resonance.
This leads to the idea that the head of the "Almaza" was perhaps a stroppy figure and resisted the "slips" dropped from the top.
It seems that the state no longer intends to accept such behavior.
In the hands of shareholders, it will remove those who prefer to argue with the installations of the Ministry of Defense and do not carry out the assigned tasks.
At the same time, the leadership of the Russian Federation seeks to punish the found managers (the machinations on the shipyard "Zvezda").
Higher attention to the problems of the sector is given by the President personally.
Vladimir Putin heads the Military-Industrial Commission and periodically holds meetings on re-arming.
The Kremlin defends the ranks of OPEC leaders, seeking to have at hand a loyal cast of directors who will carry out the orders received from the top.
This is far from ideal politics, but against the backdrop of corruption and the lack of normal competition in the OPC, the state does not have other instruments.
The situation in defense, of course, is not catastrophic, but the current geopolitical situation stimulates the Kremlin to put the armed forces in order as soon as possible.
In parallel with the “cleansing” of managers in the OPC, the leadership of the Russian Federation is taking quite successful steps to increase the professionalism of Russian troops.
The personnel of the army acquired a new quality with the coming to the post of Minister of Defense Sergei Shoigu.
It seems that the president took on armament the famous saying, “If you want peace, get ready for war.”
During the Cold War, the military power of the USSR and the nuclear parity achieved in the 1970s led to the conclusion of the Helsinki Pact, which secured Moscow's sphere of influence on the continent.
With all the shortcomings of the bipolar system, it worked quite effectively.
Evidence of this was the absence of wars on the European continent and a relatively stable situation in the Middle East.
The celebration of the “winners” in the Cold War eventually turned into a strengthening of international terrorism.
After a series of terrorist attacks in Europe and the United States in a “civilized world,” there may not be a single quiet corner left.
Despite the general trouble, the West refuses to talk to Russia at the level of an equal partner.
In such circumstances, the only allies of our country remain the fleet and the army.
The strengthening of military power will allow Moscow to defend national interests more effectively and to rise to the new frontiers of world politics.
Scotsman Callum Skinner wrestles on the final straight, resulting in the British capturing bicycle gold
Scottishman Callum Skinner ran for a triumph in the men's team sprint at the Rio bike race last night, as a result of which the UK team trio defended their title from London in 2012.
The 23-year-old Glasgow native was in the role of the strongest that his Scottish friend Sir Chris Hoy had made his own, and the young man proudly entered history, scrolling down the finish line to win the favourite team from New Zealand.
Britain claimed the right to an unexpected victory four years ago, winning when Hoy claimed the right to a fifth of its six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated the trick after finishing modestly sixth at the March World Track Cycling Championships in London, despite Hoy's career ending since then.
The issue between Beijing and London was the replacement of Jamie Staff.
They did just that at the time when the Hindus appeared.
Hoi's departure also created a void that Keane Emadi and Matt Krempton tried to fill.
Skinner was a man who was held by British coaches when he saw the potential in Scotland that was now being realized.
Hindes, Kenny – the champions from Hoy four years ago – and Skinner set an Olympic record in qualifying, but the norm was outperformed by New Zealand in the first round.
And the British trio won the gold duel.
Hindes was right behind after his round, but Kenny pushed the team forward, and Skinner supported.
The change of strategy was a big part of the transformation, where Hindes drove on a larger transmission to slow down and allow Kenny and, in particular, Skinner to keep pace.
Hoi watched from his seat as a guest BBC expert and caught the eye of Skinner, Kenny, and Hindes as they entered the pedestal.
The 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said, “This is a step-by-step comparison.”
I'm here to do my best and make a name for myself.
We set an Olympic record in the final and beat the world champions.
That was unbelievable.
There is no better way to win.
After a triumph in London in 2012, along with Kenny and Hoy, Hindes admitted to intentionally falling onto the track after a failed start.
He later declined to comment, and there was no way to appeal from the UK's competitors.
There was no such question this time in the greatest victory.
Hindes said: “I felt like I was in London, with all those flags of Great Britain on the stand.”
We've all met as a team in the last three months.
We lost in so many world-renowned races that winning the Olympics again was just amazing.
It is one event, one gold medal for the country, which has won seven of the 10 names of the races in both Beijing and London.
If this is the barometer of progress made in the last five months, then the bike is waiting for another five successful days.
With the form shown by Kenny, it’s not beyond the ability to imagine how he repeats Hoi’s feat by winning three Olympic gold medals in one Games.
This would allow us to see how Kenny — who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (it seems to be a sacred date in British sport, which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) — brings his shyness to the scene.
It would be like Hoi.
The next time Kenny competes in a sprint, which starts today and is played for three days.
A 28-year-old from Bolton said, “I’m just enjoying it right now.
Team competitions are always the best.
You're here to win with your comrades.
It's a little lonely to win alone, if you're honest.
Hindes said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he must get a knighthood."
It was the only one for the day of the medal draw, but there was good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owen Doll are qualified for the fastest four-kilometre team pursuit race in four.
They finished at 3:51,943.
The world record for winning gold in London in 2012 is 3:51,659.
The first round and final (10:42 p.m.) will take place today, on the second day of the event, where Wiggins will definitely be in the spotlight.
He had a discussion with the commissioners yesterday, on the eve of the qualifying check-in, when officials asked him to measure his weight.
In the corresponding women’s event, which resumes and concludes tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rosell Sand, Eleanor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milnave improved the world record by showing a time of 4:13,260.
The UK team has come to the conclusion that it relies on a powerful team of cyclists to take possession of the average period of the Olympic Games and earn a lot of medals.
After in fact exceptional demonstrations of total supremacy in Beijing and London, expectations weakened in the gradual preparation for Rio.
There were dramas in the background, not least the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April due to allegations of sexism and harassment, and the resignation of major figures such as Hoy and Victoria Pendelton.
However, based on the first evening race on the bike, it seems that the legendary glory of Britain now in reaching the tops at the right time may just be repeated again.
The future of the Portland metallurgical plant under threat due to the termination of the contract for electricity
The future of the portland aluminum plant in Victoria — as well as the jobs of hundreds of workers — is at risk because the electricity company that supplies the plant, according to one of the plant owners, is going to issue a deal to dissolve the supply contract: everything is planned.
This move follows a decision taken earlier this year by the Government of Victoria not to extend the subsidies granted to support the operation of the plant.
The fixed subsidy for 20 years expires in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs could be threatened at the Alcoa plant in Portland.
As many as 2,000 jobs, both directly and indirectly, could be at risk from any closure.
There may also be additional indirect consequences, as the metallurgical plant consumes about 10 percent of all electricity produced in Victoria.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the metallurgical plant in Point Henry, which led to the closure of the power plant in England last year.
Alcoa’s portland metallurgical plant is losing money and risking closure.
These actions were the result of reflections on the future of the plant, which have been going on for several years, initially due to strong positions of the Australian dollar, and later - due to the price of the plant's products.
AGL, which supplies a large aluminum plant with electricity from its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, said it expects the other three owners to also take steps to terminate the contract.
The controlling stake in the plant belongs to the short-term joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, while the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese company Marubeni Corp own smaller shares.
“AGL expects the Portland facility to continue to operate, meaning that the physical demand for electricity from the metallurgical plant will not stop,” she said.
According to AGL, the contracts mentioned are so-called “hedged contracts” that were to come into force in November 2016.
Contracts have a 12-month termination period, so they actually expire in 2017.
“Accordingly, AGL still expects these contracts to bring its share of revenue in the 2017 financial year,” the company said in a statement.
Any potential impact on AGL’s profits from the 2018 financial year is currently limited to forecasts for a strong futures market for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL said it had already reduced the amount of contracts in its accounts by $187 million in the form of an “imminent termination”.
According to Alcoa, the decision to terminate the contracts “does not affect Alcoa’s ability to operate a metallurgical plant or provide electricity to a metallurgical plant.”
The U.S. company said it had signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which was due to enter into force in November this year, but it still has to explain why it terminated the contract.
Analysts feared a possible closure of both the Portland metallurgical plant in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to the unfavourable economic situation in the industry.
Addressing analysts earlier this week, AGL’s Chief Operating Officer Steven Mikkelsen said that Portland uses about 600 megawatts of energy each year, while Tomago uses about 900 megawatts.
If both of these plants leave the market, there will be a significant drop in demand in the [electricity] market.
For us, as a producer, it will be bad,” he said.
Not only the reality show star Kardashian, Kendall on the cover of the September issue of Vogue
Kendall Jenner, a 20-year-old model and the fourth daughter of the Kardashian-Jenner clan, Chris’s mother-manager, appeared on the September cover of American magazine Vogue.
Kendall, who is the face of the Estee Lauder brand and debuted at fashion weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, reported the news in her Instagram account on Thursday.
“When I was in the room with my favorite people, I looked at this cover and cried,” Kendall wrote.
The news about the cover was accompanied by a strange (or simply in the spirit of "The Kardashian Family"?), prepared reality video, in which the whole Kardashian-Jenner family (debossili Rob and Caitlyn, also a member of the band, "the most beloved uncle"
It's a standard storyline of almost all episodes of children's television shows dedicated to their birthday (Secrets utters the phrase, "Did you think we forgot about you?" with the sincerity of the cartoon rabbit's other half or so from the show at 8am), but Chris needed this one to be praised.
Because with this episode dedicated to the September issue of Vogue, we’ve undoubtedly entered the new era of the Kardashian show.
Let older sister Kendall Kim also get on the cover of Vogue earlier (she appeared on it with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the September cover of the magazine is an accomplishment in itself.
The September issue is the best-selling Vogue issue of the year.
Thickness is more like a gift edition than a fashion magazine, the publication attracts a huge number of advertisers (according to the portal Fashionista, 615 pages of last year’s 832-page edition contained advertising).
News about who of the stars will get on its cover is expected with such impatience that in the last two years photographs of the magazine merged before the official announcement.
Among the previous women on the cover included Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelist and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have certainly been more "celebrities who work with models" on the cover than "models who are celebrities".
The Oscar winner and Dior brand face Jennifer Lawrence was featured on the cover in 2013, a year after Lady Gaga’s award was received.
But even in the unlikely case, if Jenner, who the magazine described as the "prominent model" of his generation, falls into the first category, she's in good company.
These celebrities are not relatives of celebrities, reality show stars, or modern-day kids who know how to make a good video on Snapchat (although Jenner falls into all of these categories).
They are truly talented women who thrive in the entertainment industry.
For Beyoncé, who appeared on the cover last year, this year was one of the most successful in her career due to the release of the album Lemonade.
Of course, not everyone is happy with Jenner's success.
Jenner’s position in the fashion world, given her past star of the reality TV show, has always had to remain shy.
In June, one of Victoria's Secret's first models, Stephanie Seymour, criticized Jenner and her colleague Jiji Hadid for calling them "the darts of the moment".
These moods were again blurred after news of Jenner's appearance on the cover of Vogue.
But it makes no sense to focus on dissatisfaction.
Kendall Jenner on the cover of the September issue of Vogue.
She is a supermodel in every sense of the word.
She's paraphrasing for Mark Jacobs.
She's selling you tone cream from Estee Lauder.
She, and all her sisters, sell you their photos in their own apps, available on a paid subscription.
She sells hand-picked photos of Cindy Crawford’s daughter to Love magazine.
And in her spare time, perhaps still to be seen with her sister Courtney and her children, she participates in a reality TV show.
Public Law Centers Refuse to Serve 160,000 Persons a Year
Each year, more than 160,000 under-protected populations refuse to serve in public legal centres, as the sector is preparing for the effect that will further cut funding to and thus already on the brink of potential activities.
In Queensland, three out of five people — mostly elderly, immigrants, unprotected workers, victims of violence, people who are not able to fight unfair deprivation of property, and so on — have already been refused in an attempt to obtain free legal aid and representation.
Public legal services, which are already operating outside of capacity, are preparing for further cuts.
As of June next year, these legal centres are expected to lose an additional 30 percent of federal funding.
James Farrell, the director of Queensland’s Public Law Centers, said that according to the latest National Association of Public Law Centers census, thousands of people are already being rejected each year.
Farrell said that if the federal government’s decision is not reversed, the situation will only get worse.
“Queensland’s public legal centres are constantly receiving insufficient funding: this means thousands of people are being denied vital services they need,” he said.
People who leave a violent relationship, people with unmanageable and devastating debts, families who go through a divorce, workers who are unfairly fired — all of these people have problems of a legal nature, and this report shows that they can’t get the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by 30 percent as of June 2017, meaning thousands of less-protected Queenslanders will be forced to solve complex legal issues without assistance.
We call on the Minister of Justice and Senator of Queensland, George Brandis, to immediately cancel these funding cuts so that people can get the help they need when they face legal issues.
Last year, the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise the funding of free legal aid to the country's average.
Now it is time to pay attention to the needs of public legal centers and communities, their clients, and the Palashchuk government to invest in this important work.
Donald Trump’s election headquarters were sued after an employee allegedly threatened with a pistol
According to reports from New York, Donald Trump’s election headquarters was sued: The headquarters allegedly did nothing after it was reported that his North Carolina operations director threatened a gunman while they were driving in a jeep in February.
The incident was described in a lawsuit filed Wednesday in a state court in Charlotte by Vincent Bordini, a former software instructor at the state's election headquarters.
Bordini said he had waited several months for the problem to be resolved internally, but realized that “this will not happen.”
Director Earl Phillip "removed the pistol, put his right index finger on the cursor, and directed the duo to Vincent's knee cup," Bordini said in a complaint.
After complaining to the local and regional administration of the election headquarters, Bordini realized that at least four more people had become participants in similar incidents with Phillip, according to the circular.
"The guns don't have to be fired to cause damage," Bordini said in a complaint.
The lawsuit took place just two days after a Republican presidential candidate made a fuss, telling listeners in North Carolina that "the people of the Second Amendment" - understood as the proprietors of guns and his fans - will be able to take action if his opponent.
Trump’s election headquarters said the media had taken his words out of context and that he did not speak out in support of violence.
In his complaint, Bordini demanded compensation from the election headquarters for negligent control, and from Phillip for the threat of physical violence, harassment, and moral harm.
Trump's spokesman Hope Hicks is slowing down with a response to the request to comment.
Attempts to talk to Phillip were unsuccessful.
The WCCB, a local news partner in Charlotte, said Phillip had recently left the election headquarters.
In response to a call to his consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services, no one called back quickly.
Presidential candidate from the Republican Party, Donald Trump, has run a controversial campaign.
Case: Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court, Mecklenburg County High Court (Charlotte).
Britain must direct the Olympic spirit in the right direction and expand the Heathrow.
Heathrow will also bring resurgence and prosperity not only in our local settlements and throughout London, but also throughout the country.
As far as I’m concerned, that was a huge advantage for Heathrow, just as it was for London 2012, where we made every effort to get our peoples and regions to benefit from the Games.
The Olympic Games have brought huge benefits to Stratford and East End.
And we're going to do it again, creating opportunities for locals and businesses near Heathrow.
Only for our local settlements will we create 10,000 new internships, 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment around the airport.
Just as it was before London 2012, there will be those who think the task of expanding the Heathrow is too large.
“I was told that Britain would never be ready for the Olympics and that we would find ourselves in a difficult position on the world stage.
The skeptics made a mistake in 2012 and will prove them wrong about Heathrow.
There are always obstacles that need to be overcome, but Heathrow answers any question asked about him.
Like the Olympic Games, the Heathrow is an infrastructure project for most people, not just for a narrow circle.
Expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, <0xC2><0xA3>211 billion of economic growth, leaving a legacy of skills and jobs both around the airport and across the UK.
We have a wonderful team in Heathrow, which has implemented the program of <0xC2><0xA3>11 billion of infrastructure investments in a timely and budget, from T5 – selected as the best terminal of the airport for five years in a row, to T2, built in the middle of the two busiest in the world.
Now they are ready to provide the third runway, which has been confirmed by <0xC2><0xA3>16 billion of private investment.
The 2012 London Olympics have been a huge success for the UK, and I am sure that the expansion of the Heathrow will be as well.
It’s time for us to take the Olympic spirit in the right direction and expand Heathrow, securing our trade future and creating a legacy of skills and jobs that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Dayton – Chairman of the Board of Heathrow and Former Trade Attaché of the Treasury
Adblock Plus, Facebook play "cat-mouse" about blocking ads
For companies that make money from online advertising, trying to bypass ad blocking software is a “cat-mouse” game, according to one of the companies that creates such software.
On Thursday, literally a few days after Facebook announced it was going to block ad blockers on its desktop site, Adblock Plus posted a blog entry that said users can update their filters in the program to block ads on social media.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that the desktop version of the site is changing the ranks around its advertisements so that ad blockers find it harder to recognize which parts of the page are advertising.
But Adblock now claims it was able to bypass the new code.
In a blog post, Adblock spokesperson Ben Williams wrote that “this kind of mutual struggle between the community of open-source ad blockers and those who try to bypass it continues from the moment of the ad blocking invention,” and that it is possible that Facebook will present its own solution in the near future.
The fact that the world’s largest social network has entered the fight is a clear indication of how big a problem ad blockers have become for the industry.
Around 200 million people worldwide use ad blockers, according to last year’s Pagefair and Adobe surveys; nearly four times the number of people who used such software in 2013.
With 1.3 billion daily active users accessing Facebook via mobile devices, mobile advertising now accounts for 84 percent of Facebook’s advertising revenues.
However, the company is hunting for ad blockers on the desktop version, as mobile ad blockers are ineffective in Facebook’s mobile apps for the social network and Instagram, according to the representative.
But still, advertising in the desktop version is a profitable enough article for Facebook to consider such a step a profitable investment.
Also on Thursday, Facebook announced that it is going to update its “advertising preferences” tool to give people more control over how they are targeted.
On Thursday, Facebook said that the new Adblock filters are causing concern as they will also block some non-advertising content on the site.
“This will not be a positive experience for people, and we plan to solve this problem,” a Facebook spokesperson said in an official email.
Advertising blockers are a rough tool, so instead we’ve focused on creating tools like Ad Preferences to hand control over to people.
A woman was moved on a Swiss highway in an episode of apparent suicide.
The victim was lying on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police call on witnesses after several vehicles were moved on the highway early on Thursday morning in an apparent attempt to commit suicide.
The incident took place on the A1 near Morge in the canton of Wo just after midnight on Thursday.
The woman was lying on the road in the dark "in a gesture of despair" and was hit by several vehicles, police said in a statement.
Apparently, in an attempt to kill himself, the victim, a 49-year-old Swiss woman, hit several vehicles, including a truck.
She died on the spot.
Several of the drivers involved have already been questioned, but the identity of some has not yet been established, police said, calling on them and someone else, who witnessed the incident, to respond.
A criminal case was launched, a "logical" step in such a situation, said lawyer Gilles Hofstetter Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it is yet to be determined whether any of the drivers involved will be charged.
Was it possible to avoid a hit?
That's what the prosecutor should determine," Hofstetter said.
Two other similar cases over the past five years suggest that drivers will not be held accountable.
In each case — both involving a man walking in the dark on the highway — a sentence has been issued that drivers cannot expect an accidental meeting with a pedestrian on the highway in the middle of the night, the newspaper reports.
Last year, the officer was acquitted of causing death by negligence after she hit and killed a man lying on the A1 near Payerne on the night of August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim drank and lost consciousness on the road, the court heard.
The court found that the woman policeman who responded to the emergency call was driving the vehicle in a manner that was justified, and that the presence of a man on the road was “a completely exceptional and unpredictable situation,” the judge said.
Anyone with information about the incident on Thursday near Morzh should call the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA's climate model: Venus was once habitable
Venus may have once been habitable, according to NASA’s new climate model estimates.
Scientists from the Nassau Institute for the Study of Goddard Space have developed a model for studying the past of Venus, using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climatologists.
The model was designed to determine if there could ever be conditions on Venus, with its hot water-free surface and an atmosphere saturated with carbon dioxide, like Earth's.
Scientists have previously suggested that the small speed of rotation of Venus is due to its dense atmosphere.
But the latest modelling suggests that Venus probably could have had a diluted atmosphere like Earth's, and still rotate slowly.
The model also looked at the topography of early Venus.
There were probably more dry regions on the planet than on Earth, but once upon a time there was enough water and enough geographic variability to create living conditions and prevent rapid evaporation.
Early Venus also favored the sun, which was 30 percent fainter.
"According to the GISS model, the slow rotation of Venus puts its daily side of the sun for almost two months at a time," GISS scientist Anthony Del Henio said in a press release.
This heats the planet’s surface and produces rain, which creates a thick layer of clouds that acts as an umbrella that protects the planet’s surface from a significant portion of solar heat.
The result is the average climatic temperatures, which, surprisingly, are a few degrees colder than they are today on Earth.
The model shows the history of Venus, similar to the development previously assumed by experts in the study of planets.
Despite the fact that Venus may have once been inhabited, it has been exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet radiation for several billion years.
Its oceans evaporated and its water vapor was burned by ultraviolet radiation.
When its hydrogen leaked, only a dense atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a lethal greenhouse effect remained — that is, Venus, as we know it today.
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns as Avalanche coach
Patrick Roy left the position of coach and vice president of hockey at Colorado Avalanche on Thursday, citing a lack of influence during the team’s decision-making process.
Executive Vice President/Chief Manager of the Colorado team Joe Sakik confirmed the news and noted that the club will start looking for a new coach immediately.
“Over the past three years, I have been serving as head coach and vice president of hockey at Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination,” Roy, 50, said in a statement.
“During the summer, I’ve been thinking long and hard about how I could improve this team to give it the depth it needs and raise it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this goal, the vision of the coach and vice president of hockey activities must fit perfectly with the vision of the organization.
He must also have the right to vote when making decisions that affect the work of the team.
These conditions are not met at the moment.
Sakik, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
"Patrick informed me of his decision today," Sakik said.
We appreciate everything he has done for our organization and wish him success in the future.
Roy won the Jack Adams Award as the league's best coach during his first season with the Avalanche team in 2013-2014.
He led the club to 112 points and a win in the Central Division, but Colorado was defeated by Minnesota in the first round of the playoffs and lost the playoffs in the last two years.
The Avalanche team announced a 39-39-4 rating in the 2015–16 season and five points behind the Wild team in the fight for the second qualifying round to participate in the Western Conference.
The Hall of Fame goalkeeper Roy won four Stanley Cups, two with the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche.
North Sea Oilmen Renew Negotiations and Suspend Strike
Working strikes on the salaries of oilmen in the North Sea have been suspended, and all sides of the discussion are beginning a new round of negotiations, the leading representatives of the parties said.
The strikes against the oil service company Wood Group were sporadically organized on platforms in the North Sea, run by Royal Dutch Shell.
“Wood Group and the Unite and RMT alliances can confirm that we have agreed to resume the negotiation process to resolve the ongoing disputes,” the statement said.
We will hold several full-time meetings over the next few weeks, starting at the beginning of next week, to look at the issues with a fresh look.
Trade unions said their recent action, which they said was the first in more than 25 years, was directed against potential wage cuts of up to 30 percent.
Wood Group this year cut rates paid to contractors working in the North Sea by about 9 percent due to negative market tensions, according to the report.
The company’s interest rates fell after a 10 percent reduction in rates for contracted employees working on the shores in 2014.
According to the company, additional cuts will give it the space it needs to overcome the decline of the market.
Shell, for its part, has cut thousands of people and announced plans to stop oil and gas operations in countries by up to 10 as it streamlines its operations as a result of its mega merger with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure because of the declining prices of crude oil: the economic situation has deteriorated due to the decision to leave the European Union, adopted by the UK in June.
Scottish Member of Parliament Dave Anderson met with trade union leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labor conflicts that have arisen in the North Sea in our era.
The North Sea, he said, is vital to the regional economy.
“In the North Sea, and across the country, we need an economy that would work for the majority, not just for some,” he said in a statement.
Less than $1.4 billion in spending on new projects in the North Sea is expected in 2016, in contrast to an average value of about $7 billion over the past five years.
Kepler measures the speed of rotation of stars in the Pleiades accumulation
The last mission of the Kepler Space Telescope helped astronomers to assemble the most complete catalog of rotational speeds of stars in the Pleiades cluster.
The new data helps astronomers understand why the stars in the cluster rotate at different speeds, as well as how the periods of rotation relate to the formation of planets.
“We hope that by comparing our results with other stellar clusters, we will learn more about the relationship between the mass of the star, its age and even the history of its solar system,” said in a press release by Intiflisky, a researcher at the Intif Center.
The Pleiades accumulation is 445 light years from Earth.
Many of the stars in the cluster are now only reaching maturity; they were born about 125 million years ago.
They're spinning as fast as they'll never be again.
At their peak speeds of rotation, these adult stars emit large amounts of stellar wind.
Traveling through the magnetic fields of the stars, these winds act as a deterrent to the stars.
As the star ages, its rotational speed begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the speed of rotation of each star, tracking the time between the appearance of recognizable star spots — such as sunspots.
The newest catalog of rotational speeds suggests that more massive stars are rotating more slowly than less massive stars are rotating.
Fishall compares stars to dancers: larger ones make pirouettes slower than smaller ones.
“In Ballet Play, we observe that those that rotate slowly are usually more massive, while those that rotate faster are usually considered to be very light stars,” said Riball.
Since the Pleiades accumulation is so close, it serves as the ideal cosmic laboratory to compare the properties of stars with the speeds of rotation.
"The Pleiades star accumulation provides a starting point for theoretical models of the rotation of stars, both young and old," said Riball.
We want to know a lot more about how, where and why the stars slow their rotation speed and hang their "dancing shoes" on the nail, figuratively speaking.
Riball and her colleagues detailed their latest analysis of the speeds of rotation of the Pleiades in three new articles, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
The investigation related to the activities of a group of Ukrainian divergents detained in the Crimea is conducted by two departments, writes Kommersant.
The FSB collects evidence of the involvement of detainees in the preparation of diversions in the Crimea.
As previously reported, the resident of the Ukrainian city of Energodar, Evgeny Panov, agreed to cooperate with the investigation.
According to him, as objects for diversions he considered the chemical plant "Titan" in Armenia, the oil base in Feodosia, the Kerch ferry, the gas pipeline, as well as one of the military airports.
Law enforcement officials believe that not all the participants of the divergents were arrested.
This, in particular, became the basis for the arrest of suspects in the Kiev district court of Simferopol, the publication notes.
The head coach of the Russian football team was Stanislav Cherchesov
At the meeting of the Executive Committee of the Russian Football Union, it was decided to appoint the head coach of the Russian football team Stanislav Cherchesov.
The contract with him will be calculated for two years - until the end of the 2018 World Cup.
On August 11, the Russian Federation appointed Stanislav Cherchesov as head coach of the Russian football team.
This is a famous footballer, who previously played in the Moscow "Spartak" in the position of a goalkeeper, as well as a coach with solid experience, was the mentor of such Russian teams as all the same "Spartak" <0xD0><0xA1><0xD1><0x82><0xD0><0xB0><0xD0><0xB4><0xD0><0xB0><0xD0><0xBD><0xD0><0xB0><0xD1><0x82><0xD0><0xB0><0xD0><0xB9><0xD0><0xBD><0xD0><0xB8><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xBD><0xD0><0xB8><0xD0><0xB9><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xBD><0xD0><0xB8><0xD0><0xB8><0xD0><0xB0><0xD0><0xB8><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB0><0xD0><0xB0><0xD0><0xB0><0xD0><0xB0><0xD0><0xB0><0xD0><0xB0><0xD0><0xBD><0xD0><0xB0><0xD0><0xB8><0xD0><0xB8><0xD0><0xB8><0xD0><0xB8><0xD0><0xB0><0xD0><0xB0><0xD0><0xB0><0xD0><0xBD><0xD0><0xBD><0xD0><0xB0><0xD0><0xB0><0xD0><0xB8><0xD0><0xB0><0xD0><0xBD><0xD0><0xB8><0xD0><0xB0><0xD0><0xB8><0xD0><0xBD><0xD0><0xBD><0xD0><0xBD><0xD0><0xB8><0xD0><0xB8><0xD1><0x8F> and so<0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB0><0xD0><0xB0><0xD0><0xB0><0xD0><0xB0><0xD0><0xB0><0xD0><0xB0><0xD0><0xBD><0xD0><0xBA><0xD0><0xB0><0xD1><0x8F>, "<0xD0><0xB8>", "<0xD0><0xBA><0xD0><0xBA><0xD0><0xBA><0xD0><0xBA><0xD0><0xBA><0xD0><0xBA><0xD0><0xBA><0xD0><0xBA><0xD0><0xBA><0xD0><0xBA><0xD0><0xBA><0xD0><0xBA><0xD0><0xBA><0xD0><0xBA><0xD0><0xBA><0xD0><0xBA><0xD0><0xBA><0xD0><0xBA><0xD0><0xBA><0xD0><0xBA><0xD0><0xB0>", "T", "T", "T", "T", "T<0xD0><0xBA><0xD0><0xBA><0xD0><0xBA><0xD0><0xBA><0xD0><0xBA><0xD0><0xBA><0xD0><0xBA><0xD0><0xBA><0xD0><0xBA><0xD0><0xBA><0xD0><0xBA><0xD0><0xBA><0xD0><0xBA><0xD0><0xBA><0xD0><0xBA><0xD0><0xBA><0xD0><0xBA><0xD0><0xBA><0xD0><0xBA><0xD0><0xBA><0xD0><0xBA><0xD0><0xBA><0xD0><0xBA><0xD0><0xBA><0xD0><0xBA><0xD0><0xBA><0xD0><0xBA><0xD0><0xBA><0xD0><0xBA><0xD0><0xB0>" "A", "A", "A", "A", "A", "A", "A", "A", "A" "A" "A" "A" "A" "A" "A" "A" "A" "A" "A" "A" "A" "A" "A" "A" "A" "A" "A" "A" "A" "A" "A" "A" "A" "A" "A" "A" "A" "A" "A" "A" "A" "A" "A" "A" "A" "A" "A" "A" "A" "A" "A" "A" "A" "A" "A" "A" "A" "A" "A" "A" "A" "A" "A" "A" "A" "A" "A" "A" "A" "A" "A" "A" "A" "A" "A" "A" "A"
It is reported that the contract with Cherchesov will be signed in the near future and is calculated for two years.
Thus, it is his duty to prepare the team for the 2018 World Cup.
It is known that his coaching staff will include Miroslav Romashchenko, Gintaras Stauche, Vladimir Panikov.
There is information that the salary of the entire coaching staff will be 2.6 billion euros per year.
According to the media, the leadership of the Russian Federation set before Stanislav Cherchesov the goal of bringing the Russian team to the semi-finals and winning medals.
As the coach himself stated, as a priority task he considers the creation of a competitive environment in the team and intends to give the players the opportunity to express themselves.
Also, according to Cherchesov, he is glad that the choice fell on him.
The first match under the leadership of Cherchesov Russia team will be held on August 31 in Antalya - it will be a friendly meeting with the Turkish team.
Earlier, the post of head coach of the Russian football team was occupied by Leonid Slutsky, who combined him with coaching at the club CSKA.
He announced his resignation after the failed performance of the Russian national team at Euro 2016 in France.
At the same time, he took responsibility for the bad result of the team on himself.
Clamping down between Angola and South Africa, Namibia suffered greatly during a long struggle against apartheid.
However, since independence from South Africa in 1990, this country, with a population of 2.4 million people, has achieved tremendous success, especially in the last few years.
The main reason for Namibia’s success is that the government pays great attention to education.
While people in developed countries perceive free primary and secondary education as self-evident, in many poor countries secondary and even primary schools demand tuition fees.
Moreover, governments are often advised to introduce a tuition fee for "cost reimbursement".
However, in Namibia, primary school education is free of charge.
In addition, secondary education has been free since 2015.
The country ' s authorities are also actively working in other important areas.
Efforts to eradicate malaria have reduced the number of annual cases of malaria by 97% over the past decade.
Contrary to the international trend of increasing inequality, it is decreasing in Namibia.
Compared to the 1993 indicator, the Gini ratio, the standard indicator of income inequality, fell by 15 points.
Then, 23 years ago, this figure was one of the highest in the world.
Poverty dropped from 69 per cent in 1993 to less than 30 per cent.
The number of people living in extreme poverty (less than $1.90 per day) also declined, from nearly 53 percent to less than 23 percent.
Namibia also has the highest ranking of free speech in Africa, according to Reporters Without Borders.
The country has far ahead of the United States and other wealthy states.
In addition, the country has a favorable rating – one of the highest in Africa – in the “Corruption Perception Index”, which is made up of human rights defenders from Transparency International.
Even now that commodity prices are falling, Namibia is able to maintain its high growth rate.
At the same time, the debt-to-GDP ratio is around 25%, which is less than 1/3 of the debt level in the United States and most European countries.
Of course, there are problems in Namibia.
Unemployment, at least according to traditional estimation methods, is still quite high – almost 28%.
And, like other countries in the region, Namibia ' s high level of HIV/AIDS - almost 17% of the population is infected.
According to World Bank estimates, Namibia is among the countries with above-average incomes, but the authorities insist that their state is actually a developing country.
Namibia, of course, is facing some of the difficulties inherent in the poorly developed economies.
The state has to develop a very large and dry country with a small population.
On the territory of the country in the deserts live isolated nomadic tribes of hunter-gatherer, which in some way must be integrated into modern society, without losing their identity.
Integrating people who were on the periphery of the world economy a quarter of a century ago is not an easy task for any country.
It is even more difficult for Namibia: like any other country in the world, it is facing the consequences of climate change.
However, Namibia did not think to let go, the country solves the problems it faces.
Almost immediately after independence, the authorities engaged in the creation of a diversified economy and a united society.
It is noteworthy that the competing political factions have come together to work for the common good.
Indeed, Namibia provides inexpensive medical care not only to its own citizens, but also to its neighbours.
About 15-20% of the visitors to medical institutions in the northern regions of Namibia are Angolan citizens.
No one in Namibia is talking about building a wall that would separate the country from its poor and corrupt neighbors.
The Namibians realized that the neighbors were not chosen, and therefore decided not to conflict with them, but to cooperate - to share scarce water resources, to participate in regional health projects, to encourage investment and exchange of students.
In addition, the Government of Namibia has rightly argued that rich natural resources can easily become a curse, contributing to the enrichment of the few at the expense of many.
The authorities understand that the proceeds from Namibia’s natural resources need to be invested in infrastructure and production capacity.
They are also aware that it would be irresponsible not to strive to make the most out of the country’s sales of resources, and are revising investment laws and mining contracts to make sure this is the case.
Transparency is crucial to this process, and therefore the strong support of the Government for freedom of expression is so important.
As the head of state Hague Gaingob noted, the media often say what he does not like.
But after fighting for freedom from apartheid in South Africa, Namibia must defend the freedoms it has received, the president said.
Not all of Namibia ' s key resources are depleted.
Some, such as fishing, are recyclable, and the Government is making every effort to preserve and strengthen them.
Every year, more than a million foreign tourists visit the country.
Namibia shows that even those countries that start with serious shortcomings - racism, colonialism, inequality and low levels of development - can stand in the way of general prosperity.
Its achievement deserves international recognition and imitation.
Many have heard of the "Golden Varna" - the oldest gold objects created by man (4600 - 4200 BC).
Perhaps this was the loudest archaeological sensation of the 1970s: in Bulgaria, at the excavations of the Varna necropolis, a fantastic number of gold artifacts were found - more than three thousand total weight 6 kilograms.
Only one tomb, known as “Tomb No. 43”, was used to extract 990 gold objects weighing more than 1.5 kg.
However, the official status of the world’s oldest gold may soon shift to an imperceptible-looking bell discovered by archaeologists in July this year.
And again in Bulgaria - in a prehistoric settlement known as Tell the Young.
Unlike Varna, a port city, Tell Yunacite is located far from the sea, near the village Yunacite of the Pazardzhik district.
The busine is a golden strip, wrapped in a ring.
Yavor Boyajjiev, the head of the excavations at Tella Yunaci, dated the discovery 4600 BCE and stated that it was at least 200 years older than the gold of Varna.
The treasures of Varna, we recall, date from about the same period, 4600 - 4200 BC.
Technologies that allow metal to be dated with impeccable accuracy do not currently exist.
How can we be sure that gold is more ancient than gold?
Apparently, Professor Boyajjiev knows more than he told Reuters: "I am quite sure that the gold of the Youth is older than the gold of Varna."
It’s a discovery of extreme importance: it’s apparently a tiny object, but it’s big enough to take a fitting place in history.
In an interview with Reuters, Boyajjiev said that in the near future scientists will analyze the composition of the metal, as well as again and more carefully study the archaeological layer, where the gold artifact was found.
This will help to date the bus as accurately as possible.
The location also explains a lot.
Tell the Youth is a famous settlement, even if you’ve never heard of it.
Today, Tell the Young is considered to be the oldest “city” in Europe.
Tell was founded by descendants of people who migrated to Europe from Anatolia (modern Turkey) in the 7th millennium BC.
Over the following centuries, metal processing in this region developed rapidly, from the development of the first metallurgical skills to the creation of a full-fledged industry.
In the national historiography for this archaeological community there is a special name: Balkan-Carpathian metallurgical province.
In the 5th millennium BC around the centers of metalworking began to appear urban type settlements.
They are now called the oldest cities of Europe.
Of these, the Tell Youth is perhaps the oldest, as artifacts were found here in 4900 BC.
I would call Tell the Youngers a prototype of a modern city, although it is a very ancient settlement, even compared to Mesopotamia.
“This place is a thousand years older than Sumer,” Bojajiev says, referring to the common belief that urban culture originated in southern Mesopotamia – modern Iraq.
It was the first city in the usual sense of the word.
The excavations of Tella Youth have been carried out since 1976.
During this time, archaeologists have excavated almost 12 hectares, which is about a third of the estimated total area of the settlement.
The remains of the fortress wall, which once reached a height of three meters, were found.
There is little left of houses and workshops, but archaeologists clearly distinguish streets, public buildings, urban dense buildings, "business center" and residential outskirts.
Young people are often referred to as the “bird city”: dozens of clay figures of birds have been found here.
All the birds are depicted in a state of rest, hence the assumption that they were not decorative objects, but the object of the local cult.
The "bird city" was destroyed around 4100 BC - possibly by Indo-European tribes coming from the north-east.
Nomads did not have cities, but had horses and weapons.
The three-metre walls of the fortress did not stop them.
Archaeologists have discovered obvious signs of a brutal slaughter: inside the houses were found the remains of old men, women and children with traces of wounds inflicted by battle axes.
New discoveries and new facts appear every year, changing the habitual perceptions of the ancient history of mankind.
Bulgarian archaeologists are increasingly talking not about individual cultures, but about the “lost” first civilization of Europe born in the Balkans.
A powerful stimulus in the search for this civilization was the "Gold of Varna", found relatively recently, in 1972.
It is logical that the gold luxuries of Varna should have preceded something - something like a tiny gold beads created in Tell the Young.
In Porsche artificially aged model 911 Targa
Officially, the 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design training is carried out manually by the specialists of the unit, who work with serial machines.
The "retro bow" consists, for example, in the special color of the body of Etna Blue, which was developed in 1960 for the model Porsche 356B - in this color even the logo of the model is painted.
In addition, the targa received a branded white graphics along the sides and special 20-inch RS Spyder wheel drives, as well as some body design details, painted in "white-gold metal".
In the interior retro-chips are noticeably smaller: it differs, to a large extent, in the gray-blue range of design, new chairs with extended ranges of electrical adjustments and detached black anodized steel thresholds with the unit logo.
In addition, when buying a special version, each buyer will receive a car case as a gift and a richly dedicated album with photos of the production process.
The power plant Porsche Exclusive specialists did not touch the steel: the retro-targa in terms of performance quite coincides with the serial.
It is equipped with a six-cylinder engine with a turbocharged volume of 3.0 l, developing 420 hp and 500 Nm.
The most dynamic version of the 911 Targa 4S can accelerate to 100 km/h in 4 seconds.
The Porsche 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design will be issued in a limited edition, but neither the volume nor the cost of each particular sports car is reported.
Facebook and ad blockers unleashed “arms race”
The recent introduction of Facebook’s technology to prevent ads from being hidden on social media pages has provoked developers to block ads from responding.
In AdBlock Plus released an “antiwar”, but Facebook plans to soon make it useless.
So AdBlock Plus has announced its new technology, which is likely to remain effective for a short time
Representatives of the social network noted that, in an attempt to deceive the new technology of "unblocked" advertising, the solution from AdBlock Plus along with commercial ads also blocks many common posts from friends or pages.
Facebook regretted the AdBlock Plus policy and promised to resolve the issue soon.

Thus, the social network and blockers unleashed a kind of “arms race”, trying to beat each other, the affected side became users who missed interesting posts from friends or saw advertisements where they were not used to seeing it.
The ethical aspects of blocking advertising have been sparking hot debates lately.

Dongfeng will bring to Russia crossover Fengguang 370 and pickup Rich New - website Driving www.zr.ru
Dongfeng Fengguang 370 is a representative of the growing popularity in China car class, combining the advantages of minivan and crossover.
Another announced Russian premiere is the pickup truck Rich New.
Many Western firms at the Moscow International Motor Show this year decided to ignore the emptiness of the exhibition halls “Crocus Expo” will fill Chinese firms.
In particular, a powerful front will be Dongfeng Motor Corporation, which has large views on the Russian market and intends to offer our car enthusiasts a number of interesting novelties in the near future.
One of them will be the Dongfeng Fengguang 370 crossover, which went on sale in China this spring at a price of 55,900 yuan (minus 550,000 rubles at the current rate).
Russians are unlikely to see such a price tag, and the issue of supplies to our country is still in the discussion stage.
In China, by the way, Fengguang 370 according to the results of June sales managed to reach 11th place in the list of the best-selling minivans, although due to the large traffic light (175 mm) and protective plastic enclosure on the lower perimeter of the body.
The crossover is built on the front-wheel drive platform of the younger model Fengguang 360, the 370 has the same wheelbase at 2725 mm, but the body is slightly longer (4565 mm versus 4510 mm), the design is more solid, and the equipment is richer.
The salon is decorated with wooden slats, but the large vertical touchscreen "like Tesla" on the central console was only on the early exhibition copies of the crossvene, and cars with "music" were made for sale easier.
Five of the seven seats are easily folded, forming a flat loading platform of 1650 mm in length, the maximum volume of the trunk - 1500 l.
The engine for the Fengguang 370 is provided only one - 1.5-liter gasoline "atmospheric" 115 hp, junctioned with a 5-speed mechanical transmission.
About the dynamic qualities of the machine, the manufacturer modestly silences, but promises a saving budget of the owner appetite at the level of 6.7 liters/100 km.
The Rich New pickup is a well-known Russian Nissan NP300 Navara of the previous generation, but with a slightly sophisticated Chinese stylist design.
Despite the morally outdated design, this model still enjoys stable demand from the Chinese consumer as a reliable and unpretentious “working horse.”
At a similar price, Rich New will certainly be interested in Russians, because modern Japanese pick-ups have become excessively expensive.
Rich New is equipped with two engines to choose from: petrol 2.4 l (137 hp) or turbodiesel 2.5 l (116 hp).
Gearbox - only mechanics, drive - on the rear wheels, but there are modifications and with a tightly connected "front".
It will be at the Dongfeng stand and the new flagship sedan A9, its Russian premiere, a representation of the Chinese firm announced in June.
Minfeno-like crossovers in the Chinese market are becoming more and more, one of the latest innovations - Cowin V3 and SWM X7.
Currently, the Russian Dongfeng lineup consists of two models: the S30 sedan and the H30 Cross hatchback.
In the seven months of this year, the dealers of the Chinese company sold 696 cars in our country.
Notifications for transport tax will cease to be sent by mail - website Driving www.zr.ru
The Tax Inspectorate has changed the procedure for sending notifications of property taxes.
All Russian car owners are used to the unchanged scheme for years: in the summer and autumn they receive by mail a receipt for the payment of transport tax for the previous year.
However, many of them are not expected this year.
The fact is that the tax inspection without unnecessary noise has changed the procedure for notifying citizens.
For those who are registered in the "Personal Office of the taxpayer" on the official website of the nalog.ru agency, notifications will come in electronic form.
In the inspection automatically considered such Russians as online users and excluded them from the standard, "paper" mailing.
The news will affect all owners of vehicles and real estate.
Everyone else will still receive the usual e-mails.
However, there is an opportunity to return to the old scheme and the account holders on the site.
To do this, they will have to visit the tax department during August and write a statement.
On the one hand, the new order is more modern and comfortable.
The notification will appear in the "personal office" immediately after compilation, while the letter will last a few days and may be lost at all.
In addition, the number of users of the Internet service of the tax inspection exceeded 18 million people, which will allow the department to save seriously on the mailing.
On the other hand, the modest news on the inspection site is clearly not enough to inform citizens about the changed order.
Some could register in a "personal office" for a one-time service and have long forgotten about it.
These people will not wait for notifications by mail and, without knowing it themselves, will fall into the category of non-payers with all the consequences.
Access to the "Personal Account of the taxpayer" is carried out in three ways: through the account of the portal gosuslugi.ru, by electronic signature or by entering the login and password specified in the registration card.
The latter can be obtained in person in any department of the tax inspection (regardless of the place of registration).
Please note that this year the transport tax must be paid before December 1.
The sending of notifications began in July.
The tuning Mercedes-Benz G-Class, in which the refinements are aimed at achieving a very high yield, is a thing in itself.
But the controversial concept did not confuse the G-Power masters, who took on the modification of the sports version of the Mercedes-AMG G 63.
G-Power is known for its passion for BMW cars, but nothing human to its masters is foreign.
Indeed, why not upgrade the G 63 - 571-strong flying cylinder with aerodynamics of the tank and acceleration up to a hundred in 5.4 seconds?
Pumping up the "muscles" of the crazy "gelica", the masters took advantage of the advantages that the 5.5-liter inflatable "eight" opens.
But the dynamics of acceleration up to a hundred improved by indistinguishable 0.1 sec, and now the flying "kirpich" is capable of acceleration in 5.3 sec.
However, the acceleration from the average speeds is certainly given to him noticeably better.
The speed limit is alarming: if the standard G 63 does not drive faster than 210 km/h, then the tuning road with a deactivated electronic “necklace” is able to push 250 km/h.
On the outside, the car is almost indistinguishable from its factory primary source, with the exception of other wheel drives - the 23-inch Hurricane RR size 305/35 ZR 23.
Mercedes-Maybach’s luxury division has announced a stunning 6-metre concept coupe that will be presented at the Pebble Beach Elegance Competition.
Mercedes-Benz is going to compete with the “green subbrand” BMW i and will promote its electric models under a separate brand.
