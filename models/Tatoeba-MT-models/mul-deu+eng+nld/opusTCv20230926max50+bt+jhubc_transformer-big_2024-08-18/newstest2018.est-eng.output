Four members of the Kemerovo group were arrested in Estonia and Spain
According to the postman, the police arrested Slava Gulevich, the leader of the so-called Kemerovo group operating in Estonia, known as Slava Kemerovski in the criminal world.
Gulevitch, who was detained in Spain, was arrested with the permission of the court.
Yesterday, the court also arrested three suspects detained in Estonia.
It is suspected that members of the so-called Kemerovo criminal community are between the ages of 27 and 57, who mainly commit drug offences.
In Malaga, Spain, in Mijas, the alleged leader of the criminal community was arrested.
In Estonia, three men were arrested as suspects, one of whom is a leading figure in the criminal community according to the data and two are members of the criminal community.
The data collected indicate that the tasks and roles were clearly allocated in the criminal community.
The purpose of the criminal community’s activities was to commit drug crimes and thereby earn criminal proceeds,” commented Vahur Verte, head of pre-trial proceedings in the criminal case.
"We do not rule out an increase in the number of suspects in this criminal case," the prosecutor added.
These are people who have also previously been subject to the interest of law enforcement agencies, and some of them have been punished for drug crimes.
Mr Verte stressed that cooperation with his Spanish colleagues has been an important factor throughout the investigation.
"International cooperation has become commonplace for us and this week's operation demonstrates the success of the cooperation," said Prosecutor Verte.
Ago Leis, the head of the Central Criminal Police Service, said the arrests were preceded by a nearly one-and-a-half-year pretrial investigation.
"In the first half of the week, the long-term work was realized and we simultaneously arrested suspects in crimes in Estonia and Spain," he said.
Leis added that central criminal police officers were assisting in the detention in Spain.
We have had good contact and mutual understanding with the Spanish police and the Spanish Civilian Card Force for years.
These detentions are another message to the perpetrators that we can also get them from the other end of Europe,” Leis said.
The information gathered so far clearly indicates that while men were at liberty, the suspects could continue to commit new crimes, so the prosecutor’s office requested their arrest and the court approved it.
A man arrested in Spain awaits his extradition to Estonia.
Property, vehicles and cash have been seized in the context of this criminal case to ensure confiscation.
The pre-trial proceedings in the criminal case are carried out by the Central Criminal Police’s Bureau of Organized Crime and headed by the State Prosecutor’s Office.
In 2005, the Tallinn City Court convicted Slava Gulevich of extortion and sentenced him to five years in prison.
In the middle of the last decade, Gulevitch was considered the second man of importance in the criminal world in Estonia after the then underworld leader Nikolai Tarankov.
Gulevish, from Kemerovo, emerged in the Estonian world in the early 1990s when he began to deal with extortion in Tallinn.
He allegedly charged taxi drivers and prostitutes operating at different hotels and demanded a monthly fee from businessmen.
International joint operations, confiscation of criminal proceeds and enacted judgments confirm that the fight against organised crime is effective.
For example, the most recent judgments, the eight accused separated from the so-called Dikayev criminal community case, from whom criminal proceeding was confiscated <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>80,000, or the trial of nine persons for the fact that Igor Aleynikov committed a crime in connection with the murder of a person in the case of Idaho and in the case of a criminal community in 2006.
The amount of criminal proceeds confiscated is around 71,500 euros.
The success of these criminal cases has been ensured by the exchange of information and evidence between police officers and foreign colleagues on a daily basis and, where necessary, by prosecutors in any country of the European Union.
Civil rights group warns against traveling to Missouri <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has warned black people traveling to Missouri of the state’s discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
The group's statement reads: "The NAACP travel note on the state of Missouri, which is valid until August 28, 2017, invites all African-American travelers, visitors and Missourians to be part of the crew of the entire state's round-the-shoulder crew."
According to the NAACP, the group was prompted to issue both the recent Missouri law, which makes it more difficult to win cases of discrimination, and the fact that the targets of the state's corrections officers are inequally minority.
“Human rights are being violated.
They're pulled to the edge of the tea because of their skin color, they're beaten or killed," NaACP Missouri branch president Rod Chapel told The Kansas City Star.
"We've never had so many complaints before."
This is the first such warning that the organization has issued against the US state.
The group referred to events such as the racially abusive death of Tory Sanders, a 28-year-old black student at the University of Missouri and Tennessee.
Sanders died in suspicious circumstances earlier this year after he got through the state on a gasoline run and was arrested by the Missouri police without being charged with a crime.
In addition, a note from the Missouri Attorney General’s Office refers to a recent report that shows that black drivers’ cars in the state are 75 percent more likely to be stopped than whites’ cars.
“The note is meant to make people aware and warn their family, friends, and coworkers about what might happen in Missouri,” Chapel said.
“People need to be ready, whether it’s taking in bail money or notifying relatives that they’re going to the state.”
Based on the latest data from the FBI’s hate crime reporting program, 100 hate crimes were documented in Missouri in 2015, placing the state 16th overall in terms of the number of similar crimes committed by the state.
Travel alerts are also a response to a new Missouri law that makes it harder for a company to sue for discrimination in search of housing or work.
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had previously issued travel remarks about Texas and Arizona after those states adopted immigration laws that required local authorities to arrest people for immigration violations, as the ACLU said it had a high profile.
Typically, travel warnings are issued by the Department of State for other countries, but recently, interest groups have begun to use this measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States.
Hepatitis: What can anyone know about the different forms of this serious disease?
Hepatitis, or inflammation of the liver, can be caused by five different hepatitis viruses - A, B, C, D, and E.
All these viruses cause acute inflammation of the liver tissue.
At a disadvantage, however, chronic hepatitis B and C can develop into liver cirrhosis, i.e. liver folding and liver cancer.
The epidemiology consultant of the health agency Hear Kutsar says that the symptoms of acute hepatitis are the same for all types of liver inflammation - fever, fatigue, eating, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, grey stools, dark urine, musculoskeletal and joint pain.
The last sign of the disease is also derived from the popular name of liver inflammation yellow fever.
In children, hepatitis can pass without symptoms of the disease.
The different types of liver inflammation can only be determined on the basis of data from laboratory studies.
Acute hepatitis can turn into chronic hepatitis and go on for decades without any signs of the disease, which means that a person may not know anything about their dangerous liver disease.
Ear Kutsar brings out different forms of hepatitis and describes their course in more detail.
Hepatitis A viruses spread to sick people and infect us by eating contaminated food or drinking water, by sex, by the infected person’s stools on the hands and hands to food, surfaces, objects, ingestion into the mouth, and by the use of drugs.
The risk group for hepatitis A infection is the family members and caregivers of the sick, people with chronic liver disease, people with the infection, men with sex, drug addicts, travelers visiting countries with high prevalence of hepatitis A.
Infection can be prevented by vaccination, in particular vaccination is recommended for many travellers and people at risk of hepatitis A.
In addition, it is important to meet the daily hygiene requirements: wash or disinfect the hands, before eating, wash all fruits and vegetables.
Hepatitis B viruses are common when exposed to the blood of a sick person, when injecting drugs, tattooing, chewing, when using blood-contaminated linings (brushes, abrasives), when having sex with a donor blood, a person suspected of hepatitis, and from an embryo to a fetus.
The risk group for hepatitis B infection includes injectable narcotics, sex partners of the infected person, men with sex, newborns of the infected mother, sick family members and caregivers, blood and other bodily fluids in contact with health care workers, rescue workers and police officers.
In order to prevent hepatitis B, it is possible to vaccinate people; in particular, it is recommended to vaccinate people at risk, in addition to people suffering from chronic liver disease, HIV infection, sexually transmitted diseases and people suffering from diabetes.
Other preventive measures for hepatitis B include: avoiding the use of foreign hygiene and manicure tools, other sharps and syringe needles, tattooing and augmenting, and using a condom in case of infectious sex, or preventing sexual risk behavior.
Vaccination against hepatitis B is part of the national immunization programme in Estonia and is free of charge for children.
Hepatitis C viruses are common when exposed to the blood of a sick person, when injecting drugs, tattooing, chewing, using blood-contaminated organs, having sex with a donor blood, a person suffering from hepatitis, and from the mother to the fetus/newborn.
The risk group for hepatitis C infection includes injectable narcotics, sex partners of the infected person, men having sex with men, newborns of the infected mother, sick family members and caregivers, blood and other bodily fluids in contact with the sick person’s health, rescue workers and policemen.
The prevention measure for hepatitis C is: avoiding the use of foreign hygiene and manicure tools, other sharp tools and needles for syringes, tattooing and augustization, and using a condom in case of infectious sex.
There is no vaccine against hepatitis C.
Hepatitis D is caused by the hepatitis D virus, which multiplies in the presence of the hepatitis B virus.
Therefore, hepatitis D infection occurs with hepatitis B or as a superinfection in patients with chronic hepatitis B.
Hepatitis D viruses spread sexually in contact with blood and other body fluids, syringes contaminated with them, and rarely from infected mother to foetus.
The risk group for hepatitis D is chronic hepatitis B virus carriers and people who do not have immunity against hepatitis B.
An effective preventive measure is to vaccinate with a hepatitis B vaccine, which also protects a person from infection with the hepatitis D virus.
Hepatitis E viruses spread by faecal-oral route with drinking water and food, including low heat-treated animal meat, fish and seafood, donor blood, co-administered syringes and infected mother to the fetus.
Travelers can get infected with hepatitis E in countries with high rates of disease.
Preventive measures against hepatitis E are to comply with hygiene requirements: wash or disinfect hands after going to the toilet, before cooking and eating, after ill care.
Fruits and vegetables should be washed before consumption, avoid eating little heat-treated animal meat, fish and seafood, drink only safe drinking water, and avoid the use of drugs.
While in the last round, competitors tried to kick the four-time Olympic champion off the track, 34-year-old Farah found strength in the final round and won by time 26.49.51.
Farah did not think for a long time, dragging his wife Tania and children with him on the track after the finish.
It was a special moment for me.
I look forward to my family.
Being on the track with them was wonderful," Farah told reporters.
Farah is aiming for London’s fifth consecutive 5000- and 10,000-metre gold sprint race.
Anything is possible if you believe in it.
Despite the title, Anne-Marie O'Connor's "The Lady in Gold. Gustav Klimt's masterpiece, the extraordinary story of Adele Bloch-Bauer's portrait" delves deeper into Vienna's cultural history at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century.
But even more in-depth history.
If the amount of information to be released was exhausted, or harder in the cutting edge, a narrower theme would allow the extraordinary story of the portrait allowed in the title to have more influence.
There are now two books between the covers: Gustav Klimt and the story of Adele Bloch-Bauer depicted in his painting "The Lady in Gold" and a more extensive and comprehensive history book about respected Jewish families and the German occupation of Austria, together with its aftermath.
The first third of the book takes you through the pulsating cultural life of Vienna, and who himself came to the Austrian capital, can hardly imagine how life went around the Ringstrasse more than a hundred years ago, or how all the heads turned when Klimt entered the Central cafe.
The concentration of cultural figures was high in one of Europe’s richest cities, and when you see the name you know in the book, you feel more like a grammar culture.
For example, the fact that Sigmund Freud acted in a city where he lived incurable syphilis and was the highest level of suicide in Europe, the story seemed to add nothing to the development.
Or maybe even - every pair of brush strokes adds colour to the cultural life of Vienna at the beginning of the 20th century.
Dream of a trip to the Soviet Union
In the last decades of the 19th century, the number of Jews in Vienna had exploded, becoming the largest Jewish community in Western Europe.
At the turn of the century, almost one in ten people in Vienna was Jewish.
Adele's parents were also newcomers in Vienna, but by the time Adele married the Czech sugarcane magnate Ferdinand Bloch and Klimt for his famous paintings, his father's bank had already become the seventh largest bank in the Habsburg Empire.
But Adelet did not draw the whole glamorous life he belonged to.
When you look at "The Lady in Gold", it's hard to believe that at the end of her life, this great lady became infected with socialism and dreamed of a trip to the Soviet Union.
By 1903, when Ferdinand Bloch decided to order a portrait of his wife from Klimt, he was the last-minute hottest painter in Vienna.
At the time, Klimt’s order cost 4000 kroner, a quarter of the price of a well-located country house.
The fact that the master's love story with the model was suspected in some portraits did not deflect the sugar magnet.
As for Adele, the only sure fact is that the close relationship between the model and the artist that emerged during the work continued for the rest of her life.
Anne-Marie O'Connor - "Ladies and Gentlemen.
Gustav Klimt's masterpiece, the extraordinary story of the portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer", Varrak 2016, translated from English by Aldo Randmaa.
Just before the beginning of work with Adel, Klimt had gone to the Basilica of Ravenna San Vitale, and researchers believe that the glorious mosaics seen there from Empress Theodore gave the artist the idea of making a golden portrait of Adel as a painted mosaic.
Klimt presented his "Golden Lady" in Vienna in 1908 and around the same time (in 1907-1908) another golden painting "Kissing" was born.
The similarities between the two women were not unnoticed by art historians.
What does Hitler have to do with this?
"I think in memory of my friend Klimt I owe him to make his handicrafts available to the public," wrote Adele Bloch-Bauer a few years after the artist's departure (Klimt died in February 1918) to the director of the Belvedere Museum and wished that their family would go to the Kolum Column.
Six years before his death, Klimt had made another portrait of Adel.
Also in her will (Adele left in February 1925) she asked her husband to leave her two portraits and four of Gustav Klimt's landscape paintings to the Austrian Gallery.
He inherited his jewels from his nieces, Mary and Louise.
A year after Klimt had graduated from the "Austria Mona Lisa", Adolf Hitler, 17, had tried to enter the Vienna Academy of Fine Arts, but fell through the drawing process.
Although Hitler’s later anti-Semitism is sometimes thought to be due to the fact that he was not accepted by Jewish professors into the academy, none of his examiners was actually Jewish.
In any case, the task of the Austrian Gallery referred to in the Will of Mary had changed markedly by 1939 - it had become important to find pleasant works from Vienna’s rich Jewish art collections to the Nazi Party.
Hitler's personal art was also suited to some of Adele's homework, but not Klimt's.
Sixty years after the Nazi art robbery, a ten-year legal battle began between the Austrian government and the Bloch-Bauer heirs.
It should be noted here that if "The Kiss" is seen in the Belvedere Palace in Vienna, then Adele Bloch-Bauer's "Golden Lady" is to be seen driving to New York's New Gallery.
And before the trip to Vienna, also read the aforementioned book.
Even if you watch Klimt’s work, you don’t plan to go, because at least my emotions revolved around more Nazi and Jewish themes after the book was closed than the painting and model Adele Bloch-Bauer sold for $135 million.
So, not so much a portrait, but rather a family story of fate - and a very moving story.
The Bauerite family tree, which was mentioned at the beginning of the book, was significantly facilitated by the orientation of the events.
The 17-year-old swimmer was very close to the Estonian record in Canada
In the lead, Gold was very close to his personal 200m backsliding record in swimming 2.16.62.
The top score comes from a 17-year-old peak from the back of the week, when the Canadian Junior Championships got 2.16.58, mediated by the Priit Desert Swimming Blog.
Gold finished in the tenth round of the A-finals.
In the final, he went through the distance with a time of 2.15.76 and achieved a good seventh place with a new powerful peak mark.
From the Estonian record of Alina Kendzior (2.15, 13), Gold stayed a little over half a second apart.
Gold was third on the Estonian all-time chart and its fresh personal top market is the fifth-highest result of all-time in Estonia.
The young future will be in the 100m, 200m and 400m free walking and 200m and 400m complex walking at the Canadian adult championships.
Last week, the Toronto Canadian Junior Championships were held, and Gold made successful starts there as well.
He won the silver medal in the 200 m freestyle with a time of 2.03.22.
So quickly this distance was swam by Estonians last in 2008.
More quickly than Gold, only Estonian record holder Elina Part<0xC3><0xB5>ka has swam this distance in Estonia.
The Estonian living in Canada won a bronze medal in the 100 m freestyle with a great personal record and a new Estonian season top score of 56.66.
For example, one year older than him, Kertu Ly Alnek has only swam this distance a century faster.
He reached his personal peak in another 100 m backsliding, receiving a letter of 1.03.69 in the open exchange of notifications.
At a half-long distance, he only reached seventh place when swimming in the final 2.17.31.
Gold is currently leading the Estonian season chart at four different distances.
President Trump goes on vacation, critics brush their teeth
The holiday season is at hand – it also means relaxation for U.S. President Donald Trump.
However, since Trump has been one of the most popular presidents to date, critics are already brushing their teeth.
According to USA Today and CNN, the president plans to spend 17 days at a unique golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey.
While the president’s holiday began yesterday, Trump’s opponents have been talking about the holiday for weeks.
They're proposing too many breaks to Trump.
In fact, the president has the habit of spending weekends in his Florida, Virginia, and New Jersey villas.
By the way, Trump is not the most rested president in his 196 days of office.
For example, George W. Bush has been on vacation for 67 days, while Barack Obama has been half as short as Trump for only 21 days.
However, Trump tends to forget things quickly.
The days after he became president, Trump said, sending "60 minutes" that there would be no time left for long breaks during his term as there was a lot to be done.
He also expressed anger over Barack Obama’s holiday three years ago.
The current president tweeted: “While Obama is on vacation, playing golf, going to parties and jazz concerts, ISIS journalists are shaking their heads off.”
According to White House officials, a 17-day visit to the golf club is not exactly a relaxation.
It’s officially called a work holiday, during which Trump doesn’t have time to read or other activities of his own.
There had to be another reason for the holiday.
That is to say, the air-conditioning system in the western part of the White House is being replaced and therefore all the staff had to leave.
The Oval Cabinet and other presidential offices are also located in Läänetiiva.
“I don’t think anyone else would like to be in the West Coast in August if it’s 38 degrees and there’s no air conditioning,” said White House spokesman Lindsay Walters, who stressed that the president will continue to work during the holidays.
Where President Trump spends the next 17 days, you get an idea from the video.
Blocking critics from Facebook Don’t apply for state office if you can’t tolerate voter criticism
Our country's father knew so much about the unfavorable media coverage.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn’t take long for the newspapers to begin emptying him from domestic politics to political principles.
Criticism, of course, irritated him.
But he did not force his critics to remain silent.
In 1783, Washington said, “Freedom of speech may be taken from us, and in the dark and silence we may be led to slaughter like sheep.”
It brings me to the governor of Maryland, Larry Hogan, who has to work hard to be more Washington-like.
Hogan's subordinates have blocked and deleted at least 450 people who posted their opinions on its official Facebook page.
And in the beginning of the week, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) filed a lawsuit against him.
The governor's office slammed the lawsuit for void and web comments about cubic counter-reactions in the style "Who cares?".
“It’s just Facebook,” a lot of people said.
But it counts.
And that counts a lot when it comes to a man like Hogan.
This is surprisingly the case with the popular Republican governor in a predominantly democratic state.
His approval rate is second among the 50 governors of the country.
Hogan is not an unthinkingly responsive firefighter.
He has led the state with a firm hand and is firmly committed to his principles.
In addition, he has used Facebook as the main tool in communicating with his constituents quite frustratingly, presenting, for example, after the first time after a chemotherapy treatment, slurred his hair.
Thus, the Governor’s pages, which are officially labeled as a public forum managed by taxpayers’ dollars-wage staff, are unnecessary and ultimately dangerous to block people visiting.
Hogan’s spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor’s behavior in an interview with The Washington Post, arguing that blocking comments was nothing more than moderating.
But it’s too easy to paint a picture of online food trolls, junk mailers, or hate people.
The Post spoke to a number of real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And that's exactly what they are, the real people who communicate with their chosen leaders. The teacher, the owner of the company and the pastor, not the internet trolls.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful, and not at all racist.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his post, stressing Hogan’s Catholicism.
Lakshmi Sarma Raman, a lawyer from Bowie, Maryland, did not incentivize anger, but rather hate crimes.
"I kindly commented that I am disappointed that he has not responded to hate crimes or other recent news," he wrote in a commentary on The Post's news story.
"I also don't like the idea that when a lot of people comment on the same topic, some immediately call it a collective effort, rather than admitting that it is a great deal of concern to citizens."
What the governor’s office called a “directed spam attack,” others would probably call “public support.”
The Facebook era allows messages to be easily matched by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It is much cleaner than it used to be, when workers had to be sent out to collect newspapers with critical handbooks and burn them or arrest the protesters and force them to remain silent.
But that’s exactly what’s happening right now, just digitally.
Hogan is not the first state official to be criticized for disabling Facebook and other social media channels.
President Trump has been sued by Twitter users who have blocked his Twitter feed.
One of the first significant judgments on this issue was made last week in Virginia.
U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris ruled in Alexandria that a Loudoun County Supervisory Board member violated the first amendment to the Constitution when he blocked an elector from his Facebook page.
Kentucky also visited ACLU after using Facebook and Twitter by Governor Matt Bevin (R).
It shouldn't be that hard.
At the time of Washington, affordable postal costs had an impact similar to that of the Internet.
Between 1776 and 1800, the number of newspapers quadrupled and anonymous writers tampered with his management.
And even then, Washington had to hit the chest with anonymous trolls.
People wrote letters to newspapers under such pseudonyms as Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius, and Portius, making Washington's decisions on the ground.
According to historical documents collected as part of George Washington’s online letter-gathering project, the cabinet was swept up by petitions criticizing his views on the friendship, trade and shipping treaties with Britain.
He did not force them to remain silent.
Freedom of speech, disagreements and debates are the cornerstones of our country.
And the right management means to accept it.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for the comfort of home territory at Renaissance Club
Former European performer Ronan Rafferty hopes for the comfort of his home territory over the next three days when the East Lothian Renaissance Club’s 25th Scottish Senior Open takes place.
The Northern Irishman, who was on the Archerfield Links circuits last year ahead of the final round before going down to Paul Eales, has fallen in love with the new venue and plays the role of the tournament’s founder and CEO Jerry Sarvad instead of the club’s founder and CEO.
"I saw how the Renaissance Club was built, and now we see how the club shines in full glory with this event," Rafferty said.
"The riders see the track in its best form, it's in a brilliant state.
Jerry's done a great job building this place.
He is an enthusiastic supporter of the golf game and is proud of what he has achieved here.
This makes it possible to present the track perfectly."
Englishman Eales is looking forward to being able to defend the title for the first time, although the man has won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
"It's a very special feeling," said a player who was batting at Southport.
“I couldn’t defend my Extremadura Open title because it was taken off my winning calendar a year later.
It's magical to get back into this.
This is a great place to play golf.
I remember the memories of last year, for me and my wife Sharon, the victory of last year was special.
It was a very special time that we will always carry in our hearts.”
On the surface of the country, Gary Orr will return to the competition again, who joined the seeders’ European team at the beginning of this year when he turned 50.
It is his first event in Scotland since the 2013 Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open.
"Playing at home is always a little more meaningful," said the Helensburgh man Orr.
"You want to perform well, but you also feel the extra strain.
I’ve enjoyed playing golf again and I’ve shown a pretty decent game of golf.
I’m happy with the way things are going.”
Former Masters Tournament winner Ian Woosnam and senior champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty join the trio.
Orr and former Ryder captain Sam Torrance are two of the six Scots in the competition, the rest being Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.

Poverty and death in Indonesian gold mines
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, he doesn't use a stove.
He rarely even uses a pot.
In a wooden house in Enarotal, the regency capital of the Papua province of Paniai, Indonesia, a housewife places a batad, called a note in the local language, directly on the fire.
After half an hour, a melted mug is taken from the fire and the skin is injected with enthusiasm without washing hands.
Degei sits on the mud floor without any furniture, and there he also does his daily household chores, such as washing the laundry with haze water from a nearby sex.
The walk-in role is played by the ember in the roofless room.
Since she is the youngest of her husband’s four women, she is not assigned to care for any field.
Polygamy is common here.
Late work, however, can be dangerous for most of the village men are unemployed and many of them drink heavily, in addition, there are still soldiers here.
“No one dares to walk around the village after five o’clock in the evening,” he says.
This is a rare glimpse of life in the Papuan mountains, a former Dutch colony that joined Indonesia in 1969 after a referendum that sparked controversy, forcing only 1,026 of the oldest occupying forces to vote with their hands raised in front of the eyes of the occupying forces.
The move, which prompted the liberation of Dutch supremacy, quickly turned its rage against the government of Jakarta, which continues to keep the region under its strong control, keeping foreign journalists and human rights watchdogs away.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, leaving Papua New Guinea as an independent island.
Enarrotal is both a remote and an abandoned place. To get there, you need to fly 90 minutes from the provincial capital of Jayapur to Nabires and then take a boring five-hour drive by car.
There is no public transport.
With a population of about 19,000, the city consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences and covered with corrugated iron roofs, whose rusts have turned different shades of yellow.
Very few Indonesians have made their way here, not to mention journalists, nor have they been to almost any foreign country.
Before the arrival of the Christian missionaries, Mee Pago worshipped a god named Uga Tamee.
There were other changes as well.
“We weren’t used to wearing such clothes,” says Degei, referring to a hand-woven turban, a dark blouse, and an ergonomic skirt.
"Before that, we only carried the seed plates of the body."
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, with 28% of people living below the poverty line and statistics on infant mortality and literacy are among the worst in Asia.
But it is also Indonesia's gold-plated country.
Just 100 km from Pania, a mountainous province of approximately 153,000 inhabitants in New Jersey, is the world’s largest and most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, owned by the Phoenix-based Freeport McMoran.
In 2015 alone, Freeport mined about $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper.
In addition, Papua can be proud of its consumer wood reserves, which are estimated to be worth $78 billion.
However, these riches are a source of Papal suffering, as they are caused by the sluggish presence of a powerful Indonesian military.
A 2005 study by The New York Times found that from 1998 to 2004, Freeport paid local troops and military units about $20 million, including up to $150,000 per officer.
The papacy’s efforts to ensure greater autonomy threaten this gold, and they are treated with pity.
According to human rights activists, more than 500,000 pagans have been killed since 1969 and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military.
According to the Asian Commission on Human Rights, the mass killings in the Papuan mountainous lands in the 1970s were beyond the scope of genocide.
Last year alone, more than 3,900 peaceful protesters were arrested by Indonesian police.
The 2016 report “We Lose All” by the Archdiocese of Birsban contains testimony of the atrocities committed in the previous year, such as extrajudicial executions, torture (according to one other report, rape and electric shocks are particularly common) and peaceful repression.
“The death toll is hard to count because such incidents occur every week,” said Andreas Harsono, a researcher at Human Rights Watch Indonesia.
The crucibles have been even tighter because Papua’s natural resources have caused new arrivals from other parts of Indonesia.
83% of the province’s 3.5 million inhabitants are Christians, but the demographics are changing as economic migrants from the Indonesian islands of Java, Kalimantan, Sumatra and Sulawesi arrive from Muslim economies.
At the Java family dinner, they sell gado-gado with croissants and mixed vegetables, which are served with peanut butter.
The locals can't compete with them.
“Migrants began selling chicken and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than local potatoes,” explains Paniais-born 24-year-old Abeth You, who moved to the provincial capital, Jayapura, for work.
"Indigenous poppies, poppy moms [women] are therefore losing their market share."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, known to the people as Jokowi, promised in his 2014 election campaign to address their inequalities and human rights violations in Papua.
The former woodpecker won the Jakarta presidential palace in 29 of the 27 constituencies of Papua, including Paniai.
But in Papua, very little has changed and the locals feel betrayed.
“Our hearts are broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokowi in the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes of restoring justice,” You said.
In fact, Paniai was in a low position just two months after Jokowi took office in October.
On December 7, 2014, 11 children sang a Christmas song at the fire in Enarotal when two Indonesian soldiers appeared on a motorcycle from the darkness.
The affected children told them that they should turn on the headlights.
According to the story of local pastor Yavedt Tebai, one of the soldiers raped their tone of voice and later returned with four soldiers.
Victims and eyewitnesses said that drunk soldiers chased the children and stabbed them with their gun handles.
Then one of the soldiers shot the children.
One child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimot, was beaten so cruelly that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the impending election commission building was set on fire and the next day things escalated further.
About 1,000 young Papuan men, women and children gathered to demand justice at a football field in front of the local police station and the military control center.
They wore ceremonial hunting carriages and performed a waita dance of the Papuan honey pago tribe, during which a bird song ran around and played.
Some protesters began to shove stones at police and military personnel.
In the wake of the aggravation of the evil, the soldiers were sent an order via internal radio. "If the masses are resisting more than three times, shoot them down," according to an official document seen by the magazine TIME, which has not been issued to local media outlets.
Jeremiah Kayame (56) of Enarotal, a district of Kego Koto, felt threatened and called for peace, asking the crowd to go home.
No one wanted to listen.
“As I turned around, I was suddenly shot in the left wrist,” he told TIME magazine in his bright colours on the porch of the wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who the shooter was, but he says the moon came from the ranks of the assembled soldiers.
"There was a lot of people, a lot of retaliation," he adds.
A local man named Alfius Youw was shot three times by a cousin who had seen him.
“I ran to him and examined his body to make sure it was him,” John, who uses only one name for many Indonesians, told TIME magazine.
"I saw that he was dead... I kissed him."
Papua Police Chief Inspector Yotje Mende told reporters that his subordinates only guaranteed the security of his department because it was attacked.
"We must protect ourselves if we are threatened to be killed," said Pudjo Sulistiyo, a Papuan police spokesman.
"It's a matter of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and numerous injured.
The news of the killings arrived in Jakarta the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi gave a passionate speech in Jayapura, where he expressed condolences to the families of the victims and promised to deal with the abuses that took place in Papua.
“I want to solve this case right away so that it will never happen again in the future,” he said.
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he would establish an out-of-court mechanism for resolving crimes against human rights.
There was also an apology almost immediately.
“Most of the crimes happened a long time ago.
Some of them took place in the 1990s and early 2000s.
The point is that we are committed to resolving these crimes, but we need to follow certain processes," he said.
Speaking to TIME magazine in Jakarta on June 5, Wiranto said he had no intention of setting up a mechanism in Papua to deal with complaints.
Instead, he said, “everything is settled by law.”
The Wiranto, who has been accused of crimes against human rights in connection with the deaths of more than 1,000 people in the 1999 bloody independence referendum in East Timor, said 11 of the crimes against human rights have already been solved in Papua, including those in Panias.
The families of Paniai’s victims accepted such claims with a grim outcry.
“I’ve been overheard four times in the last three years, but no progress has been made,” John said.
"I'm tired."
He says he's still living scary years later.
"I'm afraid," he says.
"I'm afraid the military will arrest me, I'm afraid I'll be shot."
His brother Jacob affirmed the view that the Panian people were afraid of the incident.
He said he was beaten by the military after he helped bury the four victims.
“After burying the dead bodies, the military had to look for me,” he says.
The celebrations have not stopped.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot villagers in the neighbouring regency of Paniai in Deiyais.
One person was killed and 17 injured, including children, when a speech was made between the villagers and the head of the construction company, who refused to transport an unconscious man to the hospital.
This master ship, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who drowned in a nearby river while fishing, died on the way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested at the construction site in front of the company’s office.
According to the police, the villagers smuggled the policemen with stones, after which the latter responded with warning bills.
But according to locals, a mobile brigade (the Indonesian military police) started shooting at the people, killing one person.
"We're in a big panic, we're afraid of retaliation," 29-year-old Domingu Badi, who lives near the hospital, told TIME magazine.
"I've been hiding in my house for two days."
Deiyai’s parliament has called for police officers to be held responsible and the police mobile brigade to be withdrawn from the area.
Paniai has always been a problematic place for the Indonesian government.
The lack of thought-provoking development fuels the discontent of the honey, the many, the Dani and the Damali tribes living in Papua’s precipitous Middle Ages.
Many of them have joined the Free Papal Movement (VPL) rebel army, which, according to him, defends the rights of papists, organising casual attacks and kidnappings among Indonesian soldiers.
Some VPL leaders are from Pania, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Judas Kogoya.
In response, the military has arrested Paniais in recent years on the grounds of “defending the sovereignty of the state” and has voluntarily detained thousands of people.
Some of them will never show up again.
Among Papua people, Pania is known as the "tragic forgotten place".
Poverty fuels discontent.
A small amount of rice sold in Enarotal is too expensive for locals to buy.
The bread is equally inaccessible.
People grow all of their food mainly on their own with potatoes, in addition to some fruits and leafy vegetables.
Farming is the work of women, each of whom is able to care for four or five butterflies.
They usually keep most of the harvest to the family, while the rest sell on the local market.
Ten potatoes cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, the economic inequalities between the indigenous Papuans and the new migrants, who have been fatally arriving since the opening of new airlines at Nabire Airport, have escalated.
These few jobs that exist go to better-educated and more affluent migrants.
Papers themselves often lack the capital or skills needed to run a competitive business.
“Young people are not interested in staying here because there are no jobs or money here,” said John Gobai, chairman of the Pania Tribal Council.
Separation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua.
In addition, there are strict restrictions on external media.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were sent out of Papua, for "not following relevant practices", although they had been given a rare filming permit.
Phelim Kine, deputy head of Human Rights Watch’s Asian division, said Jokowi’s election bans have not been enforced to remove the restrictions imposed on reporters to promote transparency and development.
"In Indonesia, journalists from the easternmost unrest provinces of Papua and West Papua attempting to report are threatening new threats of visa rejection and blacklisting," he said in a statement.
The lack of a sluggish look at the press means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely confined to nearby Papua.
In March, six Pacific countries urged Tonga, Nauru, Belau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands UN Human Rights Council to investigate "a variety of widespread crimes" in Papua, including the shooting of Paniai.
The same countries have historically supported the VPL.
Arrmanatha Nasir, a spokesman for Indonesia's foreign ministry, dismissed the group's accusations, telling reporters in Jakarta: "In Indonesia, democratic order and freedom of the press still exist, so evidence of human rights violations would be difficult to dig up."
The local people want more attention from the governments of foreign countries.
When the official Dutch delegation headed by the country's human rights envoy Kees Van Baar visited Jayapura on May 4, locals interrupted the meeting, but said the source wanted to remain anonymous, insisting: "We want freedom."
Indonesia will hold new presidential elections in 2019, but the popes do not believe they will vote for Jokowi again.
“Jokowi is a man with good intentions, but he is surrounded by people involved in the Pania shooting,” Hobai, chairman of the Tribal Council, said in a statement.
He wants to make Jokow realize that, in addition to the Panian people constantly living under the threat of a squalid army, they are struggling because of Nigerian education and health services.
According to Gobai, the people of Pania, like the other priests, owe their vote to Jokoi, which he has to pay.
“They don’t need money, they want justice,” he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, the families of Paniai’s shooting victims were able to cope with the latest symbolic retaliation, killing the body of one of the victims in the country opposite the police station and military base.
Knowing that justice may never come to an end, they will at least not let the perpetrators forget their crimes.
“One of our family members was killed,” Yacobus said with his head down.
"What else can we do?"
It was the second time that the Dubai Torch skyscraper has been swallowed by fire.
On Friday, fire swept through one of the world’s tallest residential towers in Dubai, forcing hundreds of residents to flee the 337-metre-high and 79-story building.
This is the second fire that has erupted in just two years from a high-rise hit known as the Torch Tower.
The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported and no direct cause of the fire was reported.
“We slept and woke up with a fire alarm and people screaming.
We would run down the stairs and it took us about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor," one resident, who called himself George, told Reuters.
According to Dubai Civil Protection officials, firefighters cleared the lake at around 4 a.m. local time (00.00 GMT) and cooled the building.
The government said they are working to provide shelter to the victims.
This incident could once again raise questions about the safety of materials used on the outer surface of high-rise buildings around the world.
The investigation conducted by the Board of Directors after the Torch fire in 2015 found that the most damage suffered by the exterior decorative panels and insulation of the fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade.
British police have said they believe that London’s Grenfell Tower insulation and fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade panels may have contributed to the rapid spread of the June fire that killed about 80 people.
See also: These phones will probably be selling out in the fall
Spring and autumn are a sweet time for tech fans, because then phone manufacturers will unveil their new top models.
Samsung Galaxy S8, Huawei P10 and Sony Xperia XZ Premium were launched in the spring, and new hot phones are expected to be available in the fall.
According to Kristjan Seema, Tele2’s marketing and sales director, this year’s flagship is characterized by an innovative design, an eye-catching scanner, an edge-to-edge 4K display and an ultra-fast processor.
The Samsung Galaxy S8, which has also reached the top of the Estonian smartphone sales chart, has generated great enthusiasm in the technology world.
In the autumn, smart people can enjoy even more fast charging, a more durable battery, a higher-quality camera and greater water and dust resistance.
He added that based on the hearings, it is already possible to make assumptions and predict four top models, which are likely to conquer the sales charts of the year.
The top four smartphones will be available on the market in the autumn of this year.
The long-awaited iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus are expected to arrive in mid-September.
But what the new Apple model looks like and what can be done with it is widespread.
While the iPhone 7 did not bring significant differences alongside the iPhone 6s, Apple’s 10th birthday is expected to make the new model completely different from the previous one.
We are talking about four colors: black, white, pink gold and chrome.
One of the elements of the new design is apparently a screen that covers the entire front panel of the phone, a home button is lost, and a fingerprint reader is built into the screen.
JonyIve, Apple’s chief design officer, wants the new iPhone model to look like smooth glass.
There has also been talk of the ceramic version of the iPhone.
In addition to an eye-catcher scanner, wireless charging and even higher quality camera, a faster A11 processor can be expected.
This is one of the most anticipated smartphones of the year.
Pre-order of the new Galaxy Note 8 will begin on August 23rd.
There’s been a lot of talk about what the new Galaxy Note 8 will look like.
It is said to be designed for even more business users, and the S Pen allows even greater functionality.
The phone should have two cameras, one of which is an oval angle and the other a narrower field of view telephoto lens.
At the moment, no one knows what the two rear cameras are capable of, but in any case, this is Samsung’s first test, which is certainly comparable in quality to the iPhone 8.
We are looking forward to August 23rd.
While Nokia has sold three smartphones in the lead with the Nokia 6 this year, there is still a lack of their flagship - the Nokia 8, which will be presented already on August 16.
We’re looking forward to Nokia’s 5.3-inch edge-to-edge display and ultra-fast Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor and more durable battery.
In the case of Nokia, we are also talking about the aluminum body and a significant degree of water and dust resistance IP68.
Similar to Samsung, Nokia’s new model has two rear-facing cameras manufactured by Zeiss.
While Sony has been the flagship of the XZ Premium, the manufacturer has confirmed that at least two smartphones with even more innovative features will be added in the near future.
We are waiting for a smartphone that is a little more modest than the XZ Premium, but at least with a good or better camera.
Sony’s new model is speculated to have a screen of at least six inches.
What brings reality, we can already see in the right direction, as Sony has traditionally unveiled its autumn flagship at the international technology fair IFA, which will be held from 1 to 6 September this year.
According to leaked transcripts of phone calls, Trump pressured Mexico to pay for border wall
The Washington Post released transcripts of phone calls between U.S. President Donald Trump and Mexican and Australian heads of state.
On January 27, Trump made a phone call to Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto after the latter ended the public announcement that he was not going to pay for the proposed border wall.
The American president slammed the wall with him for public condemnation, saying, “You mustn’t say that to the press.”
Trump made his presidential campaign on the promise to build a wall along the southern border of the United States and vowed to make Mexico pay for the project.
Transcripts of his first speech with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published, revealing a tense exchange of views.
Trump told Turnbull that the deal under which the United States takes on refugees heading to Australia is "laughterful", "serious" and "worse". He claimed that the deal, which was made during the Obama administration's coup d'état, would leave him with a slump in the ambition.
Trump ended the speech by telling Turnbull that “this was the most unpleasant speech of the day.”
The Riigikogu did not take the complaint of OÜ MRP Linnai in the case where the city of Tartu rejected their offer to purchase a bus line from July 2019 to 2029.
This is an order rejecting OÜ MRP City Lines’ bid for the Tartu bus contract because the bid did not meet the requirements, explained Anneli Apuhtin, head of the Tartu City Government Law Service.
This is a public bus service in the city of Tartu for the period 01.07.2019-30.06.2029.
MRP City Lines appealed the decision of the Tartu District Court to the National Court.
The Supreme Court did not take this action.
While many on social media complain that the weekend’s noisy festival disturbs their night and the whole city is full of drunken partyers, there are plenty of people on the beach who don’t have a bad word to say about the festival.
I’m even positively surprised that the parties in the store were so clever!
I didn't see any turmoil or indifference.
“I’ve seen it,” says the squirrel.
“It’s nice to see, be, and know the joy of Pärnu, which has been wintering like winter,” he adds joyfully.
Wet water from the beach and not disturbing.
While living in the city centre, he still heard that music was being played on the beach, but now the music has not yet reached his home.
"But I hope to hear it," he says joyfully.
Agnes, who also spoke with the Evening Party, says that the big festival is rather good for Pärnu - it is a great contribution to the business of local merchants.
In addition, he is pleased that so many foreigners have visited the summer capital.
The noise of the parties does not bother the woman.
I don't live on the beach anymore, but I'm glad the beach is alive.
And it’s good that people are moving, and it’s been that way three times already,” she said.
For the first time, it was a bit worse.
“There may have been complaints,” he said.
However, the noise at the beach is, according to him, common for summer swimmers.
“This weekend is a very good promo for our little town,” says Harri, who lives in the park.
Noise and noise have not swayed his rhythm of life.
But for what?!
We should keep it all together.
Think about how it would be better to communicate internationally.
The sound of music doesn't shake.
It doesn't bother me, even though I live nearby.
“Good people can save and there’s no problem,” he said.
According to him, the guests who came to Pärnu are wise.
“They’re a little overreacting with the bottles, of course, but young people are young and goddamn — let’s go, but be people and we can do it!” he says.
By this time, coastal residents have traveled somewhere far away, whether to relatives or acquaintances.
"But in general, the festival has a positive impact on life - people like that noise," says Tiina, who walked with the children in Pärnu.
His family and festival music are also not bothered, although last year it went even further than this year.
Last summer, the stage was different, so we heard more.
We live outside the city ourselves, that actually gets there far by the river Pärnu quite well," he says.
Pearson Cuts More 3000 Jobs and Reduces Dividends to Restore Business
British education firm Pearson said on Friday it would cut another 3,000 jobs and cut its interim dividend by 72 percent, launching another restructuring program to address the business’s intimidation.
Lost jobs, which, according to CEO John Fallon, are likely to be pooled at the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019, will add to the 4,000 jobs lost during the previous restructuring.
In May, Pearson announced plans to cut an additional <0xC2><0xA3>300 million ($394 million) under a third-party cost-cutting program to try to revive a business that has become a hoax due to a rapid digital learning transition.
The company, which agreed to sell a stake in Penguin Random House last month to its partner company Bertelsmann, said their expectations for the year had not changed after a 1 percent increase in sales revenue was reported to be <0xC2><0xA3>2.05 billion in the first half of the year.

Konvoirunnak in Kabul: NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
According to officials, a suicide bomber attacked military convoys in the Afghan capital Kabul, killing one NATO soldier and wounding several others.
A NATO statement said five soldiers and translators were injured.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians were killed in an incident in the city's Qarabaghi district.
This bombing is the latest of the violence that has hit Afghanistan this month - more than 30 people were killed in the Herat mosque massacre on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
NATO said Thursday night's blast occurred when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked "with a man-carried, self-made explosives."
According to the statement, all of the injured are in a stable condition and are being treated at the US military hospital at Bagram airport.
According to the correspondents, the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (ISIS), the ever-growing force in Qarabagh is a serious source of concern for NATO forces in Bagram.
According to UN data, at least 1,662 civilians died in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, about 20% of them in the capital.
At the end of July, a car bomb in Kabul killed at least 30 people, mainly in the Shiite region.
The Taliban said they were behind the attack.
On May 31, a major bombing in the city center killed more than 150 people – the most-deadly military attack in the country since U.S.-led forces ousted the Taliban in 2001.
This violence highlights the uncertain security situation in Afghanistan, while U.S. President Donald Trump is considering increasing the number of U.S. forces assisting the country’s military and police.
According to correspondents, the suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have also led to a public confidence crisis against the government, its policies, and especially President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA cancelled after appealing the decision to postpone the interim regulation
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) annulled the decision to delay the imposition of an Obama-era regulation that obliges states to limit emissions that cause rabies, one day after 15 states complained to the agency about this move.
The EPA announced its decision to proceed with "2015's ozone-determination operations" late Wednesday, saying it shows the agency's commitment to cooperation with the states.
"We believe that we need to have dialogue with our partners in our states and listen to them," EPA chief Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
Pruitt had announced in June that the EPA intends to reject the determinations of ozone levels to measure air pollution in different parts of the country in order to determine where this level should be reduced by one year to meet the stricter air quality standard by October 2018.
15 principally Democratic states filed a lawsuit with the District of Columbia on Tuesday, saying that the decision was illegal.
President Donald Trump’s government has tried to pull back a number of environmental regulations introduced by former President Barack Obama, which Trump said is part of a broader growth plan.
But these efforts have provoked counter-reactions among Democrats and conservation groups, who are concerned about the increased impact of pollutants on human health.
The EPA website writes that inhaling ozone-containing air "may reduce lung function and increase the risk of developing respiratory diseases", for example, asthma.
German pigs can have a party.
Germany’s pigs and cattle could come to the party as heavy rains threaten the harvest of another wheat producer the size of the European Union, writes Bloomberg.
This year it may be that the harvesting of weeks before harvesting may mean that the fruit for the bread industry is suitable only for feeding the animals.
“The quality of wheat is far worse than wheat and poorer than in 2015,” said Bernhard Chilla, an analyst at Agravis Raiffeisen.
This year, up to 40 percent of German wheat can be used for animal feed, which is twice as much as normal, Agravis forecasts.
German farmers, as well as their European colleagues, have been exposed to all kinds of weather this year.
At first, the winter was too dry.
Then came the cold spring, which in June replaced the hot coals.
In July, Germany was hit by a rainy season, which continued in August.
The eyes of many have been turned to Northern Germany, where rain prevents harvesting.
Only 5 percent of the wheat has been harvested so far.
Most of the area has not yet started harvesting, said local harvester Ceravis.
“It’s a pretty complicated day,” said Frank Decker, a senior trader at Ceravis from Rendsburg.
Consistency in all things, namely, the subtle flaws of Finnish interior design
Beautiful nature plays its part in the interiors of honeycomb houses, because through the large windows, even views of the slopes of Saimaa reach many (living) rooms.
Every step of the way, the efforts of our northerners to create both rugged and perfect (energy-saving) homes begin to emerge.
The Finnish woodworking skills as building and finishing materials, furniture and beauty products are worthy of admiration and respect.
In the fairhouses, both the builder and (home) designer can find vivid drawings and smart solutions.
There it is evident that black, white and gray shaded compositions, when complemented by wooden shades and houseplants, can be very enticing.
Good ideas can go on for another week, because the fair lasts until August 13.
Accessories and herbal pots suggest that this kitchen is often cooked.
Tonight, the line was drawn to this year’s Weekend Festival Baltic, and Martin Garrix did everything in his power to be remembered as the last performer.
The people were really turning around at the time of Garrix's performance - singing, cheering, dancing with self-confidence.
When Garrix finished, a common mass of light spread from the beach of Pärnu to the city.
We bring you a gallery with all the pictures that our photographer took over the weekend in three days.
You must be one of them too, look up!
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discuss possible confrontation
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who are expected to be on a collision course to face off in the tightest boxing match in the near future up to 66.7 kg weight category, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms at ESPN’s Los Angeles office until Garcia, the invincible World Boxing Council lightweight champion, walked across the corridor to greet Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization heavyweight champion.
After Garcia's unanimous decision to win over former four-time world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday at Showtime, both fighters are in the forefront of the weighing table.
Garcia stretched out her right hand and said, "How are you, Champion?
I wish you good luck."
Lomachenko will defend his belt against Miguel Marria on Saturday night at 7 p.m. on ESPN.
When a couple posed for photos, Lomachenko manager Egis Klimas noted that a possible confrontation between the fighters would be a "perfect measurement".
"I'm old-fashioned," Garcia recalled.
"I moved up for Broner [to 63.5 kg], but I'm not that big.
I'm 63.5 kg small.
I want to move down lightweight.
And he has to move up lightweight [61.2 kg] and then we can fight.
Fans have wanted it.
Let’s offer them that.”
Lomachenko agreed.
"The boxing world needs this fight."
Klimas raised the question of whether viewing it should be cost-effective. This is part of his strategy, according to which he wants to let Lomachenkol debut at the end of this year in a 61.2 kg class to make it possible for the next summer to meet with Garcia at the mat or at the toil of the toil (37-0, 30 knots on the fork) and at the fork of the fork of the camp with the 23 s.
"Watching this fight could be rewarding, as fans have wanted this confrontation," Garcia said later, saying that she is open to fighting on any channel that offers the best financial package.
“We are the main actors.
No other name can get that much attention.
Whenever they are ready...”
Garcia said he considers Lomachenko a "strong fighter" and can go see his Saturday match.
Lomachenko, however, was modest in approving Garcia, saying that he thought the three-division champion from Riverside looked "very slow; sorry, Mikey... you wanted this knockout".
According to Garcia, the goal was to show punch strength and then box.
Both of them confirmed that they felt the tension between them was growing in order to prove their wealth.
“It’s a struggle that awaits realisation.
No one gets so much attention and succumbs to it.
I’m more than willing to work on it,” Garcia said.
Lomachenko said: “I’ve been waiting for the best fighters and that’s exactly what Mikey is.
This is going to be a good fight.”
From what world angles are you moving to Estonia?
The Police and Border Guard Agency (PPA) has extended and issued a record more than 13,000 residence permits to third-country nationals who have mainly travelled to Estonia to work, study or family.
When, for example, a temporary residence permit was issued to 6,702 foreigners, the number was 4928.
The authorities are unable to say how many immigrants will eventually remain permanently in Estonia, but such an analysis will be prepared by the Ministry of the Interior.
When almost 500 Ukrainians moved to Estonia a year ten years ago, in recent years that number will begin to reach close to 2,000.
The number of applicants for a residence permit increased sharply during the Ukraine crisis - in 2014, 1,087 people received a temporary residence permit, a year earlier, 675.
According to the Statistical Office, the number of Ukrainian citizens in Estonia is growing the most - 850 Ukrainian citizens arrived in Estonia more than left.
"The Ukrainian community has always been large in Estonia and due to the difficult conditions in the country, it is natural that work and learning opportunities are sought in a country where the community and many families are already in front of it," said Kristin Rammus, a spokeswoman for the Ministry of the Interior.
The number of Ukrainians who had been granted temporary residence permits to Mullu and Tunimullu was even higher than the number of Russian citizens, although in ten years there have been the most temporary residence permits issued to the latter.
When Ukrainians come here to work mainly, Russian citizens will be forced to immigrate.
“Given the historical Russian community here, they are also most likely to have the greatest family ties with people living in Russia,” said Helina Maasing, a migration researcher at the Academy of the Interior.
“When you look at where the Russian citizens who have been granted Estonian residence permits have moved to live, Harjumaa is right after East Viruma,” he added, adding that about 40 percent of them have married a citizen of the European Union.
Mullu was granted a temporary residence permit for 1696 Russian citizens, which is also a record number.
At the same time, the number of Russians wishing to extend their residence permits decreased.
"The reason is that instead of renewing the residence permit, a new residence permit has been applied for for permanent residence in Estonia," Rammus, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Interior, explained, according to which Russian citizens' interest in the residence permit has remained rather stable for years.
Foreigners who have lived here for at least three years may apply for a new residence permit for permanent residence in Estonia from the previous year.
Its purpose is to encourage people who have adapted to stay here.
A long-term resident’s residence permit, for example, takes five years.
With the new residence permit, the extension of the old residence permit has probably also been reduced.
For example, a residence permit was granted to 146 Ukrainians who have worked here for at least three years.
Now Ukrainians can change jobs and the Estonian state will no longer be able to determine whether the wage criterion is met.
This residence permit became very popular - for applicants to the mud still grey passport holders (1029), Russians (487), Indians (54) and Nigerians (36).
In 1968, a total of 23 people, including 23 Americans, 12 Egyptians, 18 Georgians and as many Chinese, were granted residence permits to live in Estonia.
In the first half of this year, the total number of such applicants is already 1269.
In ten years, Nigeria has surprisingly become a country whose citizens are one of the most active applicants for Estonian residence permits.
When three residence permits were issued to Nigerians in 2007, there were 200.
You’ll be able to study in Nigeria at universities.
Estonian universities are also popular among Georgians, Chinese and Turks, for example.
The number of citizens of India, Bangladesh and Nigeria has increased mainly thanks to students.
They also have the rule that where the community has emerged, it is easier to get to others,” Rammus added.
Over the past 10 years, two people have also moved to Estonia from North Korea, as much as from Laos and Madagascar.
Ten people have come here from Cuba, 231 from South Korea, 40 from Indonesia and four from Uruguay.
While around 6,000 third-country nationals are granted a residence permit per year, that is about 0.46 percent of the total population.
Even if you count the citizens of the European Union, migration remains at about one percent,” Maasing commented that the numbers are actually small.
According to the Statistical Office, 14,822 people migrated to Estonia, 13,792 of them.
This means that immigration exceeded the second year of emigration.
Most of the expats and immigrants are Estonian citizens, but more of them are among the expats.
Therefore, the migration balance of Estonian citizens was down by 2,000 people.
Estonians mainly migrate between Finland and Estonia.
Mommy Couture princess fashion charms with satin, embroidery and tulle
For Maria Tammeor, however, there is history - old paintings and costumes: "I can dream for hours in a museum and admire old-fashioned sleeves and collars.
When you do something with stress, you will study and learn about it every day.
It's a joy of discovery!
The glamorous world of Mummy Couture may look bizarre to some, but the designer doesn’t think so.
You decide how much light there is in your life.
I have a friend who has a whole sauna full of my created haute couture dresses.
Because it’s not her fault that she doesn’t live in Hollywood and doesn’t wear red carpets every day, she wants to wear the most beautiful dresses and wear them!
You can make your life special for yourself!
The fashion artist does not recognize the gap between bright events and gray everyday life.
It was this idea that made the plan to bring high fashion in Estonia to the countryside, between forests and fields, to people who often do not reach fashion.
For example, the Mammu collection was presented at V<0xC3><0xB5>rus, J<0xC3><0xB5>hvis and Pärnu fashion store, where a 45-model royal parade filled the entire street.
In Tallinn, they are often taken into a shop, dignified, but elsewhere there are more emotions - they shout bravo, stand up, want to thank you hand in hand.
A large part of the audience came to the news, but now they are fans of Mammu Couture.
If you exceed people's expectations, they're impressed!
And I like the feeling that I'm in my mood as if I were on a summer vacation.
We had a 50-metre-long red carpet, a whole street full of beautiful dresses, it felt like they wouldn’t end!
Maria also does not admit that the creation has to be presented to the supersale supermodel, she enjoys bringing ordinary women to the stage.
I often invite my own clients to the stage - they have always come with pleasure.
It's such a cool experience, you can shine on the stage in a beautiful dress!
I’m so sorry that I’ve never seen my own performance myself, I’m always behind the scenes to give hopeless perfectionist things the last easy.
My nerves wouldn't allow me to look at the hall calmly.
Mary is this kind of fashionista who wants not only to play a representative role, but to be inside everything.
I have my own sewing machine in the studio, I do most of the collection myself.
I like the whole process where you play with the details, you discover.
I'm never far from my creativity and I'm not afraid of work.
Design is not limited to styling, logistics, organizing, organizing - everything has to fit into a single day of temperament of a woman.
These hours of work are going to be huge for fanatics.
I can’t say when my work day will end, for me it’s just a day full of joy!
I’m still very lucky – it’s like a never-ending happy hour: I do something beautiful, a person gets something beautiful and in turn compliments.
I've been told many times that my dresses have magic - they make me feel like a princess.
The sumptuously tedious satirical readings that made Maria’s talent famous overnight have remained the signature of Mammu Couture to this day.
Martin Müürsepp U18 boys: Estonian subgroup tournament weapon turned against us
Too bad, the story is over.
The first thing we noticed was that we couldn’t get our table.
And if there is such a big difference in the table, there is nothing to be done," commented Martin Mürsep, our only NBA player, BC Kalev/Cramo assistant coach.
The opponents took 28 balls from the attacking table and as a result received so many more attacks.
We were also not prepared for their aggressive defense or attack, it struck.
Many English attacks ended in three to five seconds, we couldn't build up the defense.
In the defense, however, they were able to keep their hands between each other, we could not combine.
It hit the team's feet.
The homework was done better.
According to Müürsepa, Estonia should make more tactical mistakes in order to reduce opponents’ turmoil.
In the last quarter - we had zero error, but the opponents already got several fast baskets.
The athleticism and dense overlap that was our weapon in the subgroup tournament, now all turned against us.
Today we did not have the strength against their aggression.
With his care, Mürzepp remained at peace in Kalevi, with Matthias Tassi.
In general, the tournament can say good words about the whole team, until today there was a single kicker.
It is a pity that you have not met such an aggressive opponent before.
The cup has always been self-confident and played its way out today, but it seemed that he was tired - he has carried quite a large load.
But he did some pretty good moves that I’ve seen in training before,” added the coach.
Horrible numbers: The women's basketball team threw at the European Championship with less than 10 points in three quarters...
In the U18 age class, it’s not just the young men’s EMI B division basketball tournament in Tallinn, the girls started the day in Dublin.
And the Estonian game with Poland was a bit of an anti-record field.
Estonia lost 25:65, but still after the third quarter it was 9:49, or only in the last ten minutes the opponents took the foot off the gas pedal, and that period remained at 16:16.
Both in the first and second quarters Estonia 4 threw 1 points in the third...
In the first two minutes, the Estonians hit two of the first four wickets, followed by 25 in the game, then one in the third and then another 21 in the game.
In about half an hour, one of the 47 wizards was killed.
In addition, there were two points out of four releases.
The loss of wages was a reasonable number at that time, 12.
At the end of the game, Poland was 33 and Estonia was 13 percent (68/9).
Estonia has started with two losses, the opening day had to admit Portugal's 83:56 better.
NATO ships arrived in Tallinn to replenish stocks
Today, NATO’s 1st permanent anti-mining group arrived for a scheduled port visit to Tallinn for the weekend to supplement the ship’s stockpiles and prepare for the upcoming exercises.
During the visit, the ships prepare for navigating the sea and give the crew members the opportunity to take a couple of days off.
After the visit, NATO ships will remain in the waters of Estonia to carry out several exercises and be ready for future operations in search of historical explosives.
"The participation of Estonians in the NATO unit and the cooperation training conducted by them in local waters is a good sign of our integration with the Allied forces," said the Chief of the Operations and Planning Division, Commander Arto Reinmaa, in charge of the Naval Fleet.
Starting on 29 June, NATO’s 1st permanent anti-military group will be led by Latvian naval captain Gvido Laudups, who took over the group’s duties at the ceremony held in Riga from Estonian naval officer Captain Johan-Elias from Selyamaa.
The Latvian naval support vessel LVNS Virsatis has been designated as the flagship of the group, which is also the leader of the group.
This semester, the international unit also includes the Estonian naval minesweeper Sakala.
One of the four NATO Marine Command Group ships, the NATO 1st permanent mini-offensive group, is one of the first rapid-reaction units to be deployed by the alliance to various parts of the world within five days.
From 4th to 13th August, the monuments of Pirita Monastery will once again become the site of the Birgitta Festival, which was founded 13 years ago by maestro Eri Klasi.
This year’s Birgitta Festival will be beautiful, powerful and unprecedented, according to Risto Joosti, artistic director of the Tallinn Philharmonic.
Risto Joost: The opera world’s classics include “Traviata” and “Tosca”, ballet responses from the charming “Bolero” to the fun “Karlsson” as well as a self-production of Hay, which is the theme of the year in the “Joseph Haydn” series.
Birgitta Festival is much more than just concerts and theatre performances.
It's bigger than any music theater in its usual form.
It's a festival whose slums take power and never let go.
Because the experience that the listener gets in this upward and mysterious environment makes human beings sound and touches human needs in a way that cannot be described.
Risto, you're the artistic director of the Birgitta Festival for the first year.
Didn't Maestro Eri Klass's shoes look a little big?
Of course, but since I had a very personal relationship with Eri Klass, it has been a lot of help.
He guided me throughout my student career and also supported me at the beginning of my conducting career.
Maybe that’s why it’s easier for me to keep working.
Eri Klas has injected so much goodness into the Birgitta Festival team and of course it all comes to me.
It was great to join a team that knew exactly how things were going.
Just the big heart of Eri Klass also gave me the strength to move forward with the Birgitta Festival at the Tallinn Philharmonic.
And here I am now and I can do it!
What will you do at this year’s festival, and what will you do?
We have artists from England, Latvia, Lithuania and, as a surprise, the first ballet written for Astrid Lindgren’s story will be presented.
That's why Karlsson's flying.
And one curious nuance about it is that the author of this ballet is the Latvian composer Juris Karlsons, who himself expressed the desire to write this work.
He must have had the character of Karlsson since he was a child.
Risto, how do you handle all this?
Thanks to my supportive co-worker.
This kind of work requires a support system and a lot of love, and fortunately I have a lot of it.
And I’ve noticed that my personal emotions don’t depend so much on other people, as much on myself or how I’m going against each new day.
And such conscious tone-keeping, maintaining positivity, and actually smiling at myself in the mirror in the morning, significantly increased my happiness percentage.
Especially now this week, when the most important tests are, I have practiced it especially agaral and it works.
Smiling activates the brain and raises the tone.
It's not just a vocabulary.
I don't think people know half of what the universe has to offer them yet, but it's everyone's own way of discovering it.
Right now, it's an important moment.
Do you have any rituals before the conductor enters the desk?
You have to change your clothes for more comfortable.
This is a small moment for yourself.
But in general, yes, I don't have a chance to rest before a big performance or do a little sleep.
In fact, I even like to interact actively with people, even before entering the board of directors.
But come all to the Birgitta Festival, here is something to discover for not a particularly great opera and ballet friend!
Watch the thrilling videos with Risto Joost!
New results of Swedish age assessment tests for asylum seekers published
In Sweden, a test was conducted among asylum seekers, during which their age was assessed medically with a new approach. The most recent results of the test show that more than 80 percent of the tests were assessed as older than 18, but not all of them believe in the accuracy of the results.
The Swedish National Institute of Forensic Medicine (Rättsmedicinalverket) started testing earlier this year.
The tests were created to assess age more accurately during the asylum application process after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticized for failing to correctly determine the age of several allegedly minor refugees.
To date, the Migration Network has sent 6,880 cases for testing and the Institute of Forensic Medicine has issued a total of 2,481 test results between mid-March 2017 and 31 July 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) were assessed as 18 years of age or older, and in another 25 cases, the Institute of Forensic Medicine estimated that the testable "may be 18 years of age or older".
In 432 cases, it was concluded that the person is "probably under 18".
Tests are only used if the age of a person is under question mark.
According to Johan Göransson, who works at the Institute of Forensic Medicine, the results are consistent compared to those of the previous months.
“We don’t see a big difference compared to previous months’ statistics, the numbers are pretty consistent,” he told The Local.
The fact that most of the cases were estimated to be older than 18 does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers have lied about their age.
The Institute issued 581 test results in May, saying that in 442 cases "there are indications that the person being investigated is 18 years of age or older".
But when the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the results of their 581 tests, it turned out that in 243 cases a person had directly claimed that he would be 18.
This method of medical age assessment, which involves X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI of knee diseases, after which they are allowed to be analyzed by dentists and radiologists, has been criticised in some circles.
One of the skeptics is endocrinologist Claude Marcus at the Karolinska Institute, whose work includes assessing the biological maturity of people to find out if they have passed puberty sooner or later than usual.
“I’ve had reason to think about it and I don’t think the measurement method currently used should be used.
Determining biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can’t say for sure, then we shouldn’t pretend we can,” he told the Metro newspaper.
But Johan Göransson from the Institute of Forensic Medicine defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, it can be said that the risk of inaccurate adulthood of a child is small.
The highest, or about 10%, is the risk if a person is a little under 18.

The 20-year-old bronze medalist Anna Maria Orel made a beautiful debut at the London MM, earning a good 18th place with 67.37.
Orel was MMI’s youngest female runner-up and a cheerful woman confirmed she hopes to fight for the medals in the future.
The race went well and I had a good experience.
With the first try (64.80) I immediately finished my average score, with the second (62.80) I risked too much and with the third (67.37) I was able to keep my head clear," Orel said after the race.
I was looking for my shot, and I'm glad I found it.
Anna Maria Orel’s MMI debut finished in 18th place.
The rain didn’t bother Orel because he trains in the winter at TTU Stadium.
"I'm tough," he said with a little sneeze.
The London Olympic Stadium had almost a full house section of the people, did Orel realize the people around him or could he turn himself off?
I did, but in a positive way.
Everyone says it’s going to happen – that’s it!
When you compete, you can experience it.
Orel confirmed that he will be at peace with MMI's debut and he will have many more good competitions: "I came here with the 32nd or final result of this year's season, I finished in 18th place.
That's a very decent result.
I'm 20 years old and MM - that's all that counts.
I’m taking a good experience and some days I want to compete already for the medals.
West Virginia Governor Announces Party Exchanging
West Virginia Democratic Governor Jim Justice announced at a meeting with President Trump on Thursday night that he was switching parties.
"Remember it or not, but the Democrats walked away from me," the governor said.
"Today I say to you, having prayed much and thoughtfully...today I say to you, West Virginians, that I can no longer help you as a democratic governor."
At the meeting, cheerleaders were fired.
"So I'm going to be a Republican tomorrow," Justice added.
“As a coach, it’s time to play another game.”
Trump had previously promised a big announcement at the West Virginia rally.
Trump won 42 points in West Virginia, and Justice did not support Democrat candidate Hillary Clinton.
According to Forbes, Justice, the state’s only billionaire, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in the fifth state and a coal business owned by his father.
Its value is approximately $1.59 billion.
At the same time, the Republican National Committee (RNC) announced on Thursday evening that "Governor Justice's party exchange is another blow to the Democratic Party, which would rather prevent the country from making it better again than working for it."
"Just 15 governorships and control over the lowest number of states in history - Governor Justice's announcement is simply the most recent rejection of a party that is end-to-end leader and cannot find a positive and unifying message," RNC spokeswoman Ronna McDaniel told News.
It’s no surprise that there are a lot of people here, too.
On the weekend, Urmet, in office at the medical center, told the Evening Newspaper yesterday that they had to give out quite a lot of patches.
Wilds and landslides are basic, twisting out and light falls.
Of course, also headaches, back and legs.
According to Urmet, visitors will come to the festival with false shoes and so problems will come.
Doctors have also had to help visitors with a couple of major injuries - there have been some panic attacks and also one pedestrian storm.
We have also made stitches when a person has broken a hand or finger.
We'll make smaller seams here, send larger ones to the hospital.
Watch the video to see if the festive medics are also asking for a painkiller to treat the scalp.
Coe apologises to Russians for doping scandal
Sebastian Coe, an international figurehead of the light force, praised Russia's "honest apology" for Thursday's doping scandal, but reiterated that now is not the time to allow the country to return the sport.
Dmitry Shylakhtin, a Russian lightweight champion, said at the IAAF Congress on the eve of the IAAF World Championships that his country’s ban on doping is correct and he has a firm goal to fight doping.
He apologised “to all the lightweights from whom gold and silver medals have been smashed in competitions.”
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted in favour of a competition ban imposed in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report found evidence of state-backed doping in Russia.
"I think today was a very honest response, a very honest presentation," IAAF President Coe told reporters.
"The Health Council and the entire Congress were pleased that the Russian Permanent Union also acknowledged itself that they have had quite difficult times and that they are doing everything possible to reorganize the Permanent Union."
Coe also said he was pleased that Russia had accepted the criteria for its own restoration.
"I believe that today was a very constructive day and progress is being made, but Congress supports the working group's proposal that now is not the right time to take Russia back," Coe said.
“We need to do everything we can in the next few months to normalize the situation.
We have always been based on the principle that we want to separate clean athletes from the broken system,” he added.
Nineteen Russian lightweight riders who meet the IAAF’s stringent criteria will compete as neutral athletes at the World Championships in London on Friday.
The head of the IAAF working group, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia still does not meet a number of reset criteria.
Following a presentation to the IAAF Council, he told reporters in London that doping control is still inadequate and that the banned trainers are still operating freely.
The electric car revolution is changing the demand for metals.
Who are the winners and losers?
Not only does the electric car revolution significantly change everything from the fuel market to the infrastructure, it also creates new winners and losers in the metal market.
While mining giants like Glencore can say that they win from one place and lose from the other, smaller mining firms won’t help.
Currently, Glencore serves from coal and oil, but in the era of electric cars, cobalt, lithium, copper, aluminum and nickel demand is growing.
This year, the UK, France and Norway governments have increased their contributions to the spread of electric cars by allowing the sale of new cars using fossil fuels to be banned in the coming decades.
Sestap has already announced that they are planning to abandon the internal combustion engine, and Tesla is bringing the cheaper Model 3 electric car to the market.
According to Bloomberg New Energy Finance, over the past two decades, more electric cars have been sold than cars with petroleum fuel.
“For some metals, it changes everything,” Capital Economics raw material analyst Simona Gambranini told Bloomberg.
We have already seen a huge impact on such metals as cobalt and lithium, the demand for which has grown for years.
Electric cars are about three times more copper than conventional cars, Glencore said.
Even more copper is needed at charging stations, which is why Exane BNP Paribas estimates it will increase copper demand by about five percent by 2025.
The increase in the demand for electric car batteries means an additional demand for lithium, cobalt, graphite and manganese.
Glencore will receive revenue from the growing trend of electric cars from copper price increases and from being the world’s largest cobalt producer, the Jefferies Group forecast.
According to this brokerage company, the other winners of the electric car race are Freeport-McMoRan and First Quantum Minerals.
The market is responding to a changing trend.
This year, the Cobalt price at the London Metal Exchange is 70 percent.
The fluctuating price increase was 37 percent.
Copper has also risen by 14 percent this year, mainly due to economic growth.
Glencore’s shares rose 20 percent in London, surpassing rivals Rio Tinto Group, BHP Billiton and Anglo American.
On the losing side are lead companies such as Recyclex and Campine, who have to adapt to the new era.
The main end-use of the lead is the batteries powered by the starters of gasoline and diesel-powered cars.
Electric cars use lithium-ion batteries.
“This is a serious risk to iron demand unless another purpose is found to overcome the decline in demand,” said Michael Widmer, head of metal market analysis at the Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
In the face of price movements, the effect of the diverging trend has not yet been noticed.
Lead is 17 percent more expensive this year, with it being the best metal in London among the main industrial metals.
Investors will only see problems with metal in the distant future.
“I’m not sure lead is so bad because cheap oil keeps conventional cars competitive,” said Herwig Schmidt, sales manager at Triland Metals.
When the demand for lead falls, it happens slowly.
Maybe that will happen in about 10 years.
So far, however, tougher emissions standards mean that the demand for hybrid cars, which depend on advanced lead-based batteries when starting engines, is growing, according to the international lead and zinc research organization.
Light metals such as aluminum replace steel because a lighter car can travel less electrically.
This can explain an additional 1.6 million tonnes of aluminium demand from 2013-2016 onwards.
It accounts for 2.7% of the world’s total aluminium production.
This trend is likely to deepen, Widmer said.
Aluminum has risen by 13 percent this year, as the growing demand by car manufacturers has led to a market deficit.
The patio manufacturers don't sleep.
AK Steel Holding is collaborating with General Motors to use nanotechnology to produce amazingly bright car chips.
ArcelorMittal and Tata Steel Europe are also trying to develop a lighter alloy of steel to withstand aluminum rubber.
“Strong steel should be the answer to this development,” said Sylvain Brunet, an analyst at Exane BNP Paribas.
There is some success in Europe.
The end of the oil age can also bring suffering to the platinum.
The mill cost about half of that precious metal to catalyze diesel-powered cars, said Johnson Matthey, a metal refiner.
“Many people with high demand for raw materials such as oil and platinum may not be in high demand in the future,” said Bernard Dahdah, a raw material analyst at Natix.
This does not mean that raw materials as a whole will become less important, but their importance will change within 15 years.
Platinum manufacturers believe there is a continuing demand for diesel hybrid cars.
Uncore CEO Marc Grynberg said that by 2025 more hybrid cars will be sold than all-electric cars.
The platinum manufacturers’ high hope for 10 years is that Toyota Motors and Hyundai Motos developed hydrogen cell-based cars that rely on platinum to produce hydrogen electricity.
So far, however, this technology has not justified itself commercially.
“The diesel seems to be a clear loser on the way to electric cars,” said Exane BNP of Paribas Brunet.
In July, German automakers were hit by a major setback as the Stuttgart court banned the use of diesel in Mercedes-Benz and Porsche's hometown.
How Football's Financial Rules Affect Neymar's Transition to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing uncontrollable spending on European football clubs do not prevent Neymar’s world-record transition from Spanish football club Barcelona to French club Paris-Saint Germain.
Any repercussions from UEFA, the governing body that governs the European game and whose power is to prohibit teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League are still awaiting Paris Saint-Germain.
UEFA’s 2011 Fair Play Financial Regulation (FFP) means that PSG must at some point prove that Neymar’s transition was financed without huge losses.
Barcelona was paid <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>222 million ($262 million) solely for the Brazilian's withdrawal from his contract, and Neymar's salary is set to reach tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of moving to Neymar’s club in France.
Without a doubt, PSG will be able to recruit Neymar and add such money to its stellar lineup, given that the team is financed by the family ruling over the Qatari energy crisis.
Clubs are allowed to spend a lot to recruit players, but they have to balance it with legal income sources that allow them to come out with their own in the football business.
The FFP was founded by Michel Platini after he was elected UEFA President in 2007.
This former French player believed that clubs that fall into huge debts in search of success are actually dealing with fraud and risk deposits if banks or owners should give up support.
Since 2011, FFP has focused on monitoring these losses instead of the debts of clubs.
This change means that the business model that Roman Abramovich first used at Chelsea in 2003 – buying a club with potential and then making big expenses to make the team better and create a global brand – is harder to implement.
During the current three-year valuation period of FFP, which lasts until 2018, clubs may bear losses of up to EUR 30 million.
And despite Platin being shamelessly expelled from the presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor, Aleksander Ceferin, is still committed to preventing excessive spending.
“The FFP is definitely not dead and we will undoubtedly continue to strengthen these rules in the future,” Andrea Traverso, a UEFA FFP observer, told The Associated Press last week.
While PSG paid for Neymar’s takeover clause in one instalment, they can allocate that amount for accounting purposes into parts for the entire duration of the contract.
Neymar entered into a five-year contract, so that a transitional fee of EUR 44.4 million can be shown for the next five years.
In the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, PSG along with Abu Dhabi's Manchester City received the toughest penalties.
PSG was fined 60 million euros ($82 million at the moment), which was later reduced to 20 million euros, and the club was required to limit the Champions League team to 21 players in the 2014–2015 season instead of the usual 25.
UEFA is looking for clubs that can try to override regulatory financial institutions by raising their income through companies associated with the club’s owners.
The Qatari company may sponsor PSG, but if the value of the sponsorship is considered to be above the standard market rates, UEFA would not allow it to be considered as official income.
This was the case in 2014 when UEFA decided that the value of PSG support by the Qatar Tourism Authority had been inflated.
It has been said that some of Neymar’s PSG services may come from Qatar through the 2022 World Championships Organising Committee payments.
However, PSG and Qatar in 2022 deny that Neymar could become the sponsor of the World Championships, and claim that UEFA regulators could easily reveal such a maneuver.
The penalties previously imposed on PSG mean that UEFA is even more cautious about any attempt to ignore the rules.
Those familiar with the situation said on Thursday that UEFA had not discussed the transition of Neymar to PSG in advance.
They spoke to The Associated Press on the condition that their anonymity is guaranteed, as they are not allowed to discuss the PSG situation.
The most recent published reports show that PSG earned more than EUR 10 million in profits in the 2015-2016 season with a turnover of approximately EUR 542.4 million.
Data for the last financial year have not yet been published.
PSG hopes that the arrival of Neymar will have a good impact on sponsorship transactions, trading and shirt sales.
The club expects at least 30 percent growth in turnover due to the conclusion of the contract.
The Spanish League, clearly irritated by the departure of one of the biggest football stars, tried to prevent Neymar from transitioning, claiming that PSG was violating the FFP.
"This is a clear case of 'money doping' with the club and the state," La Liga president Javier Tebas told Spanish newspaper AS, noting that PSG belongs primarily to Qatar.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club belongs to the American sports magnate, shares La Liga’s view that the state is funding the club.
"This is a result of ownership rights and it has completely changed the entire football field over the last 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
"If the club belongs to the state, everything is possible.
It is very difficult to respect the financial rules of an honest game, because the state may have other ways or other interests for such a big player to represent the country."

Today 50 years ago: a hurricane storm in Estonia that ripped roofs and windows from houses.
The storm of the century, which erupted on August 6 and 7, caused great damage to the West, Harjumaa and Raplama.
During these days, the wind speed in North Estonia was over 30 m/s.
My old man ran from one mapping tree to another in the garden and tried to support them with his hands.
Everything was blind and deaf, like the end of the world.
The roofs had already flown from the houses, recalled Linda Kurova from Haapsalu in 2002 in an interview with the Estonian magazine Nature.
Linda’s husband saw her own planted garden collapse.
But what do you do with your hands to support trees where you can resist such a storm?
The sea came under the window, the window sprayed water in,” said Mrs. Linda, who lived on Kalda Street.
The fact that the roads were full of trees and the roof of the railway station perron had flown at a distance of 20-30 meters, Linda only saw most of the headscarves the next morning.
According to the locals, behind the Paralepa, the trees were lying in the ground, some quite long, some half.
Everything looked very terrifying, the storm went from beautiful old trees to ragga and pragina like a war.
West Virumaa was not particularly badly affected in the August 1967 storm compared to West Estonia, but the damage was large there, wrote the Virumaa Teataja in 2007.
The Haapsalu Lossipark and Padise Park were consecrated locally, but our candi parks were also severely affected.
In Tallinn, wind speeds of up to 35 meters per second, or about 130 kilometers per hour, were measured.
On the night of August 6th, a small puppet in Tallinn called out: "Mom, mom!
The chickens are in the air and can no longer come down!” wrote Virumaa Teataja.
The building of the P<0xC3><0xB5>lli manor in Viljandi was destroyed during the storm so much that it was decided to be demolished later.
The August Storm was not able to withstand the constructions of the Turi ski jumping hill, which were later not restored.
The newspaper Red Star wrote on August 12, 1967, that the cleaning of cities and settlements from degraded trees and their branches is progressing slowly, and residents could be involved in the cleaning work.
Orchards were also severely affected in the storm, and the newspaper said that "partisan organisations must be an inspiration and a guide for both the organisation and the harvesting of fruit".
We can talk about hurricanes when the average wind speed exceeds 32.7 m/s.
The record for wind blowing in Estonia is from November 2, 1969, when Ruhnul was measured at a wind speed of 48 m/s.
On Vaindloo Island, the meter was broken, so the measured strong wind speed could not be accurately recorded.
The Secret of Clean Diving Edges: Night Decoration and Bad Beach World
The colder summer worlds also mean the smaller cleaning mine at the submersible shores of Tallinn.
“When there are no people on the beach, when there are no people on the beach,” the beach cleaner said.
Kayaking on the river bank of Northern Tallinn.
They are offered melodic competition at low speeds by a bumper tractor, which pushes the strip down on the plate.
In fact, the last one sweeps through the sand from a depth of seven centimeters, collecting out of it sea debris and a rift left behind by humans: bottle jars, cigarette icons and more.
People still come to the beach, whether the water is warm or not.
When the weather is beautiful, there are people on the beach, and if not, there are no people,” says Aleksandr Usov, head of decorating works at Haabersti Addus Beach.
It's 6.30 and there's a nice decorating work on the beach, because at eight o'clock the place has to be in order for the people.
Usov's at work at 4:00.
In addition to the river, he also keeps an eye on Pirita, Lake Harku, Kakumäe and Paljasaare Pikakari.
The amount of waste has decreased.
Years ago, there was so much more.
People are already able to appreciate what is done for them,” says Usov, who has been cleaning the beach for 15 years.
Before that, when something new was put up, it was already broken the next day.
What is on the beach is now being kept.
The price of the clean beach
One of the most important works on Estonian beaches is the cleaning of sea litter, or sea litter, on the shore.
For example, in Pirita Beach, 400,000 tons of this beach season will have to be hauled off.
"It's an incredible amount," Usov says.
The second big category is the waste that people leave behind, or all that they leave behind.
The one-and-a-half-kilometre coastline of Strom has eight large garbage containers that need to be emptied three times a week.
There's so much garbage going on.
However, the colder summer worlds have meant that the garbage is about a fifth less than otherwise.
The third type is the things left behind.
Most of them are children's toys.
This time, Usov has pulled a dozen model cars out of the sand.
They are waiting for the owners to reach the beach.
"Usually more of them come out, but it is a normal catch." Usov already knows that soon he will find them again in the sand.
The children come to the beach and take the toys to drown them in the sand again.
Waste is discarded
Erika Scholler, Haaberst’s representative for administrative services, admits that locals are disturbed by the tractor’s screening work.
The noise, which lasts from night to early in the morning, disturbs the sleep of the people living in the neighborhood.
This work is impossible during the day.
In one month, the beach has to be washed twice.
“If we don’t do it, the neighborhood is punishing us,” Scholler says.
However, like Pirita, Pikakar and Pärnu, the goal is to get the river beach under the international seal of quality.
“Compared to Europe, Estonia has much more work to take care of the beaches,” says Scholler.
We've got more ridges and stones, and it's harder to dig sand.
There is less waste on our beaches than anywhere else in Europe.
Hearing that the beach is talking about rubbish, Martin, who lives near the beach of Strom, enters the circle of journalists and decorators, revealing the current narrow spots on the beach.
There's a bad picture of the morning light everywhere.
The problem is with the birds and bottlenecks who have pulled the garbage bags badly,” says Martin.
While it’s hard to predict that people will be able to change their current behaviors, Martin hopes that the city government will do something about trash cans and put on covers for example to prevent at least the birds from renewing there.
In general, however, Martin is pleased with the development of the river.
We can see that the city is taking care of it.
With children's playgrounds, illuminated and freshly paved roads, it has become more pleasant.
Once upon a time, there was only one way to go on a roller coaster,” says Martin.
Earthquakes in the river: coins, only coins
Dimitri, a 40-year-old man, has come to use the measuring period in the morning, who as a treasure trove climbs a beach with a metal detector.
He does not believe that he will find anything pricey today or in the future.
The seagods are not generous enough.
“I’ve been dealing with this for a year and I haven’t found anything valuable so far,” Dmitri said.
In Dmitri’s treasure chest, there are some euro coins, bottlenecks and also dangerous nails, which later throw away the trash can.
Usually there are coins.
“There are usually no gold, rings, and other bones,” says the treasure hunter.
Bank of England keeps interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates will remain at the previous level, as weak economic growth and inflation relief have softened speculation about the rise.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain looming, as households’ plummeting incomes have put interest rates on hold.
The Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) policy makers voted in favour of keeping the rate at 0.25% at 6:2, and fewer members are demanding an increase this month as slow economic growth has weakened support for the rise.
In its quarterly inflation report, the bank cut its 2017 growth forecast to 1.7% and its 2018 growth forecast to 1.6% and warned that the pressure on household incomes will continue as inflation is still expected to rise close to 3% in the fall.
At the same time, the bank also noted that rising rates are necessary to curb inflation due to Brexit over the next few years, and financial markets may need a higher-than-expected rise in borrowing costs.
Members also voted a year ago in favour of a partial withdrawal of the mammoth package, which was triggered as a result of Brexit.
The bank will end a temporary financing scheme in February that offers banks cheap financing, although it said it now expects a <0xC2><0xA3>15bn bid, which is <0xC2><0xA3>115bn, under the scheme.
In the minutes of the decision on the rate, the bank states: "In the medium-term MPC forecast, the gross domestic product (GDP) will remain ineffective in the near future, as the difficult situation of real incomes of households will continue to affect consumption."
With regard to the rates, it was reiterated that to alleviate inflation, it is necessary to "take some strain on monetary policy" and to a "slightly greater extent" than expected in the markets.
The stock market is currently forecasting a first increase in the third quarter of next year and a second increase in 2020.
However, the bank stressed that any kind of jumps are gradual and limited.
The Bank’s reduced growth forecasts for this and the following year are comparable to the May forecasts of 1.9% and 1.7%.
The forecast of growth of 1.8% in 2018 remained stable.
After this news, the pound fell against the dollar and the euro.
However, it fell 0.5% to 1.31 US dollars and 0.4% to 1.11 euros.
The decision not to make any changes is due to recent disappointing growth indicators, which have bounced off growing expectations of GDP growth, rising from 0.2% in the previous three months to 0.3% in the second quarter.
The bank says growth is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will start to pick up a little bit at the end of the year.
The Bank’s most recent inflation report provided little reason to applaud households suffering from rising inflation and poor wage increases, saying the situation is going to get a little worse before it improves.
It was added that monetary policy cannot prevent the impact of income over the next couple of years, but by the end of the three-year forecast, salaries are expected to recover significantly.
Due to the low pound, the economy is also encouraged by the growing demand for British production, which partially compensates for lower consumer spending.
The decision comes a year after rates were lowered to 0.25% last August after the shocking EU referendum, which led to a sudden weakening of the pound.
According to the bank, it is likely that it will take four years to fully absorb prices and the economy.
Before the bank’s last decision, there was a growing demand for a rate hike as inflation had increased pressure on tight households; in July, the three policymakers demanded a rate hike to 0.5%.
Inflation fell to 2.6% last month, compared to 2.9% in June, although the bank’s message was expected and is expected to rise again in the coming months.
The Bank said that the excessive growth compared to the 2% target was due to a completely weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, Head of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: “Given the recent fall in interest rates, the mortgage market seems to be becoming more and more competitive again as lenders look forward to work and hope to end the year positively.
The stock market seems to be particularly favourable to those whose current transactions are coming to an end, as refinancing, often at a low fee and low rate, has become increasingly popular."
The NHS is prescribing HIV-inflicted medicine to 10,000 people
Since September, patients will have access to "transformative" HIV-preventive treatment after a battle in the Supreme Court over whether the NHS should fund the drug.
NHS England announced that national health care is now making an estimated 10,000 people available pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) pills during the initial three-year clinical trial, which have shown a high risk of infection in 8% of people.
The NHS agreed to finance the clinical trial after the Court of Appeal endorsed the Supreme Court’s ruling last year that the NHS is able to pay for PrEP, despite the Authority’s own claims that the medicine should instead be funded by local authorities.
NHS England’s CEO Simon Stevens hailed the move as a “new comprehensive intervention” on Thursday, while the National Aid Fund (NAT) described it as “a turning point.”
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield are among the first to start registering people. In October, more clinics will be added before the program for April 2018 in England is implemented everywhere.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a treatment for HIV drugs that is taken before intercourse to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
The results of clinical trials show that PrEP significantly reduces the transmission of HIV in people with a risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before intercourse means that there is a sufficient amount of certain medicines in the human body that prevent HIV infection.
Such medications can be taken every day or at least two hours before the interval.
Candidates eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transgender people and people whose partners are HIV-infected and are not treated.
Clinics identify suitable people who agree to participate in the clinical trial, including men, women, transgender people and those whose HIV-positive partner cannot receive antiretroviral therapy.
People who live in England and have chosen a family doctor there will also be able to register their wish to participate in the program at a local sexual health clinic participating in the program.
The program costs <0xC2><0xA3>10 million and the NHS England signed a contract to receive the drugs this week after an international procurement procedure.
The aim of the clinical trial is to assess the actual potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence as to who the medicinal product is intended for and how it is consumed and administered in the large picture.
Stevens said: “This new comprehensive intervention should complement and enhance the widespread and increasingly successful fight against the spread of HIV.
This is another step forward in more than three decades of struggle with one of humanity’s greatest health problems.”
Deborah Gold, NAT’s chief executive, said: “This is a turning point in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, when properly targeted to those who need it and belong to the risk group, offers an opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic.
Starting in September, high-risk people in England, through this NHS-funded clinical trial, have access to a powerful new tool that is individually managed and independent of negotiating with their partner, thereby improving many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement.”
Ian Green, CEO of the Terrence Higgins Foundation, said: “It is now crucial to ensure that clinical trials across the country are quickly postponed and that no HIV risk group is left behind.
Now that the PrEP clinical trial drug has been purchased, we are on our way to protecting more than 10,000 people at risk of becoming infected with HIV.
Public Health Variety Minister Sharon Hodgson said: “The start of the PrEP clinical trial has been very welcome and very late after months of delays and government leg-drawning.
Evidence shows how significant changes this medicine can bring to the end of HIV prevention and the spread of its life-changing infection.
This clinical trial takes us one step closer to a full understanding of the benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that the clinical trial be implemented as soon as possible in the country to protect people who are exposed to HIV and bring us one step closer to halting the spread of HIV in society."
Electricity prices rose 12% in Estonia, while Latvia and Lithuania fell.
In July, the electricity price difference between Estonia and Latvia and Lithuania decreased to 1.94 euros, compared with 7.71 euros in June this year, Elering reported.
The main reason for the price discrepancy is the Lithuanian-Swedish Community breach.
In Estonia, the average exchange price for electricity last month was EUR 34.33 per megawatt-hour and the price rose 12 percent compared to June.
In Latvia and Lithuania, the price fell by five per cent to EUR 36.27 megawatt-hours.
In Finland, the price was EUR 34.17 and the system price of the Nord Pole electricity exchange was EUR 26.37 per megawatt-hour.
Prices rose by 12 and 7 percent, respectively.
Between Estonia and Finland, electricity moved 75 percent of the previous month’s hours towards Estonia and 16 percent of the hours from Estonia to Finland.
In the remaining 9% of the hours between the two countries, no transactions took place the following day.
Between Estonia and Latvia, electricity moved from Estonia to Latvia for 99 percent of the time and for 73 percent of the hours the entire transmission capacity was in use.
According to transactions on the Nasdaq OMX market on the last trading day of July, the electricity exchange price could be around 34 euros per megawatt-hour in August and 37 euros per megawatt-hour in September.
The price of carbon dioxide affecting the electricity production price rose last month and transactions took place at a price of EUR 5.04-5.47 per tonne.
Living in a high-rise - semi-detached and smart design niches have turned this small Earls Court apartment into a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker who is a passionate real estate agent, swapped her big Knightsbridge home for the Earls Court apartment in 2014.
It is located on the first floor of Queen Anne Terrace, and the fact that Joanne has not packed her bags and sold the apartment is a tribute to the new design.
“Before that, I lived on a much larger surface with my former roommate in Knightsbridge,” Joanne said.
“I was looking for something that would be equivalent to the price I offered.
I was shown this Earls Court apartment and it had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with it and made an offer the same day.”
Since the first visit, this 93-square-foot apartment has undergone a complete renovation.
In the beginning, it was a one-bedroom apartment with a complex layout - in order to reach the bedroom, you had to walk through the kitchen. Joanne wanted to add a storage room and a half-floor to take advantage of the high storage.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, a lot of light.
Those were my demands,” he said.
He hired Erfan Azadi from the architecture and design studio Duck & Shed in Notting Hill to take advantage of the 3.8 m high quays and create a home that would not just be a development object, but a place where Joanne could live.
The ceiling was not high enough to add two rooms on top of each other, so it was an architectural challenge to create a semi-storey that could stand up.
Erfan had to approach the matter creatively.
"The metal construction is quite complex," he explains.
“We had to reorganize the rooms so that they would be placed on top of each other without having to bow down.
It wasn’t just about building a platform, but we used a steel structure to make the height of both the upper and lower rooms right.”
This arrangement allowed Erfan to create two full-height rooms in a room apart from each other with a wealth of dramatic elements.
From the semi-detached floor, antique copper light opens from the Retrouvius window to the glamorous living room under the view.
The gold furniture with the mirror surface, the silver details and the retro-style Serge Mouille light accentuate the style of the room.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatricality, spaciousness and light saturation.
At both ends of the short corridor, mirrors are added to make it feel longer.
In the kitchen, the mirror behind the wall leaves the impression of a window opening into the second room.
At the entrance, the mirror cabinet offers a storage space for all Joanne’s kitchenware and glassware.
The living room adds a charming opportunity to close the kitchen area if not used, creating a more glamorous room of imagination.
Foldable kitchens are nothing new.
The unique thing about this kitchen, however, is that it is a garage type retractable door.
"There was a bit of design ship going into it," explains Erfan's steel-strength spooned MDF door.
"It has a counterbalance, which is why it slides very easily when it is pushed up."
Thanks to the intelligent use of space and storage space, Joanne now has 16 extra square meters, an additional bedroom and a better apartment plan.
“After all, the floor is what you sell — or what gives the property value,” Erfan says.
"The real estate agent enters the room in outdated form and makes calculations based on the surface of the floor."
Here, they have been able to enlarge the floor, while using high-quality materials that add luxury to the room.
“Materials are what you touch and by doing so help create an emotional bond with the home,” Erfan says.
"You don't like the electrical wiring on the wall.
It’s important, but it doesn’t make the heart ring.”
This shows that a good design and an enlarged surface will help make a fairly ordinary apartment something amazing.
In fact, they may cause a desire not to leave, as it did with Joanne.
Dane Jensen is a Chicago skyscraper head coach who competes with a colleague for a promotion.
The sum of money earned is nothing more than the sum of money by which any ethics is forgotten.
The man sees his wife and three children only in the early morning and late at night.
In the first half of the film, I think it’s a version of the business world of “Cardman” – even Kevin Spacey and Gerard Butler’s speech is similar.
The further the film, the less a frame-like element, however, remains, and the moralizing intention of the filmmakers is becoming more and more apparent.
The protagonist's son's illness can become a cancerous experience.
Now we have to make a choice between work and family life.
A dreamy son from an architectural background makes his father walk to the great buildings of Chicago to think of truly important things such as faith, goodness, love..., without touching even the disaster of the twin towers.
After the third scene, where the son opens his father’s eyes, it becomes felt that the filmmakers have left the goal of making the audience cry, because even the most heartfelt viewer can’t hold back tears from seeing the suffering of a dear cancerous boy.
When the son falls into a coma and his situation seems almost hopeless, the father finally understands the morality of his work and does a good deed to an old man looking for a job.
Now, I'm mistaken in terms of bet on myself - if the movie is happy, I'll reward my transparency after the movie with coffee, but if I'm wrong, the script can be praised for at least one surprise.
For a moment, the suspicion arises that I will be stuck with coffee - when the husband calls Dane from the hospital and the man storms slowly along the hallway towards the palace.
However, the son is still wonderfully healed, and although his father has just lost his job, it turns out to be even positive, because now is the time to deal with the family.
I can also feel good - I can already predict the end of the American drama quite well!
In honor of the truth, the film is well-constructed, all the necessary elements exist.
You can cry, you can laugh, the actors are good and the morale is beautiful: money is not the most important thing in life.
I think this movie is a good fit.
Trump’s new chief of staff plans to limit the president’s media consumption.
Others have tried and failed to do so.
Maybe John F. Kelly will be able to do that.
In that case, he would be the first.
Politico writes that the new White House chief of staff plans to limit President Trump’s incoming flow of information, including news, in the hope that it will keep the chief in the water.
Here's breaking reporter Josh Dawseylt:
“When the new White House chief of staff John F. Kelly met with a senior official on his first working day, he brought out a key problem at the White House that President Donald Trump planned to solve when bad information came into the hands of the president.
“Kelly told officials that information must be passed through him, whether on paper or in meetings, because the president would make better decisions if he were to share good information.”
Kelly’s diagnosis seems perfectly logical, but others have tried it, too, and they have failed to impersonate Trump by monitoring his media use.
President Trump’s relationship with television goes back decades, and even now that he’s in the White House, his television viewing habits haven’t disappeared.
“When the candidate Trump was angry about the unfair media coverage, he was paid to show that he was honestly reflected in the affected publications as well,” former campaign counsel Sam Nunberg told Politico in February.
At the time, Politico Tara Palmer wrote that “according to six former campaign workers, the key to controlling Trump’s Twitter habits is to ensure that his personal media consumption also includes a song of praise.”
All right, all right.
But the idea that Trump’s Twitter usage habits have ever been “under control” is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaign workers know something that the rest of us don’t know that Trump’s tactics would have been even hotter without their intervention.
We’ll probably never know about the rumors that Trump didn’t post.
When his aides were able to save him either or a few times from trouble, their efforts were worth it.
But no one has been able to stop Trump from constantly creating polemics.
Part of the problem is that in a White House made up of competing clicks, people are trying to promote their own interests exclusively by transmitting material to Trump that supports their worldviews, but may not always be reliable.
Reflecting the whole story, Politico wrote in May about the advisers’ tendency to feed the president information with strategically questionable value.
One example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher is the following:
“Trump’s current and former subordinates say that Trump can react to the negative press, especially detrimental information campaigns, explosively, insisting that their source be found.
The same happened in late February when someone gave the president a maliciously printed copy of an article on the website GotNews.com belonging to Charles C. Johnson, which accused deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh of being the White House's "several sources of information".
It doesn’t matter that Johnson has been permanently blocked from Twitter because of the mutiny, or that he has not offered any specific evidence, or that he has also made false accusations in the past and has withdrawn them.
Trump read the article and began to succumb to Walsh.”
Goldmacher added that the then chief of staff, Reince Priebus, and White House office chief Rob Porter, “have tried to establish a system for managing and documenting documents that arrive at Trump.”
How'd that work out?
Kelly tries to do exactly the same thing three months later.
He may prove to be a more effective leader than Priebus, but Trump is still impulsive and his aides are still competing for influence.
These unchanging factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Street musicians who came from abroad to the capital do not get permission to perform in the cymbals.
There is a lot of foreign music going on in the centre of Tallinn.
Those with whom the Evening Newspaper spoke admitted that they were playing in the old town without the permission of the city government.
First, we found three street musicians near the gates of Vir, who had brought with them the same number of dogs.
It was clear to see that the musicians in sledgehammers and explosive clothes were backpackers, who would need a shower to rinse off.
Despite the appearance, the only woman in the company played the story on the accordion with a fun rhythm, while one man next to her juggled with three balls and invited the passers-by closer.
The third man had sat next to them on one backpack and smoked the heart of his own ready-made turntable.
These three dogs did not allow themselves to be disturbed by the passing people.
The chordion played by Naomi and the ball-jungled Bob said they were playing on the streets for fun as well as money.
The purpose of the company’s presence was to collect ticket money for a ship heading to Finland on the same day.
When asked if they asked the city for permission to play in the old town, Naomi and Bob shook their heads.
First of all, we didn't know.
Secondly, we never stay in one city for more than a day or a couple and usually are given permits for a month or something like that.
There’s no point in paying for it,” Bob explained.
When we got back to the Vir gates about 20 minutes later, we saw that two women were at the musicians’ house and were driving them away.
The company moved backpacks and dogs to the intersection of Viru center to try their luck.
On Viru’s street, there were also three half-young men, one playing the violin, the other playing the clarinet and the third carrying an almost electronic piano.
“We’re here to provide people with entertainment, to spread music and joy, and to make money for fuel and living,” Mivosh said in a statement.
According to Mivoshi, they are aware that there must be permission from the city government for the performance.
"Of course we don't have it," he said jokingly.
But we hope that when people enjoy our music, there is no problem.
Of course, when the police come, we will go elsewhere, but we have to try,” he added.
Eesti Pank purchased bonds for EUR 149 million in July as part of the public-sector asset-purchase programme of the euro area central banks, with the central bank’s debt portfolio growing to EUR 4.36 billion.
The central bank does not publish more detailed information on purchases.
The President of the Bank of Estonia, Hardo Hansson, has previously explained in response to an inquiry by members of the National Assembly that the Eurosystem’s asset purchase programme includes three different purchasing programmes: financial sector covered bonds, asset-backed bonds (ABS) and public sector bonds (PSPS).
The central bank buys bonds from the market in order to encourage investors who sell bonds to invest money elsewhere.
As a result of purchases, lower-risk asset yields are declining and this motivates investors to take higher risks.
As a general rule, under a public-sector debt-purchase programme, each central bank purchases government bonds of its own country, and other country bonds are not purchased.
Since the Estonian State has not issued bonds, Eesti Pank makes so-called replacement purchases within the allocated volume.
Replacement purchases are also made by central banks in those countries where the supply of bonds corresponding to the purchase plan is limited.
According to Hansson, Eesti Pank generally purchases bonds from European institutions, such as the European Financial Stability Fund and the European Investment Bank.
Eesti Pank will purchase bonds as part of the asset purchase programme as of March 2015.
In the meantime, Elering’s bonds were also acquired, but from June 2016 Eesti Pank will no longer buy Elering’s bonds.
Since June, both Ellering and Eesti Energia have been buying bonds on behalf of the euro area central banks.
Passengers ignore the tie and return to the “millionaires’ district”
Some of the wealthiest homeowners in the West Midlands have once again come to terms with a furious confrontation with determined migrants who have ignored the board’s dug-out cradle to win back the field away from their villas.
Passengers have parked their 20 trailer villas on the square near Solihull, a wealthy “millionaires’ district”.
They have returned with an army of horses, children and trucks after they were only expelled from there in May, without getting mixed up with the cranes in the pit to prevent their intrusion by the mayor.
The tactical group found a weak spot on the defensive lines, pinching their vehicles through the unhindered part of the vehicle that had been left behind.
Residents of Maruvi have joined the Solihull committee, saying that the committee is "useless in dealing with the problem".
An anonymous resident said: "They moved there on Monday night after their expulsion from Bentley Heath, where they looped through with passing stones.
The Commission must be ashamed to take action, because they are useless in dealing with the problem.
The passengers were there in May, they were timed to leave and now they are back.
“They came in last night, and more today.”
He added: “The Birmingham Board knows how to deal with such things by acquiring long barriers to protecting their parks.
I live on the Streetsbrook road and I'm not happy to continue paying the mayor's fee if the mayor's board can't even prevent that."
One local resident, who also wanted to remain anonymous, said: "It's ridiculous. We just saw the last of these migrants leave, and there's already a new upswing going on.
This time the number has increased and the grass has even been seen remembering a horse."
A representative of the Solihull Committee said: "We are aware that there is an inadmissible campground in the country near Streetsbrook Road, and we are cooperating with the Solihull police. We are implementing the necessary legal measures to get them moving as quickly as possible.
Collecting evidence is very helpful if as many locals as possible report any anti-social or criminal behavior to the police by calling the number 101.
This will help create a picture of the situation for the court when we present the case to them."
The weekend of the festival will also be visited by Minister of Culture Indrek Saar, who is pleased to have been able to bring the real top names of the world to Estonia.
To the question why the Weekend festival is so important for Estonians, Saar answers that it should be asked from all those who fully enjoy the three days of the festival talk.
However, he admits that the real makers of his area have come to Pärnu.
"Looking at the level of artists that have been able to bring to Estonia, the absolute top names of this genre of music are brought home - this often does not happen in our country," says the Minister of Culture.
Which artists perform at the festival, however, speak most of the island itself?
I consider myself a relatively old man, and for old men like me, there is certainly one of the most experienced artist Armin van Buuren who got up last night.
After all, according to his album, at some point, all of us have turned our backs on ourselves,” he says.
However, he will be releasing several more names, such as Chainsmokers, Deadmau5, Knifeparty.
Of course, also our Estonian authors: starting with NO<0xC3><0x8B>P and they can be read in a whole series.
In reality, this concentration of known names is very high,” he says.
Take a look at the video for the evening!
Audi to upgrade up to 850,000 diesel vehicles in the midst of criticism from car manufacturers
The day before the announcement, BMW said it would offer software extensions to more than 350,000 vehicles.
According to BMW chairman, the company believes that "there are smarter options than driving restrictions," referring to European cities, including the BMW home city of Munich, which has been considering banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will upgrade three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce diesel engine emissions.
None of the companies described these operations as a recall.
European car manufacturers have been advocating for the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States in order to help comply with the CO2 emissions regulations.
However, nitrogen dioxide released from diesel engines is considered a carcinogen and can cause asthma.
At the same time, the cost of equipment installed to neutralise the emissions from diesel vehicles is increasing for automotive companies, making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.
While the German automakers are being thoroughly investigated, Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government is also accused of appeasing powerful automakers and ignoring signs of the problem.
The companies are trying to avoid repeating Volkswagen's mistakes, which silenced the use of so-called fraudulent devices, which allowed the emission indicator to be adjusted to the regulations at the time of testing the car, but withdrew under normal driving conditions.
Several Volkswagen drivers have been charged in the United States and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean.
Last month, the former head of the sub-division Thermodynamics of the Audi engine development department was arrested in Germany.
Former President Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and may go to court in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was drawn to a criminal investigation into Volkswagen in Germany when authorities accused the Audit of installing the system in order to shy away from European emissions requirements, thereby expanding the investigation, which had previously focused on the United States.
Audi’s involvement in the survey could have a large chunk of luxury car manufacturers generating a disproportionately large share of Volkswagen’s profits.
For 20,000 euros, the flag of the European Union is purchased for Estonian schools.
The Ministry of Education intends to buy the flag of the European Union for Estonian schools by 1 September.
With dimensions of 105x158 centimeters, 570 educational institutions will receive the flag of the European Union.
The flags are intended to be displayed in the interior, they must be made in high-quality printing technology in the interior, also with tunnel confirmation, mediated by the ERR news portal.
The sign reads: "Hungation for Estonian schools to mark the first Presidency of the Estonian Council of the European Union.
The estimated cost of 570 flags is estimated by the Ministry of Education at 20 000 euros, i.e. one flag will cost 35 euros.
The murder of a journalist highlights the growing state of danger in Mexico
Employees of the weekly newspaper Riodoce usually gather on Wednesdays to review plans to reflect the state’s latest chaos, which is fueled by organized crime, corrupt officials, and unbridled drug wars.
But today, under the shadow of a personal tragedy, they have gathered to discuss their own security.
They are told that it is important to change your routine.
Two reporters discuss which one seems safer: either bringing the children to the office that was the target of a grenade attack in 2009, or leaving them at home.
Security experts have written three words on the board in front of the room: "enemies", "neutral", "allies".
They ask reporters to provide the names of each column without the need for evidence, enough impressions and a sense of interior.
A whole list of drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen, and journalists are suspected of being on government or cartel salaries, making it dangerous to reflect the chaos that is taking place in Mexico.
The more dead bodies are accumulated across the country, the more journalists, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, have been in office since the inauguration of President Enrique Pena Nieto, and the more dead bodies are accumulated in the country, the more journalists have been in the office of President Enrique Pena Nieto.
Among the latest deaths is their editor and inspiration, Riodoc co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
“The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist,” Valdez wrote in one of his many books on drug abuse.
His absence gives a deep feeling, although his presence can be felt everywhere on the fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade of the Riodoce building, hangs a large picture of the middle finger of Valdez with the letter "Justice" and two 30-year-old reporters, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wearing a T-shirt with a scarf on their arm.
The meeting takes place less than two months after his death. Reporters discuss common trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a separate public prosecutor’s office was set up in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists, the Committee for the Protection of Journalists reports that only two cases have been taken to judicial responsibility.
As with most annual drug trafficking and organized crime-related murders, the number of which reaches thousands, the killers of journalists rarely get to court.
Riodoce continues to reflect the violence in Sinaloa, although their hearts are broken and the landscape is now even more dangerous.
Without the data of the killers and without justice, the security meeting would not be of much use, Ibarra said.
"Very stupid is wasting your time here at the meeting," he says.
"Until you know the reason, you betray everyone."
Valdez left the Riodoc office in the state capital Culiac<0xC3><0xA1>n on the morning of May 15.
He managed to drive only a few blocks before two men stopped his red Toyota Corolla. He was forced to get out of the car and he was shot 12 times. Presumably by the name of the newspaper, which translates to "Twelfth River".
The gunman drove out of Valdez's car and caused an accident nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He was left with a wife and two adult children.
Celebrities spread Culiacans freely.
On the subject of Valdez, however, there is mainly silence.
Since Guzman’s arrest last year and his extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has been one of the country’s bloodiest battlefields as rival cliques battle for power vacuum.
It doesn’t matter that on the streets of Sinaloa some people or a few people are shot every day, or that the dead garden cubicizes abundantly decorated with double drug king mausoleums, which are larger than the homes of many living.
For a moment, let us forget that peacetime refers to the fact that only one cartel drives a coastal state with valuable ports and drug routes to the United States.
Despite all this and the fact that Valdez was fully aware of the dangers associated with his work, Riodoce feels the enormous guilt of co-founder and chairman Ismail Bojorquez (60) that he was unable to protect his friend.
He believes the killing was caused by two mistakes.
The first of these was the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a rival and warlike cartel clique with Guzman’s sons, in February.
This booklet could have angered the boys by the suspected gang members buying all the copies of the publication as soon as they got to the newspaper stores.
The second mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave the country for his own safety after the capture took place in another newspaper that reflected the same story.
Valdez was a legend both in Mexico and abroad, and his murder is seen as a turning point in violence against journalists in Mexico.
He had lived for so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would be there forever.
He worked as a veteran reporter for the newspaper Noroeste in 2003 when he joined five colleagues to create Riodoce, selling $50 shares.
Bojorquez said that in Sinaloa "it was impossible to deal with the press without touching the drug problem".
Over time, the newspaper gained recognition with its brave and honest reflections, and sales and advertising grew.
Reporters liked to publish vigorous research without fear of censorship, and readers sniffed a print from which they could read stories that no one else dared to reflect.
Eight years after the founding of Riodoce, the newspaper won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Award for its Latin American reflections.
In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award by the Committee for the Protection of Journalists (ACC) for his courage to follow the Mexican narcologist wherever it leads.
He openly admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to live on," he said, receiving the ACC award.
Last October, he told Rompeviento TV in an interview that drug trafficking is a way of life in Sinaloa.
"You have to take on the task that comes with the press agency, the second option is to play a fool.
I don’t want to be asked what I’ve been up against so many deaths or why I haven’t told you what’s going on.”
The Riodoce collective misses Valdez, a joker who roamed like a madrassa, a friend who kindly shared embassies and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They supported her routine.
He always wore his coat.
He moved from the office to the bar in El Guayabo and always sat at the same table.
Now they ask if his routine love became fateful to him.
His death has also left them questioning themselves how to do their job best and stay alive.
“They don’t like being bullied by women, their children, their legitimate businesses, the secret landing sites used to transport drugs.”
"These things should not be touched," said Bojorquez.
The result is strong self-esteem and self-respect even in the best of times.
Confidence in your instincts.
If it smells suspicious, stay away.
Riodoc editor Andres Villarreal says the problem is that "the smell can be tricked... and that's what happened to Javier."
He and others say that the old rules in Sinaloa no longer apply, just as they do not apply in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerreros, or other states, which are home to the toxic combination of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions, and corrupt government officials.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the room where Riodoc staff gathered for security training, mobile phones were suddenly no longer allowed; a few days before it was revealed that only software sold to governments had been used in Mexico to track journalists and activists.
In front of the house, two police officers were looking for relief from the 40-degree heat in the shade of a tree.
The government appointed them to oversee the Riodoc office, located in a four-story building in the middle class neighborhood of Culiac<0xC3><0xA1>n.
Some reporters questioned whether these police officers were among the 50 percent of the police officers whom the governor himself has smeared as unreliable.
Several months have passed since reporters have traveled to rugged terrains where control is de facto in the hands of drug giants.
This week’s edition of Riodoce covered three main stories.
One of them was the murder of the brother of former boxing legend Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
In addition, they had a revealing story of spending government money on the governor's hometown.
And a group of people were kidnapped from one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiac<0xC3><0xA1>n, a block away from the prosecutor's office.
There was no official announcement about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows the restaurant is a place of attraction for both drug dealers and authorities.
The reporter learned from public documents that the restaurant is registered in the name of a politician who belongs to the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (IRP), which dominated all levels of politics for almost the entire previous century.
Recently, several IRP governors have been accused of corruption in a wide range of cases.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in the same place, including how the son of El Chapo-named Guzman escaped from the military.
Only a few months earlier, readers would have searched the Valdez column to get information about abduction from the best sources.
"In the past, we would have known what happened," said Villarreal, 46, whose lean body construction has earned him the nickname El Flaco.
"Now all channels of communication with our sources have been broken."
Valdez’s office has become a storage space for labels and stickers protesting the killing of journalists, and the editorial staff have become something they could never expect activists to do in the name of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a couple of sticks and headed to the local prosecutor’s office the next morning for a demonstration for another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n three days after Valdez was killed.
The body was found to be burnt, and according to officials, it belongs to him based on DNA tests.
Journalists across the country have become more vocal and criticise the phrase "SOS press" as organized protests against the promenades and buildings.
On this day, President Bojorquez is away in Washington, attempting to gather international support in the Valdez case to bring justice to the table.
The day after Valdez's death, in a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa, Ramirez accused the authorities of nagging and killing journalists for telling the truth.
After that, he asked that he direct the government’s activities to a different place, worrying that his anger had affected his objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that Mexican journalists were "restricted to it" by organized crime, co-accused officials and any society.
In his latest book, Drug Journalism, he wrote that journalists are not only killed by drug forces, but also by the orders of politicians and security forces, who are in the grip of organized crime.
The media watchdog group Articulo 19 owned more than half of the attacks on police and state officials last year.
“In Mexico, you’re going to die because you want to be silenced,” Ramirez said.
The murders obviously have a blood-thirsty effect.
No one will forget the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border country of Tamaulipas six years ago.
His body was found along with a letter probably signed by the Los Zetas cartel: "I'm here for my reports."
Next to his hairy head, there was a computer pad and headphones.
Some publications have decided to close their doors, for example the newspaper El Norte in the northern border country of Chihuahua after their correspondent Miroslava Breaki was killed in March.
Others are going on as El Manana de Nuevo Laredo did after the assassination of their president in 2004.
In 2010, the newspaper Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels with the headline “What do you want from us?”
Some journalists have been smuggled out of their home countries or even countries.
It's a nerve-wracking decision.
The exile is hard to find work and they still have to hide the streets in order to avoid threats.
And sometimes they are chased, as was supposedly the case with photographer Ruben Espino, who was murdered along with four women in 2015 in a Mexican apartment three months after being stabbed by Veracruz.
Those who remain in place and continue to work, have to rethink risky decisions every day.
Ibarra, who once wanted to become a poet, admits that the reflection of the drug trade scares him.
“Mexico is on its way to hell and that’s why I started being a reporter,” he said.
At midnight on a recent Friday, when the freshest number had already been locked, Riodoce editors sat in front of the office on a walkway and grabbed beer as all of the phones suddenly began to vibrate.
In the coastal resort town of Mazatlan, 19 people were confirmed to have died in the exchanges between rival wealthy and security forces.
The war continued to escalate, as promised by a number of cartels found in the region.
From the side of the walkway, reporters posted the news using a mobile phone to the Riodoce website.
The next day, we needed a change.
The sirens roared through another firefight in the area.
Bojorquez hid to the police officers on guard to see if they were on guard.
When they were afraid, they didn’t show it at least.
Under a massive portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger is visible all over Sinaloa, Riodoce's workers were able to follow in his footsteps.
“How could one even think of closing up,” said Bojorquez, “when on the same day Javier was killed, he asked the trainee to get him to report to the streets?”
Dinosaur used protective paint to avoid enemies.
At first glance, it looks like a shape, though rather scary.
Scientists have now revealed the first discoveries regarding the incredible size of the nasal cavity discovered in a Canadian excavator, which has been so well preserved that experts have described it as the “Mona Lisa of dinosaurs.”
It is almost so well preserved that it was even possible to detect that the skin covered with her fins was a reddish-brown color and her past had been somewhat "complicated".
The report, published in the journal Current Biology, described the creature as “the best-preserved Finn dinosaur ever found” and “one of the best dinosaurs in the world.”
The fossil is a new species of nodosaurus, which lived in the middle of the Cretaceous, 110-112 million years ago.
Its unbelievably good preservation has smashed scientists who describe it as "truly significant".
According to National Geographic, this fin-covered vegetarian has best preserved the type of fossil that has ever been found.
It was discovered by Shawn Funk on March 21, 2011, when he mined the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada.
He grabbed something that didn’t resemble the surrounding stone, and decided to examine it more closely.
The fossil was discovered by the Royal Tyrrelli Museum of Paleontology.
For the next six years, the animal was worked on to be excavated from a piece of land of 2,500-pound (1,100-pound).
After all this hard work, the end result is now finally ready to be presented to the public.
"If you close your eyes a little bit, you can almost believe he's sleeping," said lead author Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is exposed.
"It's going to be one of the most beautiful and best-preserved dinosaurs in history - the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs."
When researching her skin, researchers found that this plant eater, which is covered in fins and resembles a walking tank, was likely at significant risk from meat-eating dinosaurs.
This rich-skinned dinosaur used red and white protective colours to hide from predators, and applied a cover-up technique called retardation, which is also used by many modern animals.
This, according to experts, allowed the dinosaur to better melt into the environment and avoid enemies, as larger dinosaurs were likely to hunt for it.
This 110-million-year-old creature from the nodosaurus family first came to the news in May and is now visited by the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
Scientists have now investigated the existence and named it after Mark Mitchell, a laboratory scientist at the Borealopleta Markichelli Museum, who was part of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours to unearth the animal.
Thanks to the amazingly good preservation of the specimen, Dr. Mitchell and the international team of scientists were able to document the shape and size of the fins on the animal’s body.
They discovered a shelter—a method of protection common in the animal kingdom, which means that the upper side of the being was darker than the lower side.
Although residuals are widespread, the findings come as a surprise, as the Borealo field is much larger than modern residual animals.
This suggests that the dinosaur was actively enough hunted by other meat-eaters dinosaurs, that evolution preferred to be a survival tactic rather than a confrontation.
However, most modern animals using shelters – such as deer, zebras, or armadillos – are often much smaller and more vulnerable, suggesting that the nodosaurus had to really struggle to survive.
"The intense hunt for a dinosaur covered in huge and abundant fins shows how dangerous predators of the Critical Age dinosaurs might have been," Brown said.
A chemical analysis of the organic compounds of the ants also revealed that the skin of the dinosaur was reddish-red.
Scientists will continue animal research to get clues about this life, including the contents of this gut to find out what the animal would eat for its last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur crashed into a river, reaching the sea with a current, where it squeezed back in front of the ocean floor.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as present-day South Florida, and the rivers and oceans probably extended much further inland than they are today.
"This nodosaurus is truly remarkable because it is completely covered with finned skin, while also remaining three-dimensional, preserving the animal's original shape," Brown said.
"As a result, the animal looks almost the same today as in the crisis era.
You don’t have to use a lot of imagination to reconstruct it – just shake your eyes and it feels like he’s sleeping.”
The Creed era was a time when on Earth the giant two-legged dinosaurs, the theropods, moved from the meat eaters.
Although the king of all these Tyrannosaurus rex lived millions of years later than the Borealis, some of his terrifying predecessors may have hunted this tamed dinosaur.
These include the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38-foot (11.5-meter) long and six-ton monster.
Scientists, whose recent findings have been published in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealoplet was trapped in the sea after its death and mummified in mud.
It was discovered by Shawn Funk on March 21, 2011, when he excavated the Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in Northern Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the best preserved finnish dinosaur in the world, including skin and finches, and it is a complete cone to the hips.
These creatures were on average 18 feet (five meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
Two 20-inch nuts came out of his shoulders.
Scientists believe that this fin-covered vegetable feeder ventured through present-day Western Canada until the flooded river threatened its open sea.
However, the dinosaur's underwater burial site helped to preserve its remains in clear detail.
The fossilized remains of this particular specimen have been preserved so well that the mosquito-like plates along the dinosaur's skulls still cover the remains of the skin.
As Michael Greshko wrote in National Geographic magazine: "Such a degree of conservation is as rare as a lottery.
The more I look at it, the more unbelievable it seems.
The fossilized remains still cover the mug-like plaques on the animal’s skull.
The right foreleg rests next to him and the five toes are pointed upwards.
I can count the finches on him.”
How did one of the activists find the answer to the question "Who are the streets for?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shocked.
Just the day after traveling to New York, a St. Louis resident sat in a room rented via Airbnb, browsing on his phone on Facebook.
He was attacked by his former classmate's post.
It read: "The police just killed an 18-year-old boy and he's still on the street."
He was confused as to why no one else had posted this information to his stream, which is why he closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
Pidemega <0x40>TheePharoah's posts were repeatedly shared in his timeline.
A rapper from the St. Louis area handed over a live video of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old black man killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He posted a picture of Brown's body lying on the street, staying there for four hours.
"It's crazy," Ferrell thought to himself.
But death was nothing new for him or for the community.
He dropped his phone, but later in the evening saw a flash again, which this time reported a gathering of people at Canfield Drive.
They shared photos of police officers and screaming people and a man who claimed to be Brown’s father and still held the letter “Ferguson police killed just my unarmed son!”
He watched a live stream where a police officer stood in front of a group of protesters with a hoarse dog.
In the second video, another police officer won the gun and shouted, "I'm going to kill you all... animals."
Ferrell remembers how he hit himself with the thought, "This is unusual."
“It’s not the kind of murder we’re used to and what we might call typical.”
At that moment, I felt scary.
I was angry and I cried.”
He booked a return flight and drove home the next day.
At 11 p.m., he went to see his father for his six-year-old daughter and decided that they would drive the next morning with the two of them in Ferguson.
What happened to Ferrelli and Ferguson over the next three years is central to the new documentary "Whose Streets?" ("Whose Streets?"), which will be featured in theaters on August 11.
It is a story of survival and protest, of love and loss, of strength and perseverance from the point of view of the people who live in this community and who filled the answers in the streets.
When Ferrell and his daughter—who had a flower dress on her back and a matching crown on her head—took a ride to Ferguson, they again talked about the experiences and living conditions of black people that had been told to them many times before this morning.
"Do you remember when I taught you how the black community had to fight for its rights?" he recalls asking himself.
"We're driving Ferguson right now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that's not right."
"I couldn't take him with me," Ferrell said later.
"What is happening now is... a culmination of what happened in the past.
He needs to know and see it and grow in the midst of it.
He must learn about activism and organization, and at the same time know the different layers of black experiences and living conditions, and what we need to do to become free and free ourselves.
Even if I manage to raise her in such a way that she does not personally experience daring racism, she is no different from any other black girl.
I feel like I would do him a cruel thing if I protected him from this world.”
The first stop they made on Ferguson's arrival was on the way to South Florissant - a police station across the road from where it had become a sort of camp where activists were waiting for news about police officer Darren Wilson, who was ultimately not charged.
There, Ferrell and his daughter joined forces with a local business owner who made lunch items.
They put the food bags together and helped distribute them to the protesters.
For Ferrell, a new type of activism slowly began to take shape.
“My activism changed completely after August 9th,” he said, noting that when he was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, he was president of the Union of Minorities and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities.
“I didn’t have any organizational experience.
It's all just begging."
Weeks later, during an evening demonstration, Ferrell met with one of the film's co-directors, Sabaah Folayan.
Folayan said he and film operator Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to document what was going on.
Ferrelli asked, “Are you trying to document what’s going on or find a story that can be exploited?”
Such scepticism was due to the innumerable number of cases in which people - often white - come to the community and try to take advantage of its pain and resilience.
Folayan explained in a recent interview: "We have heard that people born and raised in Ferguson are not heard and we wanted to do it differently."
Folayan had already struck his hands with co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the region who was known for his activism in connection with death row inmates.
His involvement made the project binding to Ferrell and six other locals who were watched by the team in Whose Streets for years after Brown was shot.
"In this documentary, no one is talking about us or us, we are talking about ourselves," Davis said.
“It was important to me how these people were portrayed, because that’s how I was portrayed.”
While the goal was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - it was meant to show that the movement consisted not of "a rescuer's guidance, but of a community gathering," as Folayan said - he became the most open participant in the film.
As a result, "Whose Streets?" documents surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life, such as falling in love and marrying his wife.
"I felt like I was naked," Ferrell said, laughing at the first time he saw the finished canvas.
"But I understood that doing this work and humanizing black people must be accompanied by a certain vulnerability."
What’s more, Ferrelli’s story emphasizes and re-emerges the central role of a black gay woman in the wider Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement who came up with the theme <0x23>BlackLivesMatter after the 2012 murder of black teen Trayvon Martin on social media are gay.
“In a leading role, black gay women have kept the movement in general,” Ferrell said, “and that’s precisely because we have to constantly fight on several fronts.
Black and gay women have to bear all the burden of this.”
Folayan agreed, noting that "the movement is indeed maintained by black women and many of them are black homosexual women".
At the same time, he argues that "it's not some sort of equal opportunity thing" - Ferrelli was not chosen as the centerpiece of the film because of his identity.
"He was the man who aired the right energy," he said.
"But it's no coincidence that she was right on her chest, because living in such nodes as a black gay woman is a lot of weight.
Its energy can be seen through the screen.”
At the same time, the news cameras have long since disappeared from Ferguson, but racial ties between the community and the police are still fragile.
Ferrell was sentenced to 2.5 years in prison for blocking the road during the protests.
He describes the social-political ventilation in the area he calls a home, simply as a “poor fear.”
However, he still considers the mantra important, which he has devoured in his memory since he went to the streets of Ferguson three years ago.
“It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
Our duty is to win.
We need to love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose except our chains.”
7 Tips on How to Get Overboard After a Weekend Party
Some of the tougher guys find help after a nasty party because of what’s going on.
Or they come from the saying "very sluggish, stay drunk."
But it’s just an inevitable delay and a good sense of health.
What can you do to feel better in the morning after today’s and tomorrow’s Weekend trolley – or any other party – and get rid of the pain as much as possible from the meditative?
Drink water.
On and off to alcohol, after a big party in the morning... or maybe even instead of alcohol.
Since the body loses a lot of fluid by consuming alcohol, it must somehow get it back.
With water, minerals are also excreted from the body and it is good to drink mineral water.
Since the stomach is often irritated after sneezing, it is especially good if the product is bubble-free or just slightly gassed.
Go for a walk.
It would certainly not be worth turning to Grandma to break down the trees with a bluff - this can turn out to be a fateful misconception.
But a light walk helps the body to remember what it feels like to be in life.
Loosing a tent and digging out a broom is a more time-consuming way of healing.
Give your body energy back gradually and carefully.
If you’re starting to overdo it yesterday, it’s definitely not worth trying to load up a big fat rag.
For example, start with a fresh juice that contains the fruit sugars quietly marketed to your body.
If the health of the south is already suffering, you could try, for example, a bouillon.
And a little later on, it's a shelves.
Avoid coffee.
This diuretic will finally release your body from the water.
As I said, water and juice are your friends.
Don't bet on painkillers.
If you take a painkiller in the evening to prevent bouts in the evening, your liver should also deal with paracetamol or ibuprofen in addition to alcohol and thus lose performance.
So you break your liver even more and in the future your pockets will get worse.
In addition, the painkiller does not stay in the body for a long time anyway.
If you take a painkiller in the morning, do not do it on a completely empty stomach - it will irritate your broken stomach.
If you don’t have a partner, you can do well with yourself.
It’s like walking, but walking doesn’t have an orgasm.
However, avoid an overactive tempo and twisting of the pussy - during a sneeze, physical exertion should be moderate.
You're kidding.
Spend time with friends and fellow sufferers in a silly conversation, making simple fools, and smiling friendlyly about yourself and others (patience).
Laughs and laughter may not distract you, but they certainly make it more fun to withstand the aftermath.
One day, the mosquito will pass anyway!
Northwestern professor and Oxford University employee are being sought for suspects in murder
According to police, a professor at Northwestern University and a staff member at Oxford University are being sought nationwide, who have become suspects after finding the dead body of a man in a Chicago luxury apartment building.
According to Cook County court documents, arrest warrants were issued on Monday without bail for the arrest of 42-year-old Wyndham Lathem and 56-year-old Andrew Warren on charges of first-degree murder for their alleged connection to the death of Trenton Du H. James Cornell.
The 26-year-old Cornell-Duranleau died after being repeatedly stabbed.
According to a warning issued by the Chicago Police Department to the community, the body was discovered on July 27.
Police received a phone call and found a victim in front of the Grand Plaza apartment building, who had several turkey wounds on his body.
Officials say Cornell-Duranleau was found dead at the scene, and investigators are dealing with the shooting as murder, while police are actively searching for two suspects.
Lathem has been a co-professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
University Public Relations Vice President Alan K. Cubbage said in an e-mailed statement that Lathem has now been temporarily removed from work and is banned from entering Northwestern University city halls.
“This is now a criminal case being investigated by the competent authorities, and Northwestern University is cooperating with investigators,” Cubbage said.
Warren's a parental assistant at the University of Oxford's finance department.
A spokesperson for the University and Somerville College said in an emailed statement: “We have been in contact with the UK police and are ready to help the US investigative agencies in any way possible.”
In addition, the statement said Warren's colleagues were shocked and wanted him to give himself up.
The head of the Chicago Police Department, Anthony Guglielmi, urges the suspects to surrender to the authorities.
"The police have an idea of where they are, but we're working more and more intensively to determine the exact location," Guglielmi said.
Guglielm said the search for suspects will help local, regional and national authorities to find them.
Guglielmi said the police received a phone call from the manager of the Grand Plaza apartment building, who had just received a cryptographic tip that something had happened in apartment no. 1008.
According to the police, it was a visual image.
According to Guglielmi, it is not clear whether the event itself took place on July 27.
He said security cameras confirmed Lathem and Warren were in the building.
"We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi added.
The Grand Plaza management sent a letter to the residents: “The police are currently working on the chronology of the events and the background of the victim and are investigating various motives, including the possibility that it was a family affair.”
Idea Companies That Will Help Your Company Avoid Next Become Uberic
Amy Errett wanted to measure employee satisfaction at her e-commerce startup, but the surveys were profitable.
The answers were often vague, useless, or, worse, misleading.
And even if he promised to ensure anonymity, some employees did not trust this process.
“This system just wasn’t consistent and objective,” said Errett, who runs an e-commerce company that sells hair care products with 75 employees in San Francisco.
So he called for help from outsiders.
A new type of human resource startups are at the forefront, which will help companies to find out what their employees feel.
By designing and licensing software with a specific purpose to measure the involvement of employees, they allow companies to conduct instant-questioning, target certain teams and demographic groups, provide employees with anonymity in the management of the C-section, and give the employees an overview of the C-section on the management board, and a half-way point of filing complaints.
“Now there are tools like Strava and Fitbit that are designed to monitor health, but where is Fitbit for your company?” said Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO of Redwood City’s startup company Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to help employees.
According to Erretti, in the three years he’s been using Glint, he’s got a much better overview of what his employees think and feel.
In addition to emergency surveys and surveys aimed at specific teams, it offers a company heatmap that provides an overview of which departments have the most complaints and which managers have the lowest support, allowing them to find out the reasons.
Companies have begun to understand that they need to stay up to date with their work culture in order not to become the next Uber, which has been wracked by scandals since a former employee posted a blog post describing the annoying environment in which those who dared to take the word were punished.
For start-ups like Glint, the desire to have an overview is a profitable business opportunity.
The global management, regulation and compliance sector could be worth more than $118.7 billion by 2020, according to the financial technology statistics website Let’s Talk Payments.
Denver Colorado-based startup Convercent, which helps companies prevent and detect inappropriate behavior, noted an increase in interest and activity against the backdrop of Uber’s suspicious reputation this year.
Convercent has nearly 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber has recently registered as a customer.
Like Glintki, Convercent lets companies send customized pulse surveys, collect confidential responses in real time, and view the problem areas of thermal maps.
It also provides an anonymous message line, which allows employees to report inappropriate behaviors.
And when it comes to the chief executive, the complaints go directly to the board.
“Public opinion has been anchored by regulators,” said Convercent founder and CEO Patrick Quinlan.
Quinlan said that if a company is found to treat its employees badly or behave unethically, it can face serious consequences, such as consumer boycotts, employee departures and lawsuits, even if regulators do not intervene.
Ruby Tuesday, a restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees at 500 locations, has been using Convercent for more than a year to ensure employees are aware of rules and activities and provide an easy way to communicate with the corporate headquarters.
If the employee wanted to report the problem earlier, he had to find the company’s headquarters phone number or email address, file a formal complaint, and hope that it would be taken seriously.
This was often a distracting and uncomfortable process, said Ruby Tuesday General Counsel James Vitrano, who said it was not a good way to monitor employee complaints.
Now that the company is using Convercent, however, it is possible to identify and deal with problems such as discrimination, harassment or unfair wage practices that have not previously reached managers who have acted in other cities or offices in states.
“I’m able to get closer to the holistic 360-degree employee experience,” said Vitrano, who heads the Ruby Tuesday Risk Management Group.
"And we're protecting our shareholders from litigation with employees."
Quinlan said companies began to take ethical behavior, values, and employee involvement much more seriously in 2002, or after audit firm Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations in connection with the Enron scandal.
But it wasn’t until “social media became mature” that companies realized that they couldn’t prevent their black laundry from being publicly washed online.
“Before using technology to monitor ethical behavior, people used hope as a strategy,” he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service, charging companies with a periodic fee for using their products.
This is a business model and an opportunity with the approval of venture capital investors who have supported both start-ups.
In February, Convercent was funded by companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising the capital raised to $47 million.
In November, Glinti invested $10 million in Bessemer Venture Partners, increasing the company’s total investment to $60 million.
Such investments will not come as a surprise, given the interrelationship between companies, culture and venture capital.
More and more research shows that modern workers expect more from the workplace than ever before.
Competitive markets, such as Silicon Valley, have high salaries and interesting projects with only the stakes on the table.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted and valued and that they devote their time to a company with a positive mission.
“When people are happy in the company, they feel that they are being listened to and that the work they are doing is satisfying, they are more committed to ensuring the success of the company,” said Nina McQueen, who is using the general benefit and employee experience in both Glicent and ConInver, a division’s vice president for Linked.
Investors make a profit when the companies in their portfolio are doing well; companies are doing well when employees are engaged and involved.
While third-party analytics tools allow to increase employee engagement and engagement, it’s no wonder they find support.
Owning data on employee involvement is important, according to occupational culture experts.
However, this data is useless if the supervisors of the company do not do anything about it.
In fact, when a company asks its employees for feedback, it can create expectations that change is ahead.
And if the changes don’t happen quickly enough or not at all, it can cause disappointment and reduce employee engagement.
“If you’re asking for 4,000 proposals, you need to be ready for 4,000 conversations,” said Russell Raath, president of consulting and business management at Kotter International, who has seen companies make the mistake of relying on too much data.
“Because if things don’t get done, the employees are thinking, ‘Did you really take the time to hear me?
Do you care?
And if you don't care, why should I care?"
According to Errett, Madison Reed, who now conducts monthly surveys among employees, has been able to implement the measures on the same day that the problem has been reported through Glint.
And after receiving feedback from employees disappointed in the speed of decisions and the quality of communication, he was able to reorganize several teams in the company and offer communication training to deal with problems.
Ruby Tuesdays, however, collects new data about employees and hopes that in the long run it will lead to long-term employee engagement in the industry, which is known for its large workforce flow.
“If you’re not committed to ensuring transparency, you’re losing people,” Vitrano said.
“If you lose people, you lose customers.
“If you lose customers, you lose businesses.”
The bright star of the euro area is the Baltics: incomes are growing fast
While the 2008 crisis and trade problems with Russia have had an impact on the Baltics, the three Baltic states are rapidly approaching the incomes of the rich countries of Western Europe, Bloomberg writes, referring to the European Central Bank report.
According to data from the Central Bank, since 1999, the total economic output per capita in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania has exceeded expectations.
Success is behind low debt burdens, rapidly improving institutions and a business- and free-market-friendly policy.
"Baltic countries, together with Slovakia, are among the few countries in the euro area where real GDP per capita is significantly closer to the EU average," the central bank said in a statement.
While the objective is to make the total per capita economic output equal to that of the richer Western Europe, in 2015 the total per capita economic output of the Baltic economies was only 2/3 of the average of the 15 countries that belonged to the European Union before the 2004 enlargement cycle.
Low salaries have led the Baltics to seek better wages from abroad.
While the European Central Bank sees the Baltics in a positive light and the economy is also growing this year, the locals are not enthusiastic at all.
According to the latest Eurobarometer survey, only a quarter of Latvians and Lithuanians estimate that their economies are doing very well or rather well.
The Czech Republic and Poland considered this to be slightly less than half of the countries' economies.
The NCAA’s decision to cancel twice a day of workouts makes Bruins days long
It’s almost 23 when a trophy of UCLA footballers stops to talk to the team at the edge of a new training ground located in the campus.
Some of them have peeled their back shirts, revealing their sweaty back from the first day of their training camp.
For most of the team, these arrival minutes offer a break from noon.
After three hours of training, players will return to the communal apartment to study for final exams before returning to the Wasserman Football Centre for meetings the next morning at 6.30am.
"Three days of mourning is a real test for them," Bruins coach Jim Mora said shortly before Monday became Tuesday.
The NCAA's decision to cancel the workouts to reduce the burden on players twice a day has actually made those days longer - at least until the final exams get one half done on Friday.
For this reason, UCLA's first three workouts were scheduled to start at 7.15pm to fit the players' tight schedule.
Switching from two workouts a day means more than one workout days – the Bruins training camp was raised almost a week ahead compared to the previous season, and for the first time in six Westwood seasons, training takes place during summer courses.
They have 18 training sessions scheduled for August 20 before the official preparations for the opening game against Texas A&M in September.
According to Mora, he is in favor of the NCAA rule change, although it adds another point of the day to the tight schedules of players.
“They have a huge load in three or four days and it’s a serious challenge,” Mora said.
"And they're breaking through this temptation; they're struggling, they're nice young.
I believe that when Saturday comes and we have more time, it’s really nice.”
When the camp is over, UCLA turns the trainings into closed, which is not an easy task, given the clear view of these squares from the nearby parking lot and the adjoining center of Luskin, a higher-class hotel that has already become a top-class hotel with a sledgehammer and a sledgehammered doorpost.
As of this weekend, the Bruins players occupy the hotel, but Mora acknowledged that problems with free rooms could arise during the season.
"We're implementing security measures," Mora said.
“It’s a real place of concern and it’s not at all exaggerated to think that people can rent a room and film a workout from there.
If you have a record of your workout, you can make a pretty good deal with it.
But we're using a security team there and on the 8th parking lot.
We do our best to use what is available.
I'm not really trying to worry about it.
We have a plan in place.”
The Savisaare-Ivanova Electoral Union, the Reform Society expelled Kristiina Ojuland and Maria Kaljuste, who were forced to leave the EKRE, was created in the local assembly of our Tallinn and the party members of the local assembly to show the same constituency as the electorate of businessmen for the participatory assembly.
However, the tibes will be considered in the autumn, and the key question will be whether they all have enough disappointed voters.
Who's staying with Savisaare?
When the support of Edgar Savisaare is small, he can imagine the events organized in honor of his electoral union.
One member of the National Assembly, some former and current midfielders and many unknown faces - can such a thing be in the composition of the electoral union?
And is there any reason why some loyal supporters and friends of Savisaare are avoiding the candidacy in Tallinn that the "Savisaare list" of detainees, preceded by corrupters and suspected corruption crimes, is becoming a reality?
A music video filmed on the roof of the municipal government for a Russian-language pop-up, in which the older part of Lasnamäe participates; and in every sense an original computer game in which the main character, Prime Minister Jüri Ratas, has to avoid the trappings and trappings of the road?
We look forward to what the other parties have to say about the youth campaign.
If Channel 2 or TV3 viewers are watching from the beginning of August instead of the entertainment reception against the black box, there are two options: agree that in the future you will only see ETV, ETV2, ETV<0x2B>, Tallinn TV and English France24 channels, or give up to a dozen TV operators every month.
There are probably also those who at first publicly enjoy the free-to-advertise television experience, but in the end, however reluctantly, pay for the television picture and the advertisements.
The noisy music, the noisy crowd and the trash left on the streets are the unpleasant side effects of almost every major music festival.
If you don’t want to get involved in the noise yourself, however, instead of having a headache at home, it’s worth exploring the homeland – and leaving the dorm to the festival guests for a lump sum.
Washington is changing the rules of the green card
The media outlets quoted President Donald Trump as saying that there is a new U.S. immigration plan that will change the rules of the Green Card.
The plan provides for a reduction in the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 people per year, stricter rules for obtaining temporary work visas and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules have been proposed by the Republicans and the President supports them.
The bill will be debated in two houses of Congress.
“This law reduces poverty, raises wages, and saves billions of dollars in taxpayers’ money as it changes the way the United States issues green cards to citizens of other countries.
The law reduces beads and begins to replace the current program.
“The new application process will give an advantage to candidates who speak English and who have the financial resources to support themselves and the skills that will benefit our economy,” Trump said in a statement.
Siberian seto youths move to the city, pensioners return to the country.
Yevseyev Anatoli continues the tradition of the famous Seto gold miners on the banks of the former Maana River.
He works as a car driver at the Gold Artillery near the Maana add-on at the Kuvai 140 km from his home.
It’s hard work: two months in a row without any days off 12 hours of work and then only ten days at home and back again.
In the three years he has worked at Artelli, Anatoly has only seen gold once.
“There’s a tough time: going in and out is being thoroughly checked so that wine doesn’t bring in, and going out so that gold doesn’t bring in,” Anatoli says.
Mare Piho is talking to the local villager Jaani, who has told him a lot about his family’s memories in Siberia.
The still-preserved archaic culture of Siberian setos will also begin to affect home-setos, as it is simply so amazing, Piho Mare, who explored the most distant setos in depth.
It will be 30 years since his first exploration trip to Siberia.
During this time, he has been there 14 times and lived there together for one year.
How many settlers emigrated to Siberia in the late 19th and early 20th centuries to get land here?
This is an unresolved question.
I'm saying 8,000.
I figured it out from the stories of Siberian seto men who have thought about it themselves.
It’s hard to say exactly, because up to 30 people could be in one group at the time, but the passport was given only to the man.
The passport was given to only one person, but with him were children, sisters, etc. female relatives.
Look how big this territory was here!
It was several times larger than the historical Setoma.
It had to be managed, managed in some way.
The Setos came here as peasants, but their lives changed, because here they came to areas that were not only related to agriculture, but also to the river (salary mining), gold mining, industry.
For example, in Uus-Petersburg, many sets later went to work in the secret city of Krasnoyarsk-45 (later built by the power of the Soviets the uranium enrichment plant - J. P.) when it was formed.
Did the Setos make up the majority of the population in the area at the time?
Yeah, they lived compactly.
In addition, the long tradition of marrying each other and polygamy has been preserved.
Seven or eight children in the family were normal.
How different is the culture of Siberian Setos and different from the one of the native Setos?
They are different, although what was brought here was once the same there.
They brought with them a lot of nationalism.
They did it themselves, but they always made a difference in what was brought about and what was done here.
Climate change strongly affected the traditional clothing of the Setos, because it is colder here.
The food has changed.
For example, the meat was salted in Seto, but it was simply frozen here.
Where are the Siberian Seto villages and what life are they living there? / graphics: Alari Paluots
The bond with the mother was mentally strong, it was considered very important.
It seems to me that now that it's starting to give Setuma back there, it's starting to affect them.
These girls who have lived here in families have been listening to amazing stories.
Piho refers to the people of the delegation of Estonian Setos who came to Haida village on the Kingdom Day in early July and lived in the homes of J. P.
What's still here, it's amazing.
“It’s super easy to come and go, because the city has a great location: at the railway junction and at the intersection of roads,” says Reigo Tamm, an opera director from Tapal.
The city is no longer just a military playground, we have plenty of nature, sports and cultural venues, and pizza can be found in every corner.
Tapa is a top-notch city!
On the outskirts of Valgej<0xC3><0xB5>e, there is a small island where killers tend to hold a jaani party.
"This beautiful place doesn't look like a train window," Reigo says.
He who is not afraid of cold water can swim in these rivers, for the river is full of springs.
I've been swimming there, I can do it!
You can have a picnic and just have a romantic getaway on the side of the river - you can face the flow of the river and think about life in front and behind.
I've been there for a walk with my brides.
Tamm, the opera house, has been on the riverside, practicing three bridges between them: "Because this place is on the outskirts of the city, no one will be able to answer when you hear your own stories".
"The mountain offers a wonderful view of Tapale, but there are also health facilities where you can run, ski in the winter and play disc golf for example now - the golf course has been made, the boards can be borrowed from the sports center," says Reigo.
Of course, the old pros go there with their plates, but I haven't been able to play there yet.
You must probably call my colleague Rasmus Kull Tapale, because he is an experienced disc golfer and has records.
He's just borrowing from me!
Reigo and Männikumägi were inseparable from the time of the current operisolist’s childhood.
At least during skiing hours.
There's been a lot of tears, disappointments on this mountain, and you can win in my sporting life.
Not to mention broken skids and skids.
“The whole city centre is full of construction work right now, it’s all going to become unfamiliar,” Reigo says.
However, the old and tired wax building is a very attractive place where summer responses are played.
I am pleased that in 2012 R.A.A.A.A.Mi’s director Mart Meos accepted my idea and came to do a summer theatre with his theatre.
Although this year's theatre season "Aleksei Kareninga" has just come to an end, the 11th of August is at the railway station "Ellumerkamene", when the old wax building is moved around in the 1980s.
"Until August 11-13, there are days in the city of Tapa, during which home cafes have been opened and cultural events are held, among other things", says Reigo, who recommends visiting the 91-year-old city on those days.
In the small yellow house on the 1st of May, the museum has been in existence since 1994.
“The house is small, but the exhibits are very much and the information is enormous,” says Reigo, a place full of the history of the city of Tapa, most of which focuses on railways and warfare.
Reigo says that once all the recommended places in Tapal go through, the stomach will eventually go empty, but fortunately the small town is full of cafes.
“We have such good dining rooms and sitting in cafes sometimes makes you feel like you’re abroad,” he says.
Trained and young soldiers who came to Killa spend a lot of time in pubs and cafes, so sitting there makes it a wonderful feeling that you are in Estonia and in your hometown, but around you there is such an international society together.
I think it would be very exciting to hear stories from the French or Americans.
Soldiers, yes, we're moving a lot!
Two Bulgarians Arrested for Illegal Camping in Greece
TV channel bTV quoted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as saying that two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal camping in Greece.
On the morning of August 1, police arrested a group of illegally encamped people on the Sithonia peninsula, including two Bulgarians.
They were released on the same day, but an investigation is underway.
The foreign ministry told bTV that the Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have increased the restrictions on free camping and are already imposing strict fines on all those who are caught in a place of rest that is not intended for this purpose.
Checks will continue throughout the season.
According to the Ministry, the court may impose a fine.
Wolves who teach puppies are going to break the sheep.
After a year's break, the farmers of Hiiumaa must again give the wolves "teaching material" from their herd - apparently the wolves who taught the puppies have already broken a number of sheep.
This year, wolves in Hiiu County have broken sheep three times, with a total of 23 sheep and eight injured, writes Hiiu Leht.
I only had the same number a year ago, 124.
In synchronicity with the outbreaks, the environmental agency also reports that no wolves were born in Hiiumaa and the Hunting Council of Hiiumaa reports that two wolves have been fixed on the island this year.
On Monday night, wolves broke into the village of Kabuna in Emmaste Valley and injured half of the remaining 18 sheep.
In the early hours of Wednesday morning, the wolves broke one sheep in the herd of the village of Reheselja and severely injured the other, who had to make an emergency kill.
The rules for the management of genetically modified crops must be clear.
The Ministry of Agriculture sent a draft law on the introduction of genetically modified organisms into the environment (GMOVS) to the coordination circle.
The amendment of the law foregoes the creation of a separate database for both genetically modified (GM) crop sites and operators, with the use of the phytosanitary register.
In addition, the obligation of the GM crop operator to have a prior agreement with the person engaged in beekeeping within the prescribed radius will be amended.
While there is currently no cultivation of genetically modified crops in Estonia, we consider the existence of clear rules necessary for the coexistence of genetically modified and unmodified crops.
At least until it has been decided to declare Estonia GMO-free,” said Sigmar Suu, Head of Plant Health at the Ministry of Rural Affairs.
"At the same time, it must be taken into account that the measures developed must be objective and proportionate, taking into account both the costs and administrative burden for the private and public sectors", added Suu.
The bill repeals the provisions relating to the data collection and management training of GM crop sites and operators in the GMOVS, establishes requirements for the management of GM crop and the start of economic activities.
Specifically with regard to beekeeping, the existing obligation of the GM grower to notify the mechanics of the start of GM cultivation will be replaced by the obligation to reach an appropriate agreement with the bee before the start of cultivation.
The bill has been sent to the ministries for coordination.
All interested parties have the opportunity to consult the draft information system and, if they wish, submit their opinion to the Ministry of Rural Affairs.
The planned changes will affect in particular the persons active in the field of plant breeding, mechanics and the Agency for Agriculture.
In the European Union, including Estonia, it is allowed to grow only one GM crop - maize MON 810.
So far, however, no Estonian farmer has been interested in growing GM crops.
This is due to the fact that there is no maize pest in Estonia, a European strain for which the MON 810 is resistant to maize.
Also, varieties of this maize line have been grown in southern regions and this maize is not suitable for our climatic conditions.
In 2015 and 2016, the Ministry of Rural Affairs commissioned studies to detect possible contamination with GM organisms in the seeds of various varieties of suviraps, maize and soybeans grown in Estonia.
The results of the analysis of the samples showed that the seeds did not contain aliens and as a result of the study it was concluded that seeds of varieties of rape, maize and soybean grown in Estonia do not contain genetically modified organisms.
From the foregoing, it can be concluded that there is no conscious cultivation of genetically modified crops in Estonia, and it has also been confirmed that no accidental contamination has occurred.
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United recruited Nemanja Maticu in the form of "genius"
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United have recruited Nemanja Matic as a "genius" after making his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
The player bought over from Chelsea for <0xC2><0xA3>40m in the last pre-season game of Dublin United before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday started a 2-1 win in the starting line-up, impressing the defending role, while Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira got a free kick on the offensive line.
However, having missed the Blues' pre-season Asia Tour, Maticul was badly out of shape and only lasted 45 minutes, Mourinho said this must definitely be improved before the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs time, but he has experience, intelligence, a brilliant mindset - he has football mindsets," Mourinho said.
"We'll help him achieve the form as soon as possible."
Like Matic, other new recruits, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku, also started at Aviva Stadium, and Mourinho quietly placed his 11th starting man at the start of the season.
The Independent announced this week that Mourinho still wants to recruit three footballers, but confirmed that the club has already done "excellent work" by signing contracts with three of his four priority choices.
"I'm grateful to the club that they were able to realize three out of four," he added.
“I’m even happier if they can make four out of four, but they’ve worked hard for me.”
Another son-in-law got on the side of a GSM transmitter on 1 August and then in Muhus.
According to the birdwatcher Mati Martinson, who lives in S<0xC3><0xB5>rves, the first great-grandson was equipped with an escort in S<0xC3><0xB5>rves and this nest is already flying around, has left the nesting area and joined the large nightlife assembly of Mullutu-Suurlahe.
This is because there is no fruit in S<0xC3><0xB8>rves, writes the Voice of the Islands.
That Tuesday, already relatively late to ring the cucumbers, another son-in-law came to the sender and it was on the island of Muhu.
According to Martinson, the installation of transmitters is actually an international project, carried out by Aivar Leito and Ivar Ojaste.
A son-in-law named Mati GSM transmitter in S<0xC3><0xB5>rves Türjul was provided to Mullu.
“His actions are all on the internet: how he went wintering in Spain, when he came back for a while he peaked at the German-Polish border and then came to the island,” Martinson said.
British inventor glass to install a microchip in his body to get into the house and car with a handkerchief
The British inventor became the first person in the country to install a microchip so that he could simply open his front door, enter the office, and even start a car.
The 33-year-old Steven Northam has made the installation of a small chip between his thumb and the naming finger and now offers this service through his company BioTeq also to companies and individuals who want to make their lives easier with technology.
He has joined forces with Dr. Geoff Watson, a consultant anesthesiologist at Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hunts to ensure that the installation procedure complies with medical standards.
The technology is similar to the microchip that is installed on cats and dogs, and the procedure takes only 30 seconds.
Northam is also replacing the locks of houses and cars to be compatible with the chip, asking for <0xC2><0xA3>300 for one lock.
This married father of one child has now installed the technology both at home and in his car BMW Z4, which starts when he is on the wheel.
White House Exhibits Pay Thousands to Taxpayers
According to military documents released to TIME magazine, the White House’s decision to fly a Navy helicopter last month went to the southern yard to pay taxpayers a whopping $24,000 for the event marking American production.
The green and white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as the Marine One at the time of the president's inception, was at the heart of an event introducing U.S. construction programs at the White House on July 17.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, and senior White House officials have been innovating industrial products from all 50 states on their tour.
The helicopter built in Connecticut was exhibited in conjunction with a Maine hunter, a Wisconsin-based fire truck, and a Mississippi-made forklift.
According to documents from the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the White House military cab demanded the presence of a sub-command, or FARGO, nearly 36 hours before the helicopter was used for an "unusual" event south of the air.
"I wanted you to be aware of this because it is an unusually high-profile event," the commander of the HMX-1 said in an email the day before the event to his superior, a deputy chief naval officer in the field of aviation.
The message stated that the helicopter will arrive at the south yard on July 17 for the event starting at 7 a.m. at 3 p.m. and will remain there until the yard is cleared between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. on the same night.
It was added that if the departure from the White House was to be delayed, the return flight would require a second crew member due to working time restrictions.
The original crew was in the helicopter at the time of the event, and the squadron's security team remained close to the aircraft for the entire period of its ground stay.
From the documents given to TIME, it was not possible to determine whether or not the second crew was needed.
The Hatchi Act prohibits federal workers from using government assets for political purposes.
Documents show that HMX-1 investigated whether the given event could violate this provision.
"We asked if it violated Hatch's law, and we were told not to break," the commander wrote.
"You don't seem to have a choice," the senior officer replied.
The White House declared the event “Made in America” an official event, and the Hatch Act would not cover it.
But even at official events, there are political sub-tones.
The President supported the efforts of health reform that had been under discussion in the Senate at the time and commended efforts to keep the government’s regulations under control.
The use of an aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically profitable purposes is not a new phenomenon.
The presidents have to use them to travel.
However, the requirement to use them purely as a photo session is unusual.
Trump came to the attention in February when his first campaign event in Florida in Melbourne hit the backdrop of a presidential plane, and his Twitter account cubizes messages that lament the way his predecessor used the plane.
“The White House is very pleased with the show ‘Made in America’, which featured products from all 50 states made from American materials by American workers,” said Lindsay Walters, the White House’s spokesperson for the show.
HMX-1 teams are often testing outside Washington, D.C., and in the south, to practice a centimeter-accurate drop to the White House by the President of the United States.
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July, the HMX-1 hosted 58 test landings in the White House courtyard.
According to the official, the flight was considered to be the norm of training for the "Made in America" flight crew that month.
The squadron's helicopters flew that day for an additional 11 hours for "non-presidential support missions".
According to the White House, no other exhibitor of the event was carrying the burden of the taxpayer's purse.
According to Sikorsky’s representative, the company was not involved in organising an exhibition in the south of the helicopter.
HMX-1 does not retain the budget documents of the President's flights and the exact costs of the event are difficult to figure out.
But according to the Ministry of Defence’s 2017 hourly prices, the VH-3D will be compensated at $24,380 per flight hour.
The squadron records the length of the flight from its main naval base, Quantico Airport, Virginia, for 30 minutes in both directions.
The White House claims that the actual cost of using the helicopter is far below its amount.
“The calculation of taxpayers’ costs on the basis of estimated compensation rates is very misleading,” Walters said.
"These estimated compensation rates shall include staff, maintenance and many other irreversible costs which shall be taken into account in the case of annual appropriations."
According to a 2015 RAND study, the Ministry of Defence’s compensation rates do not include personnel costs, but they do cover fuel, maintenance and contract costs.
Former White House spokesman Sean Spicer defended the helicopter at the time.
“The idea is to show things made in America this week,” Spicer said.
And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they are contributing to our national security and that there are expected to be hundreds, if not thousands, of people whose work depends on it.
And I believe that just like most Americans, we are all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have been tirelessly struggling with.
So, of course, it’s important to highlight that.”
It’s not clear whether Trump was in contact with a helicopter during a tour of the south outside, but he was behind the wheel of a firefighter.
Inside the White House, Trump turned to Sikorsky's representatives, throwing a joke at media outlets about the company's products in his personal aircraft fleet.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the President, "I have three of these products."
Grit <0xC5><0xA0>adeiko - through tears came peace and joy
At the 2011 MM Daegus, <0xC5><0xA0>adeiko was hit in the last field, the 800 m foot ramp ran and the stadium was taken to the top with a load-carrying frame.
Immediately before that, he had been awarded a zero in the distance jump at the university held in China.
In 2012, the Helsinki E.M. suffered an injury from a low-cost injury, but he finished 23rd at the London Open with 6013 points.
Unfortunately, however, it continued.
After the opening day, the 2013 Moscow MM suffered a thumb injury in the Estonian long-distance jump, which was on the Estonian record chart.
Two years later, he won 15th place at the Beijing MM and met the Olympic norm, but was also disappointed by the more wanted athlete.
<0xC5><0xA0>adeiko's heaviest kick went through the mud when he didn't get to score at the Amsterdam EM.
I'd just like to put together one or two decent multi-races once.
“One time,” said Shadeiko.
Even worse was ahead: a month later, his Olympic competition in Rio was interrupted by a knee injury by the first obstacle.
It's time to take it down - will we go on with the seven races at all?
Is it worth the effort of two days?
She thought for a long time, but found peace.
I was able to think cleanly.
It is relatively difficult to describe this experience, but I have thought that the previous season and the Rio Olympics were something that just had to happen.
Luckily, it was time to heal and clear your mind.
“I knew I wasn’t putting the pill in my bag yet,” says <0xC5><0xA0>adeiko about his self-cleaning.
I was able to turn a clean page and move on to a new speed.
According to coach Anne Mägi, it was very difficult to look at the suffering of carelessness, but she realized that the athlete must first and foremost come to terms with himself.
He was so fucked up by everyone.
It was hard to bear.
“Grit said he doesn’t give up and he wants to prove to himself what he’s worth,” says Mägi.
Now he has some kind of peace.
He does it for his own pleasure.
The competition came back in May, when <0xC5><0xA0>adeiko set a new Estonian record of 6280 points in the Götzis multi-race.
In the high-level race, he improved his personal top-ranking score by almost a metre (13.89) and ran a record-breaking time.
Then the multi-competitor felt that it was not at all the ceiling of abilities, but erased from just the first wave of competition.
He has been a teacher for years, and he says that <0xC5><0xA0>adeiko is a master student.
He's a ready athlete, he's good at training.
If something goes wrong or is wrong, he says it right away.
He knows his body and trusts his feelings.
That's what we have to do.
I can’t say exactly what to do and we will follow it.
Shadeiko has also found a new approach.
"I'm not the one who does the maximum in training," he says, saying that the most important thing is to get the right feeling, because it also ensures a good result.
The joy of the next baby makes me happy.
Good emotions have also offered <0xC5><0xA0>adeiko the happiness of his loved ones.
Both her former training partner Maris Mägi and her sister Grete have recently become parents and multiple contestants have received support from new air citizens.
"It's been very interesting," said <0xC5><0xA0>adeiko.
One alcoholic drink equals the brain's "workout".
Livestrong writes that Dr. Gordon Shepherd is such a big fan of wine that he believes that wine can train the brain better than any other thing in the world.
Sheperd is a neuroscientist at Yale University.
His message is not about alcohol or how it affects our feelings and thoughts, but rather about the "very active" process of tasting wine.
By sniffing the glass, twisting the wine in the mouth, enjoying it, and sensing the aftertaste, we put our brains to work to create the taste of the wine.
According to Shepherd, wine molecules do not actually contain taste, but the taste comes from the way wine stimulates the brain.
It compares how the brain “sees” colors.
“The taste is not in wine, the taste creates the taste of wine,” says Shepherd.
The things that still affect the development of the taste of wine are, for example, our age, gender, and even the amount of saliva that a person produces.
Sheperd, of course, warns that wine is not meant to be drunk.
“There has to be more work,” he says.
If you take a too large chin, the system is overloaded.
Excessive drinking wine can be harmful to the brain instead of harming it - according to a 2004 study, people who drink more than three glasses of wine are at risk of memory loss, loss of balance, and decreased mental capacity.
10% of employees in the Estonian ICT sector receive less salary from colleagues
Data from the employment search company Fontes reveal that 10% of employees in the Estonian ICT sector receive less salaries from their colleagues.

According to the United Nations, Afghan democracy depends on the role of women in politics
The head of the U.N. mission to Afghanistan said on Wednesday that elections can only represent the people if all members of society, including women, play a role in them.
Nicholas Haysom, the head of the U.N. aid mission, said that hundreds of women are running for local council elections, three women are running for vice president, and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
"The emphasis on the importance of women cannot be overstated," he said in a statement Wednesday.
Elections can truly represent the people and be credible only when women are fully involved and involved in all stages of the electoral process.
The elections of the Afghan local councils and presidential elections will take place on 5 April.
For its part, the Taliban has threatened the election process, which coincides with a transitional period when the role of international military operations becomes advisory.
This year’s elections will mark the first time that power is peacefully handed over from one democratically elected government to the next.
According to Haysomi, the strong role of women in democracy enhances the success of Afghanistan.
According to the Afghan Independent Electoral Commission, there are 1.2 million women out of 3.6 million registered voters.

A trip from the Philippines to the heart of fashion fans, the Shoulder Bag
Bags lined with shoulders are a summer classic that has become a hit product of its own in recent years, which one of the right summer enthusiasts has to hang their hands on and which merchants have been able to weld a price tag to the hit regardless of its modest origin.
A bag full of debts is probably one of those things that has always existed in life and whose possession has not provoked special emotions.
It just exists, and if it doesn't, there's nothing broken.
Now, however, shoulder bags are making a real triumph, and fashion fans have exchanged their fine designer bags for summer months instead of simple shoulder bags.
While this is not just a beach house, today it is just as popular as a street house, and brave women even walk into the office with it.
Here, however, it is worth clarifying whether the boss still has a summer look like this, or it is worth deferring the note and the laptop to a slightly more official sum.
But the exchange has made the shoulder bag a true summer love for women.
For example, when reading foreign fashion blogs, the first thing to be noticed is that on a holiday trip, fashion gurmans are the first thing to bring to the local market and buy some shoulder bag, which will then be faithful to the whole holiday season and which will go with the bath on the beach, on the beach and on the market.
Some bloggers are almost so generous that they buy a bigger pile of bags from the market and sell or hand them over to their loyal readers.
It is worth noting, however, that the demand for bags among readers is so high that in the real world, women (and men!) probably go hand-in-hand with each other to become a happy owner of some bags.
In some ways, such madness is also understandable, because these are rare occasions when in the world it is possible to buy something that has risen to the status of a hit for just a few hundred euros.
True, clever merchants have also discovered the easy way to earn money here, and so finer luxury brands sell bracelets for a few hundred and thousands of euros.
It’s probably still so that richer customers shouldn’t feel like they’re easy-going, walking around with some kind of cheap bags.
For example, it is possible to buy Dolce & Gabbana shoulder bag for over a thousand euros.
The interpretation of Chanel’s shoulder bag can be around 6,000 euros.
Unlike most fashion designers, however, the shoulder bags do not come from some large fashion box, but their story started from a distance.
Shoulder bags are said to have originated far from the Philippines, from where they have been widely worn.
The redness of the shoulder bag is there especially the exporter and the locals walking around with them very often do not see.
It is said to date back to the 14th century and is quite steeped in the usual pilgrimage.
Since the shoulder bag does not have to weave as strongly as the basket, it can be filled with patterns and other materials that make the bag more personal and thus more attractive.
For example, recently there have been especially trendy bags, in which colored lace or leather bags are embroidered.
A thank-you note can be sent to actress Jane Birkin, who has never seen the biggest swollen shoulder bag.
In fact, he matched the shoulder bag for all sorts of outfits and didn’t even have to go to the Cannes Film Festival with it.
The popularity of bags nowadays does not play a lesser role, but also the fact that taking care of them is tricky and, unlike all sorts of other sumadans, does not have to take care of them with special means, but the thing also drives away water and a wet towel.
As with trend trends, brands have come up with all sorts of interpretations after the classic look.
For example, if you wish, you can buy yourself a ribbed ribbon or rather a small shoulder jacket.
At the same time, it is worth remembering that the classic shoulder bag never goes out of fashion, but the shoulder strap is.
What is a classic shoulder bag?
For centuries it has been considered a classic bag of such shoulders, which resembles a basket in its style, is open and has short, as well as shoulder, branches.

GMB is concerned about investments in the company’s McVitie’s plant in Glasgow
The union is awaiting confirmation from the managers of cookie maker McVitie’s on long-term production plans at the company’s Glasgow plant.
According to GMB Scotland, the company has kept quiet about the future of the investment of the Tollcross facility.
The factory, which produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea cookies and other products, employs more than 500 people.
McVitie's owner in Pladis said they have invested more than <0xC2><0xA3>5 million in the last few years.
There, employees were hired and union leaders "are the first to hear" when something changes in the factory's operations.
In a letter sent to the company's head of the facility, GMB Scotland addressed McVitie's request "to leave concerns that funding is not being used to modernise production lines".
GMB Senior Organiser Drew Duffy said: “The fact that we do not get clarity from the head of the facility about the business needs of the Tollcross and the future investment plan makes our members deeply concerned.
A multigenerational division of families has worked here, and the workforce is largely made up of the local community and the people around Glasgow, being a necessary supporter for ensuring decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social exclusion.
Therefore, Glasgow needs a company with strong growth in productivity at McVitie in terms of jobs, wages and well-being, and in terms of Brexit, rising housing costs and a chronic decline in production."
A spokesperson for the record said: "The Customs Cross Objective Manager received a letter from GMB Scotland only yesterday and the company responds directly to it as we value active communication with employees and union representatives.
Two months ago, there was a regular meeting between the employees of the Customs Cross and the representatives of the GMB, where a number of issues were discussed openly.
We then discussed with employees that, like all other companies operating in an extremely competitive and insecure economic climate, we are reviewing our activities on a regular basis - and this applies to all of our companies and facilities - in order to ensure our competitiveness.
He added: “In recent years, we have invested more than <0xC2><0xA3>5 million in the Tollcross facility, most of which have gone into production lines and operations improvement.
We fully understand the legacy of the Customs Cross as a production facility and if any changes should occur in the operation of the facility, the employees and representatives of the trade union will be the first to hear about it."
Did PSG warn Barcelona three years ago of Neymar’s approach?
La Liga may regret their interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain does not give up trying to lure Neymar into his ranks, making a <0xC2><0xA3>189 million bid to buy him out. But did they warn Barcelona three years ago of this record-breaking conquest?
This turbulent approach has opened the window for the summer and the Ligue 1 club is ready to break more than twice the current world record for the takeover that was set last season with Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United for <0xC2><0xA3>89 million.
When the transition is completed, Neymar will become the world’s most expensive player and also the highest paid professional athlete in the world, who will receive a salary of over <0xC2><0xA3>500,000 per week after a payment from PSG.
Barcelona is somewhat angry about both the approach and the break-up of Neymar, although a source close to the Catalan board confirms that the club has always taken the best care of the footballer since his arrival at Santos in 2013.
But did the PSG president warn the football world of such an opportunity three years ago?
When Manchester City showed interest in signing a contract with Blaise Matuid in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaif harshly warned all clubs who are thinking of recruiting some of PSG’s best players.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch any of our players, we will come to them and get in touch with them," Al-Khelaifi said.
"We respect all the clubs.
But if they try to make a deal with one of our players, they have to face the consequences.”
Barcelona seem to have crossed that line as the Spanish club showed an interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verratt earlier this summer.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the Italian to leave under any conditions and that Barcelona could get a rebound as a result of this interest, losing one of its precious assets in the form of Neymar.
Ireland wants to build a bridge, not a border, after Brexit.
“Brexit threatens to seriously strike the wire between Northern Ireland and Ireland, Britain and Ireland,” Varadkar warned on his first visit to Northern Ireland after resigning in June.
“I can’t imagine who would benefit from it,” he added.
Cross-border infrastructure projects made possible the free movement of current people and goods, Varadkar said.
“This is our vision for the future: to build a bridge, not a border,” he said.
He said he would prefer Britain to remain part of the European Union, and since that is not possible, to remain part of the European common market.
This would preserve the current free trade between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom.
The second way to make Britain’s departure more smooth would be to create a customs union between the European Union and the United Kingdom, the Irish Prime Minister said.
Noting that such an agreement existed with Turkey, Varadkar said: "We could definitely have such an agreement with Britain".
An alternative to this would be a return to customs posts that would proclaim historical fragmentation and political failure.
"Stop commerce, prosperity and peace," the Irish Prime Minister said.
He called Brexit "a challenge for our generation" and warned that its outcome could affect every aspect of Northern Ireland's daily life.
The Irish Prime Minister met with the leaders of the main parties in Northern Ireland during a visit to Belfast.
Mart Avandi, who has completed his first triathlon of half-lengths, is able to pass Ironman by anyone.
Today, the biggest triathlon festival in the Baltics was held in the winter capital Otepää, when the semi-long Ironman competition hosted about a thousand triathletes from over thirty countries.
The 70.3 mile distance consisted of 1.9 km of swimming, 90 km of cycling and 21.1 km of cycling.
Among others, Mart Avandi won the first triathlon of his life.
"I thought it turned out to be complicated and in the end it was complicated," said Avandi in the final.
Despite the complexity of Avandi, in fact, the triathlon is accessible to almost everyone.
"It's not the distance that kills, it's the tempo that kills," he said, suggesting that at an affordable pace almost everyone reaches the finish line.
With the exception of Ott Sepp, "He's okay with physics, but unfortunately he can't swim."
Avandi had been practicing agaral since February.
First 4-5 hours a week, then 10 hours a week.
With a time of 05:34:12, he reached 270th place in the overall ranking.
Although Avandi lost to both Raio Piiroja (time 04:59:53) and Jürgen Liga (time 05:06:37), he won other so-called "prominent class" competitions.
Last year's "good example person" Tanel Padar lost to Avandi in seven minutes (time 05:41:54), journalist Sten Teppan in 16 minutes (time 05:50:23), Kalev Kruus and Raivo E. Tamm in about an hour (times respectively 06:31:53 and 06:45).
The men's overall winner of the Otepää men's stage in the Ironman series was crowned by the German Johannes Moldan at 3:58:27, the Estonians were the best at Ivo Suri at 04:14:09.
Among the women, Helle Frederiksen won with a time of 04:24:01, while Maria Jänesen, who lost to Frederiksen almost half an hour and got a time of 04:58:58.
Avandi passed a 1.9 km swimming distance in 42 minutes and 14 seconds.
He came out of the water at 410th position.
