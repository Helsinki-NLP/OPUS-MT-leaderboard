Camille Auer wanted to correct her sex, was diagnosed with mental illness, and now she's doing art on the subject - "A man should have the right to his own body"
Dozens of patient stories hang from the ceiling of the Project room gallery of the Academy of Fine Arts.
Every one of them says the name of Camille Auer.
The papers tell a multi-year story of how outside people have written up their interpretations of Auer and her identity.
Decide on his behalf who he is.
“I wanted to tell a person my personal history of treatment so that the violence of the process becomes visible,” says Auer.
In the process, he refers to the sex correction process.
It is often a years-long research period that includes meetings with psychologists, psychiatrists, nurses and doctors.
The process starts by sending the “gender identity disorder” diagnostic studies to be carried out in Tampere and Helsinki.
With Auer, the process started four years ago.
Before that, he had already used the estrogen he ordered over the internet and was, by the way, very long in his own repair process.
She experienced being a woman, but according to Finnish law, a person must undergo a correction process in order to be able to correct the sex also legally.
The Translaw, or Transsek Suala Law on Gender Confirmation (563/2002) obliges transgender people to be forced into sterilisation in order to obtain the right sex, for example, in the population register centre and passport.
At the moment, every person of their sex is required to have a psychiatric diagnosis and evidence of infertility.
You have the right to decide your own body.
“This situation is intolerable and violates human rights,” says Auer.
We have been talking about reforming the Translaw in Finland for a long time.
The UN Human Rights Council has adopted eight observations on the law and the European Court of Human Rights has a preliminary ruling requiring the parties to the European Convention on Human Rights to respect the right to self-determination.
The previous Finnish government prepared the amendment of the law under the leadership of the then Minister of Social Affairs and Health Susanne Huovisen.
The elections were held and the Finns were elected to the government.
The change of law is back again.
These are internal political disputes that are not even related to this law.
“The government does not want to put it on the table because there are disagreements within the government about changing the law,” says Frank Johansson, CEO of Amnesty Finland.
The front of the exhibition hall is dominated by two large installations.
One of them consists of the packaging and instructions for use of the medicines used by Auer.
In the patient report installation, anyone can read, for example, the interpretation of the transpol psychologist at Tampere University Hospital on Auer.
The psychologist met Camille Auer twice and based on these, wrote a report that would define Auer's treatment of justice and help.
The realization of the reality to be investigated appears prone to decay.
The self-perception of the examiner appears to be fragmented on a borderline level, and the instability associated with personality is emphasized.
Auer did not recognize himself from these descriptions.
“It was shocking to hear that I was diagnosed with mental illness,” Auer says.
Even more shocking was when Auer was not given sex-correction treatment.
According to the medical staff, his resources were not sufficient to initiate the process.
He was denied his own identity.
On February 11, 2015, Auer walked out of the meeting and kicked the transpolar waiting room into the television cleavage.
Later on, a work of art called Monument for the Excluded emerged from this television, in which Auer reflected on his experience of power and its use.
“It’s crazy that anyone who is born a woman can enlarge their breasts, but to remove the breasts needs a diagnosis,” says Auer.
Your body is not your own if you feel that you are anything other than the amount of your sex defined at birth.
Unfortunately, the experience of Auer is not the only one of its kind.
For many people, the process of sexual correction is more severe for mental reasons than purely medical operations.
Through it, dozens of people meet who have to justify their own existence and their right to their own sexual experience.
“It’s crazy that people who are in need of support and help are denied treatment, insisting that their resources are not enough,” Auer says.
Many people involved in the process have a psychic symptom: depression, anxiety, possible experiences of harassment.
With these appeals, the nursing staff may prescribe that treatment cannot be started.
“Preventing treatment and getting help can lead to an even worse situation than it was before the process started,” Auer says.
Auer’s solo exhibition also deals with anxiety and thoughts of suicide.
Auer writes: “I’ve had suicidal thoughts all my adult life and it’s something that people are usually hard to melt.”
Depression has been treated with medications and when Auer started taking hormones, feeling relieved.
He had finally been able to say the feelings that had already existed in childhood and adolescence.
That’s why a wide jaw didn’t feel right for your body and why your chest muscles had to be round instead of a flat chest.
The most important thing for Auer is that there are people near him who see him.
To be seen is a basic necessity.
“You have to justify yourself by talking, dressing, using your voice and moving,” he says.
Today, Auer feels already seen, she exists as a woman.
In the early stages of the process, however, the random comments of loved ones could hurt a lot.
It hurts the most when a loved one misbehaves.
“They should know and they know who I am, but they don’t agree or are able to internalize it,” he continues.
However, not all trans people need physical changes.
They do not suffer from body dysphoria, which is a contradiction in the body, where the body or parts of it can cause anxiety and even physical pain.
Without the use of hormones and a long research process, however, you cannot get formal confirmation for your own sex.
“There’s no medical basis for these studies,” Auer says.
And it's true.
For example, in Denmark, Parliament approved a new procedure for the recognition of legal sex in June 2014.
The new legislation is based on the right to self-determination in relation to legal sex.
An adult applicant makes a written application for a new ID stating that he or she is of the opposite sex.
After half a year of consideration, the applicant confirms his application in writing and the Ministry gives the applicant a new ID.
This right of self-determination is also required in Finland and this requirement is also crystallized by the Auer exhibition.
It has not been a therapy experience for the artist, but the exhibition is a political and artistic work collection.
I would like to believe that art is still important and that it can be used to bring about political change, during a time when politicians have forgotten human rights.

The Civil Rights Organization issued a travel warning to Missouri
The National Organization for the Rights of African Americans (NAACP) has issued a travel warning for Missouri, based on the state’s discriminatory practices and racist attacks there.
“NAACP’s Missouri Travel Information Act enters into force on August 28, 2017, and calls on African-American tourists, visitors and locals to pay special attention and exercise extreme caution when traveling to a state where information has recently been reported,” the statement said.
The law that recently came into force in Missouri makes it harder to export cases of discrimination to the courts. In addition, the state's enforcement of laws is disproportionately targeted at minorities. According to the NAACP, these factors led to the issuing of a travel warning.
“People’s civil rights are violated.
They will be stopped on the basis of skin color and abused or killed,” Rod Chapel, president of the NAACP, told the Kansas City Star.
“We’ve never heard of so many cases in a short time.”
The Missouri Travel Guide is the organization’s first warning for the U.S. state.
The organization mentioned racist comments made against African-American students at the University of Missouri, as well as the death of Tory Sanders, a 28-year-old black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in questionable circumstances earlier this year. He was driving through the state when his car ran out of fuel. The Missouri police arrested him, although he was not charged with a crime.
The travel note also referred to a statement by the Missouri Minister of Justice that police are 75 per cent more likely to stop a black driver than a white one.
“The purpose of the travel information is to encourage people to be vigilant and to warn their families, friends and coworkers about what might happen in Missouri,” Chapel says.
“People need to prepare, for example, by bringing in money to pay guarantees or by telling relatives that they intend to travel through the state.”
According to the FBI, in 2015, there were 100 hate speeches recorded in Missouri, the sixteenth-most in the U.S. state.
The travel warning is also a response to the new Missouri law, which makes it difficult for businesses to challenge discrimination in residence and employment.
The Constitution-backed ACLU recently issued travel warnings to Texas and Arizona after they had passed immigration laws that oblige police to detain people from immigration violations. According to the organization, this adds to racial profiling.
Generally, travel warnings are issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and they concern other states, but recently NGOs have published them in response to certain laws and trends in the United States.
Yle: Lintilä asked Finnair for a report on the additional pension of the CEO
Mika Lintilä (Central) Minister of Industry, responsible for the management of the state’s owners, has asked Finnair to report on the additional pension payment received by Pekka Vauramo, CEO of the airline, Yle says.
According to the Minister, it is in conflict with the state's will.
The additional pension of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>130,000 received by Vauramo emerged this week, when Helsinki Sanomat reported on the development of the remuneration of directors of listed companies.
Finland’s Kuvalehti announces Vauramo’s additional pension in February.
Finnair announced that it would give up additional pensions in 2013.
The state has made it clear that additional pensions are not used for remuneration.
The state owns more than half of Finnair.
According to the company, the decision is in line with last year’s principled decision on ownership management.
Sanctions immediately curb speeches
Some time ago, it seemed that relations between the United States and Russia were on the way from cold to warm.
US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, who met at the G20 summit in Hamburg, seemed to be doing great with each other.
Since then, the atmosphere has cooled down considerably.
The new economic sanctions, approved by the U.S. Congress last week and signed by Trump on Wednesday, were reacting harshly in Russia.
The shocking response has so far been heard by Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, who said Trump’s signing of the sanctions would mean a “full-scale trade war.”
Even if Russian reactions were merely touted as political rhetoric and exaggerations, the tightening between the United States and Russia is indeed a short month after the election of Trump.
In the United States, the passage of the sanctions law on Russia, Iran and North Korea was not easy.
While Congress passed the law with considerable consensus, it was much more difficult for the president to pass the law.
Trump has criticised the law he recently signed into law as “significantly flawed.”
President Trump’s shortcomings may have been due in particular to Russia, although the adoption of a law restricting their powers has also had to be repulsive.
As is well known, an investigation is underway in the United States into both Russia’s possible interference in the presidential election and Trump’s campaign’s Russia ties.
The tightening between the US and Russia is in fact a short month after the rule.
As the staff of the White House has changed sharply and various scandalous turns have been revealed to be almost up-to-date, it seems increasingly clear that foreign policy is not being done in the United States under the President but in spite of the President.
Such a situation is by no means desirable.
If the Russian-Russian relationship is a spark in the United States, the same applies to the European Union.
In addition to economic sanctions, the tense security situation in the Union's nuclear area in the Baltic Sea is strengthening relations.
The EU has made it clear that the situation in Ukraine in its relations with Russia has been highlighted and called for the implementation of the Minsk Agreement.
Although the Union has so far remained, at least on the main side, united in its Russia policy, the interests of the Member States are quite different.
For a member country like Finland with a lot of trade with Russia, economic sanctions have been a real mess.
The impact of the new U.S. sanctions law is still unclear.
In the EU, it is feared that sanctions will make it difficult for many European companies to operate.
In Finland, the effects can be felt, for example, in the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project and possibly in the Fennovoima nuclear power plant project.
The acidity in Europe has been caused by the abandonment of liquid natural gas, such as LNG, which is important for the US economy.
Trade sanctions are a way of showing resentment in world politics.
However, economic sanctions must be well-considered and meticulous.
Otherwise, they are easily more harmful than useful.
Is nothing holy anymore?
Trump’s White House is now in the middle of a war
The absence of the statues is certainly a sign of a change of power.
The Americans know it as well as others: the Iraqis, together with American soldiers, crashed the statue of Saddam Hussein in Firdo Square in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the Trump administration’s chief ideologues, knew well what he was doing in a heated debate with CNN’s Jim Acosta, a freedom fighter who was targeted by Miller in a speech bar that dealt with the president’s proposal to significantly reduce legal immigration.
Miller didn't really criticize the statue himself.
If he had done so, he would have been attacked by huge flocks of cruise organizers and characters mimicking the Statue of Liberty.
The object of his attack was the importance of the statue and, above all, the fact that in 1903 the statue was added to the foot of the poem of Emma Lazarus – 17 years after the completion of the statue.
As Miller put it, “I don’t want to go into history in more detail now, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.
The poem was later added, and it does not belong to the original Statue of Liberty."
Miller was not wrong in his own right, but it's not just history, as he himself said.
The words of Lazarus are essential, the only words of their kind in which the state calls not only immigrants but "the poorest": "Your tired, your poor, / Your huddled masses longing to breathe free, / The wretched refusal of your teeming shore."
The poem is more up-to-date than ever.
Miller did not practice literary criticism at all; he made it clear that "the poorest" are not welcome in Trump's United States.
The dispute over the importance of the Freedom Path is part of a broader political and cultural dispute over the importance of the United States.
After his death, Lazarus’ friends campaigned for a poem to be attached to the statue’s foot, knowing that the act was highly political.
The aim of the statue was to express the connections of the French and American republics with the classic symbolism, the feminine embodiment of freedom.
Lazarus changed its meaning: in his poem, the female character is no longer abstract, but has a voice.
And it gives itself a new name: the mother of the exiles.
Including the poem in her mind was a brilliant feminist coup d’état and a destructive attack on American nationality.
Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, and the right has long wanted to change it back to the original.
In 2010, Rush Limbaugh – a director who can now be regarded as some sort of predictive sign of Trump – claimed that the Freedom Patch does not invite anyone, but rather is an early neoconservative pioneer who leads the U.S. rays of darkness into the world: “Lady Liberty steps forward.
He takes freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
“The ring doesn’t show the way to the United States.”
Rarely, Limbaugh was partly right.
The importance of freedom depends entirely on the point of view.
Lazarus saw it as poor and exhausted but hopeful immigrants from the deck of the ship after a long and arduous journey.
He saw it from the point of view of people seeking protection and a better life.
His Pillar of Freedom comforts us by giving us hope and welcoming us.
And that's not what Miller and Trump want.
Their sparks do not show the way, but burn the flames of hatred, their only source of power.
World Championships in Athletics 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK national team
Eilidh Doyle remembers the time when only two Scots made it to the UK national team
Neil Black, the head of the British Athletics Association, said the 16 Scottish national team members participating in the World Championships are “significant confirmation.”
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for the World Championships in Athletics starting in London on Friday.
According to Black, there is "something special going on in Scotland" that British athletics must learn from.
“This is welcome, and we will continue to study it for so long that we understand what the issue is,” Black says.
"I spoke with representatives of the Scottish Institute of Sports and they thought it was related to the Institute's activities.
The Scottish Association of Athletics believes that it is related to the activities of the association,
and the British Federation of Sports believes that it is behind their activities.
And the ordinary repentant thinks he must have something to do with it.
But it’s a great thing, whatever the reason.”
Many Scotsmen compete for medals in London, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who competes with Sir Mo Farah in the 5000 metres, and Eilidh Doyle was selected as captain of the national team.
"It's not going to be modest.
His captain's speech was amazing," Black said.
“The athletes left the event with pride in their achievements and strong motivation, no matter where they happened to live and practice.
Yesterday’s words had a real feeling and passion for sport.”
Eilidh Doyle is the silver medalist of the National Championships in the 400 m hurdles, and these are his fifth World Championship. He thinks it is "unbelievable" that there are 16 Scots in the national team.
The previous record was seven in 1983 and 2015.
Middle-distance runner Laura Muir has run five UK and two European records over the past year.
He competes in London for 1,500 metres and 5,000 metres.
Chris O'Hare runs 1,500 metres in London and is also worth keeping an eye on: the man has an excellent season behind him, which includes winnings at the UK World Championships and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers his first World Cup, when the only Scotsman on the team was Lee McConnell.
The captain of the national team says he is "extremely proud" that there are so many Scots involved, some of whom are seriously competing for final places and medals.
"It's a great honour to be captain, by the way, but even more particularly, it's because the team members voted for the captain," Doyle said.
"Of course, I'm very proud of all the Scots who made it to the national team.
It shows how far we've come.
They are involved as well-deserved athletes who compete for prizes.
Captain's speech?
I think it went really well.
I was focused on how lucky we are when we have home games.
It is important to enjoy the support of the local public and that we are at the Olympic Stadium again.
I get a second chance to compete there and I know the atmosphere is going to be insanely great."
Preventing Criticism on Facebook: Don’t be a candidate for public office if you can’t stand criticism
Our country's father knew what bad publicity is.
The Americans loved George Washington, but the newspapers soon began to criticize him for all the possible politics of his homeland, all the way to his political principles.
Criticism is certainly irritating.
But he did not silence his critics.
“If freedom of speech is removed, we may be led as dumb and silent as sheep to be slaughtered,” Washington said in 1783.
That's where we get to the governor of Maryland, Larry Hogan, who should learn from Washington.
Hogan’s staff has removed at least 450 comments from his official Facebook page and blocked their viewers.
The U.S. Civil Rights Union challenged Hogan’s trial earlier this week.
His staff regard the challenge as unfounded, and the attitude was also negligible online.
"What does it matter? This is just Facebook," many commented.
But it matters,
Especially in the case of Hogan.
Hogan is an astonishingly popular Republican governor of a Democratic state.
He has been ranked second among the top 50 governors in his career.
Hogan is not sensitive to heat.
He has consistently led the state and adhered to its principles.
He has also skilfully used Facebook as the main communication channel for his voters and published an image of his bald head in chemotherapy.
That’s why blocking the Governor’s Facebook page is unnecessary and even dangerous. The Governor’s page is a public and official forum maintained by his staff with tax funds.
Hogan's spokeswoman, Amelia Chasse, defended the governor's actions in an interview with the Washington Post, saying it was only about moderating comments.
However, labeling commentators as trolls, spammers or haters is too easy a solution.
The Washington Post interviewed users blocked by Hogan on Facebook.
They turned out to be ordinary people who wanted to talk to the leaders they chose, not trolls, but teachers, entrepreneurs, and pastors, for example.
They said their comments were respectful, thoughtful, and relevant.
In his commentary, the pastor borrowed the Bible; he wanted to appeal to Hogan's Catholic faith.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani was not hostile to Maryland’s Bowie but asked about the hate crimes.
“I politely commented that I was disappointed that Hogan had not taken a stand on hate crimes and other recent news,” he wrote in the Washington Post.
“Neither can I accept the fact that when more people comment on the same thing, they are immediately treated as an organized group and left behind as a large group of concerned citizens.”
The Governor's staff called the comments a "centered attack" and someone else could call them to promote the things that were considered important.
In the age of Facebook, communication is easy to manage by blocking a critic or removing a critical comment.
The old man should have sent staff to collect and burn newspapers containing critical headlines, or to arrest and silence demonstrators.
But it is the same thing, now only digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to be accused of hacking Facebook and other social media channels.
President Trump’s blocked Twitter users have challenged him to justice.
The first major decision on the issue was made last week in Virginia.
Alexandria District Court Judge James C. Cacheriks said the government of Loudouin County violated the U.S. Constitution’s first amendment by blocking voters on Facebook.
And the U.S. Civil Rights Federation went to talk to the Republican Governor of Kentucky, Matt Bevin, about the use of Twitter and Facebook.
This shouldn't be hard.
At the time of Washington, low-cost postage had a similar effect to today’s internet.
The number of newspapers quadrupled from 1776 to 1800, and anonymous writers molested Washington.
At that time there were trolls.
The names Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius and Portius wrote letters to the newspapers in which they mocked Washington’s decisions.
The President's office was flooded with petitions criticizing Jay's agreement, the U.S.-British cooperation, trade and shipping agreement, as evidenced by documents collected by the Papers of George Washington network project.
However, he did not silence his critics.
Freedom of speech, freedom of opinion and freedom of speech are the cornerstones of our nation.
Real leadership is the acceptance of this fact.
Bird feeding should be stopped immediately.
Samples have come from about sixty places, and in addition to online announcements from a couple of, three.
Most of them have come from South and West Finland, but then also individuals from Haapavä and Seinäjoki, says specialist Marja Isomursu from Evira.
The green beetles have died of a parasitic disease called tricomonosis.
It is caused by an animal known as Trichomonas gallinae.
It has previously been known to bite pigeons, and especially dolls.
However, in the 21st century, the disease also began to be detected in beetle.
In 2009, it was pretty good.
At that time, the tricomonosis caused a major collapse in the Finnish green pea pox, after which the species' stocks have been about to recover.
There have now been sick green beetles, but at least not on a large scale, says Juha Honkala, the museum’s mayor of the Central Museum of Natural Sciences at the University of Helsinki (Luomus).
It is feared that the previous epidemic of green beetles will recur unless something is done.
What you need to do now is a very simple thing that anyone can do: stop feeding birds immediately.
More on the subject later.
Ronan Rafferty hopes to benefit from home field presence at Renaissance Club
Former European first player Ronan Rafferty hopes to take advantage of the home field for the next three days as the Renaissance Club in East Lothia hosts the 25th Scottish Senior Open.
Rafferty from Northern Ireland led last year’s tournament at the nearby Archerfield Links before the final round, but eventually lost to Paul Eales. Rafferty has moved to a new location and will serve as the tournament’s ambassador on behalf of the club’s founder and CEO Jerry Sarvad.
“I followed the construction of the Renaissance Club, and with this event, it will reach its full glory,” Rafferty says.
"The players see the field at their best. It's in great condition.
Jerry's done a great job with this place.
He is an enthusiastic ambassador of the game, and he is proud of his achievements here.
The tournament is a great showcase for this field.”
Eales defends the championship for the first time, although he has won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
"This feels like a really special occasion," the Southport player says.
“I couldn’t defend my win at the Extremadura Open because the tournament is not part of this year’s tour.
It's great to be back here.
This is a great place to play golf.
Last year’s memories come back to mind: winning the tournament was a great thing for me and my wife Sharon.
It was a great time that we will always remember.”
Gary Orr returns to real life on his own soil, and he took part in a tour earlier this year after turning 50 years old.
This is his first appearance in Scotland since the 2013 Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open.
“Playing at home is always more meaningful than usual,” says Orr, who lives in Helensburgh.
“You want to succeed, but you also feel the extra pressure.
I enjoyed playing again and played a lot of games.
I’m happy with my game so far.”
The three will be accompanied by former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and senior major tournament winners Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
The tournament will be attended by six Scots: Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance, Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.

Possible indoor air problems in the village were investigated
At least no indoor air problems have been discovered in the village of Pori’s prikata news company, the prikata said on Thursday.
The unannounced investigations will continue.
The investigations began when a man who interrupted his armory service for health reasons thought his health was deteriorated due to poor indoor weather.
According to Colonel Colonel Mika Holma, the Pori Brigade Commander, there are no problems in the health situation of the other guards.
It turned out that this was an isolated case, and the other staff in that unit had no health problems.
Every announcement is taken seriously and we wanted to clarify this in depth.
At the moment, it is not known that we have any indoor air problems, Holma says.
According to a press release by Prikaat, due to the arrival of July, the cargo had to be moved to the barracks, which allowed the dustiness to increase temporarily.
The weather may have been too hot for that, Holma says.
Poverty and Death in Indonesian Gold Country
Bardina Degei doesn't use a spoon in the kitchen.
He also rarely uses the pot.
Degei lives in a wooden building in Enarotal, the capital of the Pania region, located in Indonesia’s restless Papua province. When he prepares dinner, he usually puts the batata – locally “take” – directly in his fireplace.
After half an hour, the batter that burned on the curry is eaten eagerly naked, without washing by hand.
Degei’s home has no furniture, and he sits on a muddy floor, where he usually also takes care of his daily tasks, such as washing in the foggy water sought from a nearby salt.
The shop's office is delivered by an owl in an unroofed room.
Degei is the youngest of her husband’s four wives, and has not been prescribed fields for treatment.
Diversity is common here.
Late work can be dangerous: most of the village men are unemployed, and many drink a lot. In addition, it is necessary to take into account soldiers.
“No one dares to walk in the village after five in the evening,” Degei says.
This is a rare encroachment on the plains of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was annexed to Indonesia in 1969, ahead of a controversial referendum, in which 1,026 village elders were forced to vote publicly in front of the occupying forces.
The local independence movement opposed to Dutch rule quickly turned its anger on the government of Jakarta, which keeps the area under strict control and prevents foreign journalists and human rights observers from entering the area.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua; the eastern part of the island belongs to Papua New Guinea.
The journey starts with a flight of one and a half hours from the provincial capital of Jayapur to Nabire and continues with a twisting five-hour drive with a rental car.
There's no public transport here.
Around 19,000 people live in bamboo-enclosed wooden houses, whose corrugated roofs have been painted into bell-brown.
Few Indonesians have been here, not to mention journalists and foreigners.
Before the arrival of the Christian missionaries, the Papuan Mee Pago people worshiped the god Uga Tamee.
There have also been other changes.
"We didn't have such clothes," Degei says. He means a colorful, hand woven iron headdress, a dark skirt and a bright-coloured blouse.
"Before, we only had leaves to cover our bodies."
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, with 28% of its population living below the poverty line, and child mortality and illiteracy are among the highest in Asia.
But it is also Indonesian gold.
Paniai is a roughly New Jersey-sized upperland region with 153,000 inhabitants. Just about a hundred miles away from Pania is Grasberg, the world's largest and most profitable gold mine, owned by Freeport McMoran, a Phoenix-based company in the United States.
In 2015, the mine produced $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper for Freeport.
In addition, Papua has an estimated $78 billion in timber reserves.
For the Papuans, however, these riches bring misery, for they signify the repressive presence of Indonesia’s strong army.
The New York Times revealed in 2005 that Freeport paid nearly $20 million to local military personnel and to local military units between 1998 and 2004, and up to $150,000 was paid to individual officers.
Papua’s demands for greater self-government threaten this source of income, and they are relentlessly silenced.
According to human rights activists, the Indonesian army has killed more than 500,000 Papuans and raped, tortured and imprisoned thousands since 1969.
According to the Asian Commission on Human Rights, mass killings in the Papuan highlands in the 1970s were proportional to genocide.
Last year, Indonesian police detained more than 3,900 people in peaceful protests in the area.
The Archdiocese of Brisbane’s 2016 report We Will Lose Everything contains reports of last year’s atrocities, such as executions without trial, torture – rape and electric shocks are particularly popular means – and relentless attacks on peaceful demonstrations.
“It is difficult to calculate the number of victims because there are cases on a weekly basis,” said Andreas Harsono, an Indonesian researcher at Human Rights Watch.
Screws have been tightened as Papua’s natural resources attract migrants from other parts of Indonesia.
83% of the province’s 3.5 million inhabitants are Christians, but the population structure is changing as Indonesians move from the islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi to the region in hopes of a better livelihood for Muslims.
Jaavali Warung food boxes sell fried chicken and gado-gado vegetable mix in peanut sauce.
Locals are hard to compete.
“The immigrants have started selling chicken and vegetables in the market at a cheaper price than the locals,” says 24-year-old Abeth You, who is from Pania and moved to the provincial capital after work.
"Local women have lost their customers."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, nicknamed Jokowi, promised in his 2014 election campaign to address Papua injustices and human rights violations.
Papua consists of 29 regions, and this former carpenter won a vote in 27 regions, including Pania, on his way to Jakarta’s presidential palace.
But little has changed in Papua, and the locals feel betrayed.
"Our hearts were broken because we voted for Jokovia in 2014 and we were waiting for him to fulfill our wishes and restore justice," You said.
The boards experienced some kind of wave base only two months after Jokov’s October officials.
Eleven children were singing Christmas songs at a wedding in Enarotal on December 7, 2014, when two Indonesian soldiers appeared in the dark on motorcycles.
The frightened children told the soldiers that they should use the headlights.
One of the soldiers did not like the remark, according to the local pastor Yavedt Teba, the man returned with four soldiers.
According to reports by victims and witnesses, drunken soldiers caught the children and abused them with gunshots.
So one of the soldiers shot at the children.
One of the children, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, died in a coma as a result of abuse.
A few hours later, the building of the State Electoral Commission, located near the venue, was set on fire and began to take place the next day.
About a thousand Papuans – young men and women and children – gathered at the football field to demand justice in front of the local police station and army command center.
They had hunting strings for the festivities with them, and they began performing the traditional waita dance of the Papuan Mee Pago tribe, which dances in a circle and imitates the bird song.
Some of the demonstrators began to stone police and army buildings.
When the atmosphere warmed, the soldiers were given the order in the internal radio system: "If the masses make resistance more than three times, shoot them dead." The information is based on seeing an official document in the TIME magazine, which has not been published to the local media.
Jeremiah Kayame, 56, the chief resident of Kego Koto, imagined that the situation would be removed from the hands and asked the crowd to calm down and return to their homes.
No one wanted to listen anymore.
“When I turned around, I was shot in the left wing,” he told TIME magazine with a glimpse of his brightly painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who shot him, but the bullet came from the ranks of the soldiers.
"A number of shots were fired in the evacuation."
Alfius Youw was shot three times, and his cousin saw the shots.
"I ran to him and made sure it was really him," John told TIME magazine sadly. Like many Indonesians, he uses only one name.
"When I saw that he was dead... I kissed him."
Papua police inspector Yotje Mende told reporters that the police were only "protecting" the police station because it was the target of the attack.
"We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," Papua police spokesman Pudjo Sulistiyo said in 2015.
"Then it's about life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young demonstrators were killed and many injured.
The death was reported in Jakarta the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi gave an emotional speech in Jayapura, where he expressed his condolences to the families of the victims and promised that the Papuan violence would be addressed.
"I want the case to be investigated immediately so that it never happens again."
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he will launch investigations of human rights violations outside the legal system.
He immediately began to cancel his speech.
"Most of the violations occurred a long time ago,
In the 1990s and early 2000s.
The most important thing is that we have decided to investigate the violations, but it requires certain processes,” he said.
In an interview with TIME magazine in Jakarta on June 5, 2017 Wiranto had already changed his mind, saying that he was not going to start investigations in Papua.
"Everything will be settled in court," he said.
The UN accuses Wiranto of "crimes against humanity". The crimes are related to the deaths of more than a thousand people in the bloody independence vote in East Timor in 1999. Wiranto told TIME that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua have already been identified, including the events in Pania.
The families of Pania’s victims are deeply disbelieving in the allegations.
“I’ve been interviewed four times in the last three years, but things haven’t progressed in any way,” John says.
"I'm tired of this."
He says he's still living in fear, even though it's been years since the incident.
“Yes, I am afraid,” he says.
"I'm afraid the army will arrest me, I'm afraid I'll be shot."
His brother Yacobus confirms that the Panicians do not dare to discuss the event.
He says that the soldiers had abused him when he had helped bury four of the victims.
“The soldiers are looking for me in their hands after burying the victims,” he says.
The shootings are not over.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot villagers in the neighbouring Pania area of Deiya.
One died and 17 were injured in a conflict between the villagers and the head of the construction company, which began when the head refused to take the unconscious man to the hospital, including children.
The man in need of hospitalization was Ravianus Douw, a 24-year-old man who had fallen into the water while fishing on a nearby river and died on his way to the hospital.
Angry villagers showed their intentions at the construction site in front of the company’s office.
According to police, the villagers stoned policemen who responded with warning signs.
According to locals, however, a police unit of Indonesian paramilitary police opened fire on the crowd, killing one villager.
"We're scared. We're afraid of revenge," says 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and saw the wounded brought in for treatment.
"I've been hiding at home for two days."
Deiyai's parliament has called for the shootings of police officers and the removal of a moving police unit from the area.
Paniai has always been a problem for the Indonesian government.
The lack of real development fuels dissatisfaction among the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes living in the Papuan meadows of the Middle Plains.
Many have joined the Papuan Liberation Movement (OPM), a rebel army that claims to defend the rights of Papuans with random attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the leaders of OPM are Pania, such as Tadius Yogi and Daniel Judas Kogoya.
The army has responded to the rebellion by arbitrarily arresting and imprisoning thousands of people in Pania in the name of “protection of national sovereignty”.
Some of the detainees will never return.
Among Papuans, Paniai is known as "the sad, forgotten place".
Poverty fuels dissatisfaction.
There is only a small amount of rice for sale in Enarotal, and it is too expensive for locals.
as well as bread.
People grow their own food: mainly potatoes and some fruit and leafy vegetables.
Cultivation is the work of women, and one woman can have four or five battalions.
Most of the harvest is for the family, and the rest is sold on the market.
Ten potatoes cost only 10,000 rupees (75 cents).
Over time, disparities in the performance of local and migrants have increased, and the number of migrants has increased since the opening of new routes to Nabire airport.
There are few jobs, and they usually go to better-educated and richer immigrants than the local ones.
Only a few Papuans have enough capital and skills to run their own business competitively.
“Young people don’t want to stay in the village because there’s no work and no money here,” said John Gobai, president of the Pania Tribal Council.
Far-off Papua is not much of a concern in the world.
In addition, the restrictions on international news are still strict.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua, although they had been granted a rare description permit. The official reason was the inability to cooperate with local institutions.
According to Phelim Kinen, Asia’s deputy director of Human Rights Watch, Jokowi has not kept his election promises, and has not increased transparency or promoted development by removing restrictions on news coverage.
"Reporters from Indonesia's most uneasy eastern provinces of Papua and West Papua have new risks: refusal of visas and blacklisting," Kine said in a statement.
The lack of freedom of the press means that the Indonesian government is only under pressure from Papua’s close aid.
In March, six Pacific states – Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands – called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate Papua “county and widespread violations”, including the Pania shooting.
These countries have traditionally also supported the Papua Liberation Movement.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir denied the allegations and told reporters in Jakarta that "Indonesia remains a democracy with freedom of the press, so hiding evidence of human rights violations would be difficult."
The locals want the governments of the external powers to intervene.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by Human Rights Ambassador Kees Van Bar, visited Jayapura on 4 May 2017, locals broke the silence and expressed their desire for freedom, an anonymous source told the meeting.
Indonesia has a presidential election in 2019, but Papuans say they are no longer likely to vote for Jokovia.
“Jokowi means good, but there are people around him who are involved in Pania’s shooting,” said Gobai, president of the Tribal Council.
He wants Jokov to know the situation of the Panicians: they live under the power of a greedy and unpredictable army in the absence and poverty, practically without health care and educational opportunities.
According to Goba, the Panians, like other Papuans, consider the votes they gave to Jokow a "debt" that must be repaid.
"They don't want money. They just want justice," he says.
In spite of threats and intimidation, the relatives of the victims of the Pania shooting once again symbolically demonstrated resistance: they buried one of the victims at the police station and army headquarters in the opposite country.
They know that they may never get justice, but at least they won’t let those responsible forget their crimes.
"My family members were killed," Yacobus says in the headlines.
"What else could we do?"
Derek Chisora: Robert Helenius's Retrieval: 'Even his own fans don't want to see'
Heavyweight boxers Robert Helenius and Derek Chisora were scheduled to play in the Hartwall Arena on May 27.
However, the match was cancelled for commercial reasons.
In a recent interview with IFL TV, Chisora gives the reason to flop the replay entirely on the shoulders of Helenius.
My game in Finland flopped, but it wasn’t my fault.
I don't live in Finland, I don't want to sell tickets there.
The reason was my Finnish opponent.
Even his fans don’t want to see him take it, because he is sad, Chisora bores.
Helenius and Chisora first met at the Hartwall Arena in December 2011.
Helenius won the match with a controversial score.
The reprocessing ticket sales went smoothly, and its promoter Nisse Sauerland told Ilta-Sanom in May that the match had been postponed to autumn.
There has been nothing new about the title.
However, the cancellation will no longer harm Chisora.
The match would probably have had to be cancelled after Chisora got sick anyway.
On Thursday, three days before the match, I woke up in severe pain.
My tyre exploded.
The hospital said I had to be cut, Chisora told me.
The UK says it is currently in about 45% condition.
At the end of the day, she is not interested in a rematch with Helenius, but in Dillian Whyte.
Chisora suffered a loss to Whyte in December.
Your power came to re-energize the Torch skyscraper in Dubai
On Friday, the Liekes seized the world’s tallest residential building in Dubai, where hundreds of residents had to escape from a 337-metre-high 79-story building.
This was already the second fire in two years in the building, whose name happens to be Torch, lit.
The building was evacuated, and no one is known to have been injured, and the cause of the fire was unknown immediately after the incident.
“We were asleep and woke up to the sound of the fire alarm and the cries of people.
We would run down the stairs from the 50th floor, which took ten minutes,” a resident named George told Reuters.
According to the Dubai Rescue Service, firefighters were put out at 4 a.m. local time and left to cool the building.
The government announced it would arrange accommodation for those who left their homes.
The case may raise questions about the safety of materials used on the exteriors of high-rise buildings around the world.
After the fire in 2015, the board of directors of the Torch building carried out a study that found that the most damage to the fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade lining and the plates used to insulate the fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade was caused.
In Britain, police believe that the insulation and curtain plates of the Grenfell Tower in London may have contributed to the rapid progress of the flames in a fire that killed 80 people in June.
A mopo was stolen from a parking lot in Joensuu during the night
A parking lot in Joensuu was stolen from the mopo on Tuesdays between 9am and 5am on Wednesdays.
Mopo disappeared from Niinwara at Tikkamäentie 2.
Mopo was the sign of Sky Team Monkey.
Its color is red, and the registration number is 27-REV.
Mopo was found later on Thursday.

In the United States, more than 20 percent of air passengers carry prohibited items on board, according to a survey.
A survey of air passengers reveals that more than 20 per cent of passengers in the United States had deliberately or unknowingly taken prohibited items onto planes past the U.S. Transportation Safety Agency (TSA) checkpoints that were not located at checkpoints on the other side of the river, at least six per cent of the passengers were on the road.
Less than one percent said they only learned later that they had accidentally transported weapons, ammunition or explosives.
The survey was carried out by the airline Stratos Jet Charters, which also reveals that young passengers are more likely to be deceptive of the rules than others.
19.7 per cent of passengers who deliberately violated the TSA rules were representatives of Generation Y and less than 15 per cent belonged to Generation X.
Most often, the rules were violated by taking food and liquids into the plane.
In addition, more than three per cent admitted to knowingly bringing items equipped with blades into the aircraft, while 2.2 per cent of women and 3.7 per cent of men said they were knowingly bringing banned drugs into the aircraft.
Passengers from all over the United States took part in the survey, and the company that carried out the survey wanted to find out how many had accidentally exported smuggling goods and how many had done so consciously.
It is not surprising that most travelers are also most likely to carry smuggled goods past security checks – knowingly or unknowingly.
But as the surveying company notes, TSA’s instructions are quite complex and confusing.
Passengers often do not know what liquids to take to the plane and how much.
So it’s no surprise that most of TSA’s seizures are liquids.
For some time there was also the idea that books should not be taken to the plane.
You can take liquids for domestic flights, but not for international flights.
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Director Scott Pruitt has backed his decision to delay Obama’s decision to reduce emissions.
A day after 15 states had challenged the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s director Scott Pruitt’s lawsuit, Pruitt rescinded his earlier decision to delay the implementation of emissions reduction decisions made during the Obama administration.
According to Pruitt, the change shows that the agency he leads takes better account of the needs of state environmental decision-makers than the previous administrations.
Pruitt did not mention a claim that had been brought against his earlier decision in the Federal Court of Appeals.
States should start complying with the 2015 level of land ozone requirement from 1 October.
Pruitt announced in June that he would postpone the implementation of the decisions a year ahead so that his agency would have more time to familiarize itself with the plan because the agency "does not want to interfere with local decision-making or hinder economic growth".
Pruitt was the Attorney General of the State of Oklahoma before President Donald Trump appointed him as the head of the EPA. Pruitt is known as an opponent of stricter environmental regulations.
Since his arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly tried to prevent or delay the implementation of the decisions opposed by the chemical industry and industries using fossil fuels.
Wednesday's sudden change of mind is the latest setback to Pruitt's plan to ease the regulations.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the EPA chief exceeded his mandate in an attempt to delay the implementation of the Obama administration’s decision on oil and gas companies, requiring companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement on Wednesday evening, Pruitt claimed that his amendment to the ozone regulations would only strengthen the EPA's cooperation with the states in a complex process aimed at meeting the new requirements in line with the timetable.
"During previous administrations, the EPA often failed to meet deadlines and then waited for activist groups and others to challenge it to the court where it could reach an agreement on timetables," Pruitt said. In his previous action, he challenged the Environmental Agency's court for more than a dozen times.
"We do not believe in legal regulation through trials and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take seriously the regulation on our activities and its powers to us."
However, the EPA's statement stated that Pruitt can continue to use its "authorities to delay the implementation of decisions and other legal powers" to ensure that the provisions "are justified and based on the best available information".
Republicans are pushing for a broader change in ozone regulations in Congress.
The legislative initiative adopted last month aims to delay the implementation of the 2015 decisions by at least eight years.
The proposal has not yet been voted in the Senate.
New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the EPA's state association, which was challenged in court this week, said the group intends to continue the pressure.
“The EPA’s change of mind as a result of our complaints is a significant gain for the 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans who are exposed to the direct effects of smoke in their communities,” Schneiderman said.
In addition to New York, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and the District of Columbia were included in the action.
Earth’s ozone is created when, for example, emissions from cars, power plants, oil refineries and chemical plants react in the atmosphere to sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause severe breathing difficulties for susceptible groups of people, as well as thousands of premature deaths each year.
Proponents of public health and environmentalists were pleased with Pruitt’s surprising change of direction.
“It’s worrying how much pressure was required for the guy in charge of our breathing climate to use common sense,” says Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
“We still have to fight against the Trump administration, because its ideological goal is to act on the terms of polluters and other self-interest groups.”
Supercar maker coming crash truck - "acts in the Ferrari style"
It also intends to invest in hybrid sports cars while trying to stick to its exclusive position.
This is likely to happen, but it will happen in the Ferrari style, CEO Sergio Marchionne said of the plans at a news conference on Wednesday.
The details of the new strategy will be revealed next year, as the Italian supercar maker unveils its new five-year plan, Automotive News reported.
All Eastern Savo measles cases of the same virus type
Infection of the salivary gland is the same type of virus as in previous cases in Eastern Savo, reports THL.
The virology laboratory of the Institute of Health and Welfare has confirmed on Thursday that the fifth ash infection in Eastern Savo is the same as in previous infections.
The THL has ensured that a person from the coast of Salisbury who has been confirmed on Friday, July 28, is infected with the same type of virus as the previous East Savo cases.
On the basis of this information, all the infections found in Eastern Savo are related to the first ashtray found in the region in June.
The news is good, because it means that we have not come up with any other types of ashtray virus.
However, it is possible that after a fifth of the sick, new infections can occur until mid-August, and therefore the epidemic is not yet over, says Mirkaleena Erkkilä, a doctor in charge of Soster’s primary health care.
There have been no new infections or suspicions of measles since the fifth confirmed case.
However, it is still important that everyone takes care of their own vaccine protection up-to-date, Erkkilä recalls.

Finland prepares for the permissible launch
Pontica soup was not even considered to be legal.
On the basis of the argument that the process produces, in addition to wine, methanol, which is toxic.
Making a skewer at home is legal next year, but it is not even considered to legalize pontika soup.
The clay is made by fermentation, the point is again distilled.
The basis of distillation regulation is the fact that the process produces, in addition to wine, methanol, which is toxic.
There has been no political will for the establishment of a pontifical remedy for every man’s right, said Ismo Tuominen from the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
When the ministry prepared the reform of the alcohol law, the distillation of the pontificate was not considered legal.
It was also not put on the political table.
There was no debate on the release of distillation, says MP Outi Mäkelä (co.).
He is a member of the parliamentary group of government parties, which took a stand on the reform of the alcohol law.
A permit to distill at the pontiff’s home cannot be granted even on application.
Commercial manufacturing will also be retained as permissible.
Bringing tells us that homemade alcoholic beverages come with a simple rule: alcohol can be made at home by fermentation.
This means that in addition to beer, cider and wine, you can legally make a call at home.
The government wants to simplify the rules.
The new law eliminates the requirements for flavourings and flavourings and allows for the production of snails, Mäkelä clarifies.
The preparation must still take place in such a way that the raw materials or the flavourings and flavourings resulting from their fermentation are clearly visible in drinking.
Under the new law, drinks can be made as much as they want, and alcohol can be given as a gift.
It must not be put on sale.
The act of smuggling is no longer a public health problem in Finland, Tuominen believes.
A much larger change occurred in 2004 when passenger imports from Estonia and other EU countries were released.
75% of the alcohol used in Finland is imported from Estonia.
The proposal for an alcoholic beverage is now being reviewed by the Ministry of Justice.
The Alcohol Act will be read by Parliament as soon as the autumn season begins.
The plenary session is 5.9.
The law will enter into force at the beginning of 2018.
The law is well prepared.
It is as if the Parliament had already taken a position, Mäkelä is pleased.
Oscar Pistorius was greeted by armed guards at the hospital.
Oscar Pistorius, who suffered from chest pain, was rushed to a South African hospital on suspicion of a heart attack.
Pistorius has already been discharged from the hospital.
Oscar Pistorius is serving his sentence in Atteridgeville prison.
According to the British magazine Mirror, Pistorius was taken from prison to hospital this morning accompanied by armed guards.
Pistorius suffered from chest pains, but in the afternoon he escaped from the hospital.
A prison spokesman confirmed that Pistorius was taken to the hospital for investigations.
A spokesperson for the Pistorius family said the former top athlete was fine.
Last summer, the Supreme Court sentenced a six-time Paralympic gold medalist to six years in prison for the murder of her girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp.
Pistorius shot Steenkamp in February 2013.
Literate phone conversations reveal Trump’s pressure to build Mexico’s border wall
U.S. President Donald Trump’s telephone conversations with Mexican and Australian leaders have leaked to the Washington Post.
In a phone call on January 27, 2017, Trump urged Mexican President Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto to stop his public address saying he was not going to pay for the proposed border wall.
The U.S. president called Nieto for saying he had publicly smashed the wall project. "You can't say that to the press," Trump said.
Trump launched his presidential campaign by promising to build a wall on the U.S. southern border at the expense of Mexico.
The Washington Post also published a letter from Trump's first phone call to Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.
Trump told Turnbull that the deal that would allow the United States to accept refugees on its way to Australia is “laughterful”, “serious” and “gentle”. Trump said the deal negotiated during Obama’s term would make him look like an “idiot” because he had proposed a refugee ban.
Trump ended the call by telling Turnbull that “this was the most unpleasant call of the entire day.”
Georgia's bloodshed: Activists staged again racist lynching in hopes of justice
A Ford Mercury car crosses the crowd in the small town of Monroe in rural Georgia and continues its journey towards the small Moore’s Ford Bridge.
The car has four black passengers and a white driver, four armed men blocking the road before the car reaches the bridge.
The leader of the gang, a middle-aged man dressed in a striped suit takes a deep breath from his cigar and crawls through the windshield.
Passengers are afraid.
"Roger, n--u!" the man whispers.
"Get out of the car!"
Screams break the silence when a young black man is pulled out of the front seat.
Thankfully, this shocking event is just a replay that was presented on July 22, 2017.
However, the whispers of the disturbance are real when the hanger stitch is stretched to "Roger"'s neck.
Since 2005, human rights organizations have returned to Moore's Ford Bridge to stage the events of 1946, when the Ku Klux Klan was lynched by two black couples, Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey.
No one has been charged with murder.
“It’s confusing that no one has been arrested during these years – even though the killers live among us and many need to know who they are,” says Tyrone Brooks, who helps with rearmament arrangements.
“It’s the burden of history, but above all, it’s the burden that weighs our souls.”
Brooks is a 71-year-old civil rights activist and a former Georgian congressman.
For him, re-opening is an astonishing call to action, and it also reminds the residents of Monroe that the injustice has never been corrected.
"We want the culprits to be brought to justice. We want things to be finally done, and we want to recover from grief and make reconciliation, but above all we want justice," Brooks says.
"We can't recover and make reconciliation until we get justice."
Investigators cover the body of the victim who died in a Georgian massacre on 27 July 1946.
According to NBC news reports, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected of lynching.
However, no one was charged with murder.
Although the perpetrators have been free for decades, according to activists, the motifs of lynching have always been known to the locals: politics and sex.
In 1946, the Georgian state's blacks won the Supreme Court by a decision to vote for the first time in the presidential election. The Supreme Court passed its decision in April, and the elections were held in the summer.
According to the FBI, during the election, there was an incident in which a black-eyed tenant, Roger Malcom, stabbed a white landowner, Barnett Hester, in a battle apparently involving Malcom's wife, Dorothya.
According to Brooks, the town was rumored that Hester had an affair with Dorothy and that Dorothy was expecting this child.
According to FBI information, the influential white landowner Loy Harrison paid Malcom's $600 bail on July 25, 1946, against which he was released from prison.
On the way home, Malcom and Dorothy were accompanied by their cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
The crowd stopped their cars before the Moore's Ford Bridge.
"It turned out that Harrison ordered and arranged the murders," the FBI said in a statement.
"It is also clear that there was a conspiracy between the state and the local authorities. The authorities were involved in the murders and destroyed the evidence and did not reveal the identity of the witnesses."
Brooks makes the most of it.
“It was a voter murder,” he said.
“They were murdered because they wanted to tell the blacks that they would do the same if they were going to vote.”
Cassandra Greene has been directing the Georgian bloodbath for almost a decade.
The presentation is extremely realistic and captivating, and it is a description of the shocking racism that many would like to believe has already disappeared from the United States of today.
The presentation is difficult to watch, but it is even more difficult not to watch, according to Greene.
“We don’t want to talk about lynching because we’d have to face our own dark side,” the director says.
“But I can’t make a relationship with you if you don’t hear me or you don’t want to hear what I’ve been through.”
On the first day of the show, about 30 actors – a dozen blacks and twenty whites – gathered to listen to Greene’s routineized summary of the show.
Wade Marbaugh serves as Greene's assistant director.
He has been the local leader of the Ku Klux Klan for years, but the role is always as difficult and repulsive.
“I feel dirty because I’m not myself,” Marbaugh says.
"However, it is important that this side of history is also shown so that it will never be repeated again."
On the other side of the room are Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, or Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester.
The show begins with a scene where Malcolm screams and stabs Hester, angry that Hester has had an affair with Dorothy.
"Didn't you hear? I told you to leave my country, n--u!"
Rascona or Hester answers.
Then there's a blow.
And then all (at least all black actors) burst into laughter.
Greene laughs with metal.
"What?" Rascona asks.
He's confused.
"Did I accidentally hit too hard?" he asks.
"No," Greene yells.
"I just don't think white people used the word n---u at the time."
"Yes," another black-haired actor confirms.
"It's a slang. You need to use a longer version."
The subject of the performance is unpleasant, but the power of the room is a guy's spirit.
Everyone wants to succeed, not just because of the show, but because they want to honor the memory of those who were killed.
The confrontation begins at the beginning.
Now Rascona's words are blurry.
No one's laughing.
The retaliation will end quickly and violently.
Shots, screams, and silence.
A woman dressed in a black funeral dress stands next to the bodies and sings Billie Holiday's Strange Fruit.
His voice breaks at every other word.
A few hundred feet away, fifty spectators wipe their eyes with sweat and tears.
Nearly half of the population is black and half white.
Among them are a couple who have come to watch a performance of Ithaca from the state of New York, but most are local.
They have been guided by Brooks at the graves of the victims in the overwhelming humidity of Georgia.
The murders have turned from story to reality, and the feeling at the scene is heavy.
After the performance, Greene invites the crowd to inspect the bodies.
Children are able to look at artificial blood and immovable bodies and whisper to each other.
"They're not really dead," the little boy mutters as if to remind himself.
A few minutes later, Greene thanked the audience.
The actors who performed the lynchings stripped off their heads and wiped the tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, the man who introduced the local Ku Klux Klan.
Nick Rascona hugs two actors and then bursts into tears after a harsh performance.
"It's okay," the woman in the show comforted her.
“We know you’re not him.
You did it for a good reason.”
Later, the audience and the actors will meet for a joint dinner.
The white couple from the altar are actively discussing the performance with the black-haired couple they just met.
Denise Duplinskin finds it difficult to find words when describing the sensations aroused by the performance.
“It’s hard to listen to terrible words and watch the terrible deeds that people say and do that look like you — precisely because they look like you,” he says.
"The show made me realize that lynchings are still going on," he added. "They're just called arrests."
On the other side of the room, Brooks recalls the development of civil rights for audiences sitting at the same table.
He says he has already started planning for next year’s show.
“Responsiveness is a powerful experience because it depicts the horrors we experience, but it’s also an educational experience,” Brooks says.
“The message is that this can happen again if we don’t learn from it.
Those who don’t know their history are doomed to repeat it.”
Hanging plants in stores shakes: removing this amount of "extra parts" really saves
Is it permissible to remove the leaves of the flower stalk already in the store before weighing?
What about taking a big hat off the pineapple - even if it's heavy?
The answers strongly share opinions: one is a sign of the most extreme exported nuisance, while others do not want to pay for those parts of vegetables that they do not use but still go to waste at home.
This phenomenon can be identified in stores.
For example, in the K-Citymarket in Ruoholahti, Helsinki, there are cardboard boxes, because many people tear off the leaves of a flower bed, for example.
From the box, the leaves are traded in biowaste.
According to the news published by the Econossanomis, smuggling on vegetable stalls amazes traders.
But how much of removing the extra parts of vegetables before weighing really saves you money?
How important is it to be a sniffing machine?
We Women tested how the price changes when leaves or stems are removed from pineapple, latvian artichoke, culinary mushrooms, brassica and floral fish.
Flower cauliflower: The price of a flower cauliflower costing 2.10 euros was 1.80 euros, when all the leaves were peeled off.
Pineapple: The price of the whole pineapple, which cost 2.30 euros, fell to 1.95 euros when its stock was turned away.
Latvian artichoke: the price of 2.60 euros came to 2.40 euros when the short-lived stock was cut off.
Delicious mushrooms: Two delicacy mushrooms cost a total of 75 cents.
Without stocks, the price was 60 cents.
Barbecue: A medium-sized barbecue cost 1 euro and without a stick 80 cents.
Result: If the leaves and stocks are going to drop off, save at best a few dozen cents for one vegetable.
In percentage terms, the price of vegetables fell by as much as 20%.
A total of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.20 would have been saved from these purchases!
Neymar bought out of Barcelona - Brass star signed a five-year deal with PSG
Brazilian star Neymar has signed a five-year contract with the French football club PSG, according to the AFP news agency.
Earlier on Thursday evening it was reported that Neymar's representatives had paid a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>222 million buy-out price for the Spanish league footballer FC Barcelona.
Huima’s transfer of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>222 million is the largest in football history.
The previous record was at Manchester United, which paid <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>105 million last summer for the Frenchman Paul Pogba.
The Spanish League slowed the transfer earlier on Thursday when it abandoned the first payment company for Neymar's representatives.
According to the rules of the league, the club that buys cannot pay the buy-out price directly to the seller, but the player must buy his own contract, which happens by recycling money through the league.
In practice, PSG has paid the sum to Neymar and his representatives, who delivered the money through the league to Barcelona.
Neymar is expected to arrive in Paris on Friday.
He will possibly be introduced to a new home audience at the PSG season opening against Amiens on Saturday.
UEFA examines the details
Barcelona also said in a statement that it had provided information about the payment to UEFA, the European Football Association, in order to allow the association to determine any disciplinary actions that might arise from the case.
Among other things, Spanish league president Javier Tebas has suspected PSG of violating the rules of Uefa’s financial fair game.
Uefa can punish a company that makes more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30 million in losses over three years.
According to Uefa, the transfer of Neymar does not automatically violate its economic commitment.
Neymar’s transfer to PSG has had an impact on the club’s economy for several years, but the impact cannot be assessed in advance.
PSG, for example, may sell several players for substantial sums, Uefa reported.
PSG is owned by the state-owned Qatari company Qatar Sports Investment.
The association is chaired by former tennis expert Nasser al-Khelaifi.

Austin, 21, got a lot of burns from lightning strike - lightning was recorded in airport security camera
Austin Dunn was taking regular work on the plane at the South Florida International Airport with a couple of colleagues when a lightning strike suddenly struck the plane from a rainy sky.
The lightning force threw the plane into Dunn near the wing.
Dunn was rushed to the hospital.
He had third-degree burns all over his body.
My father called me and said that my brother had an electric shock and he's in the hospital.
I asked if he was still alive, Austin's sister Autumn said.
Austin spent two weeks in the hospital.
In addition to burns, he had muscle damage and a brain hemorrhage.
The experience was difficult for the whole family.
There's no such thing to expect.
It's traumatic for everyone, Autumn says.
According to the airport representative, the alert system was on at the time of the incident and the transport company itself decides whether to comply with it.
Pearson Reduces 3,000 Jobs and Revitalizes Business Dividend by Cutting
British training group Pearson announced on Friday that it will cut 3,000 jobs and cut its dividend by 72% as it embarks on a new restructuring programme in response to pressures on its business.
According to CEO John Fallon, job cuts are mainly made at the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019. The company has already reduced 4,000 jobs in connection with previous structural arrangements.
Pearson announced that it will cut costs by <0xC2><0xA3>300 million again in May as part of its third austerity program aimed at revitalizing business that has been weakened as a result of rapid digitalization.
Last month, Pearson decided to sell its stake in Penguin Random House to its partner Bertelsmann. The company announced that it would keep its outlook for the year unchanged. Its turnover grew by 1% in the first half of the year and was <0xC2><0xA3>2.05 billion.
Attack in Kabul: NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
A suicide bomber struck a military attack in the Afghan capital of Kabul, killing a NATO soldier and injuring several others, officials said.
According to NATO, five soldiers and an interpreter were injured in the attack.
According to unconfirmed local information, three civilians were also killed in the attack in the Qarabagh area of Kabul.
The explosion is the latest violent attack in Afghanistan this month, killing 30 people on Tuesday in an explosion at a mosque in Herat.
On Monday, two people were killed in a suicide bombing at the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
According to NATO's statement, Thursday night's explosion occurred when a joint NATO-Afghanistan Army party was targeted by an attack "by carrying a person with a self-propelled explosive device".
The statement said the condition of all the injured was stable and they were treated at a U.S. military hospital at Bagram Airport.
According to the correspondents, the strengthening of the Taliban and the presence of the ISIS terrorist organization in Qarabaghi are significant concerns for NATO forces near Bagram.
According to the UN, at least 1,662 civilians were killed in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, 20% of them in the capital.
At the end of July, a car bomb killed at least 30 people in a suicide bombing in Kabul in the area where mainly Shia Muslims live.
The Taliban said they were behind the attack.
On the last day of May, more than 150 people died in a bomb attack in central Kabul, which was the country’s deadliest attack by a militant group since US-led forces ousted the Taliban in 2001.
The violence highlights the volatile situation in Afghanistan as President Donald Trump is considering whether the United States will send more troops to the country to help the local army and police.
The suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have also significantly undermined people's confidence in the government, in its policy, and in particular in President Ashraf Ghani.
The EPA reverses its decision to postpone the implementation of the smoke-free regulations
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reversed its decision to delay the implementation of the Obama administration’s emissions reduction decisions a day after 15 states challenged the agency’s court.
The EPA announced its decision to implement the so-called "ozone definitions" in 2015 late Wednesday, according to the Agency, which is an indication of its commitment to cooperation with the states.
"We believe in dialogue and we want to meet the needs of the states," President Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
Pruitt announced in June that the Agency intends to postpone the implementation of the ozone definitions by one year to October 2018. According to the definitions, smoke pollution is measured in certain parts of the country to determine where pollution should be reduced in accordance with stricter air quality requirements.
On Tuesday, the agency challenged 15 mostly Democratic-controlled states, including the District of Columbia, according to them, delaying enforcement was illegal.
President Donald Trump’s administration has been looking for ways to mitigate the environmental regulations of Barack Obama’s time, according to Trump, the measures are part of a broader economic growth agenda.
Trump’s actions have been opposed by Democrats and environmentalists who are concerned about the health effects of the increase in emissions.
According to the EPA website, breathing air containing ozone "may impair lung function and increase respiratory symptoms", such as asthma.
According to the Sydney Morning Herald, a senior ISIS official had also sent parts of the bomb to Sydney.
Suspectedly, the bomb was intended to be carried into the plane on July 15, but the company was suspended before security checks.
The police are not telling us why the company was interrupted.
Another plan of the suspected terrorists was to build a toxic colorless gas-separating device and take the device to a full-fledged public place, such as a public transport vehicle.
Australian Federal Deputy Commissioner Michael Phelan says the terrorist plan was one of the most professional plans ever made in Australia.
Four men were arrested in police raids on Saturday over suspected terrorist plots.
One of the men has been released, but his interrogations are also being continued.
Liquide’s CEO: Renewable fuels did well
Oil producer Nesteen’s earnings before taxes fell, but hit forecasts in the second quarter.
According to CEO Matti Lievosen, the company achieved good results in petroleum products, sales of renewable products rose to record levels and the development of the Marketing & Services segment’s operating profit was in the right direction.
Last year, comparable operating profits were improved by the US Blenders Tax Credit tax relief.
According to Lievosen, the turnover of renewable products remained at a good level this year thanks to higher sales volumes and more favourable markets, even though the tax relief ended.
The implementation of our strategy is progressing well.
We will continue to focus on our customers and growth projects and will complete the strategic investments we previously announced in 2017,” Lievonen said in a statement.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomatschenko discuss possible match in their first meeting
Vasyl Lomatchenko and Mikey Garcia, who are expected to be on a collision course towards the most interesting boxing match in the near future of the 66.7-kilo series, met for the first time on Thursday.
The men were in their own rooms at the ESPN Sports Channel facilities in Los Angeles until WBC unbeaten lightweight champion Mikey Garcia walked down the hall to greet Lomatchenko, the WBO's top-flight series champion.
Garcia won the Showtime on Saturday with a unanimous decision by former four-weight world champion Adrien Broner, after which Garcia and Lomatschenko have been among the top five on the list of different weights boxers.
Garcia stretched out her right hand and asked, "How are you, Master?
Good luck with the game!"
Lomatschenko will defend his title against Miguel Marriaga on ESPN on Saturday at 7 p.m.
When the duo posed for photographers, Lomatschenko's manager Egis Klimas noted that the men's match would be "perfect in terms of sizes".
"I'm a former Featherman," Garcia recalled.
"I'm going to go up the top [63.5 kg] for the bronzer, but I'm not that big.
I'm small to 63.5 kilograms.
I want to go back to the lighthouse.
He has to get up in his lightweight [61.2 kg] and then we can ride.
That's what our fans want.
Let’s fulfill their wishes.”
Lomatchenko agreed.
"Sports needs this game."
Klimas asked if the match should be organised on the payment channel. It is part of his strategy for Lomatschenko, according to which Lomatschenko made his debut in the lightweight series later this year and will also take the next summer in a match against Garcia (37–0, 30 for Forna in the match against Campi.
"The match could be on the pay channel because the fans have asked for it," Garcia said, later announcing she was ready to take the channel that offers the best prize package.
“We are the most interesting names.
No one else gets as much attention.
I'll be fine as soon as we get a deal..."
Garcia said he valued Lomatchenko as an "incredible fighter" and that he was going to watch Saturday's game.
Lomatschenko interrupted Garcia's praise and said that this three-weight champion from Riverside looked "very slow. Sorry, Mike... but you needed that punch".
Garcia said he focused first on showcasing the impact force and then on boxing.
The men said they felt that they wanted the match between them to be made stronger and stronger.
“This is the game that is expected.
There is no other game that attracts as much attention and interest.
I'm definitely involved in this case," Garcia said.
Lomatschenko said he was expecting to win against the best. "Mikey is a legend.
It’s going to be a great match.”
Average salary of 5,300 euros, training what happens - the investment advice situation was "wild and free"
The quality of investment advice has spoken a lot lately.
Last time, Helsinki Sanomat told Ritva, 68, to whom the investment advisors of the banking industry spoke full-blown when selling investment products.
The rules for the sale of investment advisors and various investment products will be tightened at the beginning of next year.
The tightening will be based on the new Financial Markets Directive, which will apply from the beginning of next year.
At present, the assessment of the expertise of investment advisors and employees who sell investment products is mainly based on self-regulation.
There are no knowledge requirements in the law.
The Financial Industry (FA) itself recommends that those working in an investment service complete its own APV1 or APV2 degree.
The financial sector has authorized the organization of diplomas to the company APV Investment Studies Ltd., whose diploma work group consists of experts from both the Financial Supervisory Authority (Fiva), universities and industry operators.
The degrees are 12-15 credits, and their exams are prepared by Aalto EE i.e. Aalto University Executive Education Oy.
Its website states that, in general, both exams are "very extensive in terms of requirements".
The study materials include 10-15 books as well as a number of other guides and works.
Markku Savikko, CEO of APV Investment Studies Ltd, says that the pass percentage of the exams is roughly around 70.
For the most part, all investment services providers have completed either the APV1 or APV2 degree from the staff of the largest banks, as their completion is mandatory according to the company’s own rules.
Then there are smaller banking establishments without mentioning names, whose staff seems to have mapped the completion of the qualifications, Savikko says.
According to him, there are “several” banks.
According to Saviko, since 2000, the APV1 degree has been completed by 13,000 to 14,000 people and the APV2 degree is recommended for more demanding investment advisors.
Some banking companies consider it to be an advantage to complete a degree.
Several other sectors have significantly more stringent knowledge requirements.
Savikko says that the recommendation of the financial sector requires the completion of the APV degrees, because that is when the knowledge related to the investment sector is ensured.
According to the Statistics Finland Centre, financial and investment advisors earn on average several thousand euros a month in commissions, including natural benefits and earnings fees.
The average regular working time for monthly salaries is approximately 5,300 euros.
On average, men who work in jobs earn an average of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5,900 per month, and women earn more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>4,500 per month.
On average, the top ten earners earn around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>8,100.
The top ten earning men earn more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>9,000 per month or more, while the top ten earning women earn more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6,400.
Investment advice under the Investment Services Act can only be provided by a licensed company.
At the level of the employee and the task, so far, self-regulation has been relied upon.
According to Fiva, the audit carried out by it met individual cases in which the investment advisor’s professional skills and qualifications were not sufficient on the basis of the advisor’s activities.
As a seller of investment products, you can also act in principle, even if your professional skills and qualifications are at an unfortunate level.
Basically, in this respect, the situation has been wild and free.
Several other industries have significantly more stringent knowledge requirements, says Savikko.
According to Saviko, from the beginning of next year, this will be tightened with the new Financial Markets Directive (MiFID II).
It requires that each company is responsible for ensuring that the staff providing investment services are adequately skilled.
Financial supervision, on the other hand, will have the power to decide what to know.
Marko Hovi, Fiva’s Market Supervisor, says that one of the clear changes to the current one is the regulation on the requirements for investment advisors and sellers of investment products in terms of expertise and experience.
According to Hovin, the new requirements apply both to investment firms’ own staff and to bondholders who sell products on behalf of a company.
Hovi says that according to a proposal by the government of the Ministry of Finance, Fiva will be given the power to determine the skills and experience.
What exactly they are will be decided by these prospects in the coming autumn.
The company must also continue to provide the necessary training and, if necessary, follow-up and supplementary training.
All this needs to be documented, and the company has an obligation to demonstrate that this has also been done.
Hovi specifies that in practice, the company must, for example, map staff performance at the individual level.
This will certainly come to varying levels of requirements depending on whether it is investment advice or selling products.
According to Hovin, there is also a requirement to work with someone more experienced on a deadline if the knowledge or experience is not at an adequate level.
That is, if the company hires a new employee who does not fully meet the specified criteria, the employee must work with the person who meets the criteria for a certain period of time.
According to Hovin, with the change, the rules tighten and become more concrete.
Legislation on the sale of investment products will be tightened at the beginning of 2018.
Photo: 787 Dreamliner passenger plane "painted" on a giant plane in the United States
The plane's flight route was routed over the United States by Flightradar24.
The flight was carried out on Thursday on a 787 Dreamliner aircraft, which was used by Boeing to test the durability of the aircraft's Rolls Royce engines on a long flight.
The plane departed Seattle and flew 18 hours and 1 minute in 15,700 kilometers, which is longer than any regular commercial scheduled flight in the world.
The flight remained within the U.S. border throughout the trip.
It flew through a total of 17 states.
Imatra’s beach schools will not be interrupted by rain or sunshine - Iines Kaikkonen polski zinki with the help of a swimming village
Iines Kaikkonen progressed at a good pace, Taina Itkonen followed.
Imatra beach swimming schools will run in Liette and Lempuka this week and next.
Even though it rains sometimes and then it shines again, the young swimmers are not moxies, praises the swim school runner Taina Itkonen.
This week’s swimming schools will have a total of 13 children, next week a dozen.
The number of children in the coming week was affected by the fact that the school and the escari were already starting, according to Itkonen.
The Imatra Beach School is co-organized by the “Sports combines” project and the city of Imatra.
On Thursday, the swimming pool in Liettee had a nice atmosphere.
The sun was shining and the young swimmers trained to stay on the surface with the swimmers, someone already without.
Smaller siblings also enjoyed the water.
Iines from Kaikko, 5, first guessed going deeper into the water.
However, Taina Itkonen encouraged him to snuggle towards the beach.
It's going great!
Kaikkonen said he went swimming a lot this summer.
The sandy beach is good for him.
Like Iines Kaikkosen, Vili Huhtanen, 5, practiced swimming with a swimming village.
You too can be satisfied with today’s achievements, the swimmer praised.
Jami Kallio, 4, once again wanted water wars.
Ilona Villberg, her daughter Anna Villberg, 6, who followed the swim from the beach, considers the beach swimming school a good start for swimming lessons.
Even though the weather has been what it is, Anna likes to leave here every day.
Sometimes I had to warm up.
The swimmers packed on the pier.
The boys had enough to crawl with a tiger found on the beach.
Milja Luukkonen, 3, and Anna Villberg spread towels on the pier, soaked fruit and baked the day.
In the water, the teaching continued, but there was no hurry on the pier.
One that doesn't belong in the summer.
An Unknown Soldier Sells Toilet Brushes - "Here's a Connecting Story"
You can see all kinds of things.
A few days ago, Siniproducte, a manufacturer of cleaning products, launched the Unknown Soldier product series.
I mean, tablecloths and laundry racks, and a "wc brush with a rim brush."
An unknown soldier refers to the film and film marketing that will be premiered this fall.
Yet there is something special about the combination, and the products have been ripped off on social media: When will the Unknown health sciences come?
You have to call the company and ask what this is about.
What does Aino Määttä, Deputy Chief Executive Officer of Sinituten say?
We are a film collaborator.
We are supporting this film, like many other companies.
We wanted to support domestic production and cult film, Määtta says.
According to him, there will be a special screening for the products, and the film will thus gain visibility.
Isn’t there something a little funny about this – often when you think that products and related stories have something in common?
Yes, this is such a merging story that we are a Finnish actor and these are Finnish products, Määttä says.
According to him, the company supports the same basic Finnish values as those who have seen the old Unknown soldier.
And cleaning isn’t a foreign thing to the military culture, says Määtta.
Other corporate partners in the film Unknown Soldier include, for example, Valio, Hartwall, Saludo, VR and Sato.
To date, for example, Hartwall vichys have been introduced on the market, which can be found under the names Rokka, Hietanen and Koskela.
Unknown products have already been broken by Finnish Kuvalehten blogger Kalle Kinnunen
Coffee and watches are also available.
Kinnunen notes that there is still time for the first night of the film, so the sequel is still up for grabs.
The unknown partners have not yet revealed their war products, for example, Valio, Processor, Neste and the German retail goods chain Lidl, Kinnunen writes.
New Results of Swedish Asylum Seekers' Age Tests Announced
The latest results of the medical age tests of Swedish asylum seekers have been published. The results of the tests carried out by the new assessment method reveal that more than 80% of the tests were determined to be over 18 years of age. However, not everyone considers the tests reliable.
The Swedish National Forensic Agency started testing earlier this year.
The new test was introduced after the Swedish Immigration Agency was criticised for failing to determine the real age of the applicants who claimed to be minors, and the Swedish Immigration Agency was criticised for failing to determine the actual age of the applicants who claimed to be minors.
The Immigration Agency has performed 6,880 tests so far, and the Forensic Agency has now published 2,481 test results. The tests were conducted between mid-March and end-July in 2017.
Eighty percent of the asylum seekers tested in 2002 were found to be over the age of 18, and the forensic agency determined in 25 cases that the test was "possibly 18 years of age or older".
In 432 cases, it was concluded that the asylum seeker is "possibly under the age of 18".
The tests were carried out only in cases where there was reason to suspect the age indicated by the applicant.
Johan Göransson from the Forensic Medicine Agency says that the results are consistent with the results of the previous months.
"The figures are quite consistent. Large differences in the statistics of the previous months are not noticeable," he told The Local newspaper.
Although most applicants were found to be over the age of 18, this does not necessarily mean that applicants had lied about their age.
In May, the agency published 581 test results, stating that in 442 cases there were "references that the examinee is 18 years of age or older".
When Svenska Dagbladet examined the same results, it turned out that in 243 cases the applicant had openly stated that he was 18 years old this year.
In the medical age assessment method used in the tests, X-rays of wisdom teeth and magnetic images of the kneecap are taken. Then dentists and radiologists analyze the images. The method has also been criticized.
One of the suspects is endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Carolinian Institute, whose work includes the assessment of human biological maturity. The assessment can be used to determine whether a person has become a ruptured person sooner or later than usual.
"I have had reason to think about it, and I think the method used is not the right one.
Determining biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can’t determine for sure the age, we shouldn’t pretend that we can,” he told the Metro newspaper.
However, the forensic agency Göransson defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, it can be said that the risk of determining a child as an adult is small.
The risk is the highest in a situation where the test is about 18 years old, and the risk is about 10 %."
Ilonen collapsed 30 places in Scotland
In the third round, Mikko Ilosen spent 30 points down the scoreline in the European Golf Tour competition in Scotland.
Ilonen left on Saturday from 11th place, but found 41th place at the end of the round.
In a difficult road, three bogs were accompanied by one double bog.
The rest of us were having trouble.
Englishman Ian Poulter stepped up to split the top spot in the under par round, even though he said there was enough work to keep the umbrella.
Keli was raw, but I hung out with him and eventually the day was good, Poulter's inch.
He shares the lead with his countryman Callum Shinkwin and Australian Andrew Dodt.
West Virginia's Governor Resigns from Party
West Virginia Democratic Governor Jim Justice announced on Thursday evening that he will be switching sides at Trump’s campaign event.
“The Democrats simply rejected me,” Justice said.
"Today, after many prayers and thoughtful thought, I can tell the West Virginians that I can no longer help you as governor of the Democrats."
The audience exploded with outrageous applause.
"Tomorrow as a member of the registered Republican Party," Justice added.
“As a coach, it’s time for a new game.”
Trump has previously promised that a major announcement will be made at the campaign event in West Virginia.
Trump won 42 points in West Virginia because Justice did not support the Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.
Justice was elected governor in 2016, according to Forbes, the only billionaire in his state.
He inherited a mining company from his father and owns coal mines in five states.
The value of his property is about $1.59 billion.
The Republican National Committee (RNC) issued a statement on Thursday night, saying that "Governor Justice's party exchange is again a new blow to a democratic party that would rather build barriers than a better America."
"Democrats only have 15 governors and fewer states than ever before. In this situation, the announcement by Justice is the latest setback for a party that has no leadership and is unable to find a positive message that connects people," RNC spokeswoman Ronna McDaniel told CBS.
Thank you for the damage that has been sown - from Thursday to the coming of the very summer day
There will also be more Ukuks in southern Finland this weekend.
Over the past week, there has been a turmoil, especially in the central and northern parts of the country and in the region of Varsina-Finland.
Between Wednesday and Thursday night, lightning strikes set off several fires.
According to meteorologists, Thursday may be the hardest day of summer so far.
The Ukkokukurs have finally found Finland.
Over the past week, there has been lightning especially in the central and northern parts of the country and in the region of Varsina-Finland.
At the table, a lightning strike hit the power station, causing a small fire.
The rescue agency received a notification of a fire in the area of about a mile away on Wednesday night.
The power station was located in the sauna area near the terrace.
The rescue team dismantled the roof and wall to find the fire pits and extinguished the fire.
A total of 11 homes were left without electricity, but injuries were avoided.
On the lake, a lightning bolt lit up the airframes of the outer building in Harjulanti before midnight.
When the rescue facility arrived, the building was already fully in the fire phase, and the rescue facility could only prevent the spread of the fire.
An outdoor building of about fifty square meters burned to the ground.
In the direction of Kuopio, in Talk Village, another lightning strikes a self-contained house.
The residents of the house were outside the building and witnessed a flash of lightning.
The rescue team went to the scene to check the case, but this time the lightning did not cause the fire - only a few dams rolled.
The traffic jam caused problems on the railway line between Seinäjoki and Vaasa, when a lightning strike damaged the traffic control system.
Between 8:00 and 9:00 a.m., the trains were replaced by buses.
The problem was not resolved until just before 5 p.m.
Since then, train traffic has been able to continue normally even on the rough part of the track.
Salams have sown destruction all over Finland.
However, lightning has been relatively low this summer.
This summer’s meteorological event has been a big one! says Jari Tuovinen, a meteorologist at the Meteorological Institute.
On Wednesdays and Thursdays, the eclipses have been mostly moderate in intensity, but thanks to the low summer lightning, this also feels very intense.
This might seem like a very hard one, but that’s what it has been compared to this summer’s one,” Tuovinen says.
On Wednesday, 1,700 earthworms swarmed, and on Thursday there has been potential even for the toughest day of summer: by about 4 p.m., there were 1,790 earthworms on the plaque.
If the lightning continues in the early part, more than two thousand lightnings can be reached, Tuovinen predicts.
The previous record-breaking year was experienced in 2015, when the number of lightning of the year was about 30,000.
By Wednesday, the number of lightning this year had increased to 18,386 lightning.
So it is still important that this year does not break the “record” of two years ago.
However, Ukkoskirin can expect to continue.
According to Tuovisen, the air above Finland will also remain warm and humid during the weekend, which is a favorable birth-environment for young people.
The main focus of the storms will be shifting from the northern parts of the country to the south on Saturdays and Sundays, where about 2,000 lightning days can be obtained.
The central part of the country is subject to a more uniform saturation.
According to Tuovisen, there are only a few people in the area.
Coe praises Russia's 'open' apology for doping scandal
World athletic champion Sebastian Coe praised Russia's apology for Thursday's doping scandal, but added that it was not yet time to end Russia's ban on participation.
Russian athletic director Dmitry Shljahtin said at the IAAF Congress on Thursday night that Russia’s ban on doping is appropriate and that he intends to fight doping decisively.
He said he regretted "for all the athletes who were stolen gold or silver medals in competitions."
Despite his remarks, the IAAF Congress voted in favour of the continuation of the ban. Russia was excluded from all-athletic competitions in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency WADA report had presented evidence of state-backed doping in Russia.
"I think his response today was very straightforward. It was a very open presentation," IAAF President Coe told reporters.
"The entire Council and Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation of All-Athletics acknowledged that the country had been going through difficult times and announced that it would do everything in its power to reorganize its activities."
Coe also said he was "satisfied" that Russia accepted the terms of ending the ban.
"I think we had a very constructive day and progress has been made, but Congress supports the Working Group's recommendation that now is not the right time to end the Russian ban," Coe said.
“We need to do everything we can in the coming months to normalize the situation.
The main principle has always been that we want to keep clean athletes apart from the corrupt system,” he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes compete as a neutral athlete at the World Championships in Athletics starting on Friday in London, where they have met the IAAF’s stringent criteria.
The head of the IAAF working group, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia still has to meet many requirements before its status can be restored.
"The testing is still insufficient, and the trainers who have been banned are still operating freely," he told reporters on Friday following a presentation by the IAAF to the Council in London.
The production company disappointed in the poor success of the film Tom of Finland
“Tom of Finland didn’t have the kind of success the actors hoped for,” says Yle.
To be honest, I am disappointed, admits that the film was produced by Helsinki Film’s director Annika Sucksdorff Yle in an interview.
I was afraid that the Finnish film audience might be conservative, and it looks like it is.
The film premiered in February 2017.
By the end of June it had reached a fair 100,000 viewers, which is the budget of the film, about five million euros, compared to a little.
No lottery wins have come from this, but now it’s important that investors get their own back.
If the film had done better in the home country, they would have already had their money.
Now we have to wait for small bites to spread abroad, Sucksdorff says.
Tom of Finland is a film directed by Dome Karukoske.
How the economic rules of football affect Neymar's transfer to Paris
The provisions restricting the use of money by European football clubs do not prevent Neymar from moving from Spain to Barcelona, France, to Paris Saint-Germain, the most expensive transfer of football players of all time.
Its possible penalties for Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) will be decided by UEFA, which regulates European football, which can prevent teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League.
In 2011, UEFA introduced the fair game's economic rules, which require PSG to be able to demonstrate that the transfer of Neymar has been financed without major losses.
Barcelona was paid <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>222 million for the conclusion of the Brazilian agreement, and Neymar’s annual salary in the new company will be in tens of millions of dollars.
Neymar's move to France involves a wide range of economic aspects.
PSG has no difficulty paying Neymar’s settlement amount and attaching it to its star card, as it will be financed by Qatar’s oil-enriched ruling family.
The clubs can use large sums of money to acquire players, but they must be balanced with real revenue sources in order not to be a loser in the football business.
The financial rules of the fair game were drawn up at the initiative of Michel Platin, who was elected President of UEFA in 2007.
As a former footballer, Platini felt that the pursuit of success by indebtedness was a scam and led to serious problems if banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, the focus of the fair game’s financial rules shifted from debts of clubs to monitoring their losses.
The change meant that the implementation of the business model used by Roman Abramovich for the first time at Chelsea in 2003 was significantly difficult. Abramovich bought a promising team, used huge sums for player acquisitions, and created a global brand.
The current three-year evaluation period of the fair game’s financial rules will last until 2018. During this period, clubs may make losses of up to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30 million.
Although Platini was forced to leave the position of UEFA president in a scandalous manner in 2015, his successor, Alexander Ceferin, also wants to curb the club’s reckless use of money.
"The rules of the fair game are still in place and we will apply them in the future," Andrea Traverso, the manager of the fair game's financial rules at UEFA, told the Associated Press news agency last week.
Although PSG paid Neymar out of his contract with a one-off compensation, it can defer the amount in its accounting to the full duration of his new contract.
Neymar has entered into a five-year contract, allowing the transfer amount to be recorded at EUR 44.4 million per annum over the next five years.
According to the fair game's financial rules, the first penalties were allocated in 2014, and the biggest penalties were imposed on PSG and Manchester City, which are financed from Abu Dhabi.
PSG received a fine of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60 million, which was later reduced to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20 million, and the club was ordered to limit its Champions League group to 21 players for the period 2014-2015 instead of the usual 25 players.
UEFA monitors clubs that may attempt to circumvent its financial regulations by increasing their income through companies affiliated with the club’s owners.
For example, if a Qatari company supports PSG but the value of the aid is considered to be higher than the normal level of the market, UEFA will not count the aid as the actual result.
This was the case when UEFA decided in 2014 that the Qatari Tourism Authority’s support for PSG had been exaggerated.
It has also been revealed that some of Neymar’s earnings at PSG could be financed by the payments made available to Qatar’s FIFA World Cup organising committee in 2022.
However, PSG and the Organising Committee have denied Neymar being a World Cup ambassador, and it would be very easy for UEFA to reveal such an arrangement.
As a result of PSG’s previous sanctions, UEFA is following the rules more closely than usual.
Sources said on Thursday that UEFA had not negotiated with PSG on the transfer of Neymar.
The sources gave an interview to the Associated Press on the condition that their identity would not be disclosed because they do not have the authority to discuss the situation with PSG.
According to the most recent published financial statements, PSG’s turnover in the period 2015-2016 was EUR 542.4 million and its operating profit exceeded EUR 10 million.
The financial statements for the last period have not yet been published.
PSG expects the arrival of Neymar to attract new sponsors and increase sales of follow-up products and shirts.
The company estimates that its turnover will increase by at least 30 % under the Neymar agreement.
The Spanish League, clearly upset with the departure of one of the best players in the world, tried to make Neymar's move difficult, allegedly violating the financial rules of the fair game.
"This is a clear economic case of doping for both the club and the state," Spanish league president Javier Tebas told the Spanish AS newspaper, referring to the Qatari ownership of PSG.
Arsenal’s manager, Arsene Wenger, is also cautious about the state funding of the football club, which is owned by an American sports club.
"The incident is the result of ownership that has completely changed the football's operating environment over the past 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
"Everything is possible after the state owns the football team.
It becomes very difficult to comply with the economic rules of a fair game. There are so many different interests associated with the fact that the famous player represents the state."
Now it's fast: Finnish World Cup Athletes' Coach stuck in Helsinki
Long jumper Arttu Pajulahti and triathlete Kristiina Mäkelä coach Suren Ghazaryan are stuck in Helsinki, although he should train for the World Championships in London.
Kristiina Mäkelä may have to compete without her coach’s advice.
Pajulahti will compete tomorrow in the long jump and Mäkelä on Saturday in the triple jump.
The pair's coach, Armenian Ghazaryan, has not been granted a visa to the UK.
Ghazaryan has tried to deal with this in the British embassy with no result.
The coach has been invited by the organizers of the World Cup as a document, but he has also failed to obtain a visa.
Whether this is the first symptoms of Brexit, or what, the head of coaching Jorma Kemppainen said.
He has always been successful in managing visa matters himself, but now there are some problems.
He's doing everything he can to get there.
Ghazaryan has worked for the Finnish Sports Association SUL for years.
It doesn't matter that much.
As soon as someone looks at the steps in the stadium, Arttu Pajulahti told his coach about a possible missed run.
World Cup medal for FinlandLondon demands a miracle
The World Championships in Athletics will start in London on Friday and will last until the end of a fair week on Sunday, August 13.
General sports, cross-country skiing and ice hockey are the species that Finnish table tennis athletes are able to treat passionately from year to year, whether successful or not.
In the hearts of table athletes, success is measured in medals.
Of course there are other measurements.
Less attention will be paid to the beautiful growth stories of young athletes from one level to another, where gaining experience matures the athlete’s performance to the level that the adult World Cup medal is truly possible.
Now in Finland’s small World Cup team there are no such young athletes, and indeed, no coaches.
The World Cup requires a miracle.
Luckily, the interest and surprise of sports is that miracles can happen, too.
It draws bench athletes to the TV screen and glues them to watch the races, even though the London medals are not decided until late at night due to time differences.
Finland won one bronze medal from the previous World Championships in general sports in 2015.
It was brought by projector Tero Pitkämäki.
The fans are still waiting for the Pitkämäki medal, even though the second one is told by him and the other throwers of recent times and Pitkämäki’s stay at the top of last summer’s prize draws.
Whatever happened in these competitions, Pitkämäki remains a great Finnish sports hero in history.
Access for other Finnish athletes to the final competition or to make their own record is a good enough performance.
Hoping and believing in the realistic medal hunts of Finnish athletics in the coming years will bring good success to young people in international competitions of value this summer.
The refinement of young talent and financial support for its work is more important than maintaining a small elite team of representative athletes.
Success doesn’t come in an instant, but requires years of hard work from athletes and patience from both coaching and bench athletes.
Finns also know how to appreciate international sports stars and enjoy their unique performances.
Hopefully the London races will remain in history as races for Usain Bolt and Mo Farah, not for example because of terror or violent attacks.
Exni Rukajärvi second in Copper's big air - "But it's annoying"
Snowboarder Enni Rukajärvi is ranked second in the big air race in Colorado, USA.
The second place finish at Copper Mountain is Rukajärvi’s best big air World Cup.
The Women's Championship was won by Jamie Anderson.
Rukajärvi scored 147 points in the competition.
He tried caballerial 1080 for the first time in the races with his last jump, and it was very close to succeeding.
It feels good and it's good now, but it's sad that the last jump didn't go away.
I’m going to try it again in the races from now on, Rukajärvi.
In the big air of snowboarding, a competitor jumps from a jumper made for the species.
Viking Linen’s new fast-paced ship sinks into port in Helsinki
Viking’s new short-haul vessel FSTR is very late on schedule.
The speedboat had to depart from Helsinki to Tallinn at 18:00.
The ship was loaded in eight countries.
The ship arrived in Helsinki late.
For at least an hour and a half, I've been waiting for you to get on the ship.
Now the motorway is moving a little bit, Johannes Rebane, Estonian, who is waiting to get on board the ship at the port of Helsinki, said at 7.30pm.
Rebane thought the new ship had become a technical flaw.
Rebane said the shipping company had brought in water bottles waiting to enter the ship in its cars.
Viking communications chief Christa Grönlund told IS that there was a technical flaw.
It was repaired in the port of Helsinki.
The ship leaves Helsinki a couple of hours late.
Grönlund says the ship will also be delayed for the return trip to Tallinn by a couple of hours.
The ship had to leave Tallinn back to Helsinki at 8:15 p.m.
42-metre special transport disrupts traffic on Kuutostia on Thursday night

The police control the traffic on the Kuutostia, and the traffic may be stopped from time to time.
From the point of view, the transport proceeds along road 13 to the port of Mustola.
Nostalgia in a Small Circle: Wet Hot American Summer and Comrade Detective
The story simultaneously haunts both the characters’ days of 80’s glory and the grunge of 90’s (at the time David Wain and Michael Showalter made a brilliant The State screenplay for MTV) and their own time – 2001, before a major career in Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler, Paul Rudd, and the rest of the series.
As a cultural product, it is both a parody and a description of the constant memory that we have stuck with in the Facebook era.
As a commercial product, it already feels like a lifetime.
First Day of Camp worked surprisingly well, not just because of its absurdity (it was told in the back story of a vegetable farmer speaking in the voice of H. Jon Benjamin, among other things).
At the heart of the joke is that middle-aged actors play adorable teens approaching adulthood. Emphasizing it makes the impossibility of reaching the past a part of the joke.
Ten Years Later, where adults play adults, is less emotional, and its parody is more fragmented: it parodies stalker films of the 90s, such as the horror film The Hand Who Curves the Wheel.
At one point, one of the characters excavates the Apple Powerbook, inline skateboards and "other stuff from 1991".
Many of the stories are the same as before.
Goodbye Coop (Michael Showalter) is now a writer but still hasn’t gotten over Kajesta (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still a virgin.
And one crazy story involves Ronald Reagan (also Michael Showalter) his crime partner George H. W. Bush (played by Michael Ian Black).
As always in such series, the best are the side paths.
It’s especially fun to see former Paul Rudd, who has a party patch under his chin, Matt Dillon’s “soul patch” from the movie Singles.
The moments of random insanity may take this series to flight as a sort of recursive Seven Up! series until it gets its obvious decision: Wet Hot American Summer – Twenty Years Later. In its final scene, a group of friends will go to the premiere of the film Wet Hot American Summer.
Amazon’s Comrade Detective series once again appeals to a different nostalgia: the Cold War spirit of The Americans series, the Atomic Blonde film, and even the GLOW series press picture where the East meets the West.
Created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka and directed by Rhys Thomas, it is a 1980s Romanian police drama in which a Bucharest police couple fights for truth, atheism and Marxism-Leninism.
In the main roles, Gregorina is seen as a hard-boiled and idealistic Josephine is seen by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici. Their turn has been dubbed in English by Channing Tatum (the main producer of the series) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a great idea,
But much else is not.
There are some good visual jokes in the series (policemen spend time watching chess on TV the same way Americans watch football).
There are a number of famous voice actors, including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny.
However, Comrade Detective gets too caught up in imitating the grim socialist drama – with a killer hiding behind Reagan’s mask, for example – that’s why the series often starts to feel really grim propaganda.
Six long episodes are too long, and the humor of the series is not fast enough and not abundant.
Consolidated, the series might work better as an agitprop satire, even when Gregor and Joseph repeatedly visit the U.S. Embassy and there are always two fat men in the lobby shoving hamburgers.
The message to the imaginary communist public is that Western culture can make all consumer goods and fast food.
The imaginary Romanian creators of the series were not wrong: we assign our own recent history and their history as well.
Kouvola Toni Tauru to take to the ring in Macau on Saturday - against former UFC fighter
Toni Tauru wants to keep the game up.
Toni Tauru gets a hard bone in Macau as Brazilian Leandro Issa played last year in the UFC.
The Brazilian also has the black belt of the jujutsu and the world championship of the species.
Once, I'm fighting against my parents.
It's a funny story, says the 32-year-old Taurus.
Kouvola was scheduled to take off in Indonesia last Saturday.
The match was cancelled due to logistical problems, but three fights were delivered on a short-term basis to the Chinese Autonomous Region of Macau.
Tauru hasn't seen anything like this before.
This was the first time my game was cancelled.
It irritated me, because preparation and training took a lot of time.
However, the player is pleased that there was a new time for the fight.
Waiting for the week has little effect on preparation.
The transfer does not affect the condition, as it will not happen in a week.
The condition can get even worse if you practice too much now.
Tauru has faced opponents in a few previous battles, whose strengths are in the verticalization.
This time the situation is different.
Isa Kouvolain describes her as a typical Brazilian.
He's a pretty aggressive fighter.
I bet he'll come in the first batch hard and try to take it to the carpet.
He's won the World Cup, so he's good at wrestling.
The last game of the season didn’t go according to plan.
The Filipino Kevin Belgongo hit Taurus badly in the corner, and the victory remained for the Philippines.
I've never played so well in the stands: he didn't get any hits.
When I went down, he hit my eyelids.
It really hurt for a long time.
A new motivation
Some freelancers take once a year, some get closer to the ring.
For example, the upcoming opponent Issa last played in September.
Last year, there were three games in Taurus.
There is now another battle ahead of us this year.
Sometimes the tempo is heavy.
I’ve been training in the last few years and I’ve been in good shape all the time.
But I've only been drinking for the sake of taking.
When the 32-year-old heard about the upcoming meeting, he decided to change the landscape for a moment.
I was training in Espoo and I got the joy of doing it back.
We got really good training when there was a guy from Sweden.
The training was a great help, because on Saturday the Kouvolaan will have to prepare for the physical struggle.
I have been able to train against opponents of the same size and practice standing.
Taking a stand is the main tactic of the 32-year-old.
You've got to hit me wisely.
If there's a chance, I'll take you to the property myself.
We must not give them free of charge, because they consume the most.
Macau also attracts the previously held Taurus in China.
It's said to be Chinese Las Vegas.
I think there's a big, nice night ahead.
The Bank of England keeps interest rates at 0.25 per cent
The Bank of England is expected to announce that it will keep interest rates steady as economic growth has been slow and inflation has stopped speculation about interest rates.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will continue to slow, and has shifted interest rates due to increasing pressures on the income levels of families.
The decision-makers of the Central Bank’s monetary policy committee decided by a vote of 6 to 2 to keep interest rates at 0.25 per cent. The interest rate was even less favoured this month because economic growth has been slow.
In its quarterly inflation review, the bank lowered its 2017 growth forecast to 1.7% and its 2018 forecast to 1.6%. It also warned that household income levels will be under increased pressure as inflation is expected to continue to accelerate by close to 3%.
However, interest rates will be needed in the coming years to mitigate inflation accelerated by Brexit, and the bank said that borrowing costs may have to increase more than expected on the financial markets.
In addition, the members of the committee decided to cancel part of the massive economic package, which began to be implemented a year ago in the aftermath of the Brexit referendum.
The Bank will discontinue the Term Funding Scheme in February 2018, although it is now expected to provide banks with affordable financing of <0xC2><0xA3>15 million more, or a total of <0xC2><0xA3>115 million.
The minutes of the Bank's interest rate decision state: "According to the forecasts of the Monetary Policy Committee, the slow development of gross domestic product will continue in the coming years as the decline in real household incomes reduces consumption."
With regard to interest rates, the Bank reiterated that a "some degree of tightening of monetary policy" is necessary to mitigate the market's expectations "a little wider".
The market is currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of 2018 and the second in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that the possible increases are "gradual" and "limited".
In May, the bank forecast growth of 1.9% for this year and 1.7% for next year.
It now held its 2018 growth forecast at 1.8%.
The pound weakened against the dollar and against the euro as a result of the news.
The pound fell by 0.5% against the dollar and was $1.31; it fell by 0.4% against the euro and was EUR 1.11.
The decision to maintain interest rates was made after weaker than expected growth rates dampened the increased expectations of interest rates. GDP grew by 0.3 per cent in the second quarter and by 0.2 per cent in the first quarter.
The bank expects growth to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, but to rise slightly at the end of the year.
Its most recent inflationary slump gave households little hope for accelerating inflation and low wage increases, and the bank said the situation would worsen before it improved.
The Bank added that monetary policy "cannot prevent" the decline in revenues in the coming years, but it expects wage developments to recover "significantly" at the end of the three-year forecast period.
The economy will also be strengthened by the strong growth in demand for British products as a result of the weak pound, which cancels part of the effect of the fall in private consumption.
The decision was made a year after interest rates were lowered to 0.25 per cent following the shocking EU referendum result, which plunged the pound into decline.
The Bank estimates that the overall impact of the decision is likely to begin to be reflected in prices and in the economy only after four years.
Prior to the central bank’s latest decision, interest rates were increasingly demanded as inflation pushed pressure on households, with three policy makers demanding a 0.5% interest rate in July.
Inflation slowed last month to 2.6 per cent in June from 2.9 per cent, however, the bank said it was expected and that inflation will increase again in the coming months.
According to the bank, the overshooting of its 2% target was due to the “totally” weak pound.
“Given the recent fall in swap rates, the competition in the mortgage market would appear to escalate further as lenders are feverishly seeking customers and want to end the year strongly,” says Andrew Montlake, CEO of Coreco Mortgage Brokers.
"The markets look particularly good for those whose current loan agreement is coming to an end. Refund agreements are more popular, interest rates are low and there are also non-consumer options available."
The NHS will prescribe 10,000 controversial HIV medications.
Starting in September, patients can be prescribed a "reversible" anti-HIV drug. The Supreme Court concluded a dispute concerning the funding of the drug in the English Public Health System (NHS).
The NHS reported that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is prescribed to approximately 10,000 people during the first three-year trial. It has been shown to reduce the risk of infection by approximately 86% in individuals at high risk prior to sexual intercourse.
The NHS agreed to finance the trial after the court held the Supreme Court ruling last year, according to which the NHS is able to pay for the PrEP drug, even though it claims that local authorities should finance it.
Simon Stevens, the head of the NHS, called the decision a "significant new intervention" and the national AIDS organization described it as "a crucial moment".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be the first to receive notifications for a trial that will expand to other clinics in October. The trial will reach full scope in England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) should be taken before sexual intercourse with an HIV medicine that reduces the risk of infection.
Experiments have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV infections in risk groups.
Before sexual intercourse, the drug taken means that there are enough drugs in the body during intercourse that prevent HIV infection.
You can take the drug daily or two hours before sex.
The target group of treatment includes gay men, bisexual men and transgender people, as well as people who have an HIV-positive partner who is not receiving effective treatment.
Clinics select the conditions for the trial for applicants of men, women and transgender people and those whose HIV-positive partner is not known to receive antiretroviral treatment for their disease.
People who live in England and have registered for general medical care can also apply for a trial at their local sexual health clinic.
The program costs <0xC2><0xA3>10 million, and the UK’s NHS signed a contract for drugs this week after an international tender.
The purpose of the trial is to evaluate the potential of PrEP by collecting extensive clinical evidence on its targeting, administration and treatment implementation.
“This significant new intervention should complement and intensify the already diverse and increasingly effective means of preventing HIV,” says Stevens.
“This is yet another significant achievement in the more than 30-year struggle to address humanity’s greatest health challenge.”
“This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV,” says Deborah Gold, director of the National AIDS Organization.
"If PrEP is properly targeted to those who need it and are at risk, it can have a reversible effect on the UK HIV epidemic.
From September onwards, those at risk will be given a drug, funded by the NHS, which they can decide on independently without the need to negotiate with their partner. It has a potentiating effect that will greatly improve the lives of many people.
This was a welcome news.”
“The most important thing now is to ensure that the trial is quickly launched across the country and that no one from the risk group is excluded from it,” says Ian Green, director of the Terrence Higgins Foundation.
“The PrEP drug to be used in the trial has been acquired, and we will soon be able to protect tens of thousands of people at risk from HIV infection.”
“The start of the PrEP trial is a welcome event that lasted for several months in vain because of the government’s slowdown,” said Sharon Hodgson, the shadow government’s health minister.
“We have evidence that the drug can have a reversible effect on our work to prevent HIV and to stop the spread of this menacing disease.
The experiment helps us to better understand the real benefits of the PrEP drug.
Now it is important that the trial be launched as soon as possible across the country, so that we can protect those who are exposed to HIV and get a step closer to the situation where the spread of HIV in society has been successfully stopped."
Quality of life: the middle floor and smart interior design solutions have made the small Earl's Court apartment a spacious home
Ex-banker Joanne Leigh moved from Knightsbridge’s residential area to a smaller apartment in Earl’s Court in 2014.
The apartment is located on the first floor of the elegant house of Queen Anna’s era. The success of the renovation is explained by the fact that Joanne has not yet packed her tents and changed.
“I used to live with my ex in a much bigger apartment in Knightsbridge,” Joanne says.
“I’m looking for something similar in my price range.
I went here for a home screening and noticed that the rooms were as tall as my apartment at the time.
I immediately loved it and made an offer the same day.”
Since then, the 90-square-foot apartment has undergone a complete transformation.
Joanne wanted more storage space, as well as an intermediate floor, so that the room height could be exploited.
“I wanted space, big windows and a lot of light.
They were my demands,” he said.
He hired Erfan Azadi from the Duck & Shed design office in Notting Hill to take advantage of the nearly four-metre-high room space and create an apartment that would not only be a repair and sale site but a home.
The height of the room was not enough for two duplicate rooms, so the challenge was to build an intermediate floor where it could stand.
The solution required creative thinking from Erfan.
"The steel structures are quite complex.
The premises had to be arranged overlapping so that they did not need to be sliding.
The structures had to be modified in such a way that the height is just right for them, both above and below."
Erfan was able to place two full-story rooms with fascinating details overlapping the space.
On the middle floor, the Retrouvius copper-crossed window opens into a stylish living room.
Mirror furniture, silver accents and Serge Mouillen vintage lights create a distinctive style.
The use of mirrors brings theatricality, feel and light to the room.
The mirrors at both ends of the short corridor make the corridor seem longer than the real one.
The mirror in the middle of the kitchen is like a window with a view of another room.
The mirrored furniture at the entrance has a storage space for Joanne’s studios and glassware.
Elegance adds to the fact that the kitchen can be hidden when not in use.
Kitchens equipped with folding doors are not a new solution,
but Joanne's kitchen is unique in that the door is raised in the same way as the garage door.
“It took a bit of design,” Erfan says of the steel-reinforced cut-out MDF door.
"It is balanced, that is, it slides very easily when lifted to its place."
With the rational use of the space and the design of the storage space, Joanne received 16 extra squares, a second bedroom and an even better floor solution.
“When selling an apartment, the surface area decides – or the valuation of the property,” Erfan says.
"In principle, the real estate agent walks into the apartment and calculates the price based on the surface area."
In Joanne’s apartment, the surface area was increased using high-quality materials that bring luxury to the room.
"The inhabitant is in contact with the materials of the apartment, and the emotion of the apartment is born partly on the basis of them," Erfan says.
"No one is attached to electrical wires running through the walls.
They are important, but not in the same way.”
Joanne’s apartment is an example of how good design and extra space can make a basic apartment exceptionally fine.
It can also happen that you no longer want to move out of your home.
Pregnant Princess Sofia Radiated in Her Summer Looks

This is the last representation event where Sofia represents before she is born.
His estimated time is in September.
For the evening of the event, Sofia had chosen a beautiful pastel blue dress, which landed beautifully.
The style was crowned by large earrings and a stylish little bag.
Pastel blue dress beautiful princess.

He raises us with sweet chili
In the summer of 1996, a house appeared on Lahti Square, where Thai food was sold.
The Lahti did not dare to taste, but walked past.
At home, food was sold by Panya Suamsri-Penttilä, among friends of Panja.
He didn’t know very much about Finland, and the Finns didn’t know Thai at the time.
Since the people did not dare to go to eat, Panja offered free tastings.
In this way he taught the Gulf people to eat Thai food, with a spring meal at a time.
Taste the country, he said.
I was hooked from the valley.
I went more and more, eventually every day.
In the summer of 1997 Panja opened her Thai restaurant in Lahti.
It had two small tables, I think there were less than 20 customer seats.
He taught us not only to eat Thai food, but also to sit next to the wind.
When you are hungry and places are limited, you cannot leave an empty chair between yourself and the guest.
After a while, we got to know each other better and became friends.
Finally, I sat at a table with a dictionary to learn Thai.
Two years went by the side of the hall, but then the restaurant had to change because the spice dishes themselves were said to smell too much in the hall.
A new place was liberated from the end of the trade hall.
There's room.
Now we jurors can again sit at our own tables, only in the most busy times we have to shyly ask the guests if there is room next to it.
You know your client.
He is told where he has been and who he has seen.
He knows what food everyone is eating.
He has seen how the stages of customers’ lives are changing and the food society is changing.
She remembers what kind of man I went to eat my first spring carrots with.
She remembers me thin and fat, and remembers what I was like when I was young.
It’s nice to go to lunch a little later than the others, sit in my own place next to the kitchen door and exchange belongings with the Panja hanging on the stove.
Food is not the most important thing we get from him.
He has taught tolerance and internationality with a sweet chilli sauce.
He has opened our minds and our hearts in addition to our tastes.
Nowadays many people speak to him in Thai - thanks to the growing popularity of tourism.
I admire Panjaa.
Even though he's had a hard time, he's always kind.
He's busy.
On the restaurant job, he goes in mushrooms and black.
Last week, the restaurant celebrated the hardest of two decades.
We, our customers, got a strawberry cake for dessert.
Without alarm or attention went this significant day, at work.
173 ISIS Terrorists Who Were Ready to Strike in Europe Discovered at Underground Base
From the beginning of the year, the security authorities received a list that was significant for counter-terrorism work.
The list contains the data of more than 170 ISIS fighters who are ready to attack Europe.
According to the German newspaper Die Welt, there are a total of 173 persons and the document contains not only their personal data, but also pictures of each person.
More than 130 of the persons on the list are Iraqis, but six Europeans are also included.
They come from Belgium, the Netherlands, France and Germany.
The rest are from Tunisia, Morocco, Jordan, Tajikistan and Saudi Arabia.
Evening Messages told me about the list and a couple of weeks back.
Now the location of the list and the information contained in it have been refined.
According to the newspaper, special forces of the Iraqi army found the terrorists' personal data and photos containing a list while investigating the terrorist organization's underground base in Mosul.
The U.S. intelligence agencies assessed the authenticity of the papers and forwarded them to Interpol.
The list was distributed by Interpol to all European country security authorities in May.
The background was the fear that something big and serious would be planned in the Western countries by terrorists after the collapse of ISIS in the Middle East.
According to Die Welt, the list includes not only the names and pictures of all people, but also their date of birth, invented aliases and information about the person’s country of origin.
The list also lists the specialties of terrorists.
For example, 27-year-old Sami J. from Germany on the list is nicknamed Abu Assid al-Almani, or German.
He is said to have left Germany in 2012, travelling first to Egypt, then to Libya and later through Turkey to Syria to join the ISIS lines.
A suicide bomber is written as a specialty next to his picture.
There is no specific information about the fate of the man.
A total of around 6,000 ISIS fighters have left Europe, whose fate is uncertain.
Man drowned beneath the surface in Helsinki’s Tokoinstrand
According to interviews with the rescue team, the man had wanted to show that he could swim.
You can save a drowning soul.
On Thursday, an underwater man was rescued in the Tokoinstrand in Helsinki.
According to Ville Estlander, firefighter of the Helsinki Rescue Agency, the situation was quickly over.
The person was found underwater about 15 minutes after the announcement.
The lifeguard found her under the surface, Estlander says.
The Salvation Army received a notification after half past four in the afternoon.
The person was delivered to the hands of first aid.
Estlander says he was about a 50-year-old man.
Based on the interviews, the man had wanted to show that he could swim.
The situation in Tokoinstrand is over.
Estlander congratulates the authorities for their cooperation with the Border Patrol and the police.
This was a task led by the Border Patrol.
The divers were also very well guided by the locals.
The situation was over in 15 minutes.
The man was rescued from the water along with the Border Patrol and the police.
Two passenger cars crashed in Eura - nine people in cars, three seriously injured
There were a total of nine people in the cars, the rest of whom suffered minor injuries, says the firefighter.
Among the injured are both men and women.
The accident occurred at a three-way intersection at four o’clock in the day.
The collar happened when another car turned behind the warning triangle in front of another car, says a firefighter.
According to the rescue agency, the intersection area has an 80-kilometer speed limit.
The brothers are fighting for more than $500 million in real estate
Two brothers argue about Victoria's largest real estate venture, worth more than $500 million, a dispute linked to a family business founded by their Italian family 40 years ago.
Colin De Lutis, former president and developer of the Carlton Football Association, lives in the value area of Toorak, just three houses away from his younger brother Paul. The younger brother has brought the dispute between the brothers to the highest court.
Paul has wanted to leave the family business since 2014, but the divorce is bitterly disputed.
Together, the brothers and their mother Anna own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, and the family began accumulating property when they bought a store on Collingwood Smith Street in 1973.
The family founded the Westco Jeans store there, which expanded into a 160-movement chain.
The chain was sold for $85 million in 1999.
The money was used for real estate, and the family now owns offices, real estate development areas in Brunswick and Sorrento, and apartments in the Gold Coast and Mt Buller, as well as suburban shopping malls.
Colin owns about two-thirds and Paul owns about a third of the company's assets, according to an agreement with his late father. Paul describes his father as "the family's bearer and central figure".
According to court documents, the property distribution ratio means that Colin owns properties worth about $316 million and Paul owns properties worth about $176 million.
Paul is not satisfied with the distribution of property and money.
“I think Colin left the best properties for himself in his proposal,” Paul wrote in his first sworn testimony to the court in 2015.
The case was first dealt with in the Supreme Court on Friday after several conciliation firms.
The brothers are now also debating who is in charge of the existing business. Paul claims that Colin has excluded him from the business.
Colin says the claim isn't true, and he's accusing Paul of mishandling some of the properties.
Colin writes in one of his first sworn evidences that he would like to find a solution to the matter.
"According to our Italian traditions, family is the most important thing to me," Colin said in a statement.
The cost of the case is constantly growing. There are hundreds of pages of optional statements, emails and reports. The case is being investigated by consulting companies like Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, as well as the best and most experienced lawyers in the country, such as Allan Myers.
Anna De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who founded milk bars and taverns in the late 1950s. In the early 1970s, they bought a trade from Brunswick.
They were used as collateral for the family's purchase of a property from Collingwood, where Colin founded the family's first jeans store.
Colin says he founded the store "in the last years of high school when Paul was still a child (about 10 years old)".
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, wanted to transfer the properties to their sons.
“Luigi often said that he didn’t want the brothers to go to court,” Anna wrote in her statement.
The family's two other sons, Mark and Luke, are no longer involved in the De Lutis Group business, according to Colin, Mark received $10 million and Luke $26 million when he left the company.
According to Paul, Luke and Mark are “disagreeing with the economic conditions of their departure.”
Colin has maintained a low profile, although he is a former board member of the Australian Football League and television star Eddie McGuire's best friend according to his 2015 biography.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Luti and their lawyers on Friday.
Colin replied, saying in his text message that he could not comment on the matter correctly, because it is being dealt with in court.
“It’s very sad that my brother Paul has decided to challenge me in court and to take our family’s name to court,” he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote to the court that he had tried to agree to his brother’s demands.
"Our father would not have wanted us to argue this way," Colin continued, saying he hoped the matter would be resolved.
On Friday, hope seemed to be gone.
“Our case will be resolved in court in the near future,” Colin wrote.
Trump’s new chief of staff will restrict the president’s media use.
Others have tried and failed to do so.
Maybe John F. Kelly will finally make it.
First of all.
The White House’s new chief of staff intends to restrict President Trump’s media use and news coverage so that the boss doesn’t get in trouble so often.
Journalist Josh Dawsey reports:
“When the White House’s new Chief of Staff John F. Kelly met with the executive on his first working day, he spoke about a key problem he intends to solve: he intends to restrict President Donald Trump’s access to information.
“Kelly told White House employees that all information – both printed and heard at news conferences – must be conveyed through him because the president makes better decisions when he gets good news.”
Kelly’s words make sense, but others have also tried to limit Trump’s media use and failed.
President Trump has a decades-long relationship with television – and as president he still watches a lot of television.
“If Presidential candidate Trump got nervous about the unfair news, it was worth showing him that the compassionate media dealt with things more equitably,” Sam Nunberg, an advisor to Trump’s campaign, told Politico magazine in February.
Politico reporter Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that “according to six former campaign workers, it is essential that Trump’s use of Twitter is controlled by a steady stream of praise in his personal media.”
Yeah, okay.
But it’s ridiculous to say that Trump’s use of Twitter would have never been in control.
Maybe these campaign workers know something that we others don’t know – maybe Trump’s tweets would have been even louder without their efforts.
We’ll probably never know what kind of messages Trump left to send.
If his staff has been able to prevent him from causing problems even a few times, their work has not been in vain.
However, no one has been able to consistently prevent Trump from causing a riot.
The problem is in part because there are competing groups in the White House that are trying to run their business by giving Trump information that supports their view. That information can be reliable – or not.
In May, Politico wrote that the advisers were intentionally giving the president questionable information.
Reporter Shane Goldmacher said of one case:
“Trump’s current and former employees say he can be immensely outraged by the magazines that criticize him – especially if they tell about harmful data leaks. Then he has to find out where the data came from.
That was the case in late February, when someone maliciously gave the president a copy of a news story on GotNews.com, founded by online provocateur Charles C. Johnson, accusing assistant chief of staff Katie Walsh of several White House leaks.
Johnson had been permanently removed from Twitter due to harassment, and he had previously circulated false accusations and later revoked them. He also did not provide any concrete evidence.
Despite this, Trump had started the case after reading about Walsh's staff."
Goldmacher added that the then chief of staff Reince Priebus and the White House’s staff secretary Rob Porter had “attempted to implement a document management system for Trump.”
And what was the result?
Kelly tries the same thing three months later.
Perhaps he turns out to be a more effective leader than Priebus, but Trump is still his own impulsive self and his assistants are still running their own business.
These unchanging facts make Kelly’s mission very difficult.
Neymar signs five-year deal with PSG
Brazilian star Neymar has signed a five-year contract with the French football club PSG, according to the AFP news agency.
Earlier on Thursday evening it was reported that Neymar's representatives had paid a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>222 million buy-out price for the Spanish league footballer FC Barcelona.
Neymar's contract with Barcelona was therefore dismantled and he was free to move from Paris to PSG.
Huima’s transfer of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>222 million is the largest in football history.
The previous record was at Manchester United, which paid <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>105 million last summer for the Frenchman Paul Pogba.
PSG is owned by the state-owned Qatari company Qatar Sports Investment.
The association is chaired by former tennis expert Nasser al-Khelaifi.
Neymar is expected to arrive in Paris on Friday.
Succeeding author Raija Oranen whispered in the hypnosis of alcoholism and flight attendants: “I’m fine with my life”
From the TV series The Time of the Rose and Pure White Laundries, the famous successful writer Raija Oranen just spent her 69th birthday.
Hypnosis helped Raija Ora.
In addition to writing, five of the children like their grandmother, Raija and her husband Jyrki gave up the Spanish sun and Fuengirola's apartment after 18 winters.
At first they sold their house, but now in the spring they also left the rental apartment.
To the light and the sun, away from the old circles, Raiyan once took depression and alcoholism, from which he has survived.
The external nature is also 20 kilograms lighter.
The weight went down when the serotonin drugs were discontinued, they were antipsychotics.
I was helped with alcoholism from hypnosis, which also worked with fear of flying, I won it.
I have been without alcohol for 15 years now.
Alcohol takes a person, the radiant writer says openly.
Raija and Jyrki Oranen have been on the same journey for over 45 years.
I can do better than ever.
Raija and Jyrki Oranen, who have worked in the tourism sector, have been together for more than 40 years.
I got married, and it was going to get married in two weeks, Raija laughs.
Such a drama queen she has always been, she has stopped her life for that, Jyrki laughs at his wife.
Oranen, who made a measurable writing career, only remembers the good 44-part series Pure White Laundries, which touched and moved the Lama era in Finland.
I finally decided to become an industry in the clothing industry of the Raikka family when I read Liisa Seppälä’s 50th anniversary interview on a plane.
I was a sewer’s daughter myself, my mother also had a clothing business and I sometimes act as a model, recalls Oranen.
The story and story of the series changed the attitude of the Finns towards entrepreneurship.
Anita Savelain’s research and the thesis revealed it, Oranen says.
Raija Oranen lives as a writer for an active time, she has many scripts under work - ideas for hundreds.
Circulars returned across the river to the "millions' alley"
The wealthiest homeowners in the West Midlands are once again at the barbershop with persistent tourers who managed to cross the river the municipality needed and return to the nearby fields of the houses.
The villagers parked their 20 caravans near a street called the Millionaire Street in Solihull.
They were driven out of the area in May, but they managed to cross the cemetery that the municipality needed to pass through, bringing children, horses and an army of vans.
The roundabouts managed to cross the crossing point, which had been left unprotected because of the path.
Angry residents have accused the municipality of Solihull of "complete inability to solve the problem".
An unnamed resident tells us that on Monday evening, the tourers arrived from Bentley Heath, where they had thrown passers-by with stones.
“The money has to be tough to act because it seems to be completely incapable of solving the problem.
The tours were here in May, then they left but came back again.
There will be more tonight, and probably more today.”
The resident said that the city of Birmingham had solved the problem by blocking access to the parks.
"I live on Streetsbrook Road, and it's frustrating to pay municipal tax when the municipality can't do anything about it."
According to another anonymous resident, it is ridiculous that the roundabouts returned so soon after they were driven away.
"There are more of them than ever, and they have even brought a horse to the park to graze."
According to a Solihull municipality spokesman, the municipality is aware of illegal camping near Streetsbrook Road. "We are taking the necessary legal action with the Solihull police to urgently evacuate the campers as soon as possible.
For the collection of evidence, it is very important that as many locals as possible report to the police of disturbing or criminal activities.
It will help to create an overall picture of the situation for legal proceedings."
Angry people surrounded Portugal’s garbage dump
In Portugal, the men who made a forced smuggling on a crowded beach have been questioned in court today.
As a result of the crash, two people died yesterday.
Two men who flew the plane could be charged with the death penalty.
At the very least, he could be sentenced to 16 years in prison in Portugal.
The men’s small plane had to make a forced landing yesterday on the beach of Sao Joao da Caparica, near Lisbon, due to a technical error.
Hundreds of people were on the beach at the time of the event, some of them fleeing the run-off plane into the water.
The plane crashed into a 56-year-old man and an 8-year-old girl who died immediately.
The plane first hit a man who was on the back of the plane.
Immediately after, the plane got up and when it landed again, it hit the child’s head, Filipe Janeira Jornal de Noticias told the newspaper.
The little girl who died was on the beach with her parents.
The girl's parents weren't hurt.
On the beach, the occupants surrounded the small plane immediately after the wreckage in anger.
The girl’s father and other people went to the plane and began to hit it, the case was reported by Celia Rocha Correio da Manha.
The man called the pilot a criminal, he was desperate.
It's a miracle that no more people have died.
Two men on board the plane were not injured in the crash.
The Finnish star, who tragically lost his foot, won the World Cup gold again: "Without the accident I wouldn't be a world champion"
On Wednesday morning, Matti Suur-Hamari celebrated Finland’s World Cup gold banked in a slalom at a competition held in Big White, Canada.
Grand-Hamari also won the World Cup gold in the previous races.
In total, three World Cup titles have already been won.
Incredible World Championships!
Twice the gold was treated, with a pretty good heartbeat drawn, the phone reached the Great Hamari rejoiced.
A 30-year-old cyclist thanked his coach and very successful preparation in Finland.
According to Grand-Hamar, the number of contestants in the species is growing all the time.
The whole paragliding board has grown and evolved a lot lately.
Differences are shrinking, and there are a lot of new calculators involved.
You always wonder if there's going to be a black horse.
Every race seems to be a different winner.
Suri-Hamari lost his second leg in a motorcycle accident in 2009.
From a young age, he had been downhill with his friends, and the accident did not lead to the desire to get on the slope.
Sometimes I wonder what my life would be like without that accident.
But my attitude has always been that there is no point in complaining.
The cards are played, which is shared, the Great Hamari emphasizes.
It would be cruel to claim a serious accident and loss of limb as a blow of luck, and Grand-Hamari does not.
But he turned to the harshness of the difficulty.
Yes, I would say that the situation has turned into a win.
I wouldn't be a three-time world champion without an accident.
Before the accident, the 23-year-old Suur-Hamar’s largest ski resort was already slipping.
Towards the summit, the real work started only after the accident.
When I was young, I trained with my friends, and we always got excited about X-Games.
But they were distant dreams that skyrocketed over time.
After the accident, I somehow found myself there at the start of X-Games.
I couldn't have imagined it in advance.
I was 23 years old and I thought this would be a really long life if I stayed here to be sad and sad.
I decided to pull the chains around my neck and start working.
I'd say I've done pretty well.
Laskija was very pleased with the selection of Leo-Pekka Star as the athlete of the year.
The four-time Olympic winner received his prizes in the sports industry held in January.
According to Grand-Hamar, the victory of the Star is an important signal to the Paralympics.
It was a really big deal, and the win was definitely deserved.
This will also open your eyes to the world of sports.
When is it time to launch the Sportsman of the Year campaign of the double world champion Matti Suri-Hamar?
We'll see you in time.
I'm trying my best to succeed.
Yet the Greater Hamari has not conquered all the peaks of his desire.
There will be a big goal next year.
A year later, the Paralympic Games will be held in South Korea.
We’re going to go get a medal!
The majority of Syrian refugee youth do not believe they will return to their homeland permanently unless the war ends and ISIS leaves the country
A Voice for Young Syrian Refugees surveyed the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
Syrian refugees to bake bread at a refugee camp in Jordan.
The majority of young Syrians do not believe they will return to their homeland permanently.
According to them, the end of the Syrian war and the departure of ISIS from the country are the most important things that should happen so that they can return to their homeland.
The Trump administration does not see a change in the Syrian conflict.
The communications agency chain Burson-Marsteller investigated the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees in an international study.
Burson-Marsteller has been studying the opinions and attitudes of young Arabs for nine years.
This year, A Voice for Young Syrian Refugees surveyed the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
In February-March 2017, a total of 400 Syrian youths aged 18-24 years, half of whom are women and half are men, responded to the study.
Half of the interviews were conducted in Jordan and half in Lebanon.
According to the study, more than half of young Syrian refugees do not believe they will return permanently in the future.
42% of respondents may think they are returning home and 4% could not say.
According to the study, young people’s decision to return home is most affected by the ongoing war in Syria and the presence of ISIS in the country.
Nearly half (47%) consider the end of the war to be the most impactful factor on permanent homelessness, while a quarter believes that the most important factor would be the departure of ISIS from the country.
Only less than a tenth of the respondents consider the most important factors to be the improvement of the economic situation or the departure of Bashar al-Assad from Syria.
Military action alone does not resolve the conflict.
The young Syrians were asked what was the most important factor in resolving the conflict.
The majority believe that the end of the war is more essential than the resignation of President Bashar al-Assad.
The fair quarter sees al-Assad’s presidency as an obstacle to a peace treaty.
Almost half feel that political and military solutions are needed to end the ongoing conflict in Syria, which is now under way.
The only way to resolve the conflict through military action is to believe only a fair quarter.
The majority of Syrian refugee youths see ISIS’s power weakening in the past year, while a fifth feels it has strengthened.
According to the respondents, the most important thing in the fight against ISIS, and generally against terrorism, is that the media would give people information that ISIS has nothing to do with Islam.
Almost as many took military measures as a priority as well as the reform of education and training.
One tenth of fairness believes that the most important thing would be to create better paid jobs for young people.
When asked about the Trump administration’s impact on the Syrian conflict, 66% of respondents believe that the conflict will not change during the Trump administration.
Nearly one in four believe the Syrian conflict will worsen during the Trump era.
The views are divided into two on whether the participation of Russia and Iran has improved or exacerbated the conflict.
Monty Widenius spends half his time encoding to keep the web in order – using the database he developed, for example, Wikipedia and Google
MariaDB is developing the "world's fastest growing" open-source database.
The main product of MariaDB, founded by encoder entrepreneur Michael "Monty" Widenius, does not cost users anything and can be developed by any suitable programmer online.
For example, Google and Wikipedia are users of the Finnish database, but they may not be paying customers.
With the help of databases, huge masses of data remain in order and quickly available.
For example, if you use Linkedin, Twitter or Booking.com, they use the MariaDB or MySQL database.
“All information that is not in the image format comes from the database, and the images are also linked there,” Widenius explains.
Widenius, the technology leader at MariaDB, spends about half of his time coding.
A man who works remotely from beautiful people helps ensure that the internet works smoothly.
Widenius developed the world’s most popular open source database, MySQL, together with David Axmark from Sweden.
In 2008, technology company Sun bought MySQL for $1 billion, and a year later, software giant Oracle sold Sun for $7.4 billion.
When the Oracle trade occurred, a large number of MySQL developers announced they were leaving.
“They didn’t want to work for Oracle, who didn’t make a sure promise about the future of MySQL,” Widenius recalls.
At this point, he had already founded a company that started to develop MariaDB.
He didn't want his life's work to die.
I hired 20 best developers from Sun and made sure that the continuity of the code was secured by the same friends who created it.
Because MySQL is an open source database, MariaDB was able to develop its own branch.
I just had to change the name.
The Foundation was established to monitor the freedom of development of MariaDB code.
"These assurances were not made during MySQL," Widenius retorts.
While many have heard of Wideni and MySQL’s billionaire trade, few Finns know anything about MariaDB.
“In recent years, our growth rate has been around 50 percent per year,” says Kenneth Paqvalén, Chief Financial Officer, MariaDB.
The growth-focused MariaDB is not yet making a profit, and Paqvalén is a sparse figure in the company.
To that extent, he reveals that in the current financial year, MariaDB estimates that it will receive orders for EUR 20 million.
Because the database is free, the company has developed services around it that corporate customers are willing to pay for.
MariaDB also helps in the exchange of databases, which can be more than a year of work if the customer has used a closed database.
Switching from MySQL to MariaDB will succeed in an instant because they are versions of each other.
Among other things, the Spanish operator Telef<0xC3><0xB3>nica and the largest bank in Southeast Asia, DBS, are paying customers of MariaDB.
The most popular cloud services, such as Amazon’s AWS, Microsoft’s Azure, Alibaba Cloud, offer their customers MariaDB.
At the same time, MariaDB automatically distributes to new users in distribution packages for Linux operating systems where MariaDB has largely replaced MySQL.
Although we are a small company, we have connections to the biggest gamers.
“Our customers include the world’s largest telecom operators, gaming companies, banks and even someone’s central bank,” Paqvalén said.
The database market is still dominated by giants like Oracle, Microsoft, IBM and SAP with their closed databases.
For Oracle, MySQL is a modest side business compared to the company’s traditional closed database.
Although the largest database companies have lost their market share in recent years, according to research firm Gartner, players like MariaDB are still null, albeit rapidly growing, in terms of turnover.
In a $50 billion database market, open-source databases don’t even go up to a billion.
However, the weight of open source cannot be measured in money alone, as most users pay nothing for these software.
Research firm Gartner predicts that in 2018, companies will already develop more than 70 percent of their internal applications on open databases.
In addition, more than half of the old databases would then have been exchanged for open, or at least the transition would have started.
Large companies don’t get new customers because most people choose open source as their next choice.
This has led to the fact that license fees for commercial databases have jumped into the clouds.
Companies want to make as much money as in the past with a smaller number of customers,” Widenius reflects.
Since the exchange of a closed database is difficult, the majority of customer companies have ingested price increases obediently.
“There are a lot of customers who are really hard to switch to because their old apps and others are stuck in a closed database,” Widenius says.
He still believes that the size of the customers is coming to a close.
When license fees rise each year, the customer moves to an open source database sooner or later.
The price is 10-20% of the previous, and the service is better, because the customer can easily switch to another database if they want.
Moreover, many companies are faced with major system changes as they move their operations to cloud services.
At the same time, many exchange database software.
Last spring, MariaDB received a EUR 25 million loan from the European Investment Bank (EIB).
It was the largest growth funding ever granted by the EIB to the Nordic countries.
The company has approximately 115 employees worldwide and is now aiming to hire more.
One of the reasons for the EIB's financing was MariaDB's impact on public IT procurement.
The company has public sector customers, for example, in the UK and Germany.
The public sector in Europe pays billions of euros annually from databases.
“Many countries want to move to open-source solutions and use tax money more effectively,” Paqvalén said.
Widenius is embarrassed about how money is wasted in Finland, for example, on closed healthcare systems, when open systems are cheaper and the subscriber is not at the mercy of one software company.
Some say that open source is an ideology, but I think it’s a better way to do the code.
The community helps and does something that it does not invent or is not able to do.
The 55-year-old Widenius is one of the best known open source promoters of another Finnish developer, Linus Torvalds, Linux.
Widenius helps other companies to develop functional business models over open source.
I still give 4-5 talks every year around the world on this topic.
Italy tightens its stance on NGO rescue vessels
Italy has warned NGOs that rescue refugees on their ships in the Mediterranean not to continue their activities unless they commit to comply with the new rules on their activities.
"If NGOs do not commit themselves to the new guidelines, it is difficult to see how they could continue their activities," Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with La Stampa newspaper in Turin.
The warning came a day after the Italian authorities seized the ship of the German aid organisation Jugend Rettet, whose crew was suspected of cooperating with human traffickers who promoted illegal immigration.
The aid organisation, which has only been operating for a year, refused to comment on the detailed charges against prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
"Saving lives is and will be the most important thing for us. We are very sorry that we are not currently able to operate in the search and rescue area," the organization said in a statement.
“We can only assess the allegations after we have gathered all the necessary information and are able to assess the situation.”
The Italian authorities had been monitoring the Youth Rettet from the Iuventa platform since October.
The crew is suspected of taking on board a boatload of refugees directly from human smugglers who re-entered the boats.
One such case is alleged to have occurred only a few kilometres off the coast of Libya, according to the prosecutor's document, the contents of which have been published by the Italian media.
The crew is suspected of threatening the Italian Coast Guard, which oversees rescue operations in the area, and is believed to be motivated by the passion to help.
According to the guidelines, ships such as Iuventa must be accompanied by an Italian police officer who oversees the operation.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue activities have so far agreed to follow the guidelines: Save the Children and the Maltese MOAS and the Spanish Pro-Activa Open Arms,
He said on Thursday that he considered the new rules to be unnecessary but acceptable because they do not cause "significant changes or obstacles" to the organization's rescue activities.
Among those who refused to follow the guidelines is the Nobel Prize-winning Doctors Without Borders organization.
Mr Minniti, for his part, said that the rescue operations have seen a sharp drop in the number of migrants arriving in Italy in recent weeks, which he considers to be evidence that the efforts to strengthen Libya's coast guard and cooperation with local mayors are starting to produce results.
"In recent days, light has begun to appear at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.
He revealed that he plans to continue discussions this month with the Libyan mayors on economic development projects and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of refugees leaving for Europe.
Seasonal worker suspected of killing his open partner in Enontekiö, suspect found in the field - case for prosecutor
The alleged crime took place in Kuttas, Enontekiö, last December.
According to police, a 36-year-old Czech man is suspected of killing a 26-year-old Scottish ex-husband.
It has been said in the past that both were seasonal workers.
Police have also said that the suspect fled with two dogs to the field after his act.
The man was found frozen in the ground, and he did not resist when caught.
The case must be brought before the court within a week.
The case may be pending before the District Court of Lapland in August.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Robert Hardy is Dead
British actor Robert Hardy has died at the age of 91.
The actor's death was announced by his family on Thursday.
Born in 1925, Hardy began her acting career at the age of 24.
During his long career, he also acted in films and television.
Hardy is particularly remembered for the role of Minister of Magic Cornelius Toffee in the Harry Potter films and his veterinarian role in the television series All Hairy Friends based on the book of James Herriot.
The BBC's most popular series was filmed in seven different ways.
Michelle Carter Sentenced to Prison for Inciting Suicide
A Massachusetts woman has been sentenced to two-and-a-half years in prison for texting and phone calls allegedly instigating the suicide of her boyfriend, Conrad Roy.
Michelle Carter, 20, is serving 15 months in prison and five years in prison.
Carter was sentenced to death in June. His boyfriend Conrad Roy committed suicide on July 13, 2014.
"My family is broken," Conrad's father said at a hearing on Thursday.
"My son was my best friend."
Carter filed an appeal to the court and was allowed to wait for the application to be considered in custody.
He was threatened with a 20-year sentence, but according to his lawyers, both Carter and Roy were suffering from mental health problems.
Carter, dressed in red pants and a cream-coloured blouse, listened to the hands of his judgment with a cry of the cross-eyed look on the ground.
"His actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
"He decided on Conrad's life to improve his own.
He has not taken responsibility for the crime,” the prosecutor continued.
"He hasn't shown any regret."
According to Carter’s lawyer, the case was due to “the shocking circumstances that Carter deeply regrets.”
Judge Lawrence Moniz, however, believed that Carter's "life or maturity level, even mental health problems, had no significant impact on his actions."
The prosecutor read Conrad's mother Lynn Roy's statement in which she said, "It won't be a day before I die of my beloved son.
I want her to be proud of me and how I am going to cope with this, and I will try my best to comfort her sister in this pain that we will always bear."
Conrad's sister Camdyn Roy told the court that she "only" the idea that she will never see her brother's wedding and not be an aunt to her children.
"It's painful to lose a person who's been in my life every day since I was born. That pain never eases," Camdyn said.
The case appears to be a precedent, as there is no law in the state of Massachusetts that incitement to suicide would be a crime.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead in a car in 2014.
The incident attracted national attention when it was revealed that Carter had incited his boyfriend to commit suicide in his text messages.
"Hop yourself, jump off the roof, kick yourself. I don't know, there are many ways," Carter wrote in many of the messages he had sent to Roy during the two weeks before his death. Roy was on vacation with his family at the time.
Just before Roy's suicide, Carter wrote: "You have to do it, Conrad" and "You just have to start the generator, and you're free and happy".
Judge Moniz said that Carter sought attention on Roy's death and ordered that Carter not benefit from the case by giving interviews.
The case has shared the views of experts.
Only a few have defended Carteria. One of the defenders is Amanda Knox, 30, who was convicted of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007. She was released two years later.
The Los Angeles Times published Knox's opinion paper, in which he states, "Michelle Carter needs sympathy and help, not prison."
NATO Secretary General: Russia's Worst Intervals Since the Cold War
NATO and Russia have clearly deteriorated, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said on Thursday.
Stoltenberg blamed Russia and its position in the Ukraine conflict.
“I think you can say that NATO’s relationship with Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the Cold War,” Stoltenberg said in an interview with CNN.
After the end of the Cold War, we hoped that we could seek close cooperation with Russia.
But especially since the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the continued instability caused by Russia-Eastern Ukraine, NATO’s relationship with Russia has deteriorated considerably.
According to Stoltenberg, however, NATO is still committed to act so that tensions do not exacerbate.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we can engage in a political dialogue with Russia in order to avoid an exacerbation of the situation and a new Cold War.
Before Stoltenberg’s remarks, US President Donald Trump was able to say that the U.S.-Russia relationship was at a dangerously bad level.
Trump called on Congress to thank the countries for their poor balances, which approved new sanctions against Russia last week.
Audi makes changes to 850,000 diesel engines due to a backlash experienced by car manufacturers
The day before Audi’s announcement, BMW offered to update the software of more than 350,000 cars.
The head of BMW said the company believes that "there are more reasonable alternatives than driving restrictions," referring to European cities, including BMW's home city Munich, which are considering restricting or banning the use of diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will make changes to more than three million Mercedes engines to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies spoke about the recall.
European car manufacturers have strongly marketed the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States in order to achieve their CO2 emissions targets.
Nitric oxide emissions from diesel engines are considered to cause cancer and asthma.
Installation costs for emissions-neutral devices are rising, making it difficult to price cars competitively.
German car makers are closely monitored, and Chancellor Angela Merkel has been accused of sympathy with major car companies and of ignoring problems.
Companies are trying to avoid Volkswagen’s mistakes. Volkswagen installed in cars devices that reduced emissions in accordance with the regulations in tests. In normal driving, the emissions were higher.
Several Volkswagen executives have been indicted in the United States, but their actions are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of the engine development division of Audi, responsible for thermodynamics, was arrested in Germany.
Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian, so he can be extradited to the United States for possible trial.
Earlier this year, Audi was involved in a criminal investigation into Volkswagen. The authorities suspected that Audi had installed a system in its cars that could circumvent European emissions requirements. The charge was based on a similar investigation in the United States.
Audi’s investigation could significantly weaken Volkswagen’s position: the luxury car manufacturer’s share of Volkswagen’s profits is disproportionately high.
Venezuela’s vote begins with fraudulent investigations, large-scale demonstrations
According to the company, the number of voters reported by the Venezuelan authorities is at least one million more than the number of actual voters.
This is an unprecedented opinion from a company that has no role in the election results, National Electoral Commission President Tibisay Lucenan told reporters.
Maduro says the crisis is over
In a controversial vote in Venezuela on Sunday, the legislature was elected to amend the country’s constitution.
The opposition has strongly criticised the vote and has organized an amendment to it against the protests.
The opposition against Maduro has postponed its own demonstrations so that they would be ongoing at the time of the appointment.
According to the newspaper El Pais, the country's national security forces began on Wednesday evening local time to take over the country's parliament building.
The task force is to ensure the security of the appointment.
Climate change threatens the lavender of Provence
Lavender has become a symbol of the Provence region of southern France, but is now threatened by climate change.
Lavender had been reduced due to drought and disease-carrying insects. Scientists and farmers are feverishly trying to find a solution to the problem.
"Lavender is directly at risk in the Provence region because it has suffered from the effects of climate change in recent years. With them, the rainfall levels have decreased significantly, especially in the autumn," says CRIEPPAM, a research institute specialising in agriculture in Provence.
"This will shorten the life of the lavender.
In addition, the drought has brought to the area a lot of small cartilages that spread microbacteria."
The bets are high.
Lavender oil attracts tourists, and it is also a highly sought after ingredient in perfumes and cosmetics.
“Instead of petite stars and large flowers, we now have smaller flowers that are poorly developed or deteriorated or missing altogether,” Chaisse says.
“In other words, there are fewer parts that contain essential oil.”
The solution is sought by enhancing irrigation, slowing the evaporation of soil moisture and injecting plants with a mixture of clay and water. In addition, drought-resistant varieties are developed.
Reporter's murder reveals growing threat in Mexico
The once-a-week edition of the Riodoce newspaper usually meets on Wednesdays to discuss how the newspaper deals with the most recent cases related to organized crime, corrupt authorities and an endless drug war in Sinaloa.
Today, however, security is being debated because of the recent tragedy.
Journalists have been asked to change their daily routines.
Two experienced journalists are discussing which one is safer: to leave the children at home or to take them into the delivery that was hit by a grenade in 2009.
Security experts have written three words on the front panel of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies.
They ask journalists for names for each group. No evidence is needed, observations and insights are sufficient.
The table contains the names of drug dealers, politicians, businessmen and journalists who are suspected of being on the payrolls of government or drug cartels, criminals who make the news of chaos in Mexico life-threatening.
Violence is uninterrupted, and journalists are increasingly the targets of attacks. According to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, at least 25 journalists have been killed since President Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto took office in December 2012. Under the protection of the federal government, there are 589 acts of statehood.
The latest victims are Javier Valdez Cardenas, the founder, journalist and source of inspiration for Riodoce.
“The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist,” Valdez wrote in one of his many books on drug abuse.
He is deeply needed, even though he is present everywhere. The facade of the Riodoc building is covered by a huge picture where Valdez shows the middle finger. The photo reads: "Justice". Thirty-year-old journalists Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez are dressed in a t-shirt with a velvet.
The meeting is held less than two months after Valdez's death, and the reporters discuss their shared trauma, nightmares, insomnia and horrific fears.
In 2010, a federal prosecutor’s office was set up to deal with journalists’ cases in particular, but the Committee for the Protection of Journalists has so far raised only two charges.
Journalists’ killers are rarely brought to justice, as are thousands of murders per year related to drug trafficking and organised crime, and very few are brought to justice.
Riodoc reporters intend to continue writing about Sinaloa’s violence, even though they are heartbroken and the situation is even more dangerous.
According to Ibarra, the security meeting is of little use, because the killers are not known and there is no hope of justice.
"This meeting is, frankly, a waste of time," he says.
“We can’t trust anyone as long as we don’t know the reason for the incident.”
Valdez left Riodoc's delivery in the state capital of Culiac<0xC3><0xA1>n on the morning of May 15, 2017.
He had driven a red Toyota just a few blocks away when two men stopped him and forced him out of his car and shot twelve shots. The amount is supposedly related to the magazine name: Riodoce means twelve rivers.
The shooter drove off Valdez's car and crashed it some distance away.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He was left with a wife and two adult children.
Rumors are moving quickly and roaming freely in Culiacan.
However, Valdez's death is silent.
Sinaloa has been one of the bloodiest battlefields in Mexico since Guzman was arrested last year and deported to the United States in January.
On the streets of Sinaloa, one or more people are shot to death every day, and the cemetery features decorating two-storey cemeteries of drug parons that are larger than many homes.
In a coastal state, it is “peaceful” when only one cartel controls ports and drug trade routes to the United States.
Although Valdez was well aware of the dangers of his work, the founder and leader of Riodoc, 60-year-old Ismail Bojorquez feels guilty for not being able to protect his friend.
He believes two mistakes led to Valdez's murder.
In February, Riodoce released an interview with Damaso Lopez, who leads a rival group that goes to war against Guzman's sons.
Guzman’s sons could be outraged: customers suspected of being gang members bought every issue of the magazine as soon as the magazine arrived at points of sale.
Another mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave the country after another newspaper published in the same case became the target of the attack.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder is considered a turning point in the violence against journalists.
He had survived so many that his friends and colleagues could no longer fear for him.
He had spent a long career at Noroeste, when he decided in 2003 to establish five colleagues in Riodoc. The shares of the newspaper were then sold for $50.
In Sinaloa, “it was impossible to do journalism without dealing with the drug problem,” Bojorquez says.
Over time, the magazine began to feel brave and honest about its stories, and its sales and advertising grew.
Journalists appreciated the opportunity to publish a hard-class investigative journalism without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by things in the journal that no one else dared to publish.
Eight years after its founding, Riodoce won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Award for her innovation in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez was awarded the International Press Freedom Award by the Committee of Journalists for his courage to follow the story of Mexico’s drug trade without sensitivities.
He openly admitted that he was afraid.
“I want to be able to carry on with my life,” he said while receiving the reporters’ committee’s award.
Drug trafficking is a “lifestyle” in Sinaloa, Valdez said in an interview with Rompeviento TV last October.
“The reporter must take on a task that falls to him – or play a fool.
I don’t want anyone to have to ask me where I was when death was bathed here – why didn’t I tell you what was going on?”
Riodoc staff miss Valdez – a joker who cursed like a port worker. They miss a friend who always got hugs and advice. They miss a teacher who knew how to cope.
They trusted him in his routines.
He always wore a Panama hat.
He went to the delivery bar opposite El Guayabo and always sat at the same table.
Now they ask if the routines have come to his fate.
The death of a colleague has also led them to think about how they can best do their job and stay alive.
“Criminals don’t like it if we deal with their women and children in our cases and their clean business, their secret drug-trafficking gigs.
They were left out of things,” Bojorquez said.
It meant, at best, a strong self-censorship and self-defense.
Confidence in your instincts.
If you feel that everything is not in order, you have to stay away.
The problem, according to Andres Villarreal, a Riodoc reporter, is that "the impression can be misleading, and so it was in Javier's case."
The old rules no longer apply in Sinalo, nor do they apply in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states with dangerous networks: attractive smuggling routes, weak agencies and corrupt authorities.
The operating environment is constantly changing.
Mobile phones were not allowed to be brought to the room where Riodoc’s security training was held, and a few days earlier it had become apparent that only spyware sold to governments had been tracked by activists and journalists in Mexico.
Outside the building, two police officers had sought shelter in the shade of the tree from a 40-degree melting pot.
The state government had ordered them to guard the Riodoc facilities, which are located in a four-storey building in the middle-class area of Culiac<0xC3><0xA1>n.
Some of the reporters half-counted whether these two policemen were among the 50 percent that the governor of the state considered unreliable.
It had been months since the reporters had visited a mountainous countryside dominated by drug gangs.
For this week's issue, Riodoc's delivery planned three main things.
The brother of Julio Cesar Chavez was killed in Sinaloa.
The newspaper also intended to reveal that the government’s use of money had focused on the governor’s hometown.
In addition, a group of people were kidnapped at one of Culiacan’s most expensive restaurants, just a block from the prosecutor’s office.
There was no official information about who had been abducted and how, so we had to proceed with caution: everyone in the city knew that the restaurant was in the interest of both drug dealers and authorities.
The journalist learned from public documents that the restaurant was registered in the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), and that the PRI has dominated Mexican politics at all levels for almost a century.
Its governors have recently been accused of corruption in cases that have received much publicity.
Villarreal asked the journalist to write about previous cases in the same place. In one of them "El Chapo" Guzman's son managed to escape and avoid the army raid.
A few months earlier, readers would have known they were getting reliable information about the kidnapping from Valdez's column.
“In the past, we would have known what had happened,” says 46-year-old Villarreal, who has been nicknamed “El Flaco” Thin because of his slim body structure.
"Now all connections to our data sources are gone."
Valdez’s office has been transformed into a warehouse where signs and stickers are kept against journalists’ persecution. Newspaper workers have been given a new, unexpected task: they have become activists for freedom of the press.
Journalist Miriam Ramirez took a few posters the next morning as she left for a demonstration in front of the local prosecutor’s office, which was again responsible for the murder of the journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michigan three days after Valdez's murder.
After the disappearance, a burnt body was found, based on DNA tests carried out by the authorities, which is Adame.
Journalists have started to protest louder across the country, with "SOS Press" texts appearing on the footpaths and buildings.
Today, Director Bojorquez is in Washington, D.C., where he is trying to get international support to investigate the Valdez case.
The day after Valdez's murder, Ramirez met with the governor of Sinaloa and accused the authorities of spying and killing journalists for telling the truth.
He has since been asked to be removed from the government’s affairs because he is concerned that his hatred cannot be objective.
Valdez had repeatedly stated that in Mexico, journalists were surrounded by organised crime, the permissible authorities and the indifferent society.
In his last book, Drug Journalism, Valdez writes that drug gangs kill journalists, but they are also killed at the behest of politicians and security forces in agreement with organized crime.
According to the Articulo 19 monitoring group, more than half of the attacks on journalists last year were carried out by police and authorities.
“In Mexico, people are silenced by killing,” Ramirez says.
Murder has a paralyzing effect.
No one will forget the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
His body had a message signed by the Zetas cartel: "I'm here for my writing."
Next to his cut-off head was a computer keyboard and headphones.
Some of the newspapers have decided to stop, such as the El Norte newspaper in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the March murder of the correspondent Miroslava Break.
Some continue their activities, such as Nuevo Laredon El Manana, even though its leader was assassinated in 2004.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez published a message on its front page to drug cartels: "What do you want from us?"
Some of the journalists have fled their states or all over the country.
It's a tough decision.
It's hard to find a job in a kidnapping, and you have to be careful all the time.
Sometimes criminals search for a journalist in their hands, as apparently happened to photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered with four women in an apartment in Mexico City in 2015 three months after he had fled Veracruz.
For those who continue their work, every day is full of dangerous decisions.
Ibarra, who was once to become a poet, admits that writing about the drug trade is scary.
“I became a journalist because Mexico is on its way to hell,” he says.
Some time ago, Riodoce journalists sat in front of the delivery at midnight on a beer walkway when the latest issue of the magazine had been completed. Suddenly, their phones began to be a colorful message.
In the shooting between rival gangs and security forces at a beach resort in Mazatlan, 19 people were killed.
The war accelerated, as was promised in the cartel messages found in the area.
Reporters posted the news on Riodoc’s website from the footpath on their smartphones.
The front page was redesigned the next day.
The sirens rallied nearby – again a shooting attack.
Bojorquez looked at the police guarding the supply:
If they were afraid, they covered it very well.
The publication of Riodoce continued the tradition of the newspaper’s murdered founder under this massive portrait, where the man shows the middle finger to the entire Sinaloa.
Bojorquez says he can't even consider quitting. "How could I shut down the magazine when our trainee asked us to go out on the street to do the thing the same day Javier was murdered?"
The Hannu Mannisen Olympic project started with a huge backlash - "Hard Place"
The celebrations of Hannu Mannisen, who turned 39 in April, were short, as the professional pilot began preparations for the Olympic season.
However, the training period began disastrously when Manninen became ill with the flu.
It started with a long period of illness that lasted almost five weeks.
The month of May was almost completely sick.
First there was the flu and finally there was a childhood disease like ear infections, which I had to eat an antibiotic course.
I was able to do only 10% of the planned exercises.
I can't remember the last time I was so sick.
It was a hard place when I did not get the exercise, Manninen tells Ilta-Sanom.
Test result collapsed
The 2007 World Champion was granted a training permit only in the second week of June, as was evident in the KIHU Rolling Test at the Race and Top Sports Research Centre on 12 June.
In the test, the athlete skis with roller skates on a carpet, the speed of which is increased every three minutes.
After every three minutes, the carpet stops for about ten seconds, and the tester takes a sample of lactic acid from the athlete’s fingertips with the needle.
Last autumn I spent 32 minutes on the carpet, but now I only stayed 28 minutes.
The fire was on the wall, Manninen said.
In a better direction
After the initial rights, Manninen says he remains healthy.
I have done a variety of calm aerobic exercises, with which I have tried to normalize the body's metabolism.
It’s a really good five-week period.
We also had a one and a half week holiday.
I also went to the cottage with my family.
In the last season Manninen participated in only four World Cup competitions before the Lahti World Cup home runs.
The best result was seen immediately in the opening race, when Manninen rose to 18th in the top skiing.
Guidance draped
The team’s head coach, Petter Kukkonen, has made a training and competition plan up to next February.
We are now looking for a different rhythm compared to the last season.
After the first half of the race, Ruka will have three World Cup weekends.
In December, it is planned to participate at least one weekend of the World Cup, perhaps in Ramsau.
By the end of January, plans would still be in Seefeld.
Hopefully after that the name will be found on the Olympic team list, Manninen says.
The Pyeongchang Olympics would be the sixth Winter Olympics for Mannis.
Now the most important thing is to stay healthy, the nummelian underline celebrated in the 2002 team gold competition in Salt Lake City.
The Dinosaur Protects His Enemies by Masking
At first it looks like a scary statue.
Now, researchers have revealed the first results of a Canadian miner’s discovery of a hornet-sized creature that was so well preserved that experts call it the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs.
It had survived so well that researchers were even able to determine that its finned skin was reddish-brown and had a “problematic past”.
According to the journal Current Biology, it is the best-preserved armored dinosaur of all time and the world’s best-preserved representatives of its kind.
The recently discovered fossil is the nodosaurus, which lived in the middle of the interstellar period 110–112 million years ago.
Scientists consider this astonishingly well-preserved fossil to be a truly significant discovery.
According to the National Geographic magazine, armored vegetarians are the best-preserved fossils of all time.
It was discovered on March 21, 2011 in the Suncor Millenium mine in North Alberta, Canada, and was discovered by a miner named Shawn Funk.
He hit something that didn’t seem to be a natural part of the surrounding rock, and decided to examine his findings more closely.
The fossil found in the rock was sent to the Tyrrell Royal Museum of Paleontology.
For six years, the beast was excavated from 1,100 kilograms of land.
The results of hard work are now visible.
“If you close your eyes, you can almost believe that it was sleeping,” says science writer Caleb Brown, who works as a researcher at the Royal Tyrrell Museum.
"It remains in the history of science the dinosaur Mona Lisa, one of the most beautiful and best-preserved dinosaurs.
The skin’s research found that the meat-eating dinosaurs were probably a significant threat to this vegetarian, even though it had a tank and it resembled a walking tank.
Its red-and-white armor masked it from predators, and it was also protected from a darker and lighter coloration, which is still present in many animals.
According to experts, it was thus better able to interfere with its environment and avoid its enemies, the larger dinosaurs.
The 110-million-year-old nodosaurus rose to prominence in May and is now on display at the Royal Tyrrell Paleontological Museum.
Researchers have named it Borealopel after Mark Mitchell, a museum engineer, who was part of a team that took more than 7,000 hours to excavate the dinosaur.
Nodosaurus has survived so astonishingly well that Mitchell and an international team of researchers have been able to determine the patterns and shape of its body fins and armor.
They found that it was still protected in the animal world by a common coloration where the body is darker on top and lighter below.
The detection was still a surprise, because the Borealopel is much larger than the current animals with similar coloring.
It can be concluded that the meat-eating dinosaurs captured it to such an extent that evolution favored hiding as a means of survival instead of fighting.
The animals of today, for example, have a similar coloring for peacocks, seraphim and armadillos, which are considerably smaller and therefore easier to catch, suggesting that nodosaurus was also seriously threatened.
“The capture of a large, heavily armored dinosaur tells how dangerous the dinosaurs of the Aegean were,” Brown says.
A chemical analysis of the organic compounds in the nodosaurus fins reveals that its skin was reddish-brown.
Scientists continue to study the nodosaur to draw conclusions about its life, including the contents of its intestines to find out what it ate at its last meal.
Scientists believe that it fell into the river when it died and drifted into the sea, where it sank on its back to the bottom of the sea.
Alberta was then as warm as today’s Florida, and the rivers and seas were likely to extend much further than today’s.
“This nodosaurus is really significant because its Finnish leather has been preserved and it has also been preserved in its original three-dimensional form,” Brown says.
"That's why it looks almost the same as in the early joining season.
It doesn’t take a lot of imagination to figure it out: if you close your eyes a little, you can almost believe it was sleeping.”
It was an era of theropods, giant two-legged, meat-eating dinosaurs.
Even though their king, Tyrannosaurus rex, millions of years ago, may have captured this armored dinosaur by his powerful predecessors.
Tyrannosaurus rex’s predecessors included, for example, the Acrocanthosaurus, a monster about 11.5 meters long.
The latest findings of the Nodosaurus scientists have been published in the journal Current Biology, and they believe that the Borealople was rinsed into the sea after his death and mummified into the mud.
It was discovered on March 21, 2011 in the Suncor Millenium mine in North Alberta, Canada, and was discovered by a miner named Shawn Funk.
According to the museum, it is the best-preserved armored dinosaur in the world with its skins and armor from the skin to the hip.
The nodos were an average of five meters long and weighed up to 1,300 kilograms.
Two-and-a-half-centimeter peaks rose from their levels.
Scientists believe that this armored vegetarian passed through present-day Western Canada until a flooded river transported it to the open sea.
Its armor has been preserved in a seaside tomb with small details.
Its fossilized remains have survived so well that its leather remains in the shell plates of the armor along its skull.
Michael Greshko wrote in the National Geographic magazine that such a preservation is "as rare as a lottery win.
The more you look at it, the more amazing it feels.
Its shell plates still have fossilized leather on them.
Its right forefoot is on its side, five toes up.
I can also count the fins on its base.”
How did an activist learn to answer the question: to whom belong the streets?
Brittany Ferrell was deeply shocked on August 9, 2014.
He had arrived in New York a day earlier from his home in St. Louis and sat on the bed of his Airbnb residence browsing Facebook on his phone.
Then he noticed a message from his classmate:
"The police just killed an 18-year-old boy, and his body is still on the street."
Confused, he noticed that no one else had posted the same information on his feed, which is why he closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
There were numerous retweets from <0x40>TheePharoah on his timeline.
The username belongs to a St. Louis-based rapper who tweeted in real-time about Michael Brown's death after a white police officer shot an unarmed 18-year-old black Brown in Ferguson, Missouri.
The user had also posted a picture of Brown’s dead body on the street, where it was left for four hours.
"This is unbelievable," Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new to him and to his community.
When he returned to Twitter later that night, it was reported that people were gathering on Canfield Drive.
Users posted pictures of police slingshots and screaming people, as well as a man claiming to be Brown’s father, who was carrying signs that read: “Ferguson’s police just killed my unarmed son!”
Ferrell followed a real-time video where the police were standing in front of the protesters with a dog barking.
He also says he saw a video where another police officer fired his gun and shouted, "I'll kill all of you... animals."
“This is not normal,” Ferrell recalls.
“It wasn’t a murder we’re already used to and could be said to be typical.
At that time, I felt cold colors.
I was angry and I was crying.”
He booked a return trip home the next day.
The plane landed at 11 p.m. Ferrell went to fetch her six-year-old daughter from her father and decided that they would go to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson in the next nearly three years has been made documentary film "Whose Streets?". It premiered in cinemas on August 11, 2017.
The film is a story of survival and expression of mind, love and loss, and strength and resilience from the point of view of the local people who went to the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell drove towards Ferguson in a floral dress and a matching crown with it, they again had a conversation about, "what it's like to live black and under what conditions." They had talked about it countless times before that morning.
"Do you remember when I told you how blacks have had to fight for the things they believe in?" Ferrell recalls saying to his daughter.
"We're going to Ferguson because the police killed an 18-year-old boy, and that's not right."
"I couldn't be without my daughter," Ferrell said later.
"The events of this day are... the culmination of the events of the past.
My daughter has the right to know and grow up.
He must gain the capacity for activism and organization, but he must also feel the different layers and circumstances of the experience of living in black, and he must know what we need to do in order to free ourselves.
Fortunately, although I’ve been able to protect her from blatant racism, she’s still the same as other black girls.
I feel like I'd hurt him if I protected him from reality."
Their first stop in Ferguson was South Florissant Road, located opposite the police station, which became a camp for activists as they waited for information about the case and finally learned that no charges would be brought against the police.
From there, Ferrell and his daughter went to help a local entrepreneur who made lunch packages.
They packed lunches in bags and distributed them to the protesters.
Ferrell gradually began to treat activism in a new way.
“My activism changed completely after August 9th,” she says. While studying at the University of Missouri in St. Louis, Ferrell was the president of the Association of Nursing Students of Minorities. At that time, he focused on food law and health disparities in black communities.
“I didn’t have any experience with organizing.
Somehow it just happened.”
A few weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, the documentary’s assistant director, in an evening demonstration.
Folayan said that he and photographer Lucas Alvarado-Farrar "would simply tell us" what was going on.
Ferrell was suspicious and asked, "Do you really want to tell me what's going on, or do you want a story that you can use?"
The reason for the suspicion was the innumerable times when people, usually whites, appeared in the local community, who only wanted to benefit from its difficulties and resilience.
"We had heard that those who were born and raised in Ferguson did not have a common voice," Folayan said in a recent interview.
Folayan had already contacted Deputy Director Damon Davis, who is known for his activism with the sentenced to death.
Davis's involvement prompted Ferrell to join the project along with six other locals, and the shooting team followed the events in the years following Brown's shooting.
“This is not a document where someone speaks to us or speaks on our behalf, but we speak,” Davis says.
“The most important thing for me was how the local people are portrayed in the movie, because I’m portrayed in the same way.”
According to Folayan, it was not intended to focus on Ferrell's experiences because it was intended to show that the popular movement "is not about a charismatic leader but about a community."
That’s why the documentary reveals surprisingly private aspects of Ferrell’s life, such as falling in love and getting married.
“I felt pretty naked,” Ferrell laughs as he tells me what it felt like to see the movie for the first time.
"But I understood that this work and the human portrayal of blacks require a certain vulnerability."
In addition, Ferrell’s story once and for all brings the role of black queer women back to the center in the wider Black Lives Matter movement.
The movement originated on social media (<0x23>BlackLivesMatter) after police shot a black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, two of the three founders of the movement identify as queer identities.
“The leadership of black queer women has kept the whole movement going,” Ferrell says. “It’s because we have to constantly fight on many fronts.
Black queer women have had to endure everything."
Folayan agrees: "The movement is indeed run by black women, among whom are many queer women."
However, he emphasizes that Ferrelli was not selected for the documentary "intentionally" because of his queer identity.
"He got the energy moving," Folayan says.
"But it's no coincidence that she was in the front line. Black queer women live at the cutting edge of a lot of things, and they have a lot at stake.
His energy is transmitted from the white cloth.”
The news crews have left Ferguson for a long time, but the relationship between the community and the police is still tense.
Ferrell has two and a half years to go on parole, and he was convicted of blocking highways at a demonstration.
His description of the socio-political climate of his homeland is short and concise: "Mistakes."
Yet he still relies on the slogan he learned outside on the streets of Ferguson three years ago:
“It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
Our duty is to win.
We need to love and support each other.
All we can do is lose our necks.”
Appropriate uniformity: artist creates portraits of Chelsea Manning’s DNA
At the Fridman Gallery in New York City, faces are hung in the middle of the exhibition hall – white, black and brown faces, between which one can see more closely the uniformity between them.
These 30 works are portraits taken by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg, based on DNA samples taken from Chelsea Manning’s possum and hair.
Manning sent samples from Fort Leavenworth prison, where he served a 35-year sentence, and was convicted of leaking classified diplomatic bullets to WikiLeaks.
Dewey-Hagborg's A Becoming Resembling exhibition was opened on August 2, 2017.
Its background is two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg and Manning. Dewey-Hagborg combines technology, information technology and art in his work. Manning is a trans woman and pioneering diver, whose prison sentence was reduced to a third term by Barack Obama.
Dewey-Hagborg analyzed Manning's DNA algorithmically and based his genetic data on 30 portrait images, which are a sharp, albeit somewhat theoretical, view of the modifiability, multiplicity, and causality of the DNA data underlying the interpretations.
Chelsea Manning, whose birth name is Bradley Edward, has openly stated that she has identified women since her break-in, and was found guilty of 20 crimes in 2013, including spying, computer fraud and theft.
There was only one picture of Manning sentenced to prison: a grainy, black-and-white selfie, in which the troubled Manning sits in the driver’s seat in a car with a platinum-colored wig on his head that became his trademark.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg had the popular Stranger Visions project, which he implemented in 2012.
It was there that he created portraits on the basis of criminal records, obtained DNA data, such as cigarette smokers and chewing gums, and created images of what the people in question might have looked like.
Then the artist received an email from Paper Magazine.
"They interviewed Chelsea Manning and needed a picture of their story," Dewey-Hagborg told a news conference.
You couldn't come to Manning's place and you couldn't take a picture of him in prison, so the paper contacted Chelsea and asked if he'd be interested in taking a DNA photo of Manning.
The artist and his imprisoned muse suddenly became fellow correspondents, writing to each other for a couple of years.
They even co-produced a comic book called Suppressed Images, illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which depicted a future in which the president would have eased Chelsea's conviction and allowed him to watch the exhibition.
In fact, Obama shortened Manning’s sentence just days after the comic book was published, a lucky coincidence after seven years in a civil war prison.
It’s also impressive that the exhibition is opening right now, as Donald Trump is waging his own war against data breaches and transgender soldiers and is inventing new ways on Twitter to reinforce the powerful two-phases that he was actually supposed to mitigate.
Dewey-Hagborg believes that “everything has its purpose.”
On the wall of the gallery there is an artist's statement and underneath it Manning's large inscription, where the point of the surname i is the heart. In his statement, the artist demands an end "to an automatic division on which sex, race, sexuality and culture are based".
On the opposite wall is Manning’s DNA cycle: a long line of letters C, G and A written on a pencil.
With this combination of 200 letters – or nucleotides, as the artist uses the scientific definition – Dewey-Hagborg wants to illustrate how similar we are, at least in our biology.
"I hope my exhibition will help people understand that we are the same from our genes and that the genetic data is very personal and open to interpretation," says Dewey-Hagborg. The exhibition also features his 2007 video work Spurious Memories.
"DNA tells innumerable stories. Here are 30 of them."
The final work of the exhibition is in his own room: a page from Manning and Dewey-Hagborg's comic book.
That's where Manning's character rises out of prison like King Kong, holding a megaphone.
"If they make you quiet, they've won," the photo reads.
"Never shut up."
“The text is from a letter I received from Manning,” says an artist from Philadelphia.
"It's so impressive that I'm still getting cold colors."
Unlike the comic book, Manning has not yet seen the exhibition. When Manning arrives, he was greeted by his own genetically based faces as a crowd of demonstrators in the middle of the showroom.
It is intentional, like everything else in this exhibition: for example, Manning’s DNA cycle is written with a pencil at a height equal to its length (157.5 cm).
“The growth was on the wall before, but I wanted to bring a crowd of people to them,” says Dewey-Hagborg.
"I wanted to portray the mass movement that Chelsea gave birth to, which was also behind his release."
Northwestern University professor and Oxford University employee are being sought for murder suspects
Police say they have launched a national search to find a Northwestern University professor and Oxford University employee who are suspected of stabbed to death in a chicago luxury apartment.
Cook County court documents show that on Monday arrest warrants were issued against Wyndham Lathe, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56, suspected of involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau. Arrest warrants have been issued against the first-degree warrant.
According to documents, Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after being stabbed several times.
According to a local report released by the Chicago Police Department, the body was found on July 27, 2017.
Police alerted to the Grand Plaza apartment building found a victim who had several cut wounds in his body.
According to the authorities, Cornell-Duranleau was found dead at the scene of the incident, and the shooting is being investigated for murder. Police are actively looking for two suspects.
Lathem has been an assistant professor of microbiology and immunology at Nortwestern University since 2007.
In an emailed statement from Alan K. Cubbage, the university’s vice-rector for social relations, Lathem is now administratively free and has been denied access to Northwestern University campuses.
“This is a criminal case that the authorities are investigating, and Northwestern University is helping with the investigation,” Cubbage wrote.
Warren works as a senior financial assistant at the University of Oxford.
The statement, sent by an email from a University and Somerville College spokesperson, said: “We have been in touch with the police in the UK and we are ready to assist the U.S. investigating authorities in every possible way.”
In addition, the statement said Warren's colleagues were shocked and hoped that he would give up.
The head of the Chicago Police Department, Anthony Guglielmi, said he called on the suspects to seriously surrender to the authorities.
"The police have an idea of their whereabouts, and we are constantly focusing our searches," Guglielmi said.
Guglielm said local, regional and national authorities were assisting in the search for suspects.
He told police that a call was received from the host of the Grand Plaza building, which had received a vague hint that something had happened in the apartment in 1008.
The police described the appearance at the scene as horrifying.
According to Guglielm, it is unclear whether the victim was murdered the same day or earlier.
He said security cameras revealed that Lathem and Warren had been in the building.
"We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi says.
The Grand Plaza management team issued the following statement to residents: "The police are currently investigating the course of events and the background of the victim, as well as possible motives, including the possibility of domestic violence."
Man threatens to explode Islamic bookstore and "kill Muslims" in London
"I'm not anti-Muslim, I'm Catholic," he told police.
Moffatt must perform one hundred hours of unpaid social service.
The 39-year-old man was convicted of threatening to blow up an Islamic bookstore in London and "kill all Muslims".
According to the Independent magazine, David Moffatt was convicted, among other things, of gross harassment.
According to police, the bookstore staff alerted them to the scene on May 23.
According to the staff, the man had "deplored to blow up a bookstore and kill Muslims".
The suspect left the store after the threats.
Moffatt was arrested when he called the police about the threat.
The threat was not related to the events of the bookstore.
Authorities noted that Moffatt had dressed in the same suit as the suspect in the bookstore, a police spokesman said.
“I’m not anti-Muslim, I’m Catholic,” Moffatt told police in interrogations.
As a punishment, the man must perform one hundred hours of unpaid social service and pay <0xC2><0xA3>620, which is about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>690 in court costs and <0xC2><0xA3>85, which is about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>95 in compensation for the victims.
According to a Scotland Yard reporter, several hate crimes are left unreported.
"We will complete actions under WADA roadmap in the near future" – Deputy Prime Minister of Russia Vitaly Mutko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko has said that Russia will soon complete actions under the roadmap of the World Anti-Doping Agency WADA to restore the powers of the Russian Anti-Doping Commission RUSADA.
"Some of the roadmap measures have already been implemented, and RUSADA was given the right to design and test in cooperation with the UK Anti-Doping Commission UKAD.
The WADA road map has been updated in these respects," Mutko said on Thursday.
The Deputy Prime Minister commented on the second part of the road map of WADA, which sets out the conditions for the restoration of RUSADA’s powers. The second part of the road map was recently published on the organization’s website.
According to Mutko, it does not contain anything of concern to Russia.
“Everything has been announced and everything is done.
The results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee and WADA in the near future," Mutko added.
However, one point of the roadmap requires that the Russian anti-doping authorities publicly accept the results of a study by WADA, Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren. McLaren is investigating the state’s alleged share of Russian sports doping.
Mutko said: “The investigation is underway because our anti-doping system has admitted to failure.
All measures have been taken.
There were no national programs, and we cannot admit that which did not exist.”
Mutko’s words echoed the statement of Vitaly Smirnov, chairman of Russia’s independent public anti-doping committee.
Earlier on the same day, Smirnov, speaking to the Russian sports media RSport, admitted that there had been problems in the Russian anti-doping bodies. "We have said several times that the report contains controversial opinions and regulations.
We will not accept the report unconditionally," he added.
WADA ordered RUSADA to end doping control in Russia in November 2015, when the scale of the doping scandal had been revealed.
However, last June it was allowed to design and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and UKAD.
In July, WADA Director Olivier Niggli visited RUSADA's headquarters in Moscow, after which he said the organization was on the "right track" towards the resumption of powers.
British organisation sceptical of loving innovation for Finns: maternal packaging’s health benefits “there is no evidence”
The British organisation suspects the benefits of Finnish-style maternity packages.
Among other things, the BBC and the Guardian say that the Lullaby Trust, a group fighting covert deaths, prohibits the use of its own pamphlets in maternity packages distributed in the UK.
The distribution of maternity packages to all pregnant women will begin this month in Scotland.
Also in England, the packaging is distributed in some areas.
According to Lullaby Trust, there is no evidence that the maternal package would reduce the risk of hidden death.
Concealed death means an unexplained sudden death of a baby.
The Lullaby Trust is an expert in the safe sleeping of a child by the UK health authorities.
We no longer allow you to pack our official leaflets into them because it would make you understand that we recommend this product, the organization announced.
Finland has one of the lowest infant mortality rates in the world, only two deaths per thousand births.
According to Lullaby Trust, Finland’s good reading is the result of many different reasons, such as a small number of teenage hardships.
The fact that there is a box for every family there may be one factor.
However, it cannot be said for sure, said Francine Bates, CEO of Lullaby Trust.
We are concerned that maternal packaging will be marketed as products that reduce infant mortality and hidden deaths.
Maternity packaging is a Finnish invention and has been given free of charge to all mothers in Finland for 80 years.
The package includes a variety of accessories, such as children's clothing.
This year there are 53 products in the package.
The packaging itself is a cardboard box in which the child can be placed to sleep.
According to the Scottish Government, the boxes it distributes meet all safety standards.
Lullaby Trust says that there is no safety standard for cardboard boxes as a sleeping place.
According to Lullaby Trust, packing may be the best option for sleeping if there is no cot or bunk bed available.
The organization recommends to use the packaging only for the day and to stop using it at the stage when the child is able to turn around.
The organization also recommends keeping pets out of the packaging and ensuring that it does not get wet or contaminated.
A vicious bitch escaped from a Japanese zoo
A Japanese zoo staff is looking for a turtle.
The giant tortoise has surprised the staff at its speed and has already run for replay within two weeks.
The turtle escaped from the Shibukawa Zoo in Okayama, western Japan, on Tuesday morning.
Security cameras revealed that the slut left the zoo through the main entrance.
It doesn’t die right away because it eats the grass around the zoo, but we’re very worried,” said Yoshimi Yamane, who works in the zoo.
The 35-year-old male is female, weighing 55 kilograms and about a metre in length.
Yamane describes the escapee as quiet and gentle.
During opening hours, the butterfly is allowed to pass freely in the area of the targa.
The zoo has not received eyewitness evidence from the turtle.
The last flight of the convoy happened in the second week.
Yamane found the fugitive walking along the road 150 meters from the zoo.
I noticed it on my way to the zoo.
I stopped my car and asked my colleagues for help, Yamane said.
It can walk faster than we could ever imagine.
These startups will help your business avoid Uber’s mistakes
Amy Errett wanted to measure employee satisfaction in her e-commerce startup, but the surveys didn’t work.
The answers were often vague, useless, or even misleading.
Although he asserted that the surveys were anonymous, some of the employees treated them suspiciously.
"The queries were simply not consistent or objective," Errett says. As his hair care company, Madison Reed focuses on e-commerce. The company has 75 employees.
Errett decided to turn to outside help.
More and more new types of HR start-ups have come to market, helping other companies to figure out how their employees can.
They develop and license software to measure employee engagement. Companies can make surveys and target them to specific teams and populations, and provide anonymous notification services to their employees and, in some cases, direct contact with the top management.
“Your own health can be monitored with apps like Strava and Fitbit, but where is Fitbit for companies?” asks Jim Barnett, founder and CEO of the Redwood City-based Glint startup. Glint provides companies with analytics software to measure employee engagement.
Errett has been using Glint's software for three years, and he says he's got a deeper insight into the thoughts and feelings of his employees.
The program can make quick queries and polls for certain teams. In addition, it can create a map that can be seen at a glance, which departments employees are most dissatisfied with and which of the managers have received the weakest ratings. Based on this, one of the reasons why you may have errett
The companies have realized that they need to follow the culture of the workplace so that they do not become the next Uber. Around the transport company has been swaying since a former employee wrote on his blog about a culture where workers are harassed and those who talk about problems are punished.
For startups like Glint, such omissions are an attractive business opportunity.
Corporate governance, regulation, and compliance are a global industry that, according to the Let’s Talk Payments website, could be worth more than $118.7 billion by 2020.
In Denver, Colorado, Convercent is a startup that helps businesses detect and prevent misuse. Interest in the company grew earlier this year when Uber’s reputation collapsed.
Convercent has nearly 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
It also recently signed a contract with Uber.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to make custom surveys, collect answers confidentially in real time, and map problem areas.
In addition, employees may report inappropriate behaviour anonymously by text message.
And if the manager has reason to suspect the negligence, the complaints go directly to the company’s board.
“Public opinion has ruled out the authorities,” said Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercent.
He reminds that if a company treats its employees badly or acts unethically, the consequences can be costly, even if the authorities do not intervene. Consumers can start boycotting the company, and it can also lose employees and become challenged by the courts.
The Ruby Tuesday restaurant chain has more than 25,000 employees at 500 locations. The company has been using Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of operating principles and procedures and are easily connected to the headquarters.
Previously, the practice was that if an employee wanted to report a problem, he had to first find out the phone number or email address with which he was able to make a notification to the head office. Then he had to make an official complaint and hope that it would be taken seriously.
“It was often a scary and unpleasant experience,” says James Vitrano, Chief Legal Officer at Ruby Tuesday, who said it was difficult to keep track of complaints made by employees.
In the past, problems remained hidden from leaders working in another city or state, and now problems such as discrimination, harassment and unfair wages can be detected and addressed more quickly.
“I get a more holistic and comprehensive understanding of the employee’s reality,” says Vitrano, who heads Ruby Tuesday’s risk management team.
"At the same time, we protect our shareholders from employment-related litigation."
According to Quinlan, companies began to take ethics, values, and employee engagement more seriously after audit firm Arthur Andersen collapsed as a result of unethical activity in the Enron scandal.
It was only through social media that the companies realized that they could no longer stop the public disclosure of their dirty tricks.
“Hope was used as a strategy before technology came to the control of ethics,” Quinlan says.
Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service that is charged on a regular basis.
It is a business model and opportunity approved by investors, and both Glint and Convercent are supported by investors.
In February, Convercent raised $10 million in funding from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising a total of $47 million.
Glint received <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners in November and has raised a total of $60 million.
Investments are not a surprise, given the links between companies, corporate culture and venture capital.
According to several studies, employees expect more from their jobs than ever before.
In a competitive market like Piila Valley, good salaries and interesting projects are just the beginning.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted and valued and that they give their time to a truly useful company.
“Employees are more committed to the success of the company if they are comfortable with the company and feel that they are being listened to and that their work is rewarding,” says Nina McQueen, LinkedIn’s Head of Employee Remuneration and Welfare.
Investors get a return when companies succeed. Businesses succeed when employees commit themselves to it.
Third-party analytics tools promise to strengthen employee engagement, so it’s no wonder they’re of interest to investors.
According to the experts on workplace culture, it is important to know the commitment of employees,
but it is useless if no action is taken on the basis of it.
If the company asks for feedback from its employees, it can be considered a sign of a change.
And if the change does not come quickly enough or nothing changes, disappointment can reduce employee engagement.
“If you ask for 4,000 proposals, you have to be ready to have 4,000 conversations,” says Russell Raath, CEO of Kotter International, a business consultancy.
“If the company doesn’t take action, employees start to wonder if they’ve been heard.
and whether their opinions mattered.
If the company doesn’t care about them, why should they care about the company?”
According to Errett, Madison Reed currently conducts staff surveys on a monthly basis and is able to address the problem on the same day as reported by Glint.
When Errett had collected feedback from frustrated employees about the slowness in decision-making and the quality of communication, he was able to make changes to teams and arrange communication training to solve problems.
Ruby Tuesday understands its employees better and hopes that a deeper understanding will help it improve the sustainability of its employees in the long-term industry known for its large-scale employee turnover.
“If a company doesn’t commit to creating a culture of transparency, it will lose employees,” Vitrano says.
“If it loses employees, it also loses customers.
Without customers, there are no businesses.”
In Sweden, a 20-year-old man is suspected of smuggling his naked neighbor, according to the news agency TT.
A woman living in Gothenburg had come home from the shower when she noticed a cell phone hanging out of her window.
According to the woman, the cell phone camera took a picture of the apartment.
The woman who was afraid of the incident had run into another room to dress.
When the woman had arrived to check the situation, the cell phone had first been pulled up, but soon after it was lowered back to the window.
A 20-year-old man suspected of smuggling has admitted to having photographed a woman.
He said he only photographed the woman’s face.
The video on the cell phone had been removed, and the police had failed to return it as evidence.
In the interviews, the man admitted to the crime, but denied he was guilty of a crime.
The man had justified his portrayal by saying that he loves his neighbor "as crazy".
According to TT, the man will be charged with the case.
Teachers demand more delays in autumn negotiations
Wage development cannot be lower than in the export industry, for example, but the difference should be narrowed, OAJ Chairman Olli Luukkainen said on Thursday.
The temporary cut in public sector holiday funds underscores the difference, he notes.
We will not be able to conclude agreements that would not in any way have been included in the review of holiday savings.
In the municipal sector, agreements will only be made when the private sector papers have been signed and the percentages of the increase are clear.
Luukkainen predicts that, for example, OAJ’s working conditions will be agreed in January.
Percentage targets have not yet been revealed.
Luukaienen is also the chairman of the Juko of the general language-trained negotiating organisation.
Luukkainen: Holiday haircut increases earnings gaps
According to OAJ, statistics and forecasts show that the purchasing power of public sector employees is declining while the purchasing power of the private sector is increasing.
According to Luukkainen, periodic holiday money cuts will further sharpen earnings gaps.
In Finland, it is necessary to determine how many pupils per teacher can be
In addition, OAJ points out that the equality of basic education must be ensured, as the disparities between the best and the weakest are constantly growing.
According to the organization, learning outcomes are deteriorating, and the disparities between students and regions are constantly growing.
The Bruins players’ day was prolonged when the NCAA reduced daily practice from two to one
It's almost eleven o'clock in the evening, and a bunch of UCLA American football players have left to talk on the other side of the campus's new training grounds.
Some of them have taken off their shirts, and their backs are shiny in the sand after the first day of the training camp.
For many of them, this few-minute talk stage is a midday break.
After three hours of training, the players at the university will return to their apartment to read the final exams and the next morning they will meet at half seven at the Wasserman Football Center.
"The next three days are going to be tough for these guys," Bruins coach Jim Mora says shortly before Monday's shift to Tuesday.
The University Sports Roofing Association reduced the number of daily workouts from two to one. The purpose of the change was to lighten the workload of players, but it has extended their days – at least until Friday, when the final tests are held.
That’s why UCLA’s first three drills started at over seven o’clock in the evening, and it was difficult for players to find a place in their already full schedules.
Limiting training rates per day means that there are more training days than before. The camp started this year almost a week earlier than last year, and this is the first time in Moran’s six consecutive Westwood coaching season when the exercises are held at the same time as the summer course.
The internships are scheduled to be held 18 times before August 20, when the actual preparation for the opening game of the season begins: UCLA will meet with Texas A&M University in September.
Mora says she supports the NCAA's rule change, even though it made players' schedules even tighter.
“We’re loading them really a lot for three or four days, and it’s very challenging,” Mora says.
"But the players are ready to do the work. They're great friends.
I think it'll be easier when we get to Saturday, and then we'll have more time.
UCLA shuts down exercises from outside the camp, which is not easy given the direct view from the training grounds to the nearby parking lot and the Luskin Center, a flat hotel already bombarded with footballs flying over the safety net behind the paintball.
Bruins players are set to move to the hotel next weekend, but Mora admits that problems can arise during the season when rooms are available to outsiders.
"We have security arrangements," Mora says.
"The concern is that people can book a room and shoot exercises from there to video. It's not an exaggerated concern.
The video depicted in the exercises costs a lot.
But we've got guards there and parking lot.
We're doing our best.
I'm not going to bother my head too much.
We have a plan.”
Freedom in Rwanda
In Central Africa, Rwanda, a presidential election will be held on Friday, which is already being considered a clear winner.
Paul Kagame is officially aiming for his third season, but in practice he has influenced the country's leadership since 1994.
At that time, the rebel group RPF ended the genocide organized by the extremists.
Kagame was the commander of the RPF.
Kagame has been criticized, among other things, for crushing the opposition and restricting freedom of speech.
He has also been accused, for example, of distorting poverty statistics.
For the third term, Kagame will be able to pursue, because the Constitution was changed without the two terms of the presidency.
In Rwanda, however, Kagame is also a truly respected leader.
During his time in Rwanda, social reforms have been made and international investments have flowed into the country.
In addition, Kagame has played a major role in uniting a country divided by genocide.
The success of Rwanda has prompted many Africans to ask whether liberal multi-party democracy is the right model for African states.
However, Kagame has also promised his people more freedom after the land has been lifted to its feet.
Now might be a good time to start.
Facebook fights against fake news by increasing the effectiveness of fact-checking
Facebook plans to send fake news more and more to independent fact-checkers and present the results below the original article, the world’s largest social network announced on Thursday.
The company published a statement on its website that it will begin to use up-to-date machine learning to identify fake news. Possible fake news will be sent to fact-checkers and the results may be published under the original article.
Facebook has been criticized for being one of the biggest spreaders of fake news, and many believe that fake news influenced the outcome of the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
The issue has been raised in a political debate in Europe, where French voters were bombed with fake news before the May presidential election and Germany, which is preparing for the September elections, supports the plan to penalise social media networks if they do not promptly remove hostile content.
In a separate statement published in Germany on Thursday, Facebook announced that fact-checking is being tried in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
“People want to see what stories don’t go through the independent reviewers’ browsing. They also want more background information so they can make more informed decisions about what they’re reading and sharing,” Facebook News Feed Product Manager Sara Su wrote in the company’s blog.
He added that Facebook will continue to test the Related Articles feature and also make other changes to its news feed to reduce fake news.
The Birth of a Comic Book: The Story of a Castle
Little Scotney Castle in Kent County is now known for Squeeze's music video and Margaret Thatcher's hideout from the 1970s and 1980s.
With 700 years of turbulent history behind it, this charming castle in the Bewli River Valley is the subject of a comic book by Jamie Rhodes, an old-fashioned moppies-haired writer.
“I find it great to be able to study the text written by a person who died over 300 years ago,” Rhodes says.
"I feel a personal connection when I hold a letter in my hand."
Rhodes' book, A Castle in England, tells the stories of families living in Scotland from the Middle Ages to the Edwardian era. Each story has been illustrated by a different artist, promising British cartoonist: Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer or Isabel Greenberg.
This is not Rhodes' first book based on archives. In 2014, Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories was released, inspired by documents from the British National Library. The project was emotional.
"I was in tears when I noticed a fingerprint in a letter written by a double agent who worked for Jacobites in the 18th century," Rhodes says.
“It was his fingerprint.
And the letters smell like smoke, because at that time, fire was used as an illumination.
Three centuries later, the scent makes the reader feel that he himself is on the spot.
I love the archives!"
With the support of the National Trust Foundation and the National Council of the Arts in England, the writer, who was drawn to the old documents, was allowed to live in the castle for almost four months, which seemed too good to be true. He admits that he could not have been in the castle without delay for a little longer than he had hoped.
He spent days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, archives, treasures, and rarities, such as hanging hyenas on the walls and bottles of carnage for centuries.
He toured the ruins and ruins of the old castle and talked with foresters, gardeners, and sometimes even artists who painted a book.
In the evening, he "takes a whiskey and begins to write".
Scotney's closer history is fairly unknown, as the castle was transferred to the National Trust only after the death of the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey in 2006.
When Rhodes arrived ten years later, the staff of the foundation was just starting to go through the archives. Rhodes describes that the archives had been kept for hundreds of years by the same method: by taking all the extras to the basement.
The archives contained diaries, letters from the times of the English Empire, and maps of who owned anything. "You could imagine that the landslides are boring," Rhodes says. "However, here the families fought for even one birch.
I thought I shouldn’t let it be already.”
Some of the stories of the book go from the castle to the history of England, such as The Labourer. It tells of a man who soon after the completion of the castle is associated with the English peasant cabinet in 1381.
"The Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex book mentions that there was a riot in the castle in 1380," Rhodes says.
“As an English farmer’s cottage began in the same area, and it came to mind that the rebellion could begin with a riot.
“Maybe these events are related?”
The other stories in the book are closely related to the history of the castle – such as The Priest, a story about a priest who Darrell’s family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
The smuggler tells the story of Arthur Darrell, a 17th-century smuggler who is said to have staged his own funeral by filling the ark with stones (it was noticed years later when his grave was opened).
The Darrels are Rhodes' favorite family in Scotney. "The family's men seem to have been pretty scoundrels, they were constantly in debt and bought things they couldn't afford.
The men of Darrell's family solved their debt problem by marrying wealthy old women, and I see them as handsome guys who knew how to smear heiresses."
Now Rhodes is looking for new writing experiences.
He spent two weeks in Finland writing a comic book about Lebenmäe, a healing plant that operated in the beginning of the 20th century, with only an ovulated plot left.
Scotney Castle has a special place in her heart.
“It was sad to leave,” he said.
"I would not have wanted to go back to this evil day."
Russia's Worst Ever After the Cold War
NATO and Russia have clearly deteriorated, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said on Thursday.
Stoltenberg blamed Russia and its position in the Ukraine conflict.
“I think you can say that NATO’s relationship with Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the Cold War,” Stoltenberg said in an interview with CNN.
After the end of the Cold War, we hoped that we could seek close cooperation with Russia.
But especially since the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the continued instability caused by Russia-Eastern Ukraine, NATO’s relationship with Russia has deteriorated considerably.
According to Stoltenberg, however, NATO is still committed to act so that tensions do not exacerbate.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we can engage in a political dialogue with Russia in order to avoid an exacerbation of the situation and a new Cold War.
Before Stoltenberg’s remarks, US President Donald Trump was able to say that the U.S.-Russia relationship was at a dangerously bad level.
Trump called on Congress to thank the countries for their poor balances, which approved new sanctions against Russia last week.
Vladimir Klitschko quits - rematch against Anthony Joshua will not take place
The long-term heavyweight world champion Vladimir Klitschko ends his career.
Ukrainian Klitshko, 41, announced his decision on Thursday morning.
At the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, Klitshko played 69 professional games and won 64 of the games.
He held various World Cup titles in 2000-02 and 2006-15.
Klitschko lost the last two games of his career.
Tyson Fury hit him in November 2015.
In April of this year, Klitschko met Anthony Joshua at Wembley Stadium and lost after a rough game in the 11th round.
Joshua and Klitschko were expected to face each other in a rematch in Las Vegas in November.
Klitschko, however, found no motivation for the match.
“I intentionally spent a few weeks making a decision to get enough distance from the Wembley match,” Klitschko said in a statement.
I got everything I dreamed of as an amateur and professional boxer, and now I want to start a second career after sports.
I could never have imagined that I would have had such a long and incredibly successful boxing career.
I'm very grateful for that.
Watch Klitshko’s reasoning for his decision from the video.
Klitshko’s manager Bernd Bönte said in a statement that the decision to quit was difficult for Klitshko.
However, he has always stressed that he wants to stop if he no longer has enough motivation.
That is why this is absolutely the right decision, Bönte said.
Klitshko has been dating American actor Hayden Panettier since 2009.
The couple have one child, daughter Kaya, born in 2014.
Klitschko’s older brother Vitali is also a former heavyweight world champion.
In 2008-12, the brothers dominated the championships of different leagues at the same time.
Finnish weather sniper witches conditions: "Get out of the fili"
Seiväshypää Minna Nikkanen has suffered from conditions during the summer outdoor season.
Minna Nikkas has had problems with the circumstances.
The wind and the cold have been taken from a woman's body.
In the London World Cup, there are also unstable conditions.
Minna Nikkanen is talking about the weather.
The conditions have been this summer against the anti-Semitic Minna Nikka.
I wouldn’t want to blame the track, but it was inconceivable that I didn’t get even small pawns to move properly,” Nikkanen said after the race in Innsbruck.
I’ve competed and practiced here knowing how many times and I’ve never experienced such a variable wind in this place,” Nikkanen told Paavo Nurm at the Games.
During this season, it has been really difficult to stabilize the jump, even when there have been such volatile winds in the exercises, Nikkanen said at the Kaleva races.
The weather was on Thursday in London.
It's been quite a challenge to get the technology stacked up - whether it's cold-blooded or what.
It's been cold and windy, and it's been taken out of the file.
There is no point in consuming energy in poor conditions.
He made his debut in the 455th World Championships.
445 is out.
The situation in London is not the same for everyone.
You have to be gentle and wait for a better wind.
The goal is to cross the 460 mark on Friday.
Why don't you go back to training abroad?
It's not necessary.
Last summer, I was in Italy and Germany.
I got a jump in the stack and the technology standardized.
I should have done the same now.
Normally, they've been able to get into the hall to practice, now the hall's closed.
What would it be like to compete?
It's 25 degrees warm.
A little wind goes as long as it's constant.
An experienced ex-officio bored politicians in Yle: “We have no room for division now or for many years”
Despite the positive atmosphere of the economy, Juha Sipilän’s government must keep the ice in the hat and warn of the government’s budget fluctuation with debt, warns Erkki Virtanen, who has been preparing budgets for decades at the Ministry of Finance.
According to him, there is no dividend.
Yle interviewed the retired Virta in 2015 at Ykkösamu on Wednesday.
The state budget for next year is just beginning.
Recently raised proposals by politicians including the raising of the guarantee pension, the taxation of cars and the support of electric bicycles, Virtanen considers as election speeches.
They mainly indicate that the elections are coming to an end, because when 10% of the state budget is financed by additional debt, we have no allocations now or for many years.
“I think it’s even a scam to talk about dividends when debt is taken,” Virtanen told Yle.
He said that all debt is owed to the children.
Virtas has a long history of preparing state budgets: he started in 1978 as Budget Secretary at the Ministry of Finance and then worked as Deputy Head of the Budget Department and Head of Budget.
Lastly, before retiring, he served as Chancellor of the Ministry of Labour and Economic Affairs.
Virtanen noted in Yle’s interview that the now predicted 3% economic growth is likely to be temporary.
All forecasters estimate that this is the peak from which we are already going to go downhill next year, and Finland expects a one percent growth in decades.
Washington to change the rules of the permanent residence permit
President Donald Trump said in a press release that the rules for a permanent residence permit (Green Card) will be amended by a new immigration plan.
The aim is to reduce the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, tighten the requirements for temporary work permits and limit family visas.
The new rules have been proposed by the Republicans, and the president supports them.
The bill will be discussed in two chambers of Congress.
“This law reduces poverty, raises wages and saves billions of dollars in taxpayers’ money by changing the way permanent residence permits are issued to citizens of other countries.
It also reduces chain migration and replaces the current program.
“The new application process will benefit applicants who know English and are able to live by themselves and have the skills that will benefit our economy,” Trump said in a statement.
The wife of the Queen of Denmark does not want to be buried in the same place as the Queen
Prince Henry doesn't want to be buried with Queen Margaret.
In the picture of Prince Henry and Queen Margaret depicted in April.
Queen Margaret of Denmark, 77, and her husband Prince Henry, 83, will not be buried next to each other.
Traditionally, the ruling couples in Denmark are buried in the same place.
The royal house has announced today that Prince Henry does not want to be buried in Roskild's courthouse, the court said in a statement on Thursday.
According to BT magazine, this is due to the Prince’s dissatisfaction with his role in the royal family.
It is no secret that the prince has been dissatisfied with his role and title in the Danish monarchy, said Lene Belleby, the head of communications at the court.
The Prince’s decision not to be buried with the Queen is a natural consequence of not being treated equally with his spouse.
According to Hovin, the Queen has long been aware of her husband’s desire for a burial place and understands the decision.
A terrible moment on the road: the car was to get on the highway
Tom had an open husband and two small children in the car.
They did not get injured in an accident, but do not get insurance money if the other party is not reached.
The accident took place at Keimolanport in Vantaa.
Stock photo of the construction site of the Circle III.
Vantaa’s Tommi tells his family that on Tuesday he survived a miracle trade in a car accident.
Tommi, her open partner Riina and the couple’s two young children drove on the motorway towards Keimolanporti in Vantaa towards Hämeenlinna.
From the connection of the circle III to Hämeenlinnanväylä, a white car was driving along the accelerator belt, which was to drive the family car to the village, Tommi tells.
If it hadn't been for me, the car would've come on Tom.
I braked and turned the car at the same time, and it went out of hand, Tommi says.
The family's car crashed at a very fast rate.
The parents and two young children in the backseat were not injured.
One of the children is a little under 3 years old, the other is under 1 year old.
It was pretty good luck when nothing happened to us.
No passers-by was even driving towards us, even though there was lively traffic.
The accident occurred around 5:20 p.m.
According to Tom, no one stopped at them, and the family called the emergency room.
They got out of the car with their own power.
The ambulance and rescue personnel arrived, and the condition of the family was checked.
The car went into redemption.
Tommi tells him that he and his partner have a small income, and they received a huge grant to buy a car a couple of years ago.
Without the details of another car, Tomm says the family won't get insurance money.
That is why the family is asking eyewitnesses for observations about the car, which caused the family to go to court.
We need a car every day.
It’s hard to take the kids to the farm and go to work without it, Tommi says.
Tommi saw that the car was a white, old-fashioned car.
It was probably from the late 1990s or early 2000s.
He thought the start of the car registration number was SIG.
If the culprit is not caught, I don't know how we're doing financially, we still have to count every cent today.
Tommi hopes that those who saw what happened or knew something about it will be in touch with the police.
The East New Zealand Police Department and the Central New Zealand Rescue Department confirm that they had a duty on Tuesday night at the scene of the accident.
Title and case corrected at 21:15: Contrary to what was initially told in the case, another car, according to Tomm, did not come to slid the receivers, but was to drive from the accelerator line to the edge of the family car.
Lotta Jäppisen’s performance deals with human relationships with humor - What’s in the theatre on Friday and Saturday
A native of Kouvola, Lotta Jäppinen brings her pre-production to the What? theatre.
The self-discovery is a musical theatre performance about past human relationships and inadequacy.
According to director Lotta Jäppisen, it is still a good idea.
The subject is dealt with in a humorous manner.
You don’t get bored with your feelings, he says.
According to Jäppisen, the circular summer theatre performance is carried out with a small budget and a large, young heart.
The name of the show challenges us to think about what a person reveals about himself when he meets a new person.
Is he playing a role, or is the other man getting his coat open?
The show is a mix of fact and fiction.
Jäppinen has both directed and dramatized the performance.
He is also responsible for the lights.
The draft consists of the texts of the working group and does not contain a line.
The director believes that while the performance feeds on the thoughts of young people, it speaks to all ages.
Jäppinen emphasizes that the Self-Revealer does not directly tell about his own or the working group’s human relations.
Facts and fiction are mixed.
I'm sure my own world of value will pass on the show.
I don’t think that human relationships would be bad, but I also don’t think that human relationships, especially couples, would be a prerequisite for happiness.
Many Learn from Distinguished Parents
Jäppinen believes that the Self-Revealer draws a current picture of young adults living in Finland at the age of 100.
According to him, many have learned a lot from their parents, many of whom have separated.
At least you have to listen to yourself.
You don’t have to stay in a bad relationship.
The show features Minea L<0xC3><0xA5>ng, Niklas Rautén and Otto Rokka.
The group also includes costume designer Ella Snellman.
The music is arranged by Jäppisen and Rokan.
Love for the theatre set on fire in Kouvola
Lotta Jäppinen, 26, from Kouvola, is studying as a theatre director at the Turku Academy of Arts.
We have two years to go and another one to go.
Jäppisen’s enthusiasm for theatre has begun during the Kouvola years.
He has been an assistant to the Kouvola Theatre and has performed at the Ylioppilasteatter in Helsinki and lastly at the Linnatheater in Turku.
Management is becoming more and more interested.
The self-revealer got his first night last week in Helsinki on the Narri stage.
A 45-minute performance was also seen in the future, at least in Jäppsen’s study town in Turku.
Self-discovery at Kouvola’s What? Theatre at 4.8. at 19 and 5.8. at 14 and 19.
Finnish Olympic winner recovers from tough motocross insensitivity for a year - necklace broken
Few athletes in Finland have the same unstoppable natural force as Janne Lahtela.
The Kumparelakku ace toured the world hundreds of days a year for twenty years and chased his dream of Olympic gold.
The dream came true in 2002, but the Lahtela movement continued.
He was not only a tireless trainer, but also a tester of new species.
There are not many forms of exercise on Earth that the chemist would not have tried at least once.
It has inspired me to practice.
There's always something new, Lathela says.
In the end, one hobby was to stop Lahtela completely.
In 2014, Lahtela was hit by a motocross accident.
As a result, his necklace and both hands were broken.
I wasn't at work.
I spent a year in my home, Lahtela says.
We had bad luck in the bay.
He also admits that age may have had its share in ruins.
Driving right away may sound awkward.
But I didn't look for boundaries.
It's just as a species so hard that it's not worth too much to play!
After the accident, Lahtela was in a special situation.
His busy life stopped like a wall.
He was the long-running head coach of the Japanese freestyle team.
Lahtela began to thrive immediately after the end of her career in 2006.
For the first time since I was 15 years old, I had to be there.
I didn't really do anything, Lakhela says.
During her training, Lahtela often challenged her protection in the slopes and in physical tests.
Surprisingly, stopping was a good experience.
I was physically and mentally so tired that my own thoughts didn’t make sense.
They're not even a couple of species.
It was good to be there.
I really enjoyed it because I was able to do it just once.
A mandatory break inspired Lahtela to become Finland’s head coach.
Without stopping, he fears that he will be burned.
It’s easier to find places that have gone by than by chance!
Without the accident, I would not have realized that I needed so much rest.
Lahtela started as a coach of the Finnish freestyle team about a year ago.
At the same time, he found a safer hobby instead of accelerators.
I switched motocross to frisbeegolf!
That's all right. That's all right.
Worst of all, I was broadcasting seven hours a day.
Although Lahtela has always been a super-industrial trainer herself, she does not demand that her coaches be the same as hers.
I don't force everyone to be the same.
In our species culture, there is space to be one’s own and ways to become the best in the world.
Freestyle is a free style, and the mentality has always been in line with it, says Lahtela.
Sex robots are coming and we should be worried
It’s here: a report on technological developments in the sex robotics industry – just when it began to feel like 2017 could no longer turn out to be weirder.
Yes, I do.
Sex robots are a big deal.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently released a report on the development of sex robots over the next 5-10 years.
“We need to start taking the prevalence of sex robots seriously,” says Noel Sharkey, a founding member and emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at Sheffield University.
Customers can choose the color of the robot’s eyes, the shape of the nipples and the type of fingernails.
“Sexy robots are sweating, but they’re already sold quite a lot, and we’re going to see more of them,” Sharkey said in a statement.
Sex dolls have evolved from inflatable dolls to robots with warm-looking silicone skin and artificial intelligence-created features reminiscent of human use.
The user can also customize the robot to their own preferences, from the color of the eyes to the shape of the nipples and the type and color of the fingernails.
Worryingly, robots have a “personality” that makes Stepford’s women look like progressive freedom fighters.
Sex dolls have evolved into robots with silicone skin.
For example, the character traits of the RealBotix robot can be adapted to the user’s preferences, for example, to be shy.
True Companion’s Roxxxy Gold robots have a pre-programmed personality: Frigid Farrah seems shy, Wild Wendy is adventurous and so on.
"The personality of Roxxxy Gold is as perfectly as possible adapted to the personality of the user," the company's website advertises.
In other words, a robot likes the same things as a user.
It also has different moods:
It can be tired, talky, or “in that wind.”
There are many worrying features in the prevalence of sex robots, replacing real human relationships, but even more dangerous is the subjugation of women and direct rape fantasies when a user approaches, for example, a shy and resistant programmed robot.
On its website, True Companion compares the Roxxxy robot to a vibrator:
"Women have a vibrator. Why shouldn't men have sex robots?"
However, sex robots are not just a fetish or a new type of sex toy.
Their prevalence and development tells of something darker and deeper in our culture: from the regression of gender equality to sexual intercourse, where submission is one option amongst others.
Of course, most men did not acquire sex robots, and their popularity is still marginal, although the FRR report indicated their growing popularity.
However, the marginal phenomena tell a lot about the spirit.
And many begin to behave strangely or offensively only when the market allows it.
It is no coincidence that sex robots have begun to spread at the same time as women’s rights are under threat around the world, and the White House has a president who has praised for harassment of women.
In the TV series The Handmaid's Tale (Orjattaresi) is not the most worrying of its powerful visual language, for example, pictures of the bodies hanging and the eyes dug out. The most disturbing is how realistic the world of the series feels.
The Republic of Gilead is far from our reality, but right now it seems to be a surprisingly short journey.
Sex robots are trying to make as much of real women as is technically feasible.
Robot developers want their skin to feel genuine and their movements to mimic human movements as much as possible.
However, their “personalities” are far from reality.
The robot is unable to start from a relationship or situation.
They have no will or history of their own – no independence-referring to or violating the fantasy of complete submission.
They're pleasant servants.
A slave.
Police suspect: Two terrorist attacks were planned in Australia, group led by ISIS chief
The ISIS leader led a group of Australian men suspected of planning to take the bomb to Etihad Airways' plane.
According to the Sydney Morning Herald, a senior ISIS official had also sent parts of the bomb to Sydney.
Suspectedly, the bomb was intended to be carried into the plane on July 15, but the company was suspended before security checks.
The police are not telling us why the company was interrupted.
Another plan of the suspected terrorists was to build a toxic colorless gas-separating device and take the device to a full-fledged public place, such as a public transport vehicle.
Australian Federal Deputy Commissioner Michael Phelan says the terrorist plan was one of the most professional plans ever made in Australia.
Four men were arrested in police raids on Saturday over suspected terrorist plots.
One of the men has been released, but his interrogations are also being continued.
The good side of Trump?
Get Mitt Romney to look like a legacy of common sense
During the Trump season, it has been repeated until the boredom that the strong duel between voters has also disintegrated families on a daily basis.
On Christmas and Thanksgiving, American newspaper advisory boards provided guidance on how to deal with the relatives who voted for Trump.
We all want our information bubble to erupt.
Trump’s ability to bring families together has been less noticeable.
I'm going to tell you this because my cousin was staying with me in New York this week, and he's a left-wing poet living in Chicago who's been a long-time contender with our family Republicans.
He reminded us that a common enemy can have a powerful unifying effect.
Now that Trump is in the White House, everyone my cousins know – including a Republican-sponsored sibling with whom he has been arguing about politics for decades – are suddenly and unexpectedly on the same side.
At the dinner table, it is a good thing, but more broadly, there are significant risks involved.
Trump has given the left a new power, but the distorting effect of his presidency can actually take us all to the right.
When we talk about Trump and “normalization,” we are talking about the frightening possibility that one day we will no longer be able to scare away his tricks.
In the long run, there is an even more terrifying possibility that Trump would normalize the right-wing Republicans, who, in comparison to Trump, suddenly seem quite reasonable.
I remember, in a nutshell, Mitt Romney’s restrained version of the madness: a dog on the roof of the car, a 14 percent income tax (and at least his tax returns we’ve seen). Compared to Trump, they seem to be very mild violations.
When Trump’s season is over, the Republicans’ next presidential candidate needs only to be clear, and that immediately feels like a significant improvement.
When my cousin was visiting me, we took our kids to the Central Park carousel, which is the largest carousel in the park department in New York and the best thing you can get in New York for three dollars without caffeine.
The horses in the carousel are huge, the characters in the middle – the irresponsible clowns and the animals in the grip of horror – are malevolent, and the music in the background is strangely fascinating.
Many of New York’s hallmarks become disillusioned with time: the views of tall buildings begin to get bored, the city’s silhouette becomes too familiar, and the city’s reality does not match dreams.
And still, after 35 years, we have not been able to get over the fact that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss cottage, but a big traffic circle in Northern London. Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is a Swiss pub, but it is not counted.
The carousel in Central Park, on the other hand, is still a strange magical experience – even to the extent that two two-year-olds, one one-and-a-half-year-olds and two women in their forties enjoy it immensely.
I would have given the carousel full points if someone had asked for my assessment, but luckily no one came to ask.
Instead, this week I was asked at the department store to rate my "payment experience" on a scale of one to five stars before putting my credit card on the reader.
The same thing in the cafeteria with my home corners, but there I am also given the opportunity to combine the estimate with 15% service money when I go to pick up the coffee shop myself.
This slows down the daily interaction and pressures the customer server to put their personality in the game in a situation where it is not needed.
The store saleswoman smiled in a sorry state when I gave my credit card experience five stars to the tiredness.
Shefki Kuqi fired from inside - "There was no trust in management"
FC Inter has today released Shefki Kuq from the role of coach of the representative team.
Fabrizio Piccareta, formerly an assistant coach, is responsible for coaching.
The other coaching group will continue in its current role.
Piccareta has previously worked as an assistant coach in Sunderland, England.
In January, 51-year-old Piccareta, who joined the Inter coaching team, completed the UEFA Pro license last year.
Stefan H<0xC3><0xA5>kans, Chairman of the Board of Directors of FC Inter, regrets the incident.
Changing a coach is never an easy or pleasant task.
However, Shefki Kuq no longer had the trust of the management of the club, when there was no other option now, H<0xC3><0xA5>kans commented in the club's press release.
The Piccaretta Agreement is valid until the end of the period.
Together with the rest of the coaching team, he is responsible for tomorrow’s home game against HIFK.
According to reports, the team has been swarming throughout Thursday.
Kuqi told players on Thursday morning that the club's assistant coaches Piccareta and John Allen have been removed.
Kuqi and Piccareta joined forces in an Inter match against PS Kemi last Saturday.
Linda Lampenius published a youth picture from the 80's - would you identify a serious violin student?
Violinist Linda Lampenius posted a picture of her youth on Instagram.
A number of wedding rings have been added to the picture, according to which it can be concluded that a 16-year-old student of the Sibelius Academy is in the picture.
Lampenius himself marvels at a young woman looking at a serious camera.
A long time ago, seriously, he texted.
If you don't see the picture, you can watch it here.
Lampenius has previously published pictures of his past and also talked about painful topics.
A couple of years ago, he posted a photo of himself on Instagram.
In the second picture we see her 20 years ago, in the second she poses now, as a mother of two children.
In his caption, Lampenius reflects on his own growth as a human being and refers to the eating disorders that he suffered from when he was younger.
Just 20 years ago and today...
“I still look much like that 26-year-old girl, but the difference is that I’ve learned to like myself and the way I look,” Lampenius wrote.
Behind the text he had added in English hashtags life, eating disorder, insecure, self-confidence, self-esteem, love yourself, 1996, 2016, aging, girl, woman, aging is neat.
Lampenius has spoken openly about the eating disorders of previous years.
At the age of 14, he was hospitalized for anorexia and orthorexia.
A little later, he also became ill with bulimia, which was eventually revealed only in 2006.
Healing began slowly.
In addition to therapy and comparability, Lampenius was helped by a new love.
Oscar Pistorius was delivered from prison to hospital for chest pain
This is the second time Pistorius has been taken from prison to hospital.
Last year, he received hospital treatment for cuts in his wrists, which, according to the prison authorities, he received after falling in a cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder by prosecutors for the original death sentence.
He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine's Day in 2013 by shooting several shots through the toilet door at his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed that he thought his girlfriend was a nighttime intruder who was hiding in the toilet.
Prosecutors have said they intend to appeal again because they consider Pistorius’ six-year sentence too light.
The State Prosecutor intends to appeal to the highest court in South Africa, and the complaint may be dealt with as early as this year.
If the appeal is accepted, Pistorius's judgment may be up to 15 years.
The death penalty is not applicable in South Africa.
Two Bulgarians Arrested for Illegal Camping in Greece
Two illegally camped Bulgarians were arrested in Greece, the country’s foreign ministry said on bTV.
Police arrested a group of unauthorised people in Sithonia on the morning of August 1, with two Bulgarians among the campers.
They were released the same day, but the case is still being investigated.
According to TV channel bTV, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs later announced that it had released the Bulgarians.
The Greek authorities have tightened the rules on free camping sites and are already imposing significant fines on anyone who camps in areas other than the designated areas.
The inspections will continue until the end of the period.
The ministry said the court could impose a fine.
Liquid share sinks - already lost -7.7%
Oil producer Nesteen’s share has fallen by 7.7 per cent at around 11 a.m.
Its earnings before taxes fell, but exceeded the forecast compiled by Inquiry Financial.
The stock market has started today slightly on the frozen side, both in Finland and elsewhere in Europe.
Shortly after the opening of the stock exchanges, the broad European Stoxx 600 index had weighed 0.2 per cent.
The general index of the Helsinki Stock Exchange OMXH had fallen by 0.3 per cent to 9509.48 points after about half an hour of trading and OMXH25 of the most exchanged companies had fallen by 0.3 per cent.
The exchange’s total turnover was 41 million euros, of which nine million were the morning earnings publisher, Nestet.
Red meat, dairy products, and chocolate can alleviate irritated bowel syndrome
Red meat and chocolate may sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.
However, a recent study claims the opposite: a diet rich in meat protein and dairy products may help alleviate irritated bowel syndrome.
Irritated bowel syndrome is an incurable disease that affects approximately 1.3 million people in the United States and 300,000 people in the United Kingdom, causing abdominal cramps, swelling, recurrent or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
Researchers at the University of Washington, however, have found that the essential amino acid tryptophan, which is contained in protein, helps the body develop immune cells that strengthen gut tolerability.
According to Marco Colonna, the head of the study, immune cells guard against salt and ensure that harmful microbes hidden in food do not enter the body.
The cells that cause inflammation are balanced by cells that strengthen resistance. They protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
If the balance falls too close to the inflammation, the result may be irritated bowel syndrome.
In the experiments, it was found that immune cells are present in mice that have certain bacteria in their intestines.
This bacterium needs tryptophan in order for immune cells to begin to appear. Tryptophan is one of the building blocks of proteins.
"We found a link between the development of the Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria and the cells that promote tolerability. Lactobacillus reuteri is part of the normal gut microbiome," says Professor Colonna.
“The more the mice in their diet had tryptophan, the more they had such immune cells.”
If the same works in humans, a combination of Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria and a diet rich in tryptophan may strengthen intestinal tolerance and reduce inflammatory sensitivity.
When studying immune cells that strengthen resistance, Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan found that although one group of mice had such cells, they did not have such cells in mice of the same species that were kept separate from the other group.
He suspected that the difference was related to the gut microbiome of mice, or the normal community of bacteria, fungi, and viruses in the digestive tract.
When the DNA of the mice was examined, six species of bacteria were detected in mice that had immune cells, but not in other mice.
When Lactobacillus reuteri was administered to mice growing in a sterile environment without intestinal microbiome and without immune cells, they began to develop immune cells.
The researchers wanted to find out how bacteria affect the immune system. They grew Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria in a liquid and transferred small amounts of liquids – without bacteria – from mice to immature immune cells that were isolated.
Immune cells evolved into resistance-strengthening cells.
When the active ingredient was purified from the liquid, it turned out to be a by-product of the metabolism of tryptophan, known as indole-3-lactic acid.
When researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the diet of mice, the number of cells that strengthen the tolerance increased by about 50%. When the amount of tryptophan was halved, the number of cells decreased by half from the previous one.
According to Cervantes-Barragan, humans have the same immune cells as mice, and most of us have Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria in our digestive tract.
It is not yet known whether the by-products of tryptophan from the bacteria Lactobacillus reuteri cause cells to develop in the same way in humans as in mice. However, genetic defects related to tryptophan have been detected in patients with irritated bowel syndrome.
“We probably want to contribute to the development of such cells because they regulate inflammation on the internal surfaces of the intestines,” says Cervantes-Barragan.
"High levels of tryptophan combined with Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria may contribute to their prevalence."
Jose Mourinho says Manchester United got a "nero" after signing with Nemanja Matic
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United got a "nero" in their rows after making a deal with Nemanja Matic. The midfielder made his debut in Manchester United's rows against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
Matic, who moved on to Chelsea for <0xC2><0xA3>40 million, started with a 2–1 win in Dublin, United’s last-ever match before the UEFA Super Cup match against Real Madrid on Tuesday. He made an impression as a defending midfielder with stars like Paul Pogban and Andreas Pereira.
However, Matic was not in the best condition yet, as he was not on the blue shirt tour of Asia before the start of the season. He only managed on the field for 45 minutes – according to Mourinho, there has to be a change before the start of the league season.
“He needs time, but his experience, his intelligence and his way of thinking make him a genius – he has the natural ability to think about football,” Mourinho says.
“We’ll help him be ready sooner rather than later.”
In addition to Matic, incoming players Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku were starting the game at the Aviva Stadium, when Mourinho began to grind his starting line-up for the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wants three more players, even though the club has already done an “excellent job” by acquiring three of his four top players.
“Three out of four – you have to thank the club,” he added.
"I'm happier if I get all four, but they did an excellent job."
Airballoons harassed Germany for two batches
The Finnish women's volleyball team lost their fourth match of the World Cup to Germany in a straight 0-3 draw (23-25, 23-25, 14-25).
Routine level of playing in Germany is high.
Their match was in every sector, Finnish head coach Tapio Kangasniemi said in a statement.
In the first two innings, Finland held its opponents tight, but in the third innings, Germany was clearly stronger.
Germany leads the bloc.
“When we were playing patiently and aggressively enough in certain places, we were able to play with them,” Kangasniemi said.
The most effective in Finland was 14 points collected by Piia Korhonen.
Finland, who lost three of the four matches, will face Slovenia on Sunday.
Reuters: Grand Jury Has Already Sent Challenges to Trump Jr.'s Russia Meeting
In the United States, a grand jury has sent challenges to the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya.
A grand jury convened by Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller has already sent challenges to the meeting of Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, known for the connections between Donald Trump Jr. and the Kremlin.
This is reported by the Reuters news agency, which at the same time confirms the information revealed by the Wall Street Journal earlier on Thursday about the grand jury's summons.
According to Reuters, the grand jury has sent challenges in connection with the meeting between Trump Jr. and the Kremlin’s famous Veselnitskaya, which was held in the middle of the U.S. presidential election in June 2016.
Donald Trump Sr.’s then campaign manager Paul Manafort and his son-in-law, the White House’s current advisor Jared Kushner, were also present.
According to Reuters sources, the fact that Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller has convened a grand jury in Washington means a tightening of the pace of the Russia investigation.
The sources add that Mueller wanted a grand jury to help investigate Russia’s involvement in the U.S. presidential election and whether Trump’s campaign or his close circle had cooperated with Russia.
The grand jury extends Mueller’s rights to collect evidence, send challenges, and force people to testify in an oath.
The great jurors are a group of ordinary citizens who work behind closed doors.
The grand jury will weigh the evidence that the prosecutor has been investigating and decide whether the charges should be brought.
British inventor microchips himself to get into his home and car with a shake of his hand
The British inventor is the first in the whole country to microscratch himself so that he can open the outside door of his home, enter his office and start his car with a shake of his hand.
The microchip is between the thumb and forearm of 33-year-old Steven Northam. Now he provides a service to businesses and individuals who want to make their lives easier with Northam BioTeq technology.
Northam is collaborating with Dr. Geoff Watson, an anesthesiologist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure that the microchip installation meets the medical requirements.
The microchip uses the same technique as the microchips of cats and dogs, and its installation takes only 30 seconds.
Northam's company is also trying to make the locks of houses and cars compatible with the microchip. One lock processing costs 300 pounds.
Northam is married, and she has one child. She has installed microchip technology both in her home and in her BMW Z4 car, which starts when she puts her hand on the steering wheel.
The White House exhibit cost taxpayers thousands of dollars.
The White House’s decision last month to fly a Navy helicopter to the White House’s southern lawn for an event featuring American production was to pay taxpayers $24,000, according to documents from TIME magazine.
The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D helicopter is called Marine One while the president is driving it. It was a draw at the White House event held on July 17, 2017, where American construction programs were presented.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, and a group of White House officials came across products from all 50 states.
In addition to the Connecticut-made helicopter, exhibits included a sailboat from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin, and a truck from Mississippi.
The military office of the White House had requested the helicopter to be deployed by special order only about 36 hours before landing on the southern lawn for an "exceptional" event, as evidenced by the documents of the Navy HMX-1 helicopter fleet.
“I just wanted to make sure you were aware of this, because it’s an exceptional event that gets a lot of visibility,” the commander of the HMX-1 unit wrote in an e-mail the day before the event to his boss, who is the deputy commander of the naval flight.
The message said that the helicopter would arrive at the southern lawn on 17 July at seven o’clock in the morning and the event would begin at three o’clock in the afternoon. The helicopter would leave the place only after the lawn was cleared between six and nine o’clock in the evening.
In addition, the message stated that if the helicopter’s departure from the White House was delayed, another crew would be needed to arrive due to the limitations of service times.
The original crew was in the helicopter at the time of the incident, and the unit's security personnel were with the helicopter when it was on the ground.
It is not clear from the documents obtained by the TIME magazine whether another crew was needed.
The U.S. Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes.
According to the documents, HMX-1 questioned whether the incident violated the law.
"One of our questions was whether there was a violation of the Hatch Act, and we were told there was no violation," the commander wrote.
"It sounds like you can take part," the deputy commander replied.
Made in America was an official White House event, so it was not covered by the Hatch Act.
But even the official events have political tones.
At the event, the president spoke in favour of the health care reform that was in the Senate at the time and looser state regulation.
The use of a Marine One helicopter and an Air Force One aircraft for political purposes is not a new phenomenon.
Presidents must use them on their journeys,
But using them only for photographs is unusual.
Trump’s actions drew attention in February when Air Force One rolled into the background of the presidential campaign event in Melbourne, Florida. Trump has strongly criticised the use of his predecessor’s presidential plane on Twitter.
“The White House is very pleased with the Made in America event, which showcased products made from American materials by American workers from all 50 states,” said Lindsay Walters, White House Press Secretary.
The crews of the HMX-1 unit regularly conduct training flights in the Washington area and train in the southern lawn to bring the president to the White House with an accuracy of centimeters.
When Trump was at the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 made 58 drill landings for the White House.
According to one official, flights to the Made in America event were part of the crew’s monthly training quota.
The unit's helicopters also flew 11 hours of "non-presidential support missions" that day.
According to the White House, no other costs were incurred by taxpayers.
A Sikorsky spokesperson said the company was not involved in organizing a helicopter demonstration in the southern lawn of the White House.
HMX-1 has no record of flights related to the President’s duties, and it is difficult to accurately estimate the cost of the event.
According to the Department of Defense’s 2017 hourly compensation, the compensation level for a VH-3D helicopter is $24,380 per flight hour.
According to HMX-1, flights from Quantico's base in Virginia to the White House and back lasted a total of one hour.
According to the White House, the cost of operating a helicopter is significantly lower.
“The calculation of the costs to taxpayers by the level of compensation is misleading,” Walters says.
"The estimated level of compensation includes staff, maintenance and many other so-called embedded costs that are taken into account in the annual appropriations."
According to a 2015 study by the RAND research company, the levels of compensation do not include personnel costs, but take into account fuel, maintenance and contract costs.
At the time of the event, former White House press secretary Sean Spicer defended the use of the helicopter at the event.
“The idea is to introduce American production,” Spicer said.
“I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they are involved in ensuring national security and employing hundreds or thousands of people through it.
And I think, like most Americans, we are proud of the helicopter and other defense equipment that many Americans have worked hard on.
It is absolutely appropriate to point it out.”
It’s not clear whether Trump was in a helicopter during the incident, but at least he was sitting in the fire truck driver’s seat.
In the White House, Trump joked to the press about his own Sikorsky fleet.
"I know Sikorsky very well," the president said. "I have three of them."

Venezuela’s Prosecutor Demands Right to Prevent the Appointment of a New State Representation
The Venezuelan prosecutor has appealed for a court order that would prevent the appointment of a new representative of the country.
Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has announced that the delegation elected in the vote on Sunday is scheduled to be appointed on Friday.
In a contested vote, the country was elected a representative, which may, among other things, change the country’s constitution.
According to prosecutor Luisa Ortega, the decision to prevent the vote has been requested because of suspicions of electoral fraud.
Ortega has also started a polling poll on the vote.
He appointed two judges after the British polling company said the results had been manipulated.
According to the company, the number of voters reported by the Venezuelan authorities was about one million more than the number of actual voters.
Only Maduro's allies were nominated for the House of Representatives, and Maduro's son and wife are included in the 545-member House of Representatives.
In addition to amending the Constitution, the legislature can dissolve the opposition-led Congress and change the laws.
Maduro is described as a dictator.
Maduro's actions have been widely condemned.
The opposition sees Maduro’s constitutional amendment as a way to strengthen his position.
The United States has sanctioned Maduro and called him a dictator.
The European Union, Britain, Mexico, Colombia and Argentina have, in turn, announced that they do not recognise the new representation.
Maduro argues that the new parliament is the solution to the country’s political and economic crisis.
Unrest in Venezuela has been going on for months.
Several people have been injured and more than 100 have died.
Venezuela plunged into an economic crisis after oil prices fell.
Today, many people are unable to afford food or medicine.
The opposition is expected to express its opinion also on Friday, when a new delegation is scheduled to begin.
A Russian man handed over by Finland was sentenced to four years in prison in the United States.
The Minneapolis court in the United States on Thursday sentenced 41-year-old Maksim Senah to nearly four years in prison for involvement in global computer fraud.
Senah was arrested in Finland in August 2015 as a result of a lawsuit filed by the United States.
According to the Russian newspaper Fontanka, Senah was on vacation in Finland.
The Finnish border authorities arrested him while he was returning home.
Finland handed over Senah to US judicial authorities in February 2016 despite Russian objections, according to the AFP news agency.
He was found guilty in March of this year of computer fraud, which had benefited from millions of dollars.
Senah was sentenced to 46 months in prison.
According to the US Department of Justice, Senah will be deported from the country after serving a prison sentence.
The Russian Foreign Ministry has harshly blamed Finland after the arrest and said that the man should not be handed over to the United States.
In a statement, Finland and the United States were accused of having been arrested in Finland without Russia’s prior knowledge.
According to the prosecutor, Senah had used a computer virus called Ebury, which infected tens of thousands of computers around the world.
The virus was used to fish usernames and passwords.
The scammers then used the data to further direct the internet traffic, which was used to create click-by-click scams and spread spam.
According to Kenneth Blanco, the head of the Department of Justice’s criminal division, the case shows that the United States is also capable of chasing other cybercriminals.
“We have the ability and desire to identify, find and bring them to justice,” Blanco said in a statement.
Edited at 8:58 p.m.: Corrected the name of the convicted person.
Trailer for the third season of Narcos: Pablo Escobar is out of the picture, so the Cali cartel will rise to the top in the Netflix hit series

The streaming service has already confirmed that the series will see the third and fourth production seasons. The trailer for the third season has been released, and it presents the new connas of the series.
In the third season of production, the US drug police DEA has turned its attention to the Cali cartel, the world’s richest drug trafficking organization.

Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) leads the cartel, and Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) has its brains. Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) maintains connections with Mexico, and Chepe Santacruz (Pepe Rapazote) operates in New York.
In the recently released trailer, Pedro Pascal returns to Javier Pe<0xC3><0xB1>ana, who recruits U.S. and Colombian policemen for the war on drugs.
New faces include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of narcotics starts on September 1.
Kari Kola performs an exceptional light work in Paris
Joensulai Light Artist Kari Kola (pictured) will perform an exceptional lightwork in honour of the first Light Day in Paris, set by the United Nations, on 16 May next year.
Kola makes a lightwork for Paris called Day and Night.
The themes of the work are light and darkness - day and night - sun and moon.
The work illuminates the Fontenoy building at UNESCO’s headquarters and the Globe monument in front of it.
In my work, I want to emphasize not only light but also darkness.
Today, light pollution in millions of cities is a major problem that affects the well-being of all of us.
With the help of my art, I can make my experiences more important and concretely visible,” says the light artist Kari Kola.
I am well-received from the invitation to participate in the first International Day of Light and to bring the art of light into the theme day, Kola continues.
Kari Kola was involved in the opening of the Year of Light in 2015, when he illuminated the festival in honor of the UNESCO headquarters.
I feel very privileged to have my art re-implemented at UNESCO Headquarters,” says Kari Kola.
The work may still be significantly expanded.
This will be announced later in the autumn, Kola will continue.
The aim of the International Day of Light is to highlight the importance of light to humanity and to raise people’s awareness of science, art, culture and sustainable development.
The first Day of Light will be celebrated at UNESCO’s headquarters in the centre of Paris on May 16.
Two men fight in shopping mall parking lot in Espoo
A dispute arose between the two men in Espoo in the parking lot of the shopping centre Iso Omena on Wednesday morning.
According to the parties, the dispute began when the other party accidentally drove in a prohibited direction.
There was an oral dispute between the drivers.
The driver driving in the forbidden direction would yell at the driver of another car, as a result of which this car started to hit the hitter's car.
After that, he hit a car that had crashed into the engine.
In the opening speech, the man has admitted to causing damage and doing wrong.
Timo Soin's question mark: "Then came the waterfall"
On Thursday, Foreign Minister Timo Soini (uv.) published a blog post titled Question Mark.
The article is short, only two sentences long.
During my time, the party grew from zero to a government party of thirty-seven deputies.
Then came the waterfall, now everything is floating, Soini writes.
The text of the song contains references to 18th-century France.
King Louis XV or his mistress Madame de Pompadour is known to have used the waterfall comparison.
Depending on the interpretation, the books of history have left statements "after us the waterfall" or "after me the waterfall".
Afghanistan’s democracy depends on women’s political role
The elections are only representative if they can vote for all members of society, including women, said the head of the U.N. mission to Afghanistan on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, the interim head of the U.N. aid mission, said that hundreds of women are running for provincial council elections, three women are running for vice president, and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overemphasized," Haysom said in a statement Wednesday.
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women participate fully in them and are included in all parts of the electoral process.
The provincial council and presidential elections in Afghanistan will be held on 5 April 2017.
The Taliban has posed threats to the elections at the same time as international forces are moving into an advisory role.
This year’s elections will be the first time that power is peacefully transferred from one democratically elected government to another.
Haysom said that women's contributions strengthen Afghanistan's democracy.
According to the Afghan Independent Electoral Commission, out of 3.6 million registered voters, 1.2 million are women.

A flood of certain types of tourists threatens the culture of the region
The authorities are considering limiting the number of tourists in Venice.
The anger of locals is especially directed towards the form of tourism represented by cruise ships.
The Italian Minister of Culture calls it "eat and flee" tourism: it's only a few hours away and we're driving through the big crowds of sights.
Venice has become obsessed with tourists making quick day trips to the city.
The narrow streets are hard to move, and the fine squares are so full of visitors that the inhabitants of Venice will no longer be able to join the crowd.
They have been forced to move further and further away from the historic centre, while hotels have been replaced by homes.
About the problems brought by tourism in Venice writes The New York Times and The Guardian.
Authorities are considering restrictions on the amount of tourists.
They call the current phenomenon a poor-quality tourism - low-quality tourism.
When you arrive on a large cruise ship, time is given for two or three hours.
Follow the guide to the flagship Piazzale Roma from Rialto Bridge to St Mark’s Square, and turn back, describing the prevailing and problematic tourism of Italian Minister of Culture Dario Franceschini.
The beauty of Italian cities is not only in architecture, but also in the operation of the place, shops and workshops.
We must preserve this part of the identity of cities.
St. Mark's Square is also one of the most popular attractions in Venice's historic center.
On the side of the tower is St. Mark's Church.
The anger of the locals is also mainly directed at cruise ships.
In the historic center of Venice, there are 50,000 inhabitants.
In 1951, there were about 175,000 inhabitants.
In July, an estimated 2,000 Venetians protested against mass tourism.
According to them, tourism has deteriorated their quality of life, destroying the environment and driving residents away.
About 2,000 people leave each year.
If this continues, in a few years there will be no more than tourists in Venice.
It would have been a social, anthropological and historical disaster, says Carlo Belframe, who organized the demonstration.
The equation is difficult, as ships bring the income they need to Venice and create a need for jobs in many different sectors.
In addition to limiting the number of tourists, the solution has been designed to allow cruisers to go further than the historic centre.
Luciano Bortot, who lives in Venice, believes that the situation would certainly change if the Veneto administrative region, where Venice is also located, were given more power to decide on its own affairs - if not full autonomy.
About 20-30 million tourists visit Venice every year.
You're driving to Kuopio?
Road traffic jams for miles on the highway
On the highway between Kuopio and Siilinjärvi, on the north-facing lane, there has been traffic congestion for kilometres from Thursday afternoon work during return transport.
The area is undergoing road surface work, which slows down traffic, says Savon Sanomat.
For data, there is a speed limit of 50 km/h instead of the usual 120 km/h.
Even in the 50-kilometer restricted area, traffic had progressed on Thursday afternoon, however, in places with practically walking speed.
The roadworks took place on Thursday afternoon on the side of Lake Siilinjärvi, near the Apparitions patch, or Golden Curry.
I'll do well without that kind of attention.
A 23-year-old runner has had to notice the public's curses.
Amalie Iuel has published some wonderful pictures of herself, including the scenery of the Grand Canyon.
Danish-Norwegian Amalie Iuel has risen in her current home country as a popular athlete in Norway, not least because in March she broke the 26-year-old Norwegian record in a 400-metre run by sprinting at 51.81.
A month later, he improved the 400-metre fence run to a Norwegian record of 55.38.
Shortly after his recordings, Iuel, a passionate social media user, realized that fame and publicity had their shadows.
Men all over the world began sending pictures of their genitals to Iuël, apparently in the hope that the young runner would be interested in them.
Iuelin had to close his Snapchat account from outside his account.
“I got a lot of ‘stringshots’ from strangers, so I had to turn my account into a private one,” Iuel told VG magazine.
In an interview with VG, Iuel did not want to identify exactly what kind of pictures he received.
You'll guess, Iuel laughed.
It’s nice to get feedback after the run, but I’ll do well without that kind of attention.
Iuel was born in Denmark in 1994.
His mother is Danish, his father is Danish-Norwegian.
Iueli's family moved to Norway when Amalien was 2 years old.
At the age of 12, Amalien’s family moved to Namibia first because of his father’s work, then to Pakistan.
Then it was Dubai, Thailand and the United States.
Iuel spent four years as a university athlete (University of Southern California) in Los Angeles, from which he returned to Norway.
In June 2015, he changed Danish citizenship to Norwegian citizenship.
In Norway, Iuel trains under the guidance of three coaches: Leif Olav Alnes, Karsten Warholm and Elisabeth Slettum.
Norway is much more open to conversation than the United States.
In the United States, coaches don't ask anything, they just give orders.
In Norway, the coach has much more time to have a personal relationship with the athlete,” Iuel told VG.
Amalie Iuel holds the record for Norway in the 400 metres and 400 metres fence run.
The footman took snowboarder Janne Korve to the crossroads throughout her career - now included in the World Cup: "It's nice when it doesn't happen anywhere"
It was nice to count when you didn’t happen to do anything!
Janne Korpi, 31, one of Finland’s most successful snowboarders, has been able to really enjoy her beloved species again this season.
Last summer, my career was on the brink.
The leg injury had forced Korve to the operating table in January, and the leg did not want any healing.
He also had a hand in the race.
In the summer I didn’t know what I was doing, whether the boarding was going to continue or not.
The sponsorships were interrupted and many things were open, Korpi says.
But that's what they say, it's a habit to get things done.
The leg healed, the sponsor continued the contract for two years, and the blood began to draw on the slope again.
After that, the follow-up decision was easy.
At least I knew it when I was in the snow.
I was like, damn, yeah, this is so much fun, let's pull a couple more through.
The corp was not able to count properly until September-October, but after a long landing break, just painless training has been a big thing.
There are only a few that have toured the races.
It's okay.
Competitions have never been the most important aspect of boarding for Korvel.
I've never counted for a race.
I think it's frustrating to aim for four years in one race, and then you're in the heat of that week.
I can't think of it that way, Corpi says.
Today Korpi competes in the semi-finals of the Spanish World Cup in Sierra Nevada.
Even though individual races don’t like him on board, in the tough company of racing he always burns.
According to Korven, the value of the competitions organized by the International Ski Federation has increased in recent years, although some of the boarders chose the Norwegian X-Games at the same time.
Yes, these are important races, the visibility is great.
However, in my opinion, valuation always depends on the conditions and the level of the races.
Korpi is the oldest athlete in the Finnish 12-man team in Sierra Nevada.
The team’s cups, 17-year-old Rene Rinnekangas and Emmi Parkkisenniemi, are 14 years younger than Korpea.
It's nice to follow the younger guys.
I remember when I was at the time that everything was new and was so sickly excited about everything.
It also brings itself a new stream, Corpi thinks.
I'm still somewhat behind the slope, but otherwise no, there's a lot of flow in the guys!
Behind the boarding career, Janne Korpi has also built a different kind of sports career.
Director legend Pekka Korve’s son is addicted to rowing: the surfer has his own rowing horses, for which he makes training programs.
When I'm on a journey all the time, I don't think it's time to be at the fair anymore.
But I look every day at least at the results of the diet and usually also at some departures, Korpi says.
According to Korve, diet management and diet preparation are a potential career plan when the boarding career is completed in time.
I didn't plan that far, but it's at least a probable option.
I feel like I'm studying it a little bit along with this snowboarding.
I’m trying to stay nervous and evolve over time, maybe in the summer I’ll be driving something.
If it is my future profession, then it will not be difficult to start it when it is already finished within the species.
Treatments also include the Elitloppet viral test with the narrator Jaajo Linnonmaa.
The duo has rented a cruise ship, which will head to the Stockholm Elitloppet food competition at the end of May.
Korpi and Linnonmaa decided to revive the old tradition.
Cruises have gone very well and people have been excited.
We are now at a point where there will be no bankruptcy.
A few months is still time, hopefully we get the ship full, Korpi says excitedly.
Attendo’s nursing home project for Kite has surprised everyone
Attendo Esteri is the name of a new 41-seater nursing home to be built for Kite.
The 1,700-storey building will be completed next summer on the other side of the Health Center’s neighbour.
A common issue of wonder is where customers are enough for a new care unit, because now, during the Siu war, many private care homes are pounding the clientele.
Anne Flink Attendolta, Regional Head of Nursing Services, commented that Kite will have more demand in the future not only for alternatives but also for improved service housing.
All kinds of services are needed, and when there are options, freedom of choice also works better, says Flink.
Attendo bought private nursing homes in Kanervikkola and Eerika from Kite last year.
The deal was about business, but the property is known to have a five-year lease.
Flink says Attendo does not have an urgent need to move functions away from these premises.
More on the topic later today.
GMB is concerned about the continued operation of the McVitie's factory in Scotland
The trade union is seeking confirmation from the leaders of the McVitie's cookie maker for a long-term commitment to production at the Glasgow plant.
According to the Scottish division of the UK General Trade Union, GMB, the company has not disclosed its plans for the future of the Tollcross plant.
The factory, which manufactures Hobnobs and Rich Tea cookies and other products, employs more than 500 people.
McVitie’s own company Pladis said it had invested more than <0xC2><0xA3>5 million in the factory in recent years.
The company added that workers and trade union representatives will "certainly be the first ones" if there are any changes in their activities.
In his letter to the Chief Operating Officer, GMB urges the company to “response to the concern that no funding has been allocated for the modernisation of production lines”.
Drew Duffy of the GMB trade union is very concerned that the factory manager does not get clear information about the business needs and future investment plans of Tollcross.
"Families have been working here from generation to generation, and the workforce has focused heavily on the local community and the Glasgow metropolitan area, and the factory is a significant employer in the area of high unemployment and low income.
From the perspective of jobs, wages and livelihoods, as well as Brexit, rising cost of living and the continued decline in production, East Glasgow needs a successful McVitie’s production.
According to a Pladis reporter, the factory manager had only received a union letter the previous day and the company responds directly to the letter because it appreciates the continued interaction with employees and union representatives.
“We had a regular meeting with employees and representatives of GMB at Tollcross two months ago, where we discussed several issues openly.
We discussed with employees, among other things, that, like other highly competitive and insecure companies in the market, we are constantly evaluating all of our businesses and offices in order to maintain our competitiveness."
According to the reporter, the company has invested more than <0xC2><0xA3>5 million in the Tollcross plant in recent years, in particular in its production lines and improving operations.
“We are aware of the long history of Tollcross as a manufacturing facility and will certainly be the first to tell employees and union representatives if we are going to make changes to the factory’s operations.”
Did PSG warn Barcelona of Neymar's move three years ago?
LaLiga may regret its interest in Marco Verratt
Paris Saint-Germain will not give up on Neymar's pursuit after paying a <0xC2><0xA3>189 million transfer fee for the deal, but did PSG warn Barcelona of a record transfer three years ago?
The sensational transfer is the most talked about case of the summer. The French Ligue 1 football team is ready to break the world record of transfer amounts. The previous record was less than half: it was born when Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United with a transfer amount of <0xC2><0xA3>89 million.
After the transfer, Neymar will become the world’s most expensive football player and also the world’s best-paid professional athlete, as PSG offers him more than <0xC2><0xA3>500,000 a week after taxes.
Barcelona are known to be angry at PSG’s actions and the way Neymar has left the club violently. A source close to Barcelona says that the club has taken very good care of Neymar since he arrived in Santos in 2013.
Did the president of PSG warn the football world of this transfer three years ago?
When Manchester City announced their interest in Blaise Matuidis in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned PSG’s best-looking clubs.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they beat our players, we'll be their opponents and we'll contact their players," Al-Khelaifi said.
"We respect all the clubs.
But if they get our players, they have to face the consequences.”
Barcelona seem to be guilty of this: it expressed its interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verratt earlier this summer.
PSG made it clear that it would not allow the Italian to leave under any circumstances. It may well be that Barcelona will lose its star player Neymar as a result.

NEW YORK: Trump's phone calls were invented - White House spokesman: "I wouldn't say it was a lie"
The White House admits that the two calls mentioned by U.S. President Donald Trump have never happened, according to the New York Times.
The Trump-smoked conversations with both the president of Mexico and the leader of the partisan organization have turned out to be inventive.
White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed that no calls had been made.
He said Trump did not lie.
According to Sanders, many of the leaders of the partisans spoke to Trump in person, and Trump had discussed with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto at the G20 summit in Hamburg.
I wouldn't say it was a lie, it's a pretty tough accusation.
Those conversations took place, they didn’t just happen on the phone, but with facial expressions, Sanders explained.
Speech to the Partisans sparked disapproval
Trump said on Monday that the Mexican president had called him and that Trump had succeeded in erasing illegal immigration.
According to Trump, Pena Nieto said that few will ever cross the southern border of Mexico because they know the trip to the U.S. border will be quiet anyway.
The Mexican government issued a statement on Wednesday saying that the call had not been made.
On Tuesday, Politico released a full version of Trump’s interview with The Wall Street Journal.
In it, Trump gloated his speech at a major meeting of the National Party organization in West Virginia.
I got a call from the leader of the party stalwarts, he said it was the finest speech they've ever had.
They were very grateful, Trump said.
On Wednesday, the party said it was not aware of anyone’s phone call to Trump.
According to the report, the previous statement by the head of the organization, Michael Surbaugh, in which he had apologised to Trump's speech from the partisans, speaks for himself.
Trump’s speech at the party organization’s meeting sparked a lot of admiration because it was exceptionally political in relation to the nature of the event.
Among other things, he praised the results of last autumn’s presidential election.
