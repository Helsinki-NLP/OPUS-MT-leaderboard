Petr <0xC4><0x8C>ech: Transition to the last minute?
Everything is Possible
Today is the last day you can jump through the transfer window and make a big transition.
Another chance will come in the winter.
Petr <0xC4><0x8C>ech, currently Chelsea’s substitute goalkeeper, is not currently on a new professional contract in Madrid, Monaco or Paris.
He sits at the NH Hotel in Sm<0xC3><0xAD>chov, talks with Czech journalists and is going to play for the Czech general with the Americans and then for a sharp start to the Euro 2016 qualification against the Netherlands.
In the new Premier League season, Chelsea take the lead of Thibaut Courtois, the Czech for the first time in ten years at the club in London.
It has been speculated that Real Madrid might be interested in the Czech Republic.
At the start of the season, he lost the Spanish Super Cup in matches with Atlético and could not even get into the league season when he lost 2–4 in San Sebastian.
It was also speculated about the interest of Paris SG.
He had two wins and two draws for the French league season, shooting St. Etienne 5:0 on Sunday.
Relatively the shoe club AS Monaco pushes the most.
He has a 1-1-2 balance in the league so far and broke off with Lille 1-1 on the weekend.
On the English boulevard, reports emerged today that the Czechs might want to play at the Queens Park Rangers.
According to English bookmakers, however, Czech's departure from Chelsea at the last minute is not very likely.
Skybet gave him a 4-1 course.
Peter, is it possible that in the remaining few hours you will change your jersey?
I don't count on it, but there's never a hundred percent in football.
In the course of the day, there will be an offer that will not be rejected.
What would such an offer look like?
(Laughter) "Well, I don't know yet how such an offer that can't be rejected actually looks.
“It would have to be agreed by all sides, it would be up to Chelsea to decide whether or not the club would deal with a possible offer.
Is it technically feasible to make such a transition now that you are in Prague?
Wouldn’t it be necessary for you to sign a new contract somewhere in your new office?
I didn't think about it.
But in a situation like this, there are a lot of players today, they are all somewhere in the national team and certainly a lot of transfers will be closed today.
So somehow it would have been feasible.
How many clubs on the planet can you afford?
Well, I don't really know.
So you're not pushing to leave?
“The situation where I didn’t catch a new season in the first three games is new for me after fifteen years of career.
However, there is no reason to panic, pack and go somewhere.
“I want to continue to participate in that fight for Chelsea’s goalkeeper position and it’s up to the coach to choose which decision he’ll make over the next few weeks.
What role does the family play in your decision-making?
I take all the factors into account.
Of course, a sporting aspect is important to me, but I also look at it from a personal point of view, which of course includes the needs of the family.
Is it possible that you could catch another club in England?
That's a question I thought it would never be about me.
In football, anything is possible.
I don't want to exclude anything.
I don't know the answer.
Prime Ministers of India and Japan to meet in Tokyo

According to the reporters, India also hopes that both nations will agree to cooperate on defense issues.
Police in Karrata arrested 20-year-old boy after motorcycle chase
The engine was stopped after a zone with a maximum permissible speed of 70 km/h hit 125 km/h and entered the bush to escape the police.
Police in Karrata tried to stop a blue motorcycle at the end of the day when they noticed that it was 125 km/h on the way out of a pumping station on Bathgate Road.
According to police, the driver did not stop and continued along Burgess Road and then drove into the borehole, so the police lost sight of him.
The motorcycle and the person who matched the driver’s description were then spotted in a house in Walcott Way, Bulgaria.
Karrath police have accused a 20-year-old boy of disobeying the call for arrest and reckless driving.
It will take place before the court in Karrata on September 23.
The motorcycle was confiscated for three months.
George Webster charged with rape at hotels in Nairn and Pitlochry
The man will be tried on charges of raping women in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, was acquitted of the charge during a hearing at the Glasgow Supreme Court.
He allegedly raped his wife on June 7, 2013, at the Scotland's Hotel in Pitlochry, Perthshire.
Webster claimed to have attacked her while "she was unaware, asleep, and unable to give her consent."
Webster was also charged with raping another woman at the Golf View Hotel in Nairn, Scotland, on 4 May 2014.
Judge Lady Rae has set a date for her dressing up on November 17 at the Edinburgh Supreme Court.
The restoration of the very American ideal that labour rights are at the same time human rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have proposed a law that aims to protect trade union organizations as civil law.
“Depending on how trade unions work, middle-class jobs work,” says Ellison, a Democratic senator for Minnesota who co-chairs the congressional committee.
That's why I'm so proud to be able to introduce, together with John Lewis's pattern of occasional rights, a law that strengthens the status of employees.
This breakthrough legislation will give workers the same legal opportunity as to prevent discrimination in unions as in other forms of discrimination – and will stop the anti-union forces.
Adapting the Labour Relations Act so as to enable all employees who face discrimination if they want to join trade unions, to stand trial in a civil court - and to judge compensation or damages - is a correct and necessary initiative.
But this is certainly not a radical initiative – at least not by American standards.
The best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis, and other proponents of the law are proposing is to re-establish the American ideal.
Despite the trade union struggles that have taken place in recent years — in Wisconsin, Michigan, and other states — Americans have once supported countries around the world to accept, expand, and respect labor rights.
There have been times, and millions of Americans still remember them, when countries advocated democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and the right to assemble with one breath.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas MacArthur and his advisers supported the country to adopt a constitution designed to ensure that the military autocracy of Hideki Toya would be replaced by democracy.
They were convinced that employees and their trade unions played a role in shaping the new Japan, included language and openly acknowledged that “the right of employees to gather, collectively negotiate and act is guaranteed.”
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his advisers urged the Germans to create a constitution that would ensure that Adolf Hitler’s fascism would be replaced by a strong democracy.
The Germans realized that employees in the new nation would need to organise and promote, and therefore included a clause that openly says: “The right to create associations that will secure and improve the working and economic conditions will be guaranteed to each and every individual.
Agreements that will limit this right or seek to damage it will be cancelled. Measures leading to the fulfillment of such purpose are unlawful.
When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt presided over the International Commission on Human Rights, which proposed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was adopted by the United Nations in 1948 as a global treaty, the drafters and drafters of the treaty included in it "the drafters and drafters of the international treaty."
For generations, Americans have accepted the basic premise that labor rights are human rights.
When countries were advising other countries on how to create civil and democratic society, Americans explained that the right to create labor unions – and their participation in collective bargaining with companies and government agencies in the position of an equal partner – must be protected.
Now that these rights are being challenged in America, it is certainly necessary to return to the American ideal that working people must have the right to organize and enforce themselves in a free and open society.
As Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. said:
History is a great teacher.
Today, everyone knows that the power unions of the nation have not diminished, but expanded.
They have raised the standard of living of millions of people, created a market for industry, and raised production to an unprecedented level.
Those who attack trade unions forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.
History does not forget, and neither should we.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of civil rights in order to prevent discrimination in the organisation of trade unions - has a great delay.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis restore the ideals that raised America and made it a real promise to democracy.
Judge Temporarily Blocked Law That Could Close All Abortion Clinics in Louisiana
A federal judge on Sunday temporarily blocked a Louisiana law that, according to lawyers, would likely shut down all five of the state's abortion clinics.
The decree enacted by the signing of Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal in June, which is set to enter into force on September 1, would require physicians carrying out abortions to have the right to receive a patient in a hospital within 30 miles of their practice.
The judge’s decision means that doctors may temporarily continue to carry out legal abortions, and in the meantime, they must obtain this permission.
"The proposing party will be able to legally conduct its activities and in the meantime obtain permission," Federal Judge John deGravelles said in a statement.
The hearing will be scheduled within one month so that the judge can issue a more permanent decision on the law.
Activists for the abortion rights resolution, which is the latest in a series of similar measures, welcomed and said it would give doctors more time to get permission.
“Today’s decision assures women in Louisiana that they will be safe from a deceptive law to prepare them for health and their rights,” said Nancy Northup, president and chief executive of the Reproductive Rights Center, which has filed a lawsuit on behalf of three out of five clinics.
It was not immediately clear whether the decision also applies to doctors from two clinics who were not among the applicants and who also applied for this authorisation.
Louisiana is among the eleven states that have passed similar laws, with courts in Alabama and Mississippi declaring such measures unconstitutional.
Key parts of the Texas law that would close most of the remaining clinics in the state blocked a federal judge on Friday.
Fighters for women’s rights to abortion, along with the Association of American Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association, claim that the need to have this permission places on the doctor requirements that are not medically necessary.
Opponents of abortions argued that the measures were aimed at protecting women’s health, and some also welcomed the fact that the clinics would have been closed due to the measures.
The Center for Reproductive Rights said that only one doctor in Louisiana is allowed to perform abortions.
If all doctors in the state were forced to stop performing abortions, this doctor would also stop performing the procedure for fear of his safety, the group said.
In response, the Louisiana authorities said they would not punish doctors who perform the abortions while they wait for the processing of the application for the grant of rights.
Due to late diagnosis and poor availability of treatment, ovarian cancer kills more often in rural areas
Angelina Jolie and her brother James released a video with the hold of their late mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women in rural Australia are at a higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than their counterparts in the city.
Researchers analyzed medical records of more than 1,100 Australians diagnosed in 2005 with ovarian cancer and found that only 35% lived five years after diagnosis.
Researcher Susan Jordan from the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said women in rural and remote areas of the state were about 20 percent more likely to die during the study than women in urban areas.
SMALL STUDY: New medications can slow down lung and ovarian cancer
Researchers followed the women during seven years of treatment.
Dr Jordan said the chances of survival were influenced by the age of women at the time of diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, other existing diseases and socio-economic status.
The lowest survival rate was observed in older women who had been diagnosed with cancer at a more advanced stage.
Women in rural and remote areas of the state were about 20 percent more likely to die during the study than women in urban areas.
Although the study was not designed to determine why women living outside the city were more likely to die from ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan says the factors could be late diagnosis and poor availability of treatment.
“The disease is best treated by gynecologists who usually reside in larger cities,” she said.
Despite improving remote medical services to overcome the barrier in the form of distance, the doctor suggested that it would help strengthen transportation services that would allow specialists to heal women closer to their homes, and programs to support people who are being treated far from their families.
Dr Jordan said the study revealed that the long-term survival of women with ovarian cancer is low regardless of geographical location, highlighting the need for better treatment and preventive programs.
Research funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer will be published in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, at the age of 33, a young mother named Elisha Neave from Gold Coast was diagnosed with an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
Garden centres regret the reduction in the number of homeowners
According to an HTA study published by the Financial Times, the decline associated with the extraordinary loss of homeowners under 35 could lead to the fact that until today’s young generation of consumers reaches “the main age group of gardeners,” garden centers will lose millions of dollars.
According to the report, people who rent a home will spend on their gardens, on average, 55% of the amount that people living in their own home.
As other threatening factors, the industry, which earns an estimated <0xC2><0xA3>5 billion a year, indicates an increase in the number of people living in highly urbanized areas where there are no gardens, preference for tile flooring rather than foregrounds used as a parking space, and diminishing garden size.
In the Greater London area, where the share of owned homes has fallen from 61% to 43% in six years, one household has the lowest spending on garden products in Britain.
HTA and the Royal Gardening Society stated that housing in a dungeon or lack of space does not mean that people could not grow plants.
Guy Barter, chief gardening adviser for RHS, said: “It’s very popular for tenants to grow plants in pots – when they move, they can take the plants with them.”
The HTA report revealed that the “golden age” of the garden retail sector was between 1997 and 2005 and was the result of a higher share of homeowners and economic prosperity lasting from the 1980s to the mid-1990s.
He also predicted higher yields for this year due to better weather, which came after unfavourable conditions in March and April.
When the Eastern dictator preaches about democracy.
After Putin, at the meeting of his youth organization, which most reminds me of Hitlerjugend, saved him with nuclear weapons and basically made it clear to everyone that their views were stolen from him, he gave us a lecture today on democracy.
But I have such a feeling that the current regime in Russia exhibits many features of the fascist state.
The great nations have one thing in common, and that is that they are able to control both the insidious nationalism and the complex of inferiority can transform into imperialist scoundrels.
Time seems to run differently in the East than in the West.
While the Western world thought that the era of wars of domination over Europe was long gone, in the East, on the contrary, it thinks that they have been overlooked for a long time and it is necessary to regain their international position.
Such a mood and frustration prevailed in Germany in the 1930s, just before the Nazis seized power, and then followed the outbreak of nationalism unlike the present situation in Russia.
And then the totally consistent cult of a strong leader, the beating of journalists, the elimination of inconvenient political opponents, the discrimination of minorities and homosexuals, that is certainly quite similar.
Vladimir Putin, and certainly much of the Russians, is probably missing after the time when Russia ruled half the world and the other half trembled before them.
Perhaps the Western politicians did it themselves, maybe a little bit of Vladimir shoved his shoulders, maybe they didn’t invite him where he wanted to go, and maybe they started to underestimate him, and he just behaved like a typical Russian man.
He did his homework, pretended that he didn't want to go anywhere, and razed the knives at home.
Now he's decided to get his lost position back.
It starts slowly, it has time.
He's probably a leader for life, so where would he be in a hurry?
He sent the Caucasians, now he sends the Ukrainians, then there are the dwarves from the Baltics.
The Russian bear has been sniffing in the skin for a long time.
This will surely be noticed by China, which is jumping a lot and is definitely making a far easterly stop.
And those Germans of Vladimir's are also pretty excited about how well they are and I gave them that in 45 so ass.
How about making a new Novorossiy in Karlovy Vary?
That would be the basement and ours there are a lot of them and how they suppress them there and the dacha already wanted to take the lectern out of them.
After all, our veterans so far remember how they were in Czechoslovakia.
Well, that's their prime minister, Mr. Sobotka, he's so soft, he can be peeled like onions, and I'll eat their whole EU.
That would be the way to jump on the big Russia.
They need to be reminded where their place is.
And we're going to use our private money that lives on their territory as explosives.
There are enough Russians everywhere, and if they say they are suppressing them there, they are simply suppressing them there, and we will not leave it that way, we will protect them.
And Russia will rule again, for what else is he born to do.
Europe is good only as a template on which a proud Ivan can dance a cossack.
Turkey Calls on U.S. Diplomat for Espionage Report
Turkey’s foreign minister has called the country’s highest-ranking U.S. diplomat to explain a report on U.S. and British espionage activities in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bulent said the U.S. Charge d'Affaires and Turkish state officials had negotiated the report on Monday.
German magazine Der Spiegel and online magazine The Intercept said that, according to documents provided by a former analyst at the U.S. National Security Agency, Turkey was a priority target of U.S. and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish media, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan underscored the importance of the report and said that all major states are watching each other.
An earlier report by the German intelligence service, which also targeted Ankara, sparked a more outrageous reaction from the Turkish government.
Game of Thrones series introduces further tricks of the fourth series
The creators of Game of Thrones are currently shooting episodes of the fifth order of the iconic series.
At the same time, they were proud of how the tricks of the fourth series came about.
The most visible are computer adaptations of the serial environment and mass scenes, when from the clutches of soldiers becomes the giant army of the famous Daenerys.
Magaluf Police Director Accused of Corruption
The plaintiffs presented evidence of blackmail by police and civil servants of the town hall in the Calvia municipality to the Mallorca State Prosecutor’s Office on Friday.
The director of police in Calvia, on the holiday island of Mallorca, was arrested on charges brought by businessmen and bar owners in the infamous party district of Magaluf.
Chief Inspector José Antonio Navarro was taken into custody after he was accused of corruption by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, a street where most of Magaluf’s bars and nightclubs are located.
According to the Mallorca Diario, on Friday, complainants presented evidence of blackmail by police and civil servants of the town hall in the Calvia region to the prosecutor’s office for the fight against corruption.
Two other local police officers have been arrested by the Spanish state police for being linked to the corruption charge and will be interrogated by a judge along with Navarre.
The Spanish national newspaper ABC quoted dissatisfied owners of night businesses as saying that the public sector benefits have a serious impact on their business.
“It’s not about making money for a long time, it’s about survival,” one businessman told the court.
Don’t play with our lives.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf got to the main page of magazines around the world after a video of an eighteen-year-old British tourist who gave oral sex to 24 men during a bar tour appeared on YouTube.
Since then, the island authorities have been trying to oversee the drunks and bullies in a number of holiday parties in Magaful by reducing the number of notorious alcohol tours around bars.
In addition, the Playhouse club, where there was an event with the provision of oral sex, was forced to close for a year and together with the organizers of the tour of the bars of the company Carnage to pay a fine of 55,000 euros ($73,000).
The tourist resort of Magaluf, which is especially popular with the British, has also witnessed many alcohol-induced accidents, including a fashionable wave known as “balconing”, where people jump from one balcony to another or from the balcony to the hotel pool.
The first day of spring marked by rain and storms that had an impact on the flight at the airport in Adelaide
JARO brought south of South Australia ice surprises, came with heavy rains and strong winds that seriously hit the airports in Adelaide.
Another 5 mm of rainfall in the city is expected to fall by nine o'clock in the evening and another 6.6 mm will fall during the night on Sunday.
The last rain came along with a few short gusts associated with the storm and wind surges, which began about eight o’clock in the evening and caused nearly 4 mm of precipitation in about ten minutes.
After several early spring doses came after winter last week, temperatures in the city fell again to just 15.8 <0xC2><0xB0>C on Monday.
It is believed that stormy weather contributed to the delayed arrival of Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane was due to land sometime after 19:30, but at short distances it was hit by a change in speed or direction of wind and was forced to postpone the landing.
Wind gusts at Adelaide airport reached a speed of about 50 km/h on the ground at that time.
Flight data indicated that the aircraft had to land from the second landing and eventually arrived at about 20:40.
The delay of the aircraft subsequently caused the delay of other flights, including the Emirates flight from Dubai and the Qantas flight from Sydney.
According to forecasts, on Tuesday temperatures in Adelaide will reach a maximum of 16 <0xC2><0xB0>C and one or two overhangs may occur.
Israeli children return to school after Gaza war
Thousands of Israeli children from areas near the Gaza Strip returned to school on Monday after spending the summer in anti-bomb shelters, while during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, they attacked their homes with rockets and mortars from behind.
The beginning of the school brought a sense of joy and excitement to the communities in southern Israel, but signs of fighting are still visible.
In Ashdod, a town in the south of the country, employees of a kindergarten that was hit by a rocket removed from the wall the remains of the shells and slowly awaited the return of children.
“We’re a little scared, but we’re looking forward to it,” said Ronit Bart, a resident of the kibuku Saad and an English teacher at the local school.
A lot of kids from this area really need to get back to their daily routine.
Her 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, revealed that “it’s a little weird” to go back to school all of a sudden.
“We’ve had a few difficult moments and we haven’t left the house at all,” she said.
Kibuc, located near the Gaza border, visited President Reuven Rivlin to offer his support to the people.
Until the ceasefire last week ended the war, thousands of residents of border settlements such as Saad stayed inside their homes or abandoned their homes and traveled to safer areas away from Gaza to escape missiles and minomites.
Many residents of Nachal Oz, a village near the Gaza border in which a Palestinian minomet shot killed a four-year-old boy, are weighing back.
The Minister of Education said that about 12 families had not yet returned.
Their children have been temporarily placed in substitute schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a town on the border with Gaza, which was heavily hit by Palestinian fire.
He urged the children to study diligently, and added: "We will provide you with education and security."
On Tuesday, Israel and Hamas agreed on an unlimited peace agreement.
While the ceasefire led to an immediate end to the fighting, it did not solve key problems such as Hamas’s demand to end the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and reopen the airports and ports in Gaza.
Israel is demanding the disarmament of Hamas and the return of the bodies of two soldiers killed in the war.
A new round of indirect negotiations is expected to begin later this month in Egypt.
According to estimates by the Palestinians and the United Nations, more than 2,100 Palestinians died in the war, of which three-quarters were civilians and at least 494 children.
Israel doubts these numbers and estimates that at least half of those killed were radicals, although it has no clear evidence for these claims.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians were killed, including a Thai worker.
Hamas and other radicals from Gaza fired 4,591 missiles and mortar shells during the fighting on Israeli cities, mainly in the south of the country.
The Israeli military has carried out more than 5,000 airstrikes and other attacks.
Israeli attacks have damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza and an estimated 250,000 people have been hiding in hundreds of UN schools, which have turned into temporary shelters.
Because of the tens of thousands of people still in hiding, and because of the ongoing fighting, school officials postponed the start of the school year last week.
“I hope the school will open soon so that we can finish our education as well as the Jewish children and other children in the world,” said Mohammad Amara, a thirteen-year-old boy from a school in the largest city of Gaza.
Wrapped up: I'm behind the guard.
Lafatu hurts the temperature
The Czech national football team met before noon in Prague before Wednesday's preparatory match with the United States and the following opening match of the European Championship qualifier against the Netherlands.
From a three-and-a-half-member squad, Spartan striker David Lafata is having trouble with the temperature.
David is not here yet, but Sparta had some problems last week, it was more players and David probably still has some of those problems.
But we want him to be here and be okay as soon as possible," coach Pavel Vrba told reporters.
"If it's two or three days, or he's going to be fit tomorrow, it'll be seen according to his medical condition, which our doctor decides," he added.
The other players are fine.
"Of course someone has some pain, but it's not that they can't train or participate in a match on Wednesday with the United States," the Czech coach said.
On Sunday evening, Vrba called as the last player of Spartan backup Lukas V<0xC3><0xA1>ch.
He admitted that it was not an easy decision, other midfielders were also taken into account.
I decided on the basis that Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> is a prospective player who is 25 years old.
The decision was very difficult, but I stand behind it," Vrba told V<0xC3><0xA1>chov.
What about Shural?
Let's see what happens to Lata.
It is not excluded that in the event of health problems, the nomination could still change.
On the weekend with great performance, for example, Liberec Josef <0xC5><0xA0>ural, who gave the hattrick.
Of course, there are players who have been showing form lately.
We'll see how David Lafat is doing.
In the event that he will not be able to be available on Wednesday, I do not claim that I cannot nominate any of the players who have played in the Czech league," Vrba said.
This afternoon, Strahov will be represented, followed by the classic pre-match training before the USA duel at the Summer Olympics, which will be open to fans and followed by an autograph.
The match against the Americans will be played on Wednesday from 20:15 and the national team in it will strive for a premier victory under Vrbo.
In the previous three pre-matches, he paid two draws and lost once.
The qualifying match against the Netherlands is scheduled for September 9 at 20:45.
A pedestrian goes to the Netherlands to Italy
Vrba is happy to have more time for training, unlike her previous encounters.
It’s an advantage if you have players for eight days and you can practice certain things with them that we didn’t have that much time for before.
Now we will be able to focus only on preparing for the Netherlands as best we can," Vrba said.
The Dutch will present themselves before the match in Prague on Thursday in Italy and the duel will personally be followed by the former temporary representative coach Josef Pe<0xC5><0xA1>ice.
It gives us the information from the match.
But it's not just about him, we're going to have a game and we're going to play it.
A new coach is coming to the Netherlands, we will see what changes there will be," Vrba told bronze medalists from the recent World Cup.
According to highly tracked statistics, the prices of apartments in the winter period have increased the most over the last seven years.
According to the housing value index in the Australian capital RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic, housing prices rose 1.1% in August, the agency said on Monday.
The increase led to an overall increase in June, July and August to 4.2%, the highest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9%, more than doubled in one year to August 2013, but the profit was not evenly distributed in the country.
RP Data Research Director Tim Lawless said that they are leading the market in Sydney and Melbourne.
The figures from RP Data show that the prices of apartments in Sydney last year increased by 16.1%, while the prices in Melbourne increased by 11.7%.
Other strongest markets included Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, with prices rising by an average of between five and six percent.
On the other side of the scale was Canberra, which was detrimental to the state-ordered spending reduction and where prices rose by only 1.4% during the year.
Lawless said that as spring begins, the number of properties for sale will increase in the coming months, which will be a “real test” for the market.
“Given the continued high rate of auction sales, generally high sales speeds, and low interest rates, it is likely that the value of housing will increase further over the next three months,” he said.
Lenny Henry: My father never hugged me.
He never said, "I love you."
Henry was born in 1958 as one of seven children of Jamaican immigrants in Dudley, Midlands.
They had a cooler relationship with their father, who died when Henry was 19, and who worked in the factory.
Henry rehearses the comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is partly based on an imaginary interview with his father and is part of the Radio 4 series.
The soundtrack is a mix of reggae and rap and the melody is optimistic.
Henry, however, had to deal with some unpleasant childhood memories.
After his mother's death, Henry has undergone "fundamental" therapy and is now thinking about his relationship with his father.
He knew very little about him.
You’ve never seen his face, you just heard his voice, “Stop that frame.
Leave your sister alone.
Get up!
I want to watch cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton — when I was a child, they were adults — went to a bar with him and discussed things like the shape of a glass of beer or the beauty of a cricket strike.
I've never spoken to him like this.
For most of my life, he was a serious guy in the corner who reads newspapers.
Henry recently visited the Dudley foundry, and although the conditions were better than in his father's time, he looked at what life must have been like for him.
Today there's a little more light, but it's still a dark, smoked, cloudy labyrinth where flames explode and there's a lot of smoke and dust.
Dad always went into the bathroom and just lay there, then it was heard how slowly he began to sing for himself, because he was was wasting the smelter.
As I walked around, I realized that he had been doing this for years to enjoy his family, and I began to appreciate him more.
Nevertheless, Henry lived his childhood without parental love.
Dad didn't hug anyone, he didn't say, "I love you."
When mom was sick and dying, we started to say, "I love you, I love you, I love you."
His daughter Billie, whom he has with Dawn French, allowed him to experience the love he was missing as a child.
Can you stop saying, "I love you"?
Don't keep hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22!
With Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mom
Franch, who he has been married to for 25 years, is still good friends.
Dawn's good.
Why shouldn't Dawn and I be friends?
She's a great mom.
Henry's own mother had diabetes.
It was one of the things that killed her.
So when I had a lot, a lot, a lot of overweight and the symptoms of diabetes started to manifest, the doctor said to me, “You have to make a radical change.”
So I started going to the big fitness center and also I had to stick to a drastic diet to get rid of the symptoms.
It's very hard.
It's exhausting.
No one wants to eat the carrot itself.
The change in Henry’s career direction may be reflected in his elegant, short-cut beard.
After receiving critical acclaim for his Othella, he plunged into the theatre.
It was followed by a comedy full of mistakes and the plots of August Wilson.
It’s a different experience than sitcoms and comedies that filled his hectic work life.
He started when he was 16 and worked in a factory.
The DJ spotted him on stage as he parodied someone, and wrote about him for the talent contest New Faces.
His television career began in the mid-1970s: "For a long time I was the only black imitator/comic on television."
He studied at the march.
In addition to being noticed by the public, between 1975 and 1985, I also had to learn how to come up with working jokes, to be a star and to perform on television, and it was really hard.
Lenny in New Faces in 1975
Since his manager owned the rights to the stage production of The Black and White Minstrel Show, an entertainment show in which actors dressed as blacks, Henry eventually performed in it with his comedy for five years.
That's why my family was sick.
I wish it never happened, but I don't regret it.
Even though it was a strange and embarrassing position, I worked on big scenes and learned how to work with the crowd.
What was “years and years acclaimed as the main product of British television” but at the same time was also a “great parody of blacks.”
In the 1980s, Henry worked in alternative comedy circles and portrayed characters who at the same time ridiculed and celebrated British black culture.
The first series of The Lenny Henry Show began airing in 1984, and in the 1990s he was known as chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef!.
The next decade took him from commercials, documents, TV shows, and roles in movies, but after broadcasting his LennyHenry.tv series on the BBC in 2008, he said, "So what are you going to do now, Lene, it looks like you're stuck in one place or another."
Another in the series was a documentary show on Radio 4 called What's So Great About...?/What's so great about...?
The first was Shakespeare.
I had a serious allergy to Shakespeare.
We didn't really learn it at school, and I thought it was something for the white middle class.
So I was afraid of it.
Everyone we've interviewed on the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench, said, "You should try."
Don't be afraid if you don't know what you're talking about.
Try a few words and you'll see why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry made twenty lines of Othello's final speech for the document, and he was already in it.
It made me feel like I could do it.
It's like it gives me more courage.
“That’s about it. It’s a serious thing, take it seriously, learn the text, find out something about it.
So the rehearsals were tough, and I've been reading this game for months and months before.
And it was a success.
It looked like they were waiting for a break, which didn't happen.
Soon he began to play in a comedy full of mistakes.
All of a sudden, I was at the National Theatre, and I couldn't believe it.
At one point, I thought, "You've changed."
There was a technical flaw, and Henry instinctively felt he had to take responsibility for the audience's seizure.
“The voice in my head said to me, ‘Before the computer fixes, you have to entertain them for ten minutes now.’”
Instead, the theatre director announced that the performance will continue as soon as the problem is resolved.
I left the stage and something in me said, “Hm, thank God.”
It's not my responsibility.
Someone else can solve this for me.
“You play, so stay in the role.”
Henry v Plotech v Duchess Theatre
Learning the plot text was a challenge.
Panic is pretty good, it adds determination.
The game was also well received, so it's like a sign from God saying, "You should do this."
Of course, he says it with a loud voice.
So I'm staying with it.
I really like it.
I'm happy to be in the rehearsal.
Henry, however, remains a comedian's brain - our conversation interrupts with humorous performances as he enters and exits the role of an imitator.
I decided not to make stand-ups, because having satisfaction from a room full of strangers is a little dangerous, I would say.
If you're still looking for something, you can get into a blind alley.
Sometimes when I want to, I do Live at the Apollo, but it doesn't make me as happy as it used to be.
I asked him if he would ever do a stand-up tour.
The joy of sitting in the same room with a director who helps give the outlines the beginning, the middle and the end of the journey – I don’t think I’d ever want to give up.
So your new incarnation?
I think so.
I enjoy acting.
It's fun.
You're always telling stories, which is great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya Registers Officials to Enlighten Non-Existing Employees
Kenya has begun biometric registration of all its civil servants to try to remove non-existent employees from the government’s payroll.
According to the government statement, employees who do not register in the next two weeks will stop receiving salaries.
The government believes that thousands of people receive salaries even after they have left the government service.
After taking office in 2013, President Uhuru Kenyatta vowed to prevent corruption in the state administration.
An audit conducted this year showed that the state comes monthly at least one million dollars (<0xC2><0xA3>700,000) on salaries of non-existent employees and in case of further abuse of official power.
The government suspects that salaries will continue to be deposited into bank accounts even after the employee’s death or after the employee leaves the state administration, according to BBC reporter Wanyama Chebusiri, the capital of Nairobi.
All civil servants must arrive within the next two weeks at the identification centres, where their data will be recorded biometrically, the government said in a statement.
He also says that anyone who fails to get without a sufficient apology will be excluded from the payroll.
“By learning the real public service employees, this measure will contribute significantly to its economy and will also be used to clean up the payroll at both levels of government, thus solving the problem of non-existent employees,” said Anne Waiguru, Secretary of the Ministry of Development.
Dozens of Turkish Police Officers Arrested for ‘Stealing’ Against the Government
Local media say a total of 33 police officers have been detained in Turkey on suspicion of “conspiracy against the government.”
The police have not yet commented on the case.
According to Hurriyet Dail News, 14 high-ranking officials were among the detained.
Some of them were involved in a December corruption investigation, which targeted government officials, including four ministers, in the U.S. government.
In July, several Turkish police officers were arrested for allegedly organising a criminal gang and telephone interception.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (at the time the prime minister) described their actions as part of the actions of Islamic cleric Fethullah Gülen against him and other people in power.
Not all children in Ukraine have returned to school
Most schools in Ukraine reopened on Monday (September 1) after the summer holidays.
This day is traditionally important for families and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk took his daughter to school.
On this occasion, he told the present journalists that not all schools had reopened, but that he was determined to defend the country for the next generation:
Not all schools held a traditional ceremony on September 1st.
There is no peace in Ukraine as a whole.
We have to fight for peace.
The whole of Ukraine, the united Ukrainian front, must fight for peace.
Alexan Pastukhov, a teacher at a school in Slavyansk, visited by Jace<0xC5><0x88>uk's daughter, spoke in Russian.
We hope that peace will finally be achieved here and that children will gain knowledge that will be useful to them in the future.
The first day of school is traditionally celebrated by children wearing embroidered shirts, bringing balloons and giving flowers to teachers.
In Ron Fairhead, the BBC may have found a boss for difficult times
It brings with it clouds of glory from the world of banking, media management and the internal conclave of the conservative party.
He has experience in the front lines.
She started her career at consulting firm Bain and Co, then continued through Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and into the media world of Pearsons.
For seven years, she served as Executive Director of the Financial Times, resigning when her junior colleague took over the top position at Pearson's parent company.
It is said that her retreat was close to <0xC2><0xA3>1 million.
Its political portfolio is also extensive.
David Cameron was advised by Lord Browne, the former director of BP, when Cameron needed private expertise in Whitehall: she became an adviser to the government.
Her husband is a former member of the city council.
In May, I described the director's work as a pot with poison.
Not only is the BBC a vast and messy entity at the center of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
The corporation turns in two directions: inside the top layer of the hierarchy of the BBC’s own leadership, but also outside the voice of the public in times of unrest when things don’t work.
This is an almost unsustainable monopoly that calls for a thorough reform.
But a director who would risk coming into a company as complex as the Chinese dynasty, will disperse it and thus prepare himself for work.
It's a tough challenge.
If it wasn’t that hard, a lot of people would like to see the BBC shrink – its power, its finances – and how its status is being revised.
With the expansion of competition and the new technology challenging old security, there is a great danger to the BBC in direct negotiations on concession fees.
For a modest amount of <0xC2><0xA3>145.50 a year, the British public buys a stake in something that is arguably the largest media company in the world.
The BBC tells a good story: It claims that its production reaches 96% of households and each costs only 40 pence a day.
In addition, the BBC’s popularity is evidently rising to 53% of supporters, compared to 31% ten years ago.
BBC service usage models have changed: Today the headlines are shown to me on my mobile phone and on the shows I’ve skipped, I can watch on iPlayer.
But the BBC continues to be a very beloved and amazing institution.
She needs an amazing director - I hope she's found one.
Texas Gov. Perry Says He Didn't Approve An Offensive Tweet
The tweet from Texas Governor Rick Perry’s official Twitter account, which was released on Sunday, contained an offensive image of the Democratic Attorney General who initiated Perry’s criminal charges of abuse of power.
The tweet was later deleted and another tweet was posted on Perry's account, which distanced itself from the previous one.
My account has been deleted by a tweet that was not authorized.
“I don’t agree with the tweet and I pulled it off,” he said in another post.
Perry's assistants didn't answer the queries immediately.
Although the tweets were sent from Perry’s official account, it is not clear who is actually responsible for his administration.
The previous tweet was posted by the unsympathetic, humorous image of Travis County Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted of intoxication in April 2013.
When she refused to resign, Perry refused to pay the money for her office, which led Perry, a possible candidate for president in the 2016 election, to a grand jury in Austin this month.
The tweet read: “I don’t always drive with three times the blood alcohol level, but if I do, I complain to Governor Perry that he’s asking me to take responsibility for it.”
I'm the toughest Democrat in Texas.
The investigation against Perry was not conducted by Lehmberg's office.
Michael McCrum, the Special Prosecutor of San Antonio, was in charge of him, who was appointed by a Republican judge.
Perry was found innocent and called the charges a tactical, political maneuver.
His qualified legal team has asked a judge overseeing the case to reject the charge because the use of laws to prosecute the longest serving governor in Texas history is unconstitutional.
Perry interrupted the payment of $7.5 million from the state fund for the public interest department, which is based in Travis County and pursues corruption in Texas, after Lehmberg refused to resign.
The rejection sparked a formal complaint by a left-wing group of civic activists.
Perry's official account is active - and sometimes it's celebrated.
After he finished fifth on his party committee in Iowa during his 2012 presidential campaign, Perry responded to speculation that he could end up with a tweet with his own photo of running near the lake and saying, “Here I am, South Carolina!”
According to Berkeley, the housing market is back to normal.
One of London’s most prominent development companies has warned that the housing market in south-east England has “returned” to normal levels of activity.
Housing in the capital has been the subject of high demand and rising prices and widespread fears of the credit bubble prompted the Bank of England to introduce mortgage limits in June.
Tony Pidgley, founder and chairman of the development company for demanding Berkeley clients, said on Monday: “Since the beginning of the current fiscal year, the market has returned from its peak in 2013 to the normal level of transactions.”
The London housing market was successful during the decline, as the capital was flooded by buyers from abroad.
According to the Catastrophe Authority, prices in the city rose by 18.5 per cent last year alone, far ahead of the average of 6.7 per cent in England and Wales.
The average selling price of private, affordable and student housing from Berkeley rose by about a fifth last year and rose to <0xC2><0xA3>423,000 at the end of April.
However, because of the strengthening of the pound, they are not so attractive in recent months for foreign buyers of London property - some of them also threatened the introduction of new property taxes and talk about the possible "seat taxes" with which politicians came before next week's parliamentary elections.
London’s real estate firm Foxtons warned last week that an April review of the mortgage market, which introduced stricter rules for loans, would also slow the pace of market growth in property sales and prices during the second half of the year.
The new data showed a decline in the amount of approved mortgages for the month of July on Monday, suggesting that the housing market is calming down.
Hamptons International, another real estate firm, has dropped its forecast of a 3% increase in London real estate prices in 2015, based on the fact that home prices have already started to fall.
According to WA Ellis, the volume of transactions in London’s most expensive neighborhoods such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington has decreased by a quarter each year.
Still, the demand for housing in the capital was a blessing for Berkeley as it increased cash for forward sales to more than <0xC2><0xA3>2.2 billion.
Pidgley added, “Demand for the right, well-looking housing in a good location has remained the same and that’s why forward sales have kept up.”
In June, the company announced that it had sold 3,742 properties from the beginning of the year to the end of April, almost a third more than before the crisis peaked in 2007.
Annual earnings before tax increased by 40% to <0xC2><0xA3>380 million, yields by 18% to <0xC2><0xA3>1.6 billion.
On Monday, ahead of Pidgley’s annual meeting, he said Berkeley’s annual revenues were expected to be in line with current market expectations.
Analysts agree that the annual profit before tax will be <0xC2><0xA3>450 million.
Berkeley's stock paused at <0xC2><0xA3>23.96 this afternoon on the London Stock Exchange.
The hacker posted photos of Jennifer Lawrenc naked on the internet
Jennifer Lawrenco is coming to the 85th Academy Awards.
Photographs of Oscar winner Jennifer Lawrenco have leaked to the internet due to a hacker who claimed to have a “list” of photos of hundreds of other start-up actresses.
A spokesperson for Hunger Games confirmed that Lawrenc's photos were real and criticized the hacker for "obvious privacy violations."
The authorities have already been contacted and will prosecute anyone who publishes the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrenc.
The hacker photos, which were originally posted on the 4chan image sharing server, allegedly gained thanks to a gap in the Internet storage system of the Applu iCloud. The alleged list of photos of the victims hacked by BuzzFeed includes the names of the dozens of victims by Olzsente, MaryKarve, MaryKarve, and Rihanna.
It is not clear how many photos are authentic, but the star of the film "Scott Pilgrim Against the Rest of the World" Winstead also criticized the act on Twitter.
“I hope that those of you who are looking at the photos that my husband and I took in private at home years ago are satisfied,” Winstead wrote on Twitter.
Victoria Justice, known for the cable television series Nickolodeon "iCarly" and "Victorious", denied that the photos were real. She tweeted: "These are my alleged nude photos are PODVRH, people."
It's better to throw it away in the pot. *deliberate word-speech*.
Buzzfeed said on Sunday evening that pop star Ariana Grande's spokeswoman denied the photos were true.
An Extraordinary Demonstration of Howard Jacobson's Praised New Romance of Love and the Letter "J"
They disintegrated, that's the best way to describe it, they gradually disintegrated like a cardboard box that someone left in the rain.
It was only from time to time that a woman told him that he was too serious, too complex, too fierce, isolated, and maybe a little sluggish.
And then she shook his hand.
He admits it in vain.
He could piss like a frog, yes.
The last victim of this ability was the beginning of a love affair, which more than usual promised to relieve him from the loneliness of life and perhaps even give him some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a fragile beauty with wild hair and a flying heart from a village on the northern island that was even more remote and inhospitable than Port Reuben.
She came to the south with an older companion, whom Kevern thought to be her aunt, who inherited the property in a wet but beautiful valley called, incidentally, Paradise Valley.
No one lived in the house for several years.
The pipes swirled, there were dead spiders in the tubs, the slugs slid down the windows, as if they thought the place belonged to them, the garden was overgrown, and the grass resembled the huge heads of cabbage.
The house looked like a hut of children's stories, terrifying and at the same time charming, with a garden full of secrets.
Author profile: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is on the preliminary list of nominations for the 2014 Man Booker Prize.
The shortlist will be announced next week.
Kevern and Ailinn sat on the folding chairs in the long grass and held hands, enjoying an unexpectedly warm spring afternoon, in the absence of a public station, which supplied the region with the comforting music of the commune to the commune of the commune, the commune of the commune of the commune, and the soothing news of the old commune of the commune.
You've got too big legs.
Because of their natural aggressiveness, such songs were no longer played on the radio.
They weren't banned -- they weren't really banned -- they just didn't play.
They helped them get to the desuetud, as well as the word desuetudo itself.
People’s taste has proven what regulations and outlaws would never do, and just as people, when it comes to books, choose memoirs in which the poor become rich, cooks and love novels, so ballads are chosen in music.
The cavern was let down by the day and began playing the imaginary piano and sang the serenade to Aillin's big feet with a coarse, comedic voice.
The family didn't understand.
"It was a favorite song from jazz pianist Fats Waller," he said, and he automatically attached two fingers to his lips.
His father always did that when he wanted to suppress the letter j before it came out of his mouth.
It started as a game when he was young.
His father told him that he was playing the game with his father.
When you didn't put two fingers in front of the mouth at the word that started with j, it cost you a penny.
It wasn’t funny then, and it wasn’t funny now.
He just knew it was expected of him, it was all.
He had to explain what jazz was.
Ailinn's never heard one.
Even jazz, although it was not built directly out of the law, did not play.
Improvisation is out of fashion.
There was only room in life for one "if".
When she started playing the melodies, people wanted to know exactly where it would end.
It's the same with humor.
His unpredictability got people on their nerves.
And jazz was the humor of the song.
Although he had not heard of Sammy Davis Jr. until he was ten years old, Kevern knew jazz from his father's semi-secret collection of old CDs.
At least Aillin didn't have to say that Fats Waller was black.
Due to her age, she could not remember a time when the favorite singers were not black.
Also without laws or pressure.
Loose society is one in which every part of it agrees with gratitude – with the gratitude of those who have been fortunately saved – with the principle of group gratitude.
People of Afro-Caribbean descent with temperament and constitutions used for entertainment and athletics, so they sang and ran.
People from the Indian subcontinent, as if by nature gifted for electronics, took responsibility for the fact that no family would be without a functional phone.
The Poles who remained were plumbers, the Greeks who remained were washing dishes.
Those of the Persian Gulf and Levant states, whose grandparents did not leave the country quickly, while it was happening, WHY it happened - they feared that they would accuse them of not putting them in the fire, they feared that they would not lay them on the stoves after the storks, they feared that the fire would be spent on the storks, and they were afraid that the next time they would open them.
Each according to his talent.
Since she only listened to the ballads, Ailinn could hardly understand how music could be made from the polite words that Cavern had just sung to her.
Music was an expression of love.
"They're not really rude," Kevern said.
Maybe just for people who have too big legs.
My father never hurt anyone, but he loved this song.
He spoke too much, but the neglected garden provided an illusion of security.
A word could not escape behind the soundproof sheets.
Ailinn still didn't understand.
Why would your father like something like that?
He wanted to say it was a joke, but he shrugged to put two fingers to his mouth again in her presence.
She already thought he was weird.
"It seemed funny to him," he said at last.
She shook her head unbelievably and overshadowed Kevern’s view.
There was nothing to be seen in the whole wide world except the confusion of her hair.
He didn't want to see anything else.
"When you think," she said doubtfully.
But that still doesn't explain why you're singing it to me.
She looked really upset.
Do I have too big legs?
He looked again.
She didn't have any feet.
Maybe a little ankles...
Are you saying you hate me because I have too fat ankles?
I hate it?
That's not true.
It's just a stupid song.
He could have said, “I love you,” but it was too early.
"Your fat ankles are attracting me right now," he tried.
I'm a little sluggish.
That didn't work out.
He wanted to be funny.
When he wanted to be funny, it often got him in trouble, because, like his father, he lacked the magic necessary to be able to shorten the cruelty that was harboring in the jokes.
Maybe his father was cruel on purpose.
Maybe it was a deliberately cruel Cavern.
In spite of the kind eyes.
Ailinn Solomons sneezed and got up from her chair, dropped the radio, and poured out the unsweetened wine.
Zinc-free wine, so he couldn't drink for it.
She seemed to tremble in her excitement like palm leaves in a storm.
"You're an idiot to me," she said.
Except it doesn't appeal to me.
She felt sorry for both her rude words and the fear she had in her eyes at the moment she stood up to him.
Did you think she'd be kicked?
She didn’t talk to him about life on the cold northern peninsula where she grew up, but he didn’t doubt that it was basically the same as here.
The same wide and icy ocean shook about them.
The same disappointment the men, then, WHAT BEEN, even more intimidating and hateful than their ancestors, smugglers and cashiers, raged from the pub to the pub, ready to lay a hand on any woman who would dare to reject them or turn them away.
Stupid?
If she doesn't pay attention, they'll show her their fists!
First, to anoint her - to anoint her became the most common expression for erotic irritation between a man and a woman: the antibody of the dull ballads of love that the radio sparked - first to anoint her, then to kill her one.
In Kevernov's view, over-cultivation, because abusing was in itself an act of violence.
Ailinn Solomons nonverbally instructed him to leave.
He got up from his bed like an old man.
She felt herself frozen, but the weight of his grief surprised her.
It was not the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
She looked at him as if she were watching him from the window on the floor, the man she had picked up what she had done.
Adam was leaving the garden, she thought.
Her heart closed because of him and because of all the men in general, no matter what a few of them beat her.
The man turned away from her, his shoulders hanged, shamed, defeated, all the fighting left him - why did she feel that she knew this look well, even though she could not afford a single moment until today, that she would ever have seen it again?
Ailinn Solomons, on her own, looked at her feet.
About twenty years after these events, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic twenty-year-old researcher working in Ofnow, a non-statutory monitoring system of the Public Mood, prepared a short article on the perpetuation of his perpetuation of light and medium-severe, and on the perpetuation of violent acts.
“A lot has been done, and a lot must be done,” she wrote, “in order to calm the innate aggression of the people who fought in many battles and won most of them, especially in the thick, hard-to-reach forests of the land.”
However, some things are irreplaceable.
It might seem that the higher the church tower, the lower the puddles.
The inhabitants breathe out over the sentimental ballads, swallow unfortunate stories and declare that they firmly believe in the value of marriage and family life, but not only that in rural areas, the old brutality is held as hardly by the peasants on the peasants and the peasants on the peasants, but also by the peasants.
"Unfortunately, you tend to have too flowery style," said her supervisor.
I would suggest that you read fewer novels.
Esme Nussbaum bowed her head.
I also have to ask: Are you an atheist?
“I feel like I don’t have to answer that,” Esme Nussbaum said.
Are you a lesbian?
Esme once again defended her right to privacy and silence.
Feminist?
Still more silence.
"I don't ask," Rabinowitz said, "that I have anything against atheists, lesbians, or feminists.
We don't have any prejudices in this workplace.
We serve unpredictable companies.
But a certain kind of hypersensitivity, which in itself is perfectly acceptable and praiseworthy, can sometimes distort judgment as you have presented it.
Obviously you yourself are prejudicial to the Church – things you call “cruel” and “brutal” could also be interpreted by others as expressions of natural strength and energy.
Still dealing with what has happened, WHEN it has happened, as if it had happened, yesterday, prepares the earth with its basic life force.
While Rabinowitz was speaking, Esme Nussbaum looked around.
Behind his head on the light board was a pink flash of recommendations that Ofnow had sent to the world for the last quarter of a century or more.
Smile at your neighbor, take care of your partner, listen to ballads, go to musicals, use your phone, talk, explain, agree, apologize.
To speak is better than to be silent, a sung word is better than a written word, but there is nothing better than love.
"I fully understand your reservations," replied Esme Nussbaum, as she was sure that her superior had finished, "and I no longer say that the wound did not heal as we claim it had healed.
My main concern is that if we are not warned in advance, we will repeat the same mistake that led to what happened, WHEN it happened.
This time, however, we will not vent anger and distrust on others.
Luther Rabinowitz put his fingertips together.
That was supposed to mean infinite patience.
"You go too far," he said, "when you describe the steps that your grandparents may have taken, and may not have done, as mistakes.
You also go too far in talking about ventilating your “outbreak” and “distrust” in “others.”
I should not remind anyone in your place that in understanding the past and protecting the present, we are not talking about “us” and “them.”
There were no “we” and there were no “them.”
All we know is that these were chaotic times.
"In which, if we are honest with each other," Esme said, "we are no one's fault.
I'm not accusing anyone.
Whether it was fair or not, what happened happened happened.
That was before.
There is nothing to add to this - we agree on this.
And just as there is no fault that can be seduced into someone, there are no things that should be corrected, even if the correction was appropriate and possible.
But what else is the past than to learn from it--
The past exists to make us forget about it.
If there's anything I can add--
Luther Rabinowitz spread his fingertips.
"I'll take your report into account," he said, letting it go.
The day she went to work as usual, she was hit by a motorcyclist who hired her on the sidewalk in a way that passersby described as "brutal and angry."
Accidents happen.
The army of the Kingdom of Lesotho says no coup is planned - the prime minister remains in South Africa
Military officers in the Kingdom of Lesotho have denied organising a coup in order to overthrow the government, and claim to be acting against the police suspected of attempting to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country and says the army surrounded his official headquarters and occupied government buildings in the capital Maseru.
After he declared that he was threatened with death, the prime minister went with his family to the neighboring South African Republic.
Army spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi said it was not in fact a coup, but an army response to the threat of “political fanatics” that police were trying to disarm.
"This morning, the Command of the Defence Forces of the Kingdom of Lesotho acted after receiving several intelligence reports that there are several groups in the ranks of the police that are planning to disarm some radical, political fanatics who were about to be made in the country."
South African government spokesman Clayson Monyela said the military actions looked like an attempt to overthrow the government.
“Although no one has declared that he has taken over government power by force, the actions of Lesotho’s defenses are apparently a sign of a coup d’état,” he said.
Military officials in the Kingdom of Lesotho said the soldiers had returned to their barracks on Sunday and there was peace in the capital.
During Thaban’s absence, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoa Metsing will be responsible for the government.
Thabane said that, in his opinion, he is the target of an attack because of his efforts to fight corruption in the country.
Since Thabane suspended parliament due to internal disputes in June, there has been tension in Lesotho.
He said that despite the opposite claim, it does not undermine his actions by the government.
Production in the euro area is at a 13-month low
Production growth slowed to a minimum of 13 months, according to a closely monitored survey in August in the euro area.
The final Eurozone Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) fell from 51.8 in June to 50.7 in August.
A number greater than 50 signifies an expansion.
There have been new orders and the factories have damaged the growing tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures come from Thursday’s meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB).
Markets will ask the bank for a clear plan on how to deal with the eurozone’s long-term recovery and the threat of deflation with inflation stagnant at 0.3%.
Speculation has emerged that ECB Director Mario Draghi may have suggested this week that he is considering quantitative easing of the eurozone, similar to the one that the United Kingdom and the U.S. joined during the financial crisis.
“Although at least some growth is better than no growth, the braking effect that has a growing economy and geopolitical uncertainty on producers is increasingly visible,” said Rob Dobson, chief economist at Markit.
The manufacturing PMI of Germany, Russia’s largest trading partner in the EU, fell to a 11-month low of 51.4.
In the second largest economy of the zone, France, the PMI fell to 46.9.
Concerns prevail over France, Italy has again gone from expansion to stagnation.
The signs that the driving force for growth in the most important industrial areas in Germany, Spain and also the Netherlands has disappeared are also not very reassuring," Dobson said.
The slowdown in the industry is likely to set oil on fire to analysts expecting the implementation of further monetary or tax incentives.
One positive report came from the Republic of Ireland, where PMI rose to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said: “The best thing to say about the August production overview of purchasing managers is that it shows that the sector is still growing.”
Producers in the euro area are currently living a very complex life, as increasing geopolitical tensions – especially between Russia and Ukraine – add even more uncertainty to the increasingly demanding conditions in many countries.
This increasing uncertainty has demonstrably affected the trade - and above all, consumer confidence, which is likely to cause some orders to be postponed or even cancelled, especially those that are expensive.
He said that as "even more likely" it appears that the ECB will eventually have to carry out some form of quantitative easing, "although we expect it to be limited."
Ten Years of Hell Survivors from Beslan: Ten Years of Horror from Occupied School Still Suffering
Ten years ago, thousands of Chechen radicals were held hostage at a school in Beslan, southern Russia.
During the three-day suffering that shocked the world, more than 330 people were killed, more than half of them children.
We went back to Beslan to look for some of the victims who escaped death during the school's brutality.
Exactly ten years after the terrifying occupation of the school in Beslan, in which 334 people, including 186 children, died, survivors warned of a new apocalypse in Ukraine last night.
When on September 1, 2004, at the beginning of the new school year, fanatical terrorists captured and murdered children and parents, it looked like the deepest bottom of hell.
Resistance to tragedy united the East and the West, leading to action and the future in this catastrophic disaster.
After ten years, we returned to Beslan, in southern Russia, to search for some of the victims who escaped death during the atrocities at the school.
We have found amazing young people who have endured misfortunes, even though the memory of hell caused by terrorists in them will live on.
What is their greatest wish?
So that the war that is now destroying Ukraine – and in which children as they were dying – is over.
Girl Trying to Get Back Into Destroyed School Gym
She was captured by leading Russian photographer Dimitri Beliakov as she only tries to get back into the bombed school gym after a bomb exploded in her underwear.
Confused Aida was desperately looking for her mother, Larissa, who is now forty.
There were fears that they were both dead, but they actually survived.
“Some woman told me to run and save my life, but I couldn’t,” Aida said.
I had my legs from blood.
I got up and climbed back to find my mom.
A soldier saved her.
After a few surgeries, she thought she was fully healed, but yesterday she said, “Three months ago, the pain returned.
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to do another operation.
I had some scraps left in my knee.
Her goal is to become a dentist so she can help people the way doctors have helped her.
“This tragedy changed my life, but it certainly did not destroy it,” she said resolutely.
“It just happened to me and it can’t be changed.
I go to the gym once a year to remember those who stayed there.
Otherwise, we try not to talk about it with friends.
The pain is too great.
My best friend and future classmate, Jerry Gapoev, were killed there.
As a child, we played together and imagined how we would go to school together.
“I don’t want to get married until I finish school and start my career.
I'll think about my family later.
She says she hasn't forgotten about the kidnapping, but the memories fade a little every year.
I am glad that so many people around the world still remember what happened, and we are so grateful for the help we have received from Britain and other countries.
When I look on the Internet at my picture climbing through the school window, I think a lot of people will see it for the first time, understand the disaster, and prevent it from happening again.
Boy Who Escaped the Rain Balls and Believed His Mother Was Dead
It was his first school day (in Russia children start school at seven years old) and survived a three-day siege of the school in the embrace of his mother Tamara.
At the time, the seven-year-old said, "My mother told me that if there was an explosion, I should lie on the ground and hold her hand."
After the explosion, he thought his mother was dying.
She said to him, "Run."
He was afraid that she was dead, he ran away and saw the crying toddler on the way, grabbed the child by the hand, and ran away with the ball in the shower.
His father Vladimir, who caught him outside, said, "Damir told me his mother was dead."
She says, "I couldn't save her."
In fact, Tamara was on her way to freedom and was lying in the hospital with her injured leg, and on the contrary, she thought her son had died.
After meeting again, she said, “I was crying with happiness.
I couldn't believe it.
He came in and hugged me.
Damir then flew to London (according to the missing News of the World), where he was declared the winner of the Bernardo's Children by then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie.
“That horror comes back every day, but I wish I could stop thinking about it,” he said yesterday.
But I can say that the memories are fading.
I remember, right after that, I threw all my pistols to play.
But today, I can play computer games where he's shooting, and I don't have a problem with that.
“I’m not afraid to go back to the gym, but I’m not thinking about myself.
I remember the kids I was playing with in the yard and they didn't get out.
We will never say that they were killed or that they were dead.
We're saying they stayed in the gym.
On a trip to London I remember well, especially how I could choose whatever I wanted in the toy shop, and how I was riding a cabriolet.
But now he is worried about places like Ukraine, where he and his friends are suffering as much as he suffered from the war.
That horror comes back every day, but I wish I could stop thinking about it
“I’m terribly sorry to anyone who has to go through such horror,” says Damir, who took part in volunteer activities at the monastery last week.
I want to help a lot.
One day I want to work for the police and I hope they will take me to the academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, says: “They killed 37 children from our neighborhood, can you imagine?
I remember that silence right after the attack, there were no kids out here screaming and running, and that silence lasted for several months.
He remembers his trip to London with Damir.
When I told our story in London, people were crying.
Then I realized how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and how they can express their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the award and the opportunity to travel to London in the fall of 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and say personally that even though it’s been ten years, I still remember meeting her and her husband in London and how they helped me and Damira.
I remember how Damir had a taste for borscht, and so they called all the Russian restaurants.
I also remember playing with waiters in the restaurant, Damir shot them with a water gun, and they ran and played with him.
And it's only been a month since the horror.
I was surprised how the British wanted to share our pain with us and how they supported us.
She said: “I still think the world hasn’t changed for the better over the past ten years.
Now there is a war in Ukraine, people are dying every day and I think a lot of children have been and will be killed.
They're the same kids as ours.
I think for a lot of people, war is just something in the news that they listen to when they’re bored or while they’re doing something else.
I know what these people are going through, what a horror it is.
I still feel it.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other, it's so sad.
Damir grew up and is a nice and quiet boy, not aggressive or angry at all.
For example, he doesn't want revenge, he doesn't care.
I know he doesn't like to remember it, but he's very close to six classmates and from time to time he goes to the gym and lights candles there.
When he was younger, he had problems with it - I remember lying on a couch with a face turned away from us sometimes and lying on it for hours.
He didn’t sleep, his eyes were open.
I also remember him throwing away all his guns or other weapons to play. Damir is 17 today, he's taller than me, pretty, smart and healthy.
I can't believe I've been sure for hours that he's dead and I'll never see him again.
When I woke up after the explosion and got up on my feet, I looked around and saw hell, there were pieces of human bodies all over the place.
I was absolutely certain that my boy didn't have a hell of a chance to survive.
“I remember yelling, ‘Damir, run, run!’ but I was convinced he didn’t hear me.
But he heard her and ran away.
So our lives go on different from others.
Grigory Ilyin, 17
The boy whose photo was taken after the attack became a symbol of horror in Beslan
Consolation: Survivor of Beslan Grigori Ilyin with his mother Fatima after the attack in 2004, right Grigori today
When he ran for his life after a Chechen terrorist shot his classmates, there was a fear pouring into his bloody face.
His photograph was one of the most shocking symbols of cruelty in Beslan.
His mother, Fatima, 54, a doctor, put him at school on his first day and rushed to take her older son Vladimir to university.
“I left two minutes before the terrorists broke into the yard, so my boy stayed there alone for three days,” she recalled.
Not entirely alone, because we had relatives there, but they all died there.
Only my Grigory survived.
As the date approaches, it becomes increasingly difficult to think and talk about it.
There will not be a single day to remember the tragedy.
It doesn't seem like it's happened long ago, I feel like it was yesterday, some moments I'm still coming back.
I promise you, no one will ever forget.
Constantly recurring memories: The photo of Grigorie (left) was one of the most shocking images of the attack and was immortalized as a statue (right)
I remember how Grigori looked forward to school that day, saying he wanted to embrace his teacher.
That he's alive, I found out when I saw him on TV.
In San Marino there is even a statue of Grigori crying.
Grigorij doesn't like this photo, and we have it hidden in the library at home.
I understand that, but I also think that because of this image, people all over the world know how much pain we feel.
Today, Grigory says: “It is important that this does not happen again.
“I doubt we will ever find out the truth.
Such tragedies are still being investigated, but no one will ever find out the truth.
Now they are investigating the boeing accident in Ukraine.
Will we ever find out what was the cause?
This world is expecting something very bad.
“I don’t understand why this is happening, because when you ask people, no one wants war, how is it possible?
Ten years is nothing for that pain.
It takes at least a little bit of time to forget.
It had an effect on my health, I still feel it.
Three or four years I had a nightmare attack, but then it got better.
Then, when I returned to school in 2004, every day I was scared.
I was thinking about my friends and classmates who killed me.
So when September 1st approaches, I go to the gym.
I want to honor the memory of my childhood friends.
It's hard for me to get into the gym, but I have to.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is past.
I don't forget it, but I don't regret it.
My life goes on.
This year I graduated from school and started studying medicine at the University of Vladikavkaz.
I want to be a cardiac surgeon.
First, I wanted to join the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but I couldn't because of my health.
I wanted to fight for my country, but it wouldn't work.
Grogory Farniyev, 20
The boy who survived despite being held at the feet of a killer terrorist
Miracle: Gregory Farniyev was held at the feet of the killer terrorist during the attack, but still managed to survive
When the attack was in full force, he was captured trapped in the gym sitting next to the bomb at the foot of the killer terrorist.
It's a real miracle that he survived.
"It seems to us as if it was yesterday," said Gregory, who wanted to become an agent of the Federal Security Service, but because of the injury he suffered during the attack, he could not.
It's still with me, it's not something I threw at my head.
Now I am older and it is said that children with bad experiences can cope better - I have to say that it is not true.
“I went to a psychologist in 2006 and then I was a little better, but I can’t forget.
And I'd like to forget.
In 2005 – a year later – this was the first and last time I ever entered the gym again.
I'm faint.
I will never go there again, and please don't ask me to show you where I'm sitting on that well-known picture.
Survivor: Gregory Farniev today, on a laptop with his photo taken in the hospital after the attack
This pain is huge and I carry it with me every day.
Friends know that I don’t like to think or talk about it, and they never ask me at school.
When it comes to physical health, I'm fine.
I have to be careful about my knee, which I've hurt, but I'm already walking normally.
But even so, due to my health, I could not attend and study at the FBS Academy in St. Petersburg as I wanted.
I sent them my documents, including medical reports, and they told me it wasn't possible.
My other favorite are animals, so I went to the vet.
I finished my second year there.
Learn how to treat all animals from "cats to cows".
He said, “I know I will never explain it to my children.
It’s not something children should know about, and it’s not something they should experience at all.
His mother, Marina, 42, said: “This pain will always be here.
He's inside and he's getting worse with his upcoming anniversary.
I will attend the commemorative ceremonies.
I know Grigory won't go.
It must be even stronger for him, because unlike me, he was there.
I was waiting for him at home and I couldn’t help him.
I'm so grateful to God that he gave it back to me, there's traces everywhere in Beslan.
It stays with us.
Gregory is an adult today, but he still carries on the horror.
It's hard to accept when something so terribly unfair happens to you.
He's a boy, he likes sports, but he can't do it because of his knee.
He underwent several surgeries, he can walk, but he can't exercise.
I'd say that 50% of the horror has already overcome it, but to overcome it completely and can't forget.
This terrible experience will always be with us.
During the attack, they killed a lot of our friends and neighbors and that pain only exacerbates.
I lost a lot of people that I loved and who were close to me.
My son is with me, and this is the greatest gift God could give me, but the loss of the dead hurts me.
I know the families in which other children were born, but also the widows who never married again.
It’s hard to accept that life goes on, even if you don’t want to.
I will never forget how my heart almost jumped out of my chest when I saw him in the hospital.
Now I'm watching what's going on in the world - wars in other places.
What are these people fighting for?
Why are they killing each other?
The war is approaching our country now, which I can hardly believe.
In the past, we were a friendly country, so how did we get to fight together now?
People and children are suffering, I am sure that many children in Ukraine have been and will be killed.
If only we could take all the rebels and throw them away as far as we can.
Alyona Tskaeva, 10
A child who took a special command to safety
Rescued: Alyon Tskaev is transported to a safe Russian special command (left).
Now she's ten (right) and she doesn't remember the tragedy at all
In 2004, the world began to suffocate when Alyona was taken out of the hands of a Russian policeman in Beslan.
She was released by the terrorists, but kept her 30-year-old mother, 10-year-old sister Kristina, and brother Makhara in custody at the school gym.
Machar, who was three years old at the time, escaped, but Alyon's mother and sister died in the massacre.
Her brother Ruslan remarried and they have a daughter with their new wife Svetlana, named after their dead daughter Kristina.
Neighbors say that Alyona, who is now ten, does not remember the attack at all, and grew out of her a bright and happy girl.
A close friend said, "It's a big happy family and Alyona and Makhar are great kids."
Ruslan is an excellent father and wants to keep children away from memories that commemorate the tenth anniversary.
You can understand why.

4 tips on how to take better photos and videos underwater
If you are interested in shooting or shooting underwater, you have a large selection of equipment at your disposal.
The cheapest option is the compact Nikon Coolpix AW120 or the GoPro Hero3<0x2B> Silver Edition outdoor camera, which costs around $300.
I took these pictures at a family party with a few cameras, all worth less than $350.
It doesn’t matter what equipment you use, but there are several rules to achieve the best results.
Check out the equipment.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the batteries and other parts are tightly closed.
Next, set the camera depending on the type of photos or videos you are taking.
Some cameras and video cameras have a scenic or shooting mode that optimizes exposure to dark underwater environments.
And before you get into it, find out how deep you can dive with your equipment.
Some cameras are designed for up to 5 feet, others for up to 50 to 60.
Read our guide to buying and evaluating digital cameras in a regular and waterproof design.
Always take a few pictures - a lot of them won't work.
Compact cameras have an LCD that will help you with the composition of photos, but outdoors do not have it.
Even if you have an LCD, it will be poorly seen underwater and the composition of the footage will be unpredictable.
So always take more pictures.
If the camera has a bracketing mode that makes a series of images with slightly different exposure scattering, use it.
Stay close to the level.
With a deeper submersion of light, it decreases significantly.
If possible, stay close to the level when shooting in the pool, lake or sea.
This will also allow you to capture more light in the photos - the deeper you dive, the less color you see.
Get close to the photographed object.
This is great advice if you are taking pictures on land, but underwater is even more important because of the more dim light.
This is especially important if you shoot with an outdoor camera: Such devices usually have a solid and wide angle of the lens, which means that if you want to fill the photo frame, you need to get closer to the objects.
Andrew Lawson was a man whose power of personality was able to change things even in an organization as huge as the NHS.
As an anesthesiologist, he dedicated his career to alleviating the pain caused by illness and treatment.
His wife recalls that one of the people who sought his help was an MI6 officer who had to live with the consequences of the torture that froze him.
Lawson understood that while doctors focus on diagnoses and diseases, the vast majority of treated patients are interested in something completely different: pain.
However, one day in 2007, he was the one who started to suffer.
"I don't feel in my skin," he wrote in May of that year.
I felt without energy.
He encountered the symptoms of the flu and found that he was impatient and his wife Juliet included remorse.
He remarked, “I want everything to happen sooner rather than later.”
When Juliet went on a business trip for a week, Lawson was unusually and inexplicably upset.
There's something wrong.
A colleague made an X-ray of his chest.
He had been skiing in the French Alps for two weeks.
X-ray results have arrived.
He had mesothelioma, an incurable tumor that affects the peritoneum or if the lung bulge.
For most types of cancer, it is difficult to determine what was their cause.
Although some smokers get lung cancer, not all patients with lung cancer have smoked.
Mesothelioma is different.
In almost all cases, it is the cause of exposure to asbestos - a building fiber material that was formerly referred to as "miracle," but is now known to be deadly.
For most of us, it was not difficult to ignore mesothelioma.
Asbestos, after all, belongs to the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in Britain since the 1960s when the ban on the use of asbestos in industry came into effect.
Even at the time asbestos was used, only certain groups of people came into close contact with it, such as insulation treasurers, builders, carpenters, and shipyard workers.
The toxin used in industry in another era is hardly seen today as a cause for concern.
But such self-esteem is not in place.
As it turns out, the mesothelioma epidemic is at its peak in Britain today.
The number of deaths in mesothelioma is higher here than in any other country in the world.
2,500 deaths from this disease per year are twice as many as the number of victims of car accidents.
Number of deaths due to mesothelioma per year since 1980 and estimated future deaths in the UK
The reason why we are only now feeling its effects, even though the use of asbestos has been illegal for years (all asbestos species were finally banned by law in 1999), is that it usually takes several decades for the mesothelioma to develop.
The disaster in the form of mesothelioma does not concern only the veterans of the construction industry.
Asbestos has been, and in many cases still is, present in the homes where we live, in the offices where we work, in the schools where we learn, and in the shops where we shop.
Thus, mesothelioma does not respect the social layer, wealth, profession or age.
Privileged bastions from London’s commercial homes to public schools are no hiding place.
Parliament is full of asbestos.
Even the hospitals where we should be treated are the repositories of this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He didn't even think of isolation.
He was trying to find out where he could come in contact with asbestos.
Then he found out.
"It's possible that a lot of asbestos was in the basement halls of Guy's Hospital, where I spent six years in practice," he wrote.
Everyone - students, nurses, doctors and doormen - used the hallways.
The question is, how many of my contemporaries will get the same disease?
Unfortunately, it was a question that he was able to partially answer.
"Of the four doctors who were in the practice at Guy's Hospital and who then had mesothelioma in the past five years," he noted in a letter in 2010, "I'm the only one who's still alive."
How many of us are sick?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma when he was 48.
When he died on February 17 of this year, he was 55.
Surviving this diagnosis for so long is not usual.
55% of people diagnosed with mesothelioma die within eight months of being diagnosed.
Illness is always deadly.
Now, then, we can only repeat Lawson's question: "How many of us will be sick with the same disease?"
According to Professor Julian Pett, a leading British mesothelioma expert, the best estimate is that between 1970 and 2050, when an asbestos epidemic occurs in Britain, about 90,000 people will die.
Most of them currently have no idea that they will die in this way.
Asbestos Mine in Quebec, Canada
With a regular look at the files in the archives of courts, which are often turned to by the disabled and require settlement, it shows how far the mesothelioma disaster has spread.
For example, in June, Marks & Spencer admitted that it had negligently exposed Janice Allen to asbestos.
She worked for the chain for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, when she oversaw two clothing department stores - one of the locations was the company's flagship, the Oxford Street store.
Allen was only 18 when she started working for M&S.
He now has two children who are over 20 years old.
“Before it happened,” he says, “I’ve never heard of mesothelioma before, I barely knew anything about asbestos.
I never even dreamed that he might touch me in some way.
There are not many people who know anything about asbestos.
Asbestos is not a single substance, but a group of six minerals.
It was named for its fibrous structure, which gives it strength and flexibility.
Three of the six minerals were used in construction.
Most often, it is possible to find chrysotile in buildings today, commonly known as white asbestos.
It has been used in roof panels, floor tiles, boiler seals and even in brake linings.
It is not as deadly as other forms of asbestos, yet the EU and WHO consider it a “large health risk” that can cause death.
But more dangerous are brown asbestos (amosite) and blue asbestos (crocidolite).
Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts claim that "there is compelling but indirect evidence that this was the main cause of the unusually high incidence of mesothelioma [in the United Kingdom]."
Marsk & Spencer Employee Exposed Asbestos at Flag Store in Oxford Street, London
Janice Allen may not consider herself a typical victim of mesothelioma, but the work of Julian Pete suggests that her story is not unusual at all.
His patient study claims that “a substantial part of mesothelioma cases without known exposure to asbestos at work or at home were likely caused by exposure to asbestos in the environment.”
A significant part of this exposure is due to the "common use and ventilation" of buildings.
It seems that no one can be sure that they are safe.
A report by Goddard Consulting, which surveyed the Westminster Palace, shows that even people in the middle of the government may not be aware that they may be exposed to asbestos.
In 2009, Goddard published a report that said the service elevators and pipes behind the parliamentary committee rooms were contaminated with asbestos, the deadly fibers of which could be violated by something as harmless as "strong airflow."
Ministers are often accused of only caring for their own interests, but in this case, the opposite may be true.
Although Parliament’s Directorate of Services II insisted that the Palace of Westminster be given a “positive medical certificate”, it is now expected that it will take <0xC2><0xA3>1 million and several years of work in the centres for the Parliament to be thoroughly examined, the electorate will be upgraded in the latrine, the electricity will be upgraded from the latrine to the latrine, and the electricity will be removed from the latrine.
The Goddard report states that "the presence of asbestos is not in accordance with several regulations."
It is not possible to say whether this discrepancy will cost lives.
Now everyone can just wait.
One person who has never been able to determine when they have been exposed to asbestos is Graham Abbott, a physician.
Like Andrew Lawson, Abbott (50) is suspected of being exposed to asbestos while working in hospitals.
“I worked in a hospital where asbestos was proven,” he says, “but in my case I can’t prove it.
It is difficult to remember all the places where he worked and when he worked there.
But he clearly remembers the day in early December 2009, when something like a cold hit him.
He was 45, it was evening, and he was in the middle of the operation.
All of a sudden, I was shaking.
It came all of a sudden.
I've been through a lot.
I thought I wasn't going home by car.
Because he was a doctor, he knew the pain came from the scab, the stretch marks around the lungs.
But like Janice Allen, he had no reason to believe it was a mesothelioma.
He finally spent a month at home.
The confused doctors made an X-ray of his chest and introduced a chest catheter to remove the fluid they sent for analysis from his lungs.
Still, they didn't make a diagnosis.
His condition slowly improved and he returned to work.
However, from time to time, his symptoms returned, often after he had exercised and breathed.
In 2011, one of Abbott's patients came to the operating room with similar symptoms and was subsequently diagnosed with mesothelioma.
But even then, Abbott had nothing to do with his own case.
After all, his patient was a few decades older and at work came into direct contact with asbestos.
In this case, the connection was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition worsened again, and his doctor consulted his CT and X-ray scans with a panel of experts.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott began to feel ill, a camera-equipped probe was introduced into the space between the chest cavity and the lung cavity.
I'm optimistic.
I tend not to take much,” he says.
To be honest, I didn't worry too much about it.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The results of the biopsy came between Christmas and New Year: “They told me it was mesothelioma.”
Graham Abbott diagnosed with mesothelioma
Abbott began to meet with sisters from the Macmillan charity, and one advised him to contact a lawyer.
At that moment, he realized the extent of the epidemic.
“It turned out that asbestos has been widely used, especially in large public buildings that often have asbestos thermal insulation in the pipeline,” he says.
In people who have been exposed to asbestos in these buildings, the disease is now beginning to manifest.
So mesothelioma is now beginning to affect younger people who do not have a risky profession.
The most dangerous asbestos-insulated tubes were located in the basement in hospitals, so it was unlikely that they would endanger patients.
However, staff members who walked through the basement corridors between buildings (such as Andrew Lawson) or ate in the basement dining rooms (such as Graham Abbott often) certainly came into contact with the toxic substance.
As it now turns out, decades after the war, hospitals were a place where patients could save lives, but also a place that could endanger the lives of the doctors who treated them.
Asbestos is still being removed.
Pupils build Bunsen's cahan on asbestos pads
And it's not just about hospitals.
Asbestos has often been used in offices, shops, libraries and town halls because of its excellent insulating and non-combustible properties.
In schools too.
In fact, many people have already been exposed to asbestos in school.
Somewhere in innumerable hours of chemistry, students built Bunsen's cocoon on an asbestos pad.
There have been websites dealing with the issue of asbestos in schools.
Innocuous things such as floor tiles or roofs of tooling roofs in our homes commonly contained asbestos.
“This is an industrial poison built into a large number of homes,” notes Andrew Morgan, a lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his lawsuit against Guy’s Hospital.
In one case, there was only one contact with asbestos, which a woman suffering from mesothelioma could remember, in the 1970s when she was hitting a garden house.
So be careful how you fight the garden house.
Knowing that the disease is incurable, the impact of the diagnosis is enormous.
“It takes a while for you to do it,” Graham Abbott says.
I went back to work and tried to keep going, but I found I couldn’t focus on what I was doing.
I was in the O.R. for two weeks.
Then I realized that I would have to leave and take care of myself.
Well, I won't live another Christmas.
One of the most difficult things was the transition from the position of the doctor to the position of the patient.
Like the innumerable number of patients before him, he also remembers how he felt confused by the amount of information he had to deal with.
“It was hard to understand all of this,” he says.
“I asked my doctor, ‘How much time do I have?’
I was told that it was twelve months.
I remember thinking, “Well, I’m not going to live another Christmas.
That's it."
Mesothelioma is particularly destructive, because the very mechanism of what keeps us alive - the breathing itself - is what causes cancer that kills.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by exposure to asbestos.
Asbestos is made up of small fibers.
When asbestos breaks down and fibers inhale, they can settle in the bladder, the lungs.
Asbestos fibers irritate the peritoneum and can cause cell mutation.
“The problem is inhaled needle-shaped asbestos fibers,” explains Professor Tom Treasure, a cardiac surgeon who joined Guy’s Hospital in 2001.
To the same hospital where Andrew Lawson was apparently exposed to asbestos and which is paradoxically the leading center in mesothelioma treatment.
Treasure Lawson knows and treats other patients who have been exposed to asbestos probably during a hospital practice.
Asbestos needles get into the lung tissue, Treasure says, and “the breathing alone pushes them to the edge where the lungs are located.
Its nature is invasive from the very beginning.
In mesothelioma, the usual treatment options used in other types of cancer do not take as much.
The effectiveness of the operation, for example, is hotly debated.
Some say it would be worth a try.
The treasure disagrees.
“You can’t remove the snail,” he says.
You won't get a scalpel around it.
Cancer “does not respond to chemotherapy,” which, while “has some effect,” does not cure.
“Sometimes there will be someone who survives lung cancer,” Treasure says.
But in the end, everyone will die.
Luckily, some patients live much longer than expected.
Stephen Jay Gould has died 20 years after his diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott is still struggling.
After discovering mesothelioma, Abbott contacted Andrew Lawson, who, four years after his diagnosis, became an individual supporter and counselor for equally affected people.
When they called, he cheerfully introduced himself, "Hello, you called the cancer center."
“It was very positive,” Abbott says.
He was diagnosed with the disease four years ago and was still very active.
In the beginning, Abbott was offered six cycles of chemotherapy, which would last four months, and would probably extend his life by only one month.
“I was desperate,” he says.
I wanted to give up.
Lawson, however, “was able to show things in a more optimistic light.”
After visiting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue treatment with Professor Loic Lang-Lazduski from the Department of Breast Surgery at Guy's Hospital.
“I had the advantage that I didn’t have to wait until I was sent to him, but I just called and they looked at me,” Graham admits.
A normal patient would have to get an application and they would have to approve his payment.
In order to be able to get the best available treatment, the question of money is key for patients with mesothelioma.
But when different treatments inevitably fail in the end, many patients face other financial worries – about the future of the family they leave behind.
And that's why they turn to the courts and they want compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgana of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
“It has been known since 1898 that asbestos is harmful to health,” says Morgan.
In the 1960s, however, it was found that even a very small amount of it could pose a health risk.
And here we meet the negligent companies.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital eventually settled, but Morgan said it was not a "full settlement" because Lawson could not definitively prove that mesothelioma was a result of exposure to asbestos at Guy's Hospital.
However, after the case was investigated, a spokesman for Guy's Hospital confirmed that "asbestos in the incriminating basement was removed in the 1990s."
It was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to Remove Asbestos
To seduce the exposure of deadly asbestos to one company or place of work — usually decades after that happened — has proved to be a huge problem for patients with mesothelioma seeking compensation.
Many of the former workplaces have either changed their owners or went bankrupt.
Evidence of insurance is lost.
And those who are now defending the charge have time on their side, which their plaintiffs certainly do not.
In response to this fact, important new legislation was approved this year, which makes it easier for patients with mesothelioma to seek compensation, even if it is not possible to trace their former employer.
The law has created a $350 million financial reserve paid by insurance companies, which is intended for people diagnosed after July 2012 who can prove that they have been exposed to asbestos but have no one to sue.
In such a case, the disabled will receive 80% of the amount that would normally be assigned to them by the court as compensation - approximately <0xC2><0xA3>120,000.
Each year, 300 successful applications are expected to be handled.
Andrew Morgan, like mesothelioma patients, thinks <0xC2><0xA3>350 million is a “good job.”
“It’s an agreement written by insurance companies for insurance companies,” he says, pointing out that the amount is a quarter of what insurance companies would have to pay if it hadn’t taken time and people with mesothelioma would be able to get to the former employer and normal.
Even Mike Penning, the former Minister of Labour and Social Affairs, admitted that the law "had gaps."
But Penning and Morgan admit that, given the seven deaths each year, it was necessary to act quickly.
“People are suffering too much and need help right away,” Penning said last December during his second reading of the Mesothelioma Act.
Graham Abbott was in the care of Professor Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After initial consultations, Lang-Lazdunski recommended surgery, which, unlike Tom Treasur, thought to have a positive effect.
The surgery was followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy - a triple treatment in which Lang-Lazdunski boasts a five-year survival rate in up to 40% of patients.
Abbott reinforced it.
“Of course, that’s not the most important thing,” Abbott says.
You can always see it in patients.
There is something that drives you.
When you give up, your condition can deteriorate very quickly.
Graham Abbott underwent surgery in March 2012.
At the end of August, he completed the last of the six cycles of chemotherapy.
Check-ups showed no signs of the disease.
I went to the next check-up in March [2014].
I had a few [cancer] spots in my chest.
My fiftieth birthday is approaching.
It's not life-threatening.
Drink it.
Abbott again underwent six cycles of chemotherapy.
Currently, there are no traces of a tumor in his body.
It is a physically and emotionally exhausting process.
You have to think about practical things - financial security when I die, or to show a woman how the alarm clock works in the boiler.
When you hear the bad news, you start to be negative.
You have to look ahead.
As for fathers Ellie (16) and Tamsin (14) it is not always easy.
“It’s hard for parents,” he says.
It’s hard to decide what to say and how much to say.
After the diagnosis, I told the girls that my condition meant I would never be old.
Their responses were different.
Tamsin is very social and wild.
She told her friends, and all of a sudden we started calling a lot of people.
Ellie was more restrained.
She didn't say much.
All cancer patients have to deal with such conversations.
In patients with mesothelioma, however, such conversations are not relieved by hope or merely an indication of a chance of survival.
Sickness brings with it (and eventually brings joy to Stephen Jay Gould).
As Andrew Morgan said, “Mesotels do not threaten life.”

Ban on the import of blue asbestos
The court of appeal confirms the first successful suit for health damages resulting from exposure to asbestos in the UK.
Global asbestos production is increasing to more than 4,213,000 tonnes per year.
The United Kingdom imports 139 000 tonnes.
The British Institute of Health and Safety requires all asbestos suppliers to be licensed.
The import and use of blue and brown asbestos is prohibited in the UK.
All types of asbestos are prohibited in the UK.
The Mesothelioma Act enters into force in the United Kingdom.
A $350 million compensation programme has been launched.
Asbestos is banned in more than 50 countries, but in many parts of the world, white asbestos is still used as a cheap building material.
World production is held at two million tons per year.
China Refuses to Give Hong Kong the Power to Choose Leadership - Protesters Promise Vengeance
China’s parliament has decided on Sunday not to allow voters in Hong Kong to nominate candidates for the 2017 general election, despite the growing debate over the democratic reform.
This move is likely to trigger long-promising protests in Hong Kong’s commercial district, as activists began organizing and planning just hours after the announcement.
The Chinese People’s Congress essentially allows Communist leaders to expel any candidate who is not loyal to Beijing.
“It didn’t surprise us, but it angered us,” said Emily Lau, president of the Democratic Party.
This is not what Beijing has promised.
People in Hong Kong lied.
And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.
In defense of China’s decision, Deputy Secretary General of the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress Li Fei said that allowing public nominations in Hong Kong’s leadership elections would cause “chaos.”
Since 1997, when Britain returned China to Hong Kong, Beijing has pledged that citizens will be able to vote for the executive power starting in 2017.
China's leaders have presented Sunday's decision as a democratic breakthrough because Hong Kong allows direct voting, but the decision also makes it clear that Chinese leaders hold firmly in their hands the process of appointing a committee that is tightly controlled by Beijing.
And according to the new clause, only candidates who “love the country and Hong Kong” will be allowed.
The decision came after the summer months that saw one of Hong Kong’s biggest and most watched protests in several years.
Behind most pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong is the Occupying the Centre with Love and Peace, whose organizers have threatened to close the financial district if Beijing does not grant them universal suffrage.
On Sunday evening, just hours after the announcement, hundreds of supporters of the Occupation movement gathered in the rain in front of the Hong Kong government headquarters.
At the demonstration, the organizers said that their movement is entering a new phase of civil disobedience and that waves of protests will begin in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide any further details, obviously they wanted to avoid problems with the authorities.
In an online statement, the organizers said that the movement “considered the occupation of the Central only as a last step in the event that all the possibilities of dialogue are exhausted and there will be no other choice.
We must regret to announce that today all the opportunities for dialogue have been exhausted and that the occupation of the Centre is inevitable.
Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for Beijing's announcement for days and on Sunday strengthened the protection of the government's headquarters and deployed police and barricades.
According to many Hong Kong residents, unrest is a sign that they are slowly losing control of the city.
The advent of people from the mainland increases competition in products and services.
There are also growing fears that values such as democracy and freedom of speech are being tilted by increasing pressure from Beijing.
Some people criticize the Central Occupation Movement and say their demonstrations are threatening trade – the Hong Kong rescue boat.
“The protest he’s talking about could cause much more economic damage depending on how many people will participate and for how long,” said Regina Ip, a politician who has been criticizing the movement for a long time.
We do not want to spread the fear that Hong Kong is getting out of control.
Such a view could damage the investment.
In recent days, Chinese state media has also come up with reports that Hong Kong’s democratic activists have portrayed as Western-led subversive agents.
In the summer, activists organized an informal referendum on voting rights, which attracted 780,000 participants - more than a fifth of voters in Hong Kong.
And in July, tens of thousands of people took part in one of the largest pro-democracy demonstrations in the region’s history.
Pre-election agitator?
The League in Jihlava bears the name of the political movement
There are about 1,600 amateur athletes playing a small dig in the regional town of Vysocina.
And their highest competition is named Together for the Jihlava League.
It is named after a movement that goes to the October municipal elections.
In addition, the ten on his candidacy is the boss of a small excavated in Jihlava Jan Mr<0xC3><0xA1>ka.
"There was a general assembly where there was no problem with it," said Mr<0xC3><0xA1>ka.
The situation around the first league of small excavations has already been dealt with by the lawyers of the City Hall of Jihlava and have recommended to change the system of distribution of grants.
A small excavation last year, according to the city's website, was worth about a million kroner.
This year, too, there are hundreds of thousands.
According to the legal opinion, the procedure is not inconsistent with the law or the directives of the Magistrate.
However, the situation is an incentive for the Office to adjust the rules for grants and grants," said the spokesman for the Magistrate's Office, Radek Tulis.
Pulling subsidies from the city and at the same time expressing as a small pit support in the elections of one political party, it probably won’t work anymore.
A similar demand from politicians has not yet come to the high-ranking "big" football.
That the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD regional council, ODS division or KDU-<0xC4><0x8C>SL 1 should have been formed.
And class and similar competitions?
I wouldn't be pro.
On the contrary, I would like to be contacted by sponsors from a number of companies," said Miroslav Vrz<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek, president of the regional football association.
The boss of the small football the other side and the movement to the name of the league will not leave
According to the players of the small dugout, this sport in Jihlava would deserve its own area with six playgrounds, dressing rooms and social facilities.
"For example, the playground Na Stoup<0xC3><0xA1>ch is not ours, we are there for rent," said Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Lape<0xC5><0xA1> of Starlet Jihlava club.
The most suitable location would be the Czech mill.
However, in my opinion, there will be a pointless area for skaters, about fifty of whom are in Jihlava," Mr<0xC3><0xA1>ka noted.
The Prime Minister of Jihlava Jaroslav Vyzal (ODS) responded that the small pit uses a playground with artificial grass in the streets of Ro<0xC5><0xA1>ické and Na Stoup<0xC3><0xA1>, which are owned by the city.
We want to build such a playground that has the maximum use.
We are planning to modernize or build sports facilities at schools, which will be accessible in the afternoon.
I think there has been tremendous progress in the last few years for a small excavation," he added.
Other political parties in the league names will not appear, according to Jan Mr<0xC3><0xA1>ka.
We have limitations.
If someone from one area joins us in the partnership, we don’t put the other there anymore,” he explained.
"The political movement in the name of the league, I consider this at least an unfortunate step," said Karel Vold<0xC3><0xA1>n, member of the City Council for Sport.
"Whether the voters are assessing whether Mr. Mr<0xC3><0xA1>ka is using the Mal<0xC3><0xA1> ovan<0xC3><0xA1> Jihlava association and the city's subsidies for political purposes or not," he added.
American tradition penetrates into university life - first-timers can fly a jet plane
We are pleased that we can respond to your request by launching the first luxury travel service for students in the UK.
In order to leave the best impression when entering the university, the company also offers transportation options including a private sprayer or Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1.
Stewart also said the service also has its own security side.
The service is an ideal option for students who would otherwise have to drag their belongings across the state in a dangerously loaded car.
We look forward to ensuring that with our VIF (very important fresher - very important champion) variants this year students arrive at the university with minimal nervousness and maximum luxury.
The spokesperson told the company that since the services were just starting, they have no reservations yet, but he added: “Students will start making reservations within the next few weeks.”
The company also said that although students pay <0xC2><0xA3>9,000 a year in tuition, it expects the service to find its place in the market.
Compared to students ten, twenty, thirty or forty years ago, today’s students are different in terms of expectations and desires – it’s more important than ever to make the right first impression and the VIF program is just the right way to achieve it.
The National Student Union, however, criticized the service as unattainable.
Megan Dunn, Vice President of the Union for Higher Education, said: “For most students, such a project is unattainable.
A lot of students who attend university this month have to deal with the financial crisis before they throw away thousands of pounds for something as simple as getting to the train, because the available financial support in the form of loans and grants can’t keep up with the rising cost of the foundation.
Feminists Are Resisting Racism and Police Behavior After Ferguson Events
Earlier this month, a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, killed an unarmed young man.
Those waiting for the funeral chant with their hands up: “Hands up, don’t shoot!”
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Missouri over the shooting of unarmed young man Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Peréz noted a shift in online discussions of white feminists.
She found that when it comes to the promotion of reproductive rights and income equality, white feminists prefer sex over race.
With the rising tension in the Midwest, which attracted the attention of the nationwide press, Perézov<0xC3><0xA1> noticed that the reaction of whites was 100% racially focused.
Compared to the reactions of blacks shortly after the shooting on August 9, personal articles with headlines such as "White thinking over Ferguson" or "Feminism is not just about oppressing women" appeared relatively late.
According to Peréz, this is an important change.
“I think there are not many people in the feminist movement who would talk about race and privileges at such a level,” she said.
People felt that they had to express themselves to what had happened.
This is characteristic of the crisis we are facing, because [the situation in Ferguson] is so racially biased that they had to warn about it.
According to Korithy Mitchell, a professor of English at Ohio State University, Ferguson brought to light the problems that African-Americans face every day and that are not perceived as “female issues” in the cultural sphere.
“I can post funny stories from my life with my partner on Facebook and it will get 150 characters from people around the world,” Mitchell said.
When I write something about being colored in their own country in a trap, it's silently deafening.
“How is it possible for a woman to speak publicly about relationships, but not about security in public?” she asked.
For blacks like Mitchell, who have dealt with the issue of race, gender, and sexuality in American history, there is no such thing as race and gender dichotomy.
According to her, blacks could not afford luxury to clearly divide these problems: they live every day in this mixed reality.
Although whites today combine the question of race and gender in mainstream feminist circles, Angela Hattery, a professor of women’s and gender studies at George Mason University, says their predecessors did the opposite.
Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 blacks were lynched, and the reason was almost all cases of white rape," Hattery said.
In order to justify lynching, you needed the cooperation of white people.
According to Hattery, the split between whites and blacks came when campaigners like Susan B. Anthony explored the terrain at the end of the 19th century and realized that only one group of people can have the right to vote - women or blacks.
“They have decided to stake cards on the right to vote for women and the right to focus on blacks later,” Hattery said.
When we realize this, we'll get an important insight into why colored women don't trust whites.
We didn't do a good job.
We've never helped blacks protect their husbands and children.
Even after women gained the right to vote in 1920, it took ten years for them to start organizing against lynching in the Southern Women’s Association to prevent lynching.
The group was formed 40 years after the blacks first talked about helping each other.
According to Mitchell’s reluctance of white feminists to the questions that Ferguson raised – the question of police conduct, racial discrimination – reflects a time when white feminists had to “reach” the questions that blacks faced generations.
“Wouldn’t it be great if the activists in these [traditional] areas took the right to raise a child as seriously as they took the right to contraception?”
The second wave of feminists who made their career a fight for reproductive rights and an approach to contraception, is now figuring out what it means.
Notable feminist activists such as Gloria Steinem took two weeks after Michael Brown was shot dead by Facebook, where they published a column by Rebecca Carroll of the Guardian, who demanded that white Americans protest more loudly against racism.
"I hope that women who have different but still similar reasons for understanding the dangers in society - and racial views that differ significantly in public opinion polls - will seek change," Steinem wrote.
While Steinem’s stand for intersectional feminism, which includes issues of race and gender, her comments on the issue of race in America are muted by some people.
Expert at the American Enterprise Institute Christina Sommers, author of the book Who Stole Feminism?, told She The People that young men in the United States, especially young men of color, are "much more vulnerable than their sisters", but the remarks of Steinem's party outvotes Ferguson to them.
We now have hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost none for boys.
But when the White House launched a small program called My Brother's Keeper, which was intended to help vulnerable young blacks and Hispanics, it provoked an angry reaction among many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
The police’s relationship with the black community is not the only problem that comes to the forefront of mainstream feminism.
After U.S. border police detained nearly 63,000 unaccompanied youths in the southwest of the country this year, the issue of reforming immigration laws – this time as a women’s issue.
Andrea Mercadova, co-chair of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women for immigration law reform, said the only thing she had to do was share the stories of immigrants in order to be able to raise the issue as a necessary one for women.
“They’re talking for themselves,” says Mercadova.
Since most work permits are granted to men, the women who come with them are in a position where they are vulnerable in terms of domestic violence and abuse.
“These stories have a voice in women’s organizations,” she said.
Pork House in Ipswich for Sale
A real estate agency removed a picture of a house for sale in Suffolk - when it was published, it rested in the living room of a pig.
A one-room detached house, which is for sale for <0xC2><0xA3>120,000, stands on a private road in Ipswich.
Informational photographs included an image of the living room in which he rests with his head on the pig sofa.
The Connells real estate agency said the pig in the photo is the pet of the owners.
"The footage was found there by mistake, and therefore it has already been removed," a spokesperson for the office said.
In the property information, the Connells real estate agency described the former prayer house as a "detached one-bedroom house."
Even though the office has already removed the photo from its website, it still appears in the promotional materials.
The sale of the house sparked interest on social media, where some asked if the pig was included in the price.
After winning the lottery, the city of Harvey in the southwest has a fresh millionaire
The lottery player in Harvey will win a million.
A search is underway for a new millionaire in southeast Perth, a lucky man from Saturday’s lottery draw to take home $1.1 million.
Traffic in Harvey was the second time in five years when fortunes were distributed, the last time it was a $1 million win in November 2009.
The lucky winner has yet to sign up.
The owner of the store, Steve Forward, said the whole city in southwest Perth is talking about the win.
This is the main topic and everyone is excited.
We thought a similar win was a touchdown.
The eight winners shared a single win in Western Australia last month, which ended in a few happy weeks.
Last weekend, a Canning Vale player became one of five August millionaires and just a few weeks earlier, the pair in Belmont won an incredible $7.5 million.
The winning pair bet twenty years and said the win would allow them to process the world and buy a new house.
The Harvey millionaire is the 59th only lottery winner in Western Australia this year, winning a total of $85 million.
Deutsche Bahn trains will not depart in the evening.
Engineers Want Higher Wages
In a press release, GDL called the protest a warning strike, for which it deliberately chose a time off the road.
At the chosen time of the strike, the GDL takes into account many people who return by rail from the weekend until the first working day.
At the same time, we are also thinking of people coming to work during the day," the trade union said in a press statement on Monday morning to declare the strike.
"Our first strike should primarily affect freight transport, less already passengers," GDL added.
DB has not yet released an official response to the strike announcement.
It is not even clear how the protests will affect international railway connections, including with the Czech Republic.
Trade unions are calling for a five percent increase in drivers’ salaries and a two-hour reduction in working hours per week.
At present, the average salary of machinists is between 36 thousand and 46 thousand euros (998,000 and 1.27 million kroner) per year depending on the years worked.
Engineers at DB work 39 hours a week.
DB refuses to join the wage increase when working hours are shortened.
They emphasise that the salaries of the drivers must be developed as well as the other railway staff, for whom the DB is not counted by the shortening of the working week.
There was a threat that Krest's car would start to burn.
That's why the Barum rally ended.
What exactly happened?
It was a defect in the material.
The car was completely new, so I didn’t think anything like that would happen.
Was it not possible to temporarily repair the exhaust and continue at a slower pace to the service, where the mechanics would replace it?
If we were going straight there, yes.
But we were still waiting for two more erects and it didn't work.
There is a high temperature in it and the risk of the car starting to burn was high.
I can't afford that.
You've been through five speed tests at a full speed.
What impression did you have of them?
He's very good.
I felt like I was young.
We were fast, but I didn't go over the top five.
Everything was caused by the fact that the car we were piping for more than half a year to be at some level.
The race has shown that we have succeeded.
You split it up so that you could really think of winning.
I have prepared myself and the car so that we really had to win.
The work didn't come through.
On the other hand, the result that we could have thought of did not arrive.
But that's Barumka.
Unfortunately, the technique said no.
You were not the only one from the top who prematurely resigned from the battle for the championship.
Also, the foreign favourites Breen, Abbring and Lappi fell out of it.
Are you surprised that so many of your favorites have resigned?
Oh, yeah.
It was a pity for the spectators, because the race ended prematurely.
Jarom<0xC3><0xAD>r Tarabus was also at the top for a long time, for which you are going to get a car.
But he paid for flying off the track and taking up an almost two-minute gap.
How were you satisfied with his performance?
It's a shame, because he could repeat the ranks of the winners.
It was the first second time.
But Mira also confirmed that we had a good car.
He was going very fast.
Exactly a year ago you announced the end of your career, yet you appeared at the start of the Barum rally.
Can a good feeling of riding make you a regular participant in the rally races again?
Not at the moment, for sure.
Last year I said that Barumka was my last race and I didn’t keep it anyway.
I decided to go with her again.
It was my 19th start here, and if there's a chance again in a year, I'll probably go for it.
But I'm not thinking about anything else.
A lot of people came to the track just because of you.
Did you enjoy it?
To a certain extent, we started because of them.
A lot of people, known or unknown, kept asking if I was going.
I wanted to make them happy.
What awaits you after Barumca?
The team goes on.
Next week we will go to Vy<0xC5><0xA1>kov, where Robert Adolf will race.
I hope the car didn't hurt too much here.
In addition, for this race he wants to borrow from us the fabi Honz Sykora.
With Mira we are waiting for a European double race in Switzerland and Corsica.
We're going to have to plan things for next year.
Can you give me a hint?
No, nothing's decided.
When the Corsican Rally was part of the world championship, in fifth place you reached your maximum in the series.
Wouldn't you like to try those tracks again?
He's a liar.
Oral agreement with the employer may be a problem
Unfortunately, you did not have to issue a certificate of incapacity for work from your doctor, which serves as proof for the organization that you cannot perform work duties for health reasons.
In addition, you did not immediately notify the employer of the absence.
Subsequently, it was agreed that the days would be seen as holidays, but the agreement took place only orally.
Although the Labour Code does not impose an obligation to keep the employer’s consent to take leave in writing, in practice this procedure has proven itself.
If there is only an oral agreement, you do not have confirmation of the agreement.
Later, the alleged consent to take leave, as in your case, may be denied and the absence at work may be considered as a long-term undisclosed absence, therefore the reason for the immediate termination of the employment relationship according to <0xC2><0xA7> 53 of the Labour Code.
In the event of a legal dispute about an agreement with the employer, you thus lack evidence.
However, the employment relationship with you has not been cancelled in accordance with <0xC2><0xA7> 53, you only have the given days listed on the bill as an unforgivable absence.
The unpardoned absence in the payroll does not have the same consequences as <0xC2><0xA7> 53 (e.g. the inability to take out material security in unemployment), however, this makes it difficult to find a new job.
We recommend that you visit the doctor again and let yourself be confirmed in writing that there was indeed an injury as a result of which you were unable to work (this is not a so-called "incompetence", it is only a doctor's document).
When you are looking for a new job, you can submit the aforementioned document and explain the situation.
In practice, it is appropriate not to underestimate both the issue of a written medical certificate of incapacity for work, as well as the early notification to the employer or the request for written consent to take leave.
This way, you avoid any complications.
Tony Stewart's accident on his return to the track
The return to the track ended for Tony Stewart just halfway behind the Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart crashed into the playoffs for the second time after his right front tyre broke in the 172nd round, and the race for him ended.
Stewart brought the wrecked car into the garage, didn't speak to reporters and left.
Chad Johnston, the head of his team, said the No. 14 team was disappointed, but he will now focus on the race in Richmond, Virginia, which will take place next weekend.
"I wish we had a better performance and a better conclusion," Johnston said.
We're going to Richmond and we're hoping we can do more there.
Stewart ran into the playoffs for the first time in a Sunday night race after a collision with Kyle Busch, which required repairs to his right side of his car.
"We were hoping for a good finish in today's race," Johnston said, adding, "It just didn't work out."
Shortly after the second accident, Stewart's car was loaded and the team packed and ready to leave.
After his car hit and killed another driver at a race in New York, Stewart missed three NASCAR Sprint Cup races.
He decided to return this weekend and needed to win either the Atlanta race or the next race in Richmond to reach a place in the table.
He returned to the race during an investigation into the tragic accident in which 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr. died, who drove Stewart into the road during the race.
Authorities said the investigation into the cause of the accident would take at least another two weeks.
So far, it has not been decided whether Stewart will face any charges.
The three-time champion was warmly encouraged before the race.
Stewart started in 12th place, at the start of the race he worked on 10th and then even 4th.
Then, at the start of the 122nd round, Busch's car number.
18 got out of control, came out of the second corner and ran into Stewart, sending both cars to pay.
Stewart continued, but retired to 21st place.
Prague has chosen a new manager of the taxi station, earning 12.3 million
Prague has completed the selection procedure for the new manager of the taxi service stations.
For 103 parking spaces, it will receive approximately CZK 12.3 million per year.
Until recently, the taxi had collected 150 thousand kroner per year for the same places for the drivers of cars.
This was reported by Councillor Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Manhart (TOP 09).
In the past, the city used lottery to select administrators.
The winner then obtained a lease for a lump sum of 1000 kroner per year.
But the rules have changed.
He is currently deciding the amount of the offer.
“One year since the cancellation of the original leases and the start of the tendering process, it has been proven that the new lease system is far more advantageous and overall fair for Prague,” the councillor says.
The Most Expensive Spot Is On Per<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC3><0xBD>na
The highest price was offered by those interested in a place in Na Per<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC3><0xBD>na street.
He will pay 2.1 million kroner a year.
About CZK 1.5 million were paid for seats in front of the House of Commons or in Wenceslas Square.
The new rules for the rental of taxi stations were adopted by the council in the autumn of 2012 and in the summer of last year the original leases were terminated.
The selection process took place in four waves and the new manager found 29 locations.
This was the second time we had to clean the well.
We released it all the time, which resulted in practically the second pond around the cottage.
Then we put Savo in there.
Incredible blow!
Our well in the basement has always provided enough scented water.
And it wasn't professionally crafted, Grandpa made it with his own help.
A long time ago.
She was just on three laps and totally weird, like everything else in the cabin, but as I say.
The water was great.
Until this year.
When we started the season, of course we ran out of water.
When she was there for months, she deserved it.
But even then, we didn’t think the water smelled.
We wondered if there was anything wrong there.
In the place where the pump passed, it was possible with a bit of luck, there the board did not quite last, so the hole was sealed with a piece of brick.
Our inspections confirmed that the brick was moving.
Otherwise, there was nothing to see in the water, and we illuminated it to the bottom.
So we let her out again and cleaned her up.
Of course, we have improved the improvised seal around the pump pipe.
We saw strange things in the basement.
On the ground was a light packet with some bones.
At least that's what it looked like.
And a little further.
Now it looked like a slender mouse.
At the ceiling, in the places where the springs, grandfather's invention, were the remains of the fish!
And it's hard to drive!
Our basement is also unique.
Someone would say that Grandpa was just digging up the chateau.
And it wouldn't be that far from the truth.
Walls and floors are only suffocated sand, only the ceiling is subdued.
There are mostly boats there.
And the car.
And the beach chairs.
The door with wide gaps was usually open, as someone walked there in one piece.
At the ceiling a few of the already mentioned fountains.
There is no network, so birds usually fly there and nest on the beams.
There is no point in mentioning mice.
Grandpa wanted it to air, and that's it.
But the air didn’t help.
The whole store stinks.
So we cleaned the entire cellar.
Especially the fish on the tram was nutritious!
We also threw away things that were around: boards, heraclite boards, and so on.
Our cottage in the distance welcomed the passing disinfectant odour.
We've been wondering, who could have fed us the nasty leftovers?
The nearest cat lives two miles from here in the village.
It would be hard for her to come to us.
Grandpa was attacked by a neighbor who was not completely okay.
What if that Frenchman didn't blow the shit out of us?
He's been here almost all year, stupid ideas, he's got it.
We decided to monitor the cellar and well and check it regularly.
After a few days, everything was fine.
We started using the water again, so far only for washing and washing before the tests are done, but that was good.
Pulling water from a forest well is not something I'd like to do for a long time.
One day we heard a terrible anxious sneeze of our bitches.
Mom looked from the balcony and saw a long, strong black hose in the grass next to the veranda.
Reza jumped over her and whistled like a madman.
My mom used to it because she thought Reza was digging a waste hose out of the sink.
Suddenly, however, the hose partially slammed into the club and partially straightened.
The balcony was soaked.
Reza suffered a hysterical attack.
We ran downstairs.
A snail, long a lot over a meter and as thick as a bull, was about to swallow a huge snail, and Réza defended it.
It wasn’t clear whether she wanted to save the caterpillar or whether she wanted to eat it alone, but it was insignificant.
When the sock saw the excess in the form of our whole family, she must have thought that we should eat it when we are so hungry, and she elegantly stretched with the air into the cellar.
We were flying after her.
It was like a flash of lightning.
By the way, we recorded another scent packet on her plate.
Depending on the smell of fish.
She wasn't there the day before!
Our new security around the pump was a bit shady.
We closed the cellar during the day.
I'd like to...
We went out, and there we all went down to one fountain.
We didn't wait long.
It's embarrassing for the well.
First, there was a flat head with yellow spots on the neck.
Then a whole chain came out of the well.
She wrapped herself around the pump and began to get in.
A disfellowshipped employee took revenge, bought laptops at the company and sold them.
After being fired, a frustrated employee bought a computer company and then sold it.
He was able to spend the money before the police arrested him.
In a short period of time, the man bought in twelve cases a total of sixteen computers for more than two hundred thousand crowns.
"He took the notebooks to Olomouc after taking them, where he sold them to the bazaars," said Rostislav Brückner, the high commissioner of the Schumper police.
The reason for the fraud was revenge on the employers for the release and also the profit of the money.
"He told us at the hearing that he used the money to pay off the loans," Brückner said.
Police have also found out that the fraudster is a pathological player who has been repeatedly treated for psychiatry.
The money could also end up in the winning machines or in the videolottery terminals.
"The fact is, we didn't find any money at his place," the commissioner said.
The fraudster, who was once convicted of theft, now faces a one-year prison term of up to five years.
Police have not yet announced whether there will be a penalty for the bazaars, who bought the laptops under the price and continue to sell them.
"It is true that they have taken over completely new goods, which is at least suspicious," the commissioner said.
However, none of the owners of the bazaar have yet been charged.
Come on, a little bit, you can do it or how I enjoyed We Run Prague
This year, the organizers have made some changes.
The biggest change was the route that brought the target to the waterfall instead of leading back to the Yellow Baths.
I was looking forward to the race together with the rest of the Rungo.cz team, but I was going to experience it a bit from the other side.
With the whole team, we decided to personally greet our readers at the booth, where we took photos and filmed videos together.
In order to reach my view of perfection from the other side, I accepted the role of a personal guide.
Together with my friend K<0xC3><0xA1>t<0xC3><0xA1>va, we obediently entered the end of the corridor for 60 to 70 minutes just before the start.
We greeted friends who were walking around us in the sector for faster runners.
There's not much time left.
A few steps to warm up, turn on the sports testers, countdown and start!
The shouts of jasmine, but instead of a quick start, followed the cupping to the starting line.
After five minutes we reach the gate, turn the measurements on and run at a rate of ten hours.
We sail with the yellow snake of runners who, like K<0xC3><0xA1>t<0xC3><0xA1>, run their first race.
For now, they all look fresh, the slowly setting sun in the sky gives the view of the Vy<0xC5><0xA1>ehrad almost to a whimsical touch.
The pulsating meat stretching along the shoreline looks like the whole of Prague is running here.
Traditionally, on the waterfront between Vy<0xC5><0xA1>ehrad and the National Theatre, it begins to show who has how many powers.
The lightweight hut on Palack<0xC3><0xBD> n<0xC3><0xA1>m<0xC4><0x9B>st<0xC3><0xAD> forces many runners to slow down or to walk.
Just before the transition to the Theatre, I see a police escort and immediately behind it V<0xC3><0xAD>tek Pavli<0xC5><0xA1>ta flies at an incredible pace to the destination.
I hear the admirable breath of the other runners.
I move to the edge of the track, I encourage him, he's going to yell at me, but just before that, my leg will fall off and our hands will mingle tightly.
The performance of the Theatre Street gives a chance for a short rest and respite.
It's necessary, there are places in front of us where the view blows my breath away.
The turn on the M<0xC3><0xA1>nes Bridge shows Prague in all the beauty of the sunset.
I can't breathe and my legs carry me almost alone.
There are moments of truth behind the first meal.
At the junction of the road K<0xC3><0xA1>t<0xC3><0xA1>a <0xC5><0xA0>k<0xC3><0xA1>brtn<0xC3><0xAD>k about the edge and introduces the jump to the swim.
I'm watching if she doesn't need help, and I'm running a series of encouraging words so she doesn't have time to think about pain.
We get up and continue along the Goat Street, it is one of the narrowest places on the track, at this stage of the race there is no longer such a navel, but it is still necessary to closely monitor the surroundings.
I have no idea that the narrowest place will get its true meaning later on.
Behind the Pra<0xC5><0xA1>na gate we are frantically encouraged by tourists and friends of other runners.
I try to get along with everyone who offers my hand, and I recommend it to K<0xC3><0xA1>ta too, because ten touches with the fans is like half an energy stick.
In fact, it works, we're accelerating again, and even though we've failed quite significantly, now the pursuit has begun.
We're running dozens of runners when I see someone particularly tired, I'm trying to encourage him with a few words: "Come on, a little bit more, you can do it!"
After the last snack, no one is ahead of us, we're accelerating.
So far we've been running for an hour and a quarter, we're adding, there's nothing to wait for.
Three miles to the target will hurt, but you really need to make up.
The sun is slowly setting and the end of the day is symbolically slowly ending the race.
The last exit to the bridge, the turn and only the straight to the destination.
The pace at which we're running, I'm surprised where the girl gets it?
"Come on, let's go under thirteen, let's go!" I call.
We try it, we sprint, and here's the target.
Thirteen and six seconds.
Well, what can be done.
The coach set a limit of 20 hours.
So seven minutes under plan.
Which is a great result.
Close to the target, K<0xC3><0xA1>ta's feet are smashed, I help her to the fence, where she rests for a while.
It can be seen exhaustion, but also happiness from a well-developed performance.
After a while, I slowly take her out of the target space.
Euphoria doesn't make us think about the pressure in the passages to the closets.
Here it can be seen that Goat Street was not the narrowest place.
That’s the goal of the flood, which is aided by almost ten thousand runners, smashed to rupture.
If someone doesn't like the crowd, it's not the place for him.
I, too, lose my mind for a while and wonder if those wonderful views and compared to the last few years, the more interesting route was worth what was happening at the destination.
I know from my own experience that running the race is no fun.
If ten thousand people are added to it, a rich accompanying program and the closure of the entire Prague center for all transport, it is a huge challenge.
This year’s change of route showed runners many interesting places, but it also brought a few really unpleasant surprises.
The excellent atmosphere dissolved in the Yellow Baths was transferred between the runners and in the race itself.
Organizers around the track and random spectators staged it on every metre of the track.
Unfortunately, when running through the city’s historic centre, there are obstacles that cannot be removed, but the goal of a mass race in a place that is bordered by a wall on the one hand and a river on the other, I do not consider the best solution.
If I say that the race ended with a goal, I rate it as very successful.
I was a little worried about the health of the participants, but in the end everything went well.
Write to us in the discussion whether you liked the route and what you say about the situation in the destination.
Prisoners in Bulgaria organize protests <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Hundreds of prison service employees across Bulgaria attended a nationwide protest meeting in front of the Ministry of Justice in the capital city of Sofia.
At the peaceful demonstration, they reiterated their demand for the re-establishment of the original working conditions, which have recently changed.
On the list of demands to be discussed with the interim Minister of Justice Hristo Ivanov, there are also higher salaries.
The month’s watchmen symbolically protested against the new working hours and demanded a return to the original twenty-four-hour shifts.
Although the unions of prison guards and representatives of the Ministry of Justice met, they did not agree, Bulgarian State Radio (BNR) reported.
“The negotiations are still ongoing,” said Rosen Zhelyazkov, head of the General Directorate of Prison Service.
Members of the Federation of Trade Unions of Employees at the Ministry of the Interior are also expected to join the protests of Prison Service employees.
Why the Universe May Have More Dimensions and We Can't See Them
Physicists usually do not write bestsellers, but Brian Green of the Columbia University managed to hit the black in 1999.
His book Elegant Universe has become the most accessible path for laymen to penetrate into the nucleus of problems that many theoretical physicists are dealing with today – an attempt to unify two perfectly functioning but mutually incompatible discoveries of the 20th century: a quantum theory and a general theory.
One of the reasons for the success of the Elegant Universe is undoubtedly that in the case of the search for a unified physical theory, it is not a boring story.
The basic problem of physics between the two key theories (since at this moment our universe is de facto divided into two worlds with different laws) has been solved and solved so imaginatively that it is worth retelling even the laymen.
In addition, Greene was so fresh and intriguing that he could not count how interesting he had not included in his book.
In addition, he largely corrected his "error" in two other books: Structure of the Universe and Hidden Reality.
Probably not even the author would object to the fact that his book would age faster, but the fact is that even after 15 years the Elegant Universe still provides almost everything that an informed layman with the ambition to understand the world should know about this important part of theoretical physics.
It is quite likely that in the next few years there will be only a little more lively in this area (for example, because the LHC accelerator is finally going to "full gas"), and so it is a good time to enter Greene's non-violent doors of the modern physics world.
How many dimensions can our universe have?
The idea that our universe may have more than three spatial dimensions may certainly sound crazy, fantastic, strange, or mystical.
However, it is concrete and completely acceptable.
To understand this, let us turn our eyes away from the universe as a whole to something more terrestrial, specifically to the long and thin garden hose for watering.
Imagine pulling a 100-meter garden hose from one side of the canyon to the other and watching the whole scenery from a half-kilometre distance (as in the picture and on the next page).
From such a distance, you can easily detect a long horizontally stretched hose, but if you do not suffer from sharpness, the thickness of the hose can hardly be discerned.
Given your great distance from the hose, you would think that the ant forced to live on the hose has only one dimension in which it can walk: the left-right dimension along the hose.
If someone asks you where the ant was at the time, you will only answer it with one thing: the distance of the ant from the left (or right) end of the hose.
All we want to say is that from a distance of half a kilometre, a long piece of hose looks like a one-dimensional object.
In the real world, the hose is thick.
As we enlarge everything, we suddenly see a second dimension - in the shape of a circle winding the hose.
In such an enlarged view, it is clear that the ant can actually move in two independent dimensions: in the already well-known left-right dimension along the length of the hose, but also in the "size in/against the direction of movement of the watch handles", i.e. around the circle.
You begin to understand that to determine the position of a small ant, you need to enter two numbers: how far from the end of the hose and where there is a spiral hose on the circle.
This reflects the fact that the surface of the hose is two-dimensional (note. Experts will note that this chapter focuses purely on the fault theory of the string.
Disadvantages are discussed in Chapters 12 and 13.)
The surface of the hose is two-dimensional: one long longitudinal dimension is represented by a straight arrow, the dimension in the direction of the circumference, marked by a circular arrow, is short and screwed.
However, there is a clear difference between these two dimensions.
The size along the hose is long and easily visible.
The size of the winding circumference of the hose is short, "rolled" and worse noticeable.
To realize the existence of a circular dimension, we had to examine the hose with a much better resolution.
The above example illustrates the important property of spatial dimensions.
The fact that they are divided into two groups.
They can be either large, large, and therefore directly visible, or, conversely, small, twisted and much worse-observable.
Of course, in this case, we did not just anticipate to reveal the "wrapped" dimension of the wrapping thickness of the hose.
You just need to take the telescope for help.
But if the hose were thinner -- like a hair or a capillary -- we would only reveal the twisted dimension with great effort.
In 1919, Kaluza sent an article to Einstein in which he obstructed the idea that the spatial geometry of the universe could have more than three dimensions known to all of us.
He justified his radical assertion by the fact that the additional dimension provides an elegant and convincing framework in which Einstein's general relativity and Maxwell's electromagnetic theory can be woven into a single, unified conceptual structure.
Immediately the question arises, how does this perception of Kaluz go along with the obvious fact that we are seeing the three dimensions of space.
The answer, which Kalusz quietly assumed between the lines, and which was clearly expressed and clarified by the Swedish mathematician Oskar Klein in 1926, stands and falls with the assertion that the spatial geometry of our universe can have both large and twisted dimensions.
This means that just like the dimension in the direction of the length of the hose, our universe has a large, vast and easily visible three dimensions, the existence of which we realize at every moment.
But analogously with the circular circumference of the garden hose, the universe can also have an additional dimension, tightly twisted into space so small that they have remained hidden from our most perfect experimental apparatuses so far.
To get a clearer idea of the essence of Kaluz's remarkable design, let's stay with the hose for a while.
Imagine drawing a fairly dense series of circles in black on the edge of the hose.
Distances, the hose still looks like a thin one-dimensional line.
With the telescope now thanks to the drawing, we can reveal the screwed dimension even easier, because we will see the motif in Figure 2.
We can clearly see that the surface of the hose is two-dimensional, with one dimension large and almost unlimited and with the other short and circular.
Kaluza and Klein came up with the idea that our universe has a similar structure, but in addition to one small circular dimension it has three large spatial dimensions, i.e. four spatial dimensions together.
It is difficult to draw an object with too many dimensions.
To help our imagination a little, let’s take a look at the illustrations in Figure 3; it shows two large dimensions and one small circular dimension.
In the picture, we enlarge the view of the geometry of the space in the same way as we enlarged the surface of the hose.
Each subsequent level represents a huge increase in the geometry of the space from the previous level.
Our universe may have additional dimensions (we see them at the fourth magnification level) if they are twisted into a sufficiently small space; this explains why we have not observed them directly yet.
A square grid depicts the commonly known "big" dimensions, while a circle depicts a new, tiny and twisted dimension.
Just like loops of threads in a densely woven carpet, these circles also exist in every place of the usual dimensions - we just for the sake of visibility have drawn them only into cross-sections in a square network.
The background of Figure 4 depicts the commonly known structure of space - the ordinary world around us - on such common scales as meters, depicted by the side of a small square in a square network.
In each image below, we will focus on a small area of the previous image; we will enlarge it to make it visible.
At first, nothing special happens, as we see on the first few levels of magnification.
However, as we proceed on our path behind the microscopic properties of the geometry of space further - to the fourth level of magnification in Figure 3 - we suddenly see a new dimension, twisted into the shape of a circle, similar to loops even in a densely woven piece of carpet.
Kaluza and Klein came up with the idea that an additional circular dimension exists at every point in the direction of large dimensions, just as the hose has a circular circumference at every point of its length.
In the interest of opinion, we have drawn a circular dimension only in some, regularly arranged points.
Figure 4 summarizes Kaluz and Klein's idea of the microscopic structure of the geometry of space.
The similarity with the hose is obvious, although we also notice important differences.
First, the universe has three large, far-expanding spatial dimensions (of which we have only drawn two), whereas the hose is only one large dimension.
An even more important difference is that we are now talking about the spatial geometry of the universe itself, not just about some object inside the universe, such as our hose.
But the basic idea is the same.
If the additional circular screwed dimension is extremely miniaturized, it is much harder to recognize it - as is the circular circumference of the hose - than to observe obvious, large and vast dimensions.
If the size of the additional dimension is small enough, it will in fact reveal it even beyond the power of our state-of-the-art magnification tools.
But the most important thing is that the extra dimension is not just a flat cradle inside the usual dimensions, as the two-dimensional illustration erroneously suggests.
A circular dimension is a new dimension that exists at each point of three common expansive dimensions.
It is a dimension on the remaining three dimensions independent as well as the dimensions of top-down, left-right and front-back independent (and vertical) of each other.
A sufficiently small ant could move in all four dimensions, and to determine its position we would need four data, in addition to the usual three still position in the circular dimension; if we also count time, then the data five, in any case one more than we would normalize.
Are you curious?
The book Elegant Universe by Brian Greeen can be purchased here at book.idnes.cz.
The price for an e-book is 149,- CZK.
To our surprise, therefore, we find that even though we are aware of the existence of only three dimensions of space, Kaluzov and Klein's thinking shows that this does not preclude the existence of additional screwed dimensions, if they are small enough.
The universe can easily have more dimensions than we can see with the naked eye.
How small should they be?
The state-of-the-art equipment can detect the structures of a large billionth of a billionth of a metre.
We can hardly see the smaller dimensions.
In 1926, Klein combined the original idea of Kaluz with several ideas from the newly born quantum mechanics.
His calculations suggested that an additional circular dimension could be about the size of one Planck's length, that is, the size far beyond the differentiation capabilities of today's instruments.
Since then, physicists have called the possibility of additional small spatial dimensions the Kaluz-Klein theory.
Home Honza Homola advises how to practice on an electric guitar: part 5
The whole essence of the "twelve" consists in a twelve-takt harmonic form, which you can repeat at will.
Those who follow the theory of music will find its principle explained in detail here.
Jan Homola as Honz Homolka Capolka (1976)
By educating a puppeteer and a puppeteer, whose facebook profile can be viewed here, he has been living as a graphic artist since his graduation twenty years ago.
He is a guitarist of the band Wohnut, from which he is said to be unable to leave.
He is a guitarist after his father, as is his brother Matej, the leader of the Wohnouts.
Start with the training on one string.
"The rhythmic model is just for you, you can invent anything, then just apply it to the harmonic model of twelve," Honza advises.
When you add another string, you can change the figure again.
All you have to do is listen to and watch Honza, what can be invented with the harmony of the twelve on two strings and how nice it is already starting to sound.
If you add a third string, you can already coke some songs with the melody.
When you finally add a fourth, pay attention to the change of tuning, warns Honza in the video.
Next time, Honza will return to the pentatonic and try to put her together with the twelve.
So, practice it honestly.
At best, you can read this in an interview with Jan Homola at the first lesson of his school playing electric guitar here.
Another goal without waiting?
It's not a big celebration, admits the castle Dvo<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xA1>k
We take the point and we like it.
The first half had more chances for us, the second home,” said the attacker, who this time scoring from the penalty kick.
You weren't nervous when he was playing, were you just accompanied by a huge sandwich?
Somehow I didn’t feel it, although on the other gate, where there are home fans, it would probably be worse.
You were fined after half an hour, but you also got the goal out of the penalty after less than four minutes.
What's the matter?
We fell asleep at the beginning, we were passive, there was a corner and then a penalty.
After that you got up and the first half you were a better team that had more chances.
Why did that change after the break?
It's hard to say.
I agree that we played well after the incremented goal until the break.
In the cabin, we said we wanted to keep up the pace of the game, but we couldn’t.
To tell you the truth, I can't even explain why.
But it’s probably also true that the locals said something about their game about the break, they probably weren’t very happy with it.
You only scored on the opponent’s field for the first time, while at home you may not have even scored a goal.
Why is there such a difference?
I wouldn't say it's such a difference, but it's up to us how we're going to deal with it.
In Brno we started well, but then it was bad from us, Plze<0xC5><0x88>, that is another category.
You waited four games for the goal, weren't you afraid that it might be similar after the last game?
I don’t think so, but of course we’re happy that we don’t have to listen to the talk about waiting for a goal since the last game.
Now we have added another without waiting, but there are still only three in six games, which is not yet for the big celebration.
Iceland - lava flows from a mile away crater.
A lava flying to the surface in the Holuhraun area near the Vatnajökull glacier flows through an underground tunnel from a kilometer away crater.
It is located under the glacier, as well as part of the mentioned underground lava tunnel.
This fact is now the most disturbing to scientists...
The situation remains unchanged for the time being.
Since yesterday morning (31.8.
2014) still flows out of the crack about the same amount of lava.
Compared to the original estimates, however, its amount is lower, not 1000 m3, but "only" 300-400 m3.
Compared to the previous eruption of 29.8.
2014 is up to 50 times bigger.
Scientists, however, fear that the lava tunnel could open even in places under the ice.
If this were to happen, with the same intensity as the current eruption, it would mean huge floods, both on the Jökuls<0xC3><0xA1> <0xC3><0xA1> Fjölllum River and on other rivers.
Around the eruption there is a strong smell of sulfur, clouds of steam and gas rising from the crack.
Definitely not an eruption suitable for tourism, as was the case with the eruption at Fimmvör<0xC3><0xB0>uh<0xC3><0xA1>ls in 2010.
This is much larger and there is also a lot more gas," says volcanologist <0xC3><0x81>rmann Höskuldsson.
However, the weather has improved considerably since yesterday, in the early hours the area was almost windless.
The trails after the sandstorm were swept away by the rain.
Scientists can continue their work.
For air traffic, the orange grade (second highest) applies to B<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB0>arbunga and the yellow (third) to Askju.
Heaven over Cheb belonged to the brave Lady Peggy.
She walked through the wings.
Flight day in Chebu.
On the Boeing Stearman PT-17 was introduced aerial acrobat Peggy Valentin, who during the flight climbed out of the cockpit to the hull on the top wing of the double wing and also between the wings.
It refers only to the strength of the muscles.
The flight day in Cheb was held for the fifth time this year and the organizers were again able to prepare several interesting pieces of aircraft.
The premiere was held at the oldest Czech airport not only "walking on the wings" in the performance of the German acrobat Peggy Valentine, but also the legendary fighter P-51 D Mustang or aircraft Beechcraft 18.
He caught his attention with his shiny blanket.
The acrobatics called Wingwalking originated in the United States.
After World War I, this was the way many former war pilots were deployed.
However, due to the large number of fatal injuries, it was banned.
Today, however, he is slowly returning to the flight schedule.
Peggy gets out of the cockpit after the start to the top wing.
He performs various exercises there.
By the end of the performance, it will move into the space between the wings of the aircraft, where its show continues," Lud<0xC4><0x9B>k Mat<0xC4><0x9B>j<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek from the Cheb Ultralight Club and the organizer of the flight day described.
The pilot of the Boeing Stearman 75 E is her husband Friedrich.
If Peggy's performance was the main highlight of the show, then the next performance of the Mustang was a reputable cherry on the cake.
The legendary fighter joined the surface with the Flu of the Army of the Czech Republic in the pendant (called in numbers).
This was the first time that fans in the Czech Republic could see such a composition.
Pilot Miroslav S<0xC3><0xA1>zavsk<0xC3><0xBD> then presented to everyone the breathtaking acrobatics with the aircraft from 1945.
It was produced during the wars, but probably never participated in it.
He was included in the Army Reserves.
He has been active in the civil sphere since 1963.
Even as a racing plane.
Today he has his home hangar at the airport in Munich Hradi<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC4><0x9B>.
At the same location is also another pearl of the Cheb air day, the two-engine Beechcraft C45H Expeditor.
There was no big machine at the airport to miss.
His polished aluminum coating glittered in the distance.
The Max Holste MH 1521M Broussard was also admired by the French Air Force.
A small transport plane jumped for the renunciated Turbolet and brought part of the German delegation from the German Hof on the day of the flight.
German neighbors performed in Cheb with the reconstructed Jak 18T or the three-member formation of the Bücker Jungmann double-deckers.
Lucie Borhyov<0xC3><0xA1>: Dramatic return in front of the camera!
Lucie Borhya's parental concerns were exchanged for those of the working class tonight.
Stress or nervousness - the blonde moderator obviously knows nothing about it.
After all, the moderated TV news went well with her, as if she hadn’t stopped with him for two months at all!
It’s only been two weeks since the blonde ended on Monday, when women experience the most stress after giving birth.
Lucie, however, will not appear regularly in the main news conference TV Nova.
Regular return awaits her according to Blesk.cz information up to a month.
After all, only her daughter Linda now needs her more than a television audience.
Lucie Borhy returned to the TV screen and it was a hit in black.
Exhibitions for a date in Prague?
Hala would sell out, plans to say goodbye to Jagr
“It would be decent if something like that were done during the World Championships.
But it depends on how the union will be built," he said in Jihlava after an exhibition called The Golden Match, in which the amazing Nagano team met again.
Also players who participated in the Golden Hattrick.
Players should have a taste, right?
Yeah, sure.
It would be good to say good-bye to the gold generation during the championship.
In my opinion, they can be found during the tournament one or two days, when it is completely free and where such a match could be interfered with.
We will say this to Gum (Jir<0xC3><0xAD>m <0xC5><0xA0>légro) or Bé<0xC4><0x8F>i <0xC5><0xA0><0xC4><0x8D>erban (the organizer of the Jihlava match) who would take it into their own hands...
The arena would sell out.
But what if you're playing with the New Jersey play-off?
So when I get here...
You don't want to play in the national team.
Or did the meeting in Jihlava somehow change your decision?
Representation and exhibition match are two different things and the performances are decisive in representation.
One thing is that people would love to see me there, but performances are crucial, especially at the World Championships.
There should be players who have to drive there, not because they have a good name.
My decision has not changed in any way.
How did you enjoy that Nagano meeting?
The meeting with the players has been great.
You've revived your stories and experienced a lot of fun.
It was a great experience not only for fans, but also for us hockey players.
Of course, the most important thing was the honor of Ivan Hlinkov.
And it's good to recall the history of our hockey and the fact that a generation is leaving that really was worth it.
Slavom<0xC3><0xAD>r Lener, Vladim<0xC3><0xAD>r R<0xC5><0xAF><0xC5><0xBE>i<0xC4><0x8D>ka and Petr <0xC4><0x8C>echm<0xC3><0xA1>nek on the alternator.
Are you ready for your first national team match on your own?
She doesn't forget things like that.
It was against the Calgary Flames and three young men: me, Robert Hol<0xC3><0xAD>k and Robert Reichel, we joined in a threesome.
For all of us, it was our first start.
Well, we'd dominate in some way, that's not to say.
In Jihlava, for a long time, Dominik Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek was captured.
What did you say about his performance?
Hashan on the ice will never surprise me.
I wanted to give it back to him with that criticism, but I can’t (Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek criticized J<0xC3><0xA1>gra for the reasons why he decided to end up in the national team).
The squirrel also performed well.
He was training with me once a night, and there was a hole in it.
And now he's caught famously.
First the United States and then the Netherlands, the footballers start qualifying
Prominent guests arrived at the NH Hotel in Sm<0xC3><0xAD>chov on Monday morning.
People could see, for example, the goalkeeper Petr <0xC4><0x8C>ech from Chelsea, the head coach Pavel Vrba...
And there, that character in a black scarf, that's Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Rosick<0xC3><0xBD>!
Arsenal's backup and the captain of the squad have come to a close at around half-dozen.
We have a great game against the Netherlands.
Who wouldn’t like it?” he said, as he had already appeared in front of a reporter in the representative team.
Czech national football team
Monday 1 September: start of the clash, first training
Tuesday, September 2nd: Training open to fans (18:30, Summer) Autograph (20:00)
Wednesday 3 September Czech Republic - USA (20:15, Summer)
Tuesday 9 September Czech Republic - Netherlands (20:45, Summer) end of clash
Russky and Co. can be supported by fans before Wednesday’s match against the United States (20:15).
For them, the national team opened a training session on Tuesday, which starts at 18:30.
And then there will be an autograph, which neither Russky nor the Czechs will miss.
Otherwise, the national team will be more relaxed.
Which praises coach Vrba, who was complaining about a lot of social events in the spring.
Finally, we will focus on what we want to do.
Now we will focus on the Netherlands.
It is an advantage if you have players together for eight days.
We will have time to train things that have not been done so long so far," said Vrba, who has been officially leading the national team since January.
The Czech national football team will be accompanied by a Musketeer image as they enter the new qualification cycle.
The team has three games behind Vrboa, all in preparation.
With Norway and Finland they scored 2–2 and with Austria they lost 1–2.
However, these results were not yet important.
It's only now.
With the match with the Netherlands, he starts qualifying for the 2016 European Championships.
Of course, it would help the Czech team if it could also manage the general against the United States.
The first half was to get to know each other.
Now the results are important.
We have to think about being successful,” Vrba agreed.
The only player in the three-and-a-half-member nomination who has health problems is striker David Lafata.
The temperature's bothering him.
If he could not recover by Wednesday's match against the United States, coach Vrba would have called another striker.
Genetic disorders are often misdiagnosed.
A woman from Britain describes how she thought she would die after being misdiagnosed for many years.
After being diagnosed with another disease, Karin Rodgers spent most of her adolescence believing she only had a few years to live.
In fact, it was Charcot-Marie-Tooth Syndrome (CMT) - a group of hereditary disorders that damage nerves outside the brain and spine.
The charity CMT UK stated that poor diagnosis is a common problem among people with CMT because very little is known about the disease.
In the United Kingdom, CMT is thought to be affected by approximately 23,000 people, which can manifest motor symptoms such as muscle weakness, motionless walking, and twisted toes.
In those affected, insensitivity or pain can also occur, this condition is incurable and progressive, which means that over time the symptoms worsen.
When Rodgers was thirteen, she thought she was suffering from Freidreich's ataxia (FA) - a disease that has a very poor prognosis.
She believed that before she celebrated her eighteenth birthday, she would be tied to a wheelchair, and dead before she was thirty.
The mother of two children, now 51, says: “As a child, I knew I couldn’t do the same things as others.
Every day I fell down and it took me longer.
I could never ride skateboarding or skateboarding with other kids and in school I was bullied because of the way I walked and ran.
When Rodgers was thirteen, and after several surgeries to relieve her Achilles' nostrils and straighten her feet, she took advantage of the fact that her doctor had left the room, and looked into her documentation, where she learned that she was suffering from the FA.
“I felt guilty because I was stalking, so I didn’t tell anyone, but when I got home, I was looking for information about the disease in the library and I wrote to the FA,” he says.
When they answered me, I was shocked, I panicked completely.
I thought that by the time I was eighteen, I would end up in a wheelchair, and by the time I was twenty-five, I would be dead, and in the meantime I would gradually lose all my abilities.
I was alone, and I was planning a funeral.”
When she was seventeen, she realized that her walking ability had not deteriorated as much as she expected, and asked her surgeon.
He just stood up, hugged her, and said, “Honey, I don’t think you’re sick, otherwise you’d be in the wheelchair.
I think it's going to be a much less dangerous life."
After undergoing several genetic tests, it was found that he has CMT.
“When he explained to me what CMT was, I thought I was a lucky kid,” she said.
The charity CMT UK has launched a month of CMT awareness to warn of this disease.
Washington Entrepreneurs: With the turnover of the economy taxed
A growing economy means more customers, higher sales, and new jobs.
And higher taxes, too.
According to a new survey released last week, state and local taxation of companies in the country with accelerating economic recovery has risen slightly last year and companies in Washington were no exception.
Entrepreneurs in Maryland and Virginia combined for fiscal year 2013 brought $27.6 billion to state and local treasury, which is 3.8% higher than the $26.6 billion selected in 2012.
The tax burden – both state and local – rose 4.3% last year to $671 billion compared to 3.9% last year and was the third consecutive year of growth after 2009 and 2010, when taxes fell.
According to a study conducted by professional firm Ernst & Young and the political group Center on State Taxation, state taxes increased faster, by 4.3% than local taxes, by 3.9%.
More than half of the county's tax revenues, 56%, are from business taxes, and 36% of Maryland's income is from corporations.
Virginia, with 28%, has the proportionally lowest tax revenues from business.
The researchers claim that the majority of tax revenue growth comes from the increase in the value of property belonging to companies, which this year, after three consecutive years with growth of -1%, increased by 3.7%.
Although most of the profits come from big states like California, New York and Texas, it seems the same situation is in Washington.
Companies in D.C., Maryland and Virginia paid over $10 billion in state and local property taxes last year, up from $9.6 billion in 2012, an annual increase of 4.2%.
However, the apparent increase in the value of real estate does not so much outweigh state and local tax revenues in Maryland, where property tax accounts for less than a fifth of corporate taxation.
For businesses in Virginia and D.C., property taxes account for almost half of the state and local taxes.
“In Maryland, a lot of real estate is owned by companies, especially the tax base around D.C., the government, or non-profit organizations that don’t pay taxes,” said Douglas Lindholm, executive director of the Center on State Taxation.
So Maryland is forced to rely much more on income taxes, for example, to pay for the same services that are in other states.
The recent increase in business tax revenues cannot be attributed solely to the recovering real estate market.
According to the data, business revenues also appear to increase.
Firms in the region announced a $2.3 billion corporate income tax, which increased from $2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland has raised $1 billion in corporate income taxes, the most in the region.
Although they are heading in the same direction, the local tax burden on entrepreneurs is not growing as fast in these three places.
The growth rate in D.C. was at the national average, at 4.3%, while Maryland’s growth was significantly higher, 4.9%.
In Virginia alone, the tax increase was below average, to 4.1%.
Virginia has the lowest corporate income tax of all three counties (all of which have the same taxation), 6%.
The corporate tax rate in Maryland is 8.25%, while the D.C. average remains relatively high, at 9.975%.
A similar study conducted by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce this year showed that Virginia has a lower state and local taxation and a generally more favorable tax climate than Maryland.
The D.C. study failed.
Despite this advantage, Virginia is facing the pressure of competition from the south.
North Carolina recently signed a law that cuts the corporate tax from 6.9% to 6%, as well as Virginia, and next year the tax will be reduced to 5%.
If the state continues to meet its revenue targets in the coming year, the rate of income tax set by the law could be reduced to 3% in 2017.
According to a recent study, small businesses in Washington are doing better, and therefore are paying higher state and local taxes.
The income tax levied by small businesses as a personal income tax – a structure to compensate for the increase in costs by raising prices, according to which most companies are organized – in D.C., Maryland and Virginia rose by 20% last year to $2.4 billion, much faster than the previous year.
The researchers say that the trend and nationwide increase in business tax will likely continue next year, with total sales tax revenues for state and local governments rising compared to the same period last year in the first three quarters of 2014, up 6%.
Washington, however, may be lagging behind others because cutting government spending is picking up its tax on the labor market.
What you missed: the head of Europe will be Tusk, Putin's Novorusko and Lafat's scissors
Will there be a new state in Ukraine?
Putin Calls for Negotiations on Novorussia
Russian President Vladimir Putin has mentioned the possibility of creating a new state in southeastern Ukraine, where government forces have been clashing with pro-Russian insurgents since April.
He also warned European firms that under the current regime of anti-Russian sanctions, they will have a difficult return to the Russian market.
According to him, the support provided by the West for the Ukrainian army’s war in eastern Ukraine is inconsistent with democratic values.
The end of the conflict, he said, depends on Kyiv, so he can’t say when the Ukrainian crisis will end.
Any more sanctions for Russia?
The Czech Republic has waived the right to disagree with the part
The European Commission, together with its diplomats, is set to propose a form of further tightening of anti-Russian sanctions within a week, the EU summit decided last night.
This was reported by Herman Van Rompuy, the permanent chairman of the meetings of the member states.
According to Czech Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka, specific proposals for the postponement of the form of sanctions are to be prepared as early as Monday.
Tusk will be the new EU president.
Van Rompuy will replace him in December
Poland’s Prime Minister Donald Tusk was elected to the European Council at the European Union summit, the so-called EU president, who heads the summits of the member states.
He will replace Herman Van Rompuy for two and a half years from December.
At the head of European diplomacy, Catherine Ashton is replaced by Italian Foreign Minister Federica Mogherini.
Italy, which thus becomes the future Vice-President of the European Commission, still has to be confirmed by the European Parliament.
Assisted death is a reality in the Czech Republic, only it is not talked about
Helping an incurable and long-term sufferer with a break from life?
In the Czech Republic, where the laws do not allow euthanasia, this is not legal.
However, from the statements of the doctors who spoke to the LN, it follows that they are hearing about such requests.
ALS: The hardest chapter of neurology, says doctor about sclerosis
The Czech Republic suffers from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) of about three hundred people, 21 patients undergo experimental treatment with stem cells in the Prague Motole.
We don’t know if it will be successful.
But if we don’t try it, we won’t find out,” says Radim Mazanec, a Motul neurologist.
There is a CIA manuscript in it, they needed a war, writes Huml about the shooting down of flight MH17
<0xC4><0x8C>SSD MP Stanislav Huml is clear about who shot down a Malaysian aircraft over Ukraine.
According to him, it is clear that "hard sanctions, which were imposed with regard to the shooting down of a civilian aircraft with almost 300 dead, were caused by the Ukrainian army."
In addition, according to the law, the CIA's manuscript is known.
Unfulfilled promises.
Elections are coming, and the parties offer the impossible again.
The end of homeless people on the streets, parking for every family and a cable car over Prague.
Before every election, it is repeated: the parties promise the impossible.
Even now, with the upcoming municipal elections, politicians are predating who voters like the most.
The Lidovky.cz server has chosen unfulfilled promises from the present and the past.
Seventy years ago, Czechoslovaks landed in Dunkirk.
The siege has begun.
It was August 30, 1944, when the Czechoslovak separate brigade moved to France.
Its commander Alois Li<0xC5><0xA1>ka systematically requested the addition of technical equipment and dispatch to the front.
The British side eventually complied and classified this land force as one of its forces during the siege of the port city of Dunkirk, which remained in power of the German troops.

How to survive the return from vacation?
Don’t rush anywhere and get some sleep.
The last days of vacation are ahead of us.
Getting used to returning from a sunny beach or cottage at the usual working pace can be for many nuts.
It may even be accompanied by depression.
Fortunately, there are proven tips on how to cope with a changed situation: do not rush and get quality sleep.
Joan Rivers' family: "Hold your fingers"
Joan Rivers has been unconscious for three days since she was taken to a hospital in New York City, but her daughter said today that she is not losing hope that the eighteen-year-old comedian will recover.
“Thank you for your greetings and support,” Melissa Rivers said in a statement today.
We're holding her fingers.
Her mother was taken to Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after a call to the rescue service, according to which she had a cardiac arrest at a Yorkville endoscope in the Upper East Side, a source said.
Doctors deliberately keep her under the influence of sedatives and under strict supervision until they are sure of her condition, which remains “serious”.
Reactions to each other did not last long, including the incredible support on the Internet from personalities like Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Reality is a distorted header
That the media distort reality with their headlines is (unfortunately) no novelty.
I know that headlines "sell" newspapers, but unfortunately I also know that there are many so-called "readers" who read nothing else.
And that's a fact that's been bothering me a lot lately, it's more of a word of anger.
This is particularly true of articles on the Israeli-Hamas conflict in the Gaza Strip.
The headline “Israel Attacked Gaza” is quite common.
It is only in the text that you will read that the Israeli "attack" was a reaction to the rockets fired from the Gaza Strip, often at the time of the declared ceasefire.
It will then be titled "Both sides violated the ceasefire".
Does the press community realize that by doing so, they are directly involved in anti-Semitic attitudes that are growing throughout Europe (and not only there)?
Not even 60 years have passed since the end of World War II.
There are still people who survived the Shao.
When I saw videos from the Federal Republic of Germany, where the crowd shouted the slogans of "Jewish pigs" and similar confidence, I was stunned.
Does the world want to finish what Hitler failed to do?
Are our journalists aware of the fact that the Jews were destined to eliminate the Slavs?
Ladies and gentlemen of the press, please take a little more care of your work.
You are often referred to as the "watchdogs of democracy."
Then defend her.
As long as he's here.
And also defend the right of the only truly democratic state in the Middle East to protect its population.
How would you like our government to be preserved if one of our neighbours decided to eliminate the Czech nation and erase the Czech Republic from the map of the world?
Perhaps you should also be aware of one more fact.
Nearly 20% of Arabs with Israeli citizenship live in the State of Israel.
And they're good out there.
When you ask them why they don’t go to Gaza, for example, they’ll answer you, why would they do it?
In Israel, they have jobs, social security and state-of-the-art health care (I saw with my own eyes how to get to the state-of-the-art private hospital of Hadassah, which is funded by sponsorship donations from Jews from all over the world, and of course Arabs go there and are treated there).
Hamas is also attacking its Arab brothers with its missiles.
The only real help to Gaza, and thus this uneasy region, is to get rid of Hamas and disarm it.
And do not condemn Israel, albeit indirectly in headlines.
Inform about the practices of Hamas, about its abuse of people as human shields.
Inform us that Hamas is aiming to abolish the state of Israel at any cost.
At the cost of the death of innocent Arab children.
Inform that Hamas is on the list of world terrorist organizations.
Inform yourself that in nine years of self-government in Gaza, this area could have been thriving thanks to humanitarian aid from around the world.
Even from Israel, which supplies water and electricity there, for which, of course, the Gaza governors do not pay and are even upset that at this time the supply of electricity is sometimes interrupted.
Had Hamas not invested money in the construction of underground tunnels to allow suicide bombers to penetrate the territory of Israel, but, for example, in the construction of residential homes, hospitals and schools, its Arab brothers in Gaza would have lived significantly better.
Amazon Buys Twitch for $1.04 Billion
AMAZON just confirmed Monday morning’s information claim: An Internet retailer – a producer of videos and hundreds of other things – is buying a video streaming service called Twitch for $1.04 billion (US$970 million).
The announcement came as a surprise not because no one would expect to buy Twitch, but because YouTube was expected to be a buyer.
Three months ago, the sale of Twitch to Google for one billion looked certain, and this connection looked like a natural one.
Twitch, which was founded just three years ago by Justin.tv, was slapped to become a widely used video streaming service – a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players who broadcast online games on it - the words Business Insider "YouTube for Live Streaming".
Interface Twitche.
There are already popular “Let’s play” videos on YouTube, a genre where sages (usually older ones) give games processing Mystery Science Theater.
The fact is that YouTube when describingTwitch comes on the rise a lot, so the news that YouTube is buyingTwitch did not bother anyone much, it was a textbook example of how the established company will pay off the potential competition.
The mystery is why the deal with YouTube did not come out, although the company was willing to pay the same amount as Amazon.
All we have at our disposal right now is Twitch CEO Emmett Sheara: “We chose Amazon because he believes in our company, has the same values and a long-term vision and wants to help us meet it faster.”
Another mystery is – frankly – the incredible success of Twitch.
For snobs like me who claim that sport prefers to do than watch, it’s hard to understand what’s so amazing about watching games instead of watching real games.
One thing is to look at a friend across the shoulder at three o’clock in the morning as he plays Resident Evil, and another thing is to watch a stranger get 20 intrusions into his head in Call of Duty.
All the games that you can watch right now.
Another problem is that many of today’s most popular games are from a player’s perspective, so looking at their record without being able to control the perspective on your own is quite a good recipe for how to get a headache.
I admit that the games of the type of speed run, in which the Rogers Bannisters of our electronic era will complete the game in record time, is fun.
But if someone is not a master of play or humor, his channel on Twitch will probably not be very interesting.
But what do skeptics like me know about it?
Twitch has 55 million monthly visits and is fourth at the top of internet traffic.
How will Amazon use that?
It’s hard to imagine that Twitch blends into Amazon Instant Video just as elegantly as YouTube might have swallowed it.
But Twitch has something every company wants to attract: hordes of young men that advertisers want.
According to Twitche Shear, Amazon and Twitch “believe in the future of the games” and the media don’t seem to shy away, nor do they look like – a snag – the audience.
The second fundamental lie of creationism.
Another Czech translation by American atheist vlogger Arona Ra.
This time on the theme "The Scriptures are the Word of God."
Included with the original video.
The second fundamental lie of creationism is the belief that sacred texts were written by God and not by real human authors.
When believers debate one of the many things that are at odds with their religion, they often ask us the question: Who are you going to believe?
Is it the word of God or the word of man?
It is as if human inquiry is completely useless in comparison with the authority they imagine to have their doctrine.
But when they say "man," they speak of science.
And when they refer to "the word of God," they refer to myths about God written by people.
If there really is an intelligent with a creator for any purpose, then it is he who has created the fossil record that reveals evolutionary history, and it must be he who has invented the genetic patterns that correspond to it, and it must be he who has given the evolutionary evidence to the detail of the evidence that shows it.
Why else would all these things exist?
Looks like he's trying to tell us something!
People couldn't create any of those things.
But people can tell stories, fabulize.
And it was the people who wrote all the texts that pretended to be the word of God.
Every supposedly sacred teaching of any religion in the world describes itself as written by men, not gods.
People who were “moved” or “inspired” by their favorite gods, or perhaps listened to the dictates of angels, but those texts were written by no one but mere mortals with a certain degree of imagination, not angels and not gods at all.
If there really was one true god, he would be an integral part of all the gods of all religions, the supergalactic supergenius, the ultimate entity of the entire cosmos.
If a creature of this size had ever written a book, there would only be one such book, one holy scripture.
It would be known all over the world, without precursors, parallels or alternatives in any language, because only human authors would not be able to measure themselves with such a work.
And people would not have to blindly believe it, because it would be consistent, based on verifiable and true evidence, and would reveal deep morality and wisdom far beyond all human limits.
It would constantly inspire every reader to the unity of common faith.
If God wrote it, we wouldn’t expect anything less.
But what we see instead is the exact opposite.
Instead of the one religion leading to the ultimate truth, we have many different religions without common origin, and all of them are constantly falling apart into increasingly separate denominations, seeking the contested truths, and each one in some way demands divine guidance from each other, regardless of the difference.
The Jewish Torah, the Christian Gospels, the Islamic Koran, Bah<0xC3><0xA1>'u'll<0xC3><0xA1>h's Kit<0xC3><0xA1>b-i-Akdas, Zarathustra's Avesta, the Sikh Ad<0xC3><0xAD>-Granth, the Mahabharata's Bhagavad-Gita are the members of each of the prophets, the Book of the Mormon, or the Book of Urantia are considered to be "right."
The only logical explanation is probably that everyone is on the trail to a certain extent.
None of the above-mentioned books have any advantage over the others.
None of them have any evidence, and none can be confirmed historically.
My name is Dr. Paul Maier, and I'm a professor of ancient history at West Michigan University.
I am not saying that I have proved that the Bible is reliable and historically accurate.
Of course he's not.
You still have to have faith.
All of them require faith and also apology (defensions) because they contain inequalities, absurdities, and primitive ideas once considered true, which have already been overcome.
So it cannot be claimed that they are evidence of divine wisdom.
Many of them advocate disgusting atrocities instead of morality, and many of them are claimed to have been confirmed by the fulfillment of the prophecy – with each also being able to contain a prophecy that has not been fulfilled.
The foregoing theologians admit that all the sacred texts of any religion were written by human hands and are therefore subject to the interpretations, impressions and views of their primitive and often politically motivated authors, and do not explain many of the prologues in these passages.
I would not call it contradictions, but rather reciprocal comments.
We have to point out once again that we have two different authors here, whose work was somehow mixed together during some editorial review.
He is right that Genesis has more than one author and is certainly not the story of an eyewitness!
Some experts now distinguish four different sources only for the Pentateuch, i.e. the five Books of Moses and Moses do not attribute authorship to any of them, because it almost certainly did not exist as described in the Bible.
Experts agree that Genesis was composed (probably by Ezra) of several mutually unrelated oral traditions less than 2,500 years ago.
The other documents were refiltered at the same time and all are attributed to human authors.
The Bible is not as old as its faithful believe.
The scrolls from the Dead Sea are the oldest archaeological finds of texts known for their unfinished foundation of all Western monotheistic faiths, and yet they are many centuries younger than the roots of Zoroastrianism, Buddhism, Hinduism, Hellenism, and Druid cults.
Christianity began as a Gnostic faith, followed by the Docetians and the Ebionites and their completely different outlook on Jesus, which eventually merged into some compromise called Orthodoxy.
Other Christian groups, such as the Luciferians, were discredited and discredited by further revisions of the Bible.
One of these modifications relates to King Ugaritus, who ruled 3,500 years ago.
Because his followers posed a fundamental threat to the young Mosaic religion, the authors of the New Testament decided to ridicule and Baal Zebul, "the Lord on the mountain" changed to Beelzebub "the Lord of the Flies".
So the Bible was deliberately and deceptively altered for both religious and political reasons.
The rest of what became of the New Testament was canonized in the 4th century AD in a series of commission decisions at the House of Commons in Nicaea.
Four Gospels were accepted, and sixteen others were rejected by simply raising their hands, as if the reality of some things could be accepted or rejected by a vote.
The way in which the canon evolved depended on what was read about Sundays in Christian centers at the time.
What was the count on the second Sunday after Easter in the Church of Jerusalem?
And what about the Roman Church at the same time?
And gradually they found out that they were approaching the same Gospel stories.
And so the core of the canon evolved from the narrowness of the original church.
So the council simply accepted as the gospel any relevant stories that were circulating among the uneducated masses at the time.
But they also consciously removed more than ten books from the Bible, even though they were referred to by the books that were approved.
Among the rejected items are the writings of both the apostles and the prophets.
Why should God’s Word refer us to books that are only words of some people and/or are no longer available?
Who was the real editor here?
The Bible often mentions human authors.
But how could it be so approved if God were the real author of this random mix of rumors, parables, and psalmic lyrics?
The Bible was certainly written by humans, and certainly not by much enlightenment, rather the contrary!
That’s why so much of its content is historically and scientifically entirely wrong, no matter what it is, from beginning to end.
We’re talking about people who believed snakes and donkeys can talk, believed in skeletons, blood sacrifices, ritual spells, enchanted objects, fireworks, astrology, and the five elements of magic.
They thought that if they used a magic wand to splash someone's blood, it would cure them from leprosy.
We’re talking about people who thought that rabbits are chewing gum and bats are birds and whales are fish and pie is an integer.
These people believed that when they showed pregnant cow striped patterns, they would give birth to striped calves.
How could anyone who knows anything about genetics say that?
Of course, the authors of this book did not know.
If the Bible were written by a higher being, it would not contain the errors it contains.
If it originated from a pen a truly superior being and was intended as a literal story, then it would contain nothing of what it contains at all.
As a moral guide to orientalism, the majority of the original Hebrew writings were written by uneducated and bigoted savages, who ignored or supported cruelty to animals, incest, slavery, abuse of slaves, abuse of family members.
To defend their inhumanity by claiming to do God’s will.
But the creationists are still ignoring all of this.
Some of their websites admit that if any fact is contrary to the Bible, then the fact must be ignored!
And why?
Because if the creationists didn’t have their beloved books, they wouldn’t have a god either.
In their world there is one and the other the same.
It is ironic that they reject God’s “work” as “the worship of creation instead of the Creator.”
But they themselves regard the word of man as the word of God and of God itself, and even insist that the repulsion of their supposedly "holy" books somehow repels God as such.
Not their version of God, but all versions of God.
Creationist Christians believe that if the Bible is wrong, then God is lying.
They cannot accept that God could exist and the Bible could be wrong at the same time because they cannot separate doctrine from deity.
So this is a kind of idolatry where believers worship man-made compilations, as if these books were God himself, because they think they are HIS word.
But God has never written or dictated any of the scriptures of any religion.
Everything that people have approved or rejected in their supposedly "immutable word" of any god has been devised, compiled, grouped, translated, interpreted, modified, and often also intentionally altered and distorted by mere folk.

Participant of the bucket challenge shoved her jaw
When the ice water swirled on her head, Isabelle Roberts from the United Kingdom shouted out that she had damaged the structure of her facial bones.
This bucket challenge didn't work out.
The woman was hospitalized after screaming at the cone challenge by tilting her jaw.
While lilacing ice water on her head, Isabelle Roberts screamed so intensely that she damaged the bone structure in her face.
“The water was so cold that I had to scream, but at the same time my jaw began to stiffen,” she told The Mirror.
A 20-year-old girl pours water on herself.
Isabelle Roberts just before the accident
I tried to shut my mouth, but it didn't work, it was stuck, and I realized something was going on.
Then it happened to me and my sister, they might have burst into laughter, but I had to get to the emergency room quickly."
The 20-year-old girl had to be hospitalized to return her jaw to its original location after attending a fashionable viral wave on Tuesday.
The video became an internet sensation, with thousands of people sharing it on Facebook and Twitter.
Chinese school attacker hits nine people, three of them dead
A man named Chen, according to the New China Agency, forcibly entered the building of the elementary school in the morning and attacked around half-eleven local time.
Three of the nine people he hit later died in the hospital.
Chen later killed himself by jumping from a height, New China said, referring to the regional government.
In recent years, China has experienced a series of similar attacks in schools and against children.
The public therefore calls for greater security measures and better protection of children in a country where many married couples have only one offspring in line with government policy.
Zeman showed the first-timers in L<0xC3><0xA1>nech how he had to sit at school
The youngest pupils took the nine to their classrooms, where they waited with the teacher for the president to arrive.
He then showed the kids how he had to sit alone at school.
"We had to sit with our hands behind our backs, fortunately you are no longer there, you are already free people," Zeman told the children.
His wife then handed over the headscarves as a gift to the first-born.

Education Minister Marcel Chl<0xC3><0xA1>dek started the new school year at a private sports school in Lithuania.
"This year I want to connect Czech education more with Czech sport," one of the reasons why the first day of school went to the north of the Czech Republic came closer.
The management of the school contacted him a while ago at a hockey match in Lithuania.
"They were the first, so I accepted an invitation to attend the start of the school year," the minister added.
The Minister of Education Marcel Chl<0xC3><0xA1>dek (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) started the school year in a private sports school in Lithuania.
This year, 115,000 first-year students joined the first class.
A total of over 850,000 children will attend primary schools and over 405,000 students will be educated in secondary schools, the Ministry of Education estimates.
The new art director of News News is David Fiala
As of September 1st, David Fiala became Nova’s new art director of news and publicity.
He replaces Alana Z<0xC3><0xA1>rubu, who has led the creative department of the entire Nova group since 1 June.
David Fiala previously worked in the graphic department of the Z1 intelligence television.
In the last two years, under the leadership of Alan Z<0xC3><0xA1>ruby, he participated in the realization of the complete visual transformation of the news conferences of the Television Newspaper, Strepiny, Pr<0xC3><0xA1>sk! and other publicist programs of TV Nova.
David Fiala manages very well the synergy of communication between the editorial, studio management and the graphic department, which is the essence of the work of the art director of intelligence.
It has a sense of typography and a purely elegant design, which is the path we want to continue to take in the visuals of Nova news," says Creative Director of Nova Alan Z<0xC3><0xA1>ruba.
Apple iCloud reportedly succumbed to hackers, leaked nude photos of celebrities
Screenshot with a list of missing files
While an anonymous user on the 4chan server publishes nude and pornographic images of American celebrities, the US server Mashable.com has warned.
Reportedly, they gained unauthorized access to user accounts on Apple servers, where affected users uploaded them via automatic backup of images from iPhones and iPads.
Apple has not commented on the issue yet.
Some celebrities reject the images as fake, but several of the affected images have already acknowledged the authenticity of the images.
Among them are actress Jennifer Lawrence, known for her role as Katniss in the Hunger Games film series, or Mary Elizabeth Winstead, who played for example in The Deathly Hallows 4.0.
The goal of the hacker is to use the obtained images and videos to enrich.
U.S. magazines have reportedly expressed interest in the footage, but according to reports on 4chan, the hacker prefers money from the community.
According to The Next Web, it’s very likely a weakness in iCloud security.
Two days ago, a tool appeared on the GitHub server that made it possible to obtain passwords for user accounts through gross force, i.e. automatic repetition of attempts to log in with different passwords.
This tool proved to be working, but Apple closed the security hole after two days.
However, it is certain that potential attackers had plenty of time to gain access to various accounts before the release of this tool.
For preventive reasons, iCloud users should change their password associated with their Apple ID.
The length of the password is important, not its complexity.
Suitable length is at least 12 characters.
The leakage of nude images of celebrities consider a reminder of the safe use of online services.
Although the servers of companies such as Apple, Google or Microsoft are secured multiple times better than computers in households or smaller companies, uploading sensitive photos in an unprotected form is an unnecessary risk.
If you want to back up explicit photos or any other sensitive content online, encrypt the files before uploading first.
It is also wise to set the automatic backup of photos from your phone so that it only runs on Wi-Fi and after connecting to the charger.
So you will have the ability to move sensitive images in time "to securely", and mainly you will have the space to delete undirected images, so that they will not take up unnecessary space in the online storage.
Instructions on how to encrypt files and communication on the Internet, we offer readers HN and IHNED.cz in the form of an e-book by Michal Altair Val<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1>ka in PDF format.
A Smart Way to Save for College Scripts
Given that the cost of a college script for many students exceeds $1,000 a year, an upcoming second-year student came up with a smart way to cut costs.
He devised a system of borrowing books from fellow seniors with a nominal compensation offer to delay their resale back.
“I got a calculator book that normally costs $180 for a semester for ten and chicken nuggets,” says Schroeder, 19, who studies at Covenant College in Georgia.
The books required in his last semester would cost $430, he says.
Utratil 120.
According to the University Council, the average student will spend more than $1,200 per year on textbooks and utilities, but students have different options for how to handle these expenses.
Online shops and creative solutions such as Schroeder's are the preferred choice for students.
Lessons are on the rise, which allows students to use the book during the semester, often with a significant discount before they buy it.
According to Neebo Inc, which operates more than 250 bookstores on campus campuses, book lending has doubled since 2011.
The survey shows that about a quarter of books in university bookstores were borrowed last spring, says Neebo Vice President Trevor Meyer.
Less than half of the textbooks are purchased in university bookstores, according to the National Association of University Businesses.
Here are 101 Best Ways to Succeed.
Online shopping
The prices of some new books may be up to a third lower on the Internet than in the university bookstore.
The recommended price of the ninth edition of the book "Calculus" by Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler is almost $290, but it is possible to buy a new one on the Internet at Chegg.com, a textbook retailer, for $239.99.
Buy used <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
If you don’t mind other people’s remarks or wear and tear, textbooks are an appropriate option.
On Chegg.com, the Calculus is sold for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, a graduate student at Brigham Young University, says he paid 42 cents on Amazon.com for his “Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business.”
The new one sold for $48.
University professor Ingrid Bracey, head of the University of Massachusetts Amherst’s College Without Walls, suggests that students check with their teachers whether older editions are acceptable.
Sometimes changes to work in seminars are not essential.
If so, older editions may be sold for a fraction of the price of the latest version.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon, eBay Inc’s Half.com is also a popular alternative to buying used books.
Lending services
It is also worth considering borrowing textbooks, if you treat them well, do not forget to return them and do not need to have them even after the seminar.
You can save up to 80% on the cost of a new book.
For example, a student could borrow "Calculus" for about twenty dollars for the entire semester.
Read the terms and conditions of the store in which you are borrowing the book, including postage for notes, highlights, or wear and tear.
Keep in mind: If you do not return the book in time, the penalty may be higher than the price of the new book.
E-books
Another option is to provide yourself with an e-book instead of a normal e-book.
Sometimes these books are essentially borrowed in the form of an electronic license valid for a certain period of time from distributors such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
Chegg borrows Calculus for six months for around $61.
According to Bracey, the most affordable offers can be found for students of literary courses, as many classics are now available for free download, while natural and technical texts can be very expensive.
In any case, go shopping.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon be attending Pepperdine Law School, recommends following the ISBN because it guarantees that you are buying the right book.
Before you order a book over the internet, make sure it’s really in stock, Gault advises.
He was convinced of it on his own.
The book he bought was sold out for four weeks, and had to pay the full price for a book from a university bookstore.
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
And then they found in the well a torso rifle from the end of the war
The well is located a short distance from St. George's Church.
We discovered the growth around and we started to pull out the flying rag - about a meter and a half of mud and shredded leaves.
As we approached the clay floor, we stumbled upon the head," said Radomil Novak.
We pulled it out, cleaned it up, and found out it was a torso-attacked German rifle used by SS units.
The finding is said to be unusual.
According to my information, such rifles were produced until the end of the war.
And there were about three hundred thousand of them," added Nov<0xC3><0xA1>k.
All wooden construction items have broken down over time, so it is unusable.
Its body, however, is preserved - it retains its shape.
How was it in the well?
There is one explanation.
Maybe it was thrown there by people who needed to get rid of the weapons used by the SS, probably out of fear of being pushed away.
The fascists on the run probably wouldn't do that.
They threw their guns in the woods," the finder thought.
The rifle was the only thing fans of the Jesen<0xC3><0xAD>ka Spirit Movement found in the well.
"There could have been hand grenades, there used to be a lot of them around here, so we slowed the excavation work, carefully scoured the mud so that there was no accident, but there was nothing else down there," Nov<0xC3><0xA1>k said.
The find will end in the museum depot at the castle in nearby Silesian Rudolphs.
Ukrainian General: I have not yet liberated the captured Chech
Exclusive interview Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz with Lieutenant General Volodymyr Ruban, who frees Ukrainian soldiers from the capture of pro-Russian separatists.
Kyiv/Prague - "I'm sorry, I have to take it... they call me from Donetsk," he apologised eight times during an exclusive interview with Ukrainian Lieutenant-General Volodymyr Ruban, otherwise also the director of the Center for the Liberation of War Prisoners.
Colonel-General Volodymyr Ruban in a TV debate.
With each such interruption, it was not possible not to hear the names of the people, their numbers or places where they are – or should be – that Ruban specifies with his counterpart on the other end of the phone.
"That'll be it - go there," he concluded one of the flash discussions with Donetsk, and again devoted himself to ours.
Volodymyr Ruban is a backup general, a former fighter pilot and an active participant in anti-government protests in Majdan.
Even yesterday - when we agreed to an interview - he was in Donetsk.
The liberation of Ukrainian soldiers from the capture of pro-Russian separatists is devoted to twenty-four hours a day.
You may know that the Czechs are fighting on the side of pro-Russian separatists.
Our counterintelligence estimates their number to be thirty.
Of course, there may be many more.
Have you ever met a Czech prisoner during your negotiations with him?
Volodymyr Ruban: I have liberated already captured Serbs, Dagestans, Chechens, one Swede, Georgians... but Czechs have not yet.
But I know who to turn to in Prague, if we could run into your captured countryman and liberate him.
Ukrainian Soldier Captured by Separatists
A.cz: What do you advise the Czechs who join the pro-Russian separatists and the Ukrainian soldiers are occupied?
They should understand that if, like the Czechs, they are engaged in the battles of Ukrainian volunteers and separatists, they will be shot without mercy by interrogation, just like any other foreigner.
The separatists consider these men to be mercenaries, and they think they deserve nothing but death.
But if, for example, Ukrainian soldiers occupy a group of Donetsk separatists – including Chechnya – they will put him behind bars and treat him like a prisoner of war.
The guy's just gonna survive.
The Ukrainian side also behaves like a state in the war.
A.cz: And how many Ukrainian prisoners have you been able to rescue?
If I get it right, I'll trade it.
According to some sources, it has long exceeded a hundred men.
It’s been a long time since we stopped counting how many people we’ve helped.
But we only liberated them... we didn't save them from war if they decided to keep fighting.
Rescuers are doctors, surgeons in the war, but we certainly aren't.
That's it.
And every day there are more and more.
We're saving someone every day.
Sometimes one, sometimes four, sometimes five.
It doesn’t always have to be an exchange.
Sometimes even a simple human request is enough to release the prisoners.
A.cz: It is rumored that in a few months you have gained great authority and even trust from pro-Russian separatists... as well as from Ukrainian society.
How did you manage to build respect for both sides of the war?
It's a tough question.
One of the officers in Kiev gave me the nickname "the crazy general with the steel balls".
It doesn't bother me.
And maybe that outweighs the nature of our work.
As the head of the Ukrainian Army Corps, I have gained some authority in the past.
I never cheat, I never cheat, and I always keep my word.
No matter what happens, I act honestly and speak the truth.
Even when it is the Ukrainian government, or the Donetsk or Luhansk very unpleasant.
If they torture and kill people?
So I'm just telling them to torture and kill them.
And that they are crimes.
I often risk my life, even when I've been taken prisoner and taken... this job can mean the end for me at any time... I don't have to come back.
A.cz: How many executions and tortures of prisoners do you know?
... (long turmoil) ... Ukrainians and separatists retreat to torture the prisoners during interrogations.
I'm sorry.
And the executions?
They're only on the donation side.
The fact that the Ukrainian army is also executing the prisoners, I have no information.
There are no indications that the Ukrainian army is doing something similar.
We have an idea of the number of executions, but I can't and don't want to.
A.cz: Describe to me the characters and motives of the pro-Russian separatists.
Among them are officers, as well as veterans from Afghanistan.
They are trying for independence and perhaps democracy in Donetsk or Luhansk, at least that’s what they say.
They no longer want to play games with Ukrainian oligarchs.
The separatists already have oligarchs full of teeth and are their relentless opponents – to life and to death.
As we say, they ate them up to their throats.
The same dreams and aspirations were revealed by the people in Maydan, by the way.
Now let me speculate: Russia supports the separatists and the West supports the Ukrainian state.
I think one is big and the other is small.
But this sentence of mine already contains an irreconcilable contradiction.
A.cz: What do you think, for example, of one of the toughest leaders of pro-Russian separatists, Igor Bezler?
Every time I cross the line of the war front, I am unarmed and I show soldiers or armed men my bare hands.
And I always have both sides of those two hundred or three hundred yards on a fly or in an optical target.
I can see the faces of the people who are aiming at me every time... and they can press the trigger of their weapons at any time.
Commander-in-Chief, experienced colonel with German and Ukrainian ancestors.
He is considered a Russian officer, but his family - his mother - lives in Ukraine.
He believes that Ukraine should not exist.
And if so, just like a small government in a large Russian empire.
In any case, he is constantly talking about it and considers Ukraine to be some kind of misunderstanding.
Such a state should not even exist.
At the same time, he is an unrelenting enemy of all Ukrainian oligarchs.
A.cz: Speaking of the characters - in a discussion show on Ukrainian television, you described your Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk as a weak, helpless and tired "leader" who would do best if he left quickly.
For those three hundred meters of walking, I always get at least five times fear.
So why should I hide from the view that Jace<0xC5><0x88>uk is a very weak prime minister and that he is harming our country?
A.cz: Do you think he has a share in the war in Ukraine?
Perhaps you know that the Ukrainians call Jacenuk "the rabbit".
And the rabbit is not in the eyes of the Ukrainians an animal from which he would be afraid or should have respect and authority with others.
His behavior is directly copying the rabbit's behavior.
He may be a good economist, but as a prime minister in war he has no right to cry in parliament, to ask him, to play with his intrigues, to threaten him to lay down a function... he must run the country, manage it, and protect it in times of war.
When a country is threatened, the prime minister is not entitled to family, friends, rest for crying emotions.
He is the first prime minister of Ukraine.
And Jacenuk?
She acts like a puberty girl.
Yes, he’s tired, but he’s also weak, because he’s never been strong... he’s not fighting for Ukraine, he’s just constantly complaining about everything.
That's why he should leave.
The sooner, the better for Ukraine.
Why the Guardians of the Galaxy Couldn't Save Revenue
The needy 3 Sylvester Stallone returned less than $30 million from the U.S. $90 million budget and Sin City: A Woman for whom I would kill only $12 million from the $70 million budget.
The film Sex Tape with Cameron Diaz made only $14.6 million during the first weekend and also movies for kids like How to Train a Dragon 2 were a disappointment for cinema.
According to Robbie Collin's article in Telegraph, the quality of children's films is to blame.
Collin called 2014 the “worst” year of children’s films and called How to Train a Dragon 2 a mere “functional” sequel.
When it comes to films deployed to a slightly older target group, it seems that the problem may not necessarily be in the quality of the films themselves.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared CinemaScore and Metacritic and their average ratings of summer film premieres broadcast in at least 2,000 cinemas between War Victims’ Day and July 20, 2013 and this year.
The results, which take into account the views of viewers and film critics, suggest that this year’s film crop is of similar quality to last year’s hits.
According to some commentators, the change in viewer access and the higher popularity of internet servers like Netflix may be to blame.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Disney’s Jungle Book processing, said on the Hollywood Reporter website: “I think times are changing.”
We have to admit it and not try to hunt down what was already there.
Unlike the current crisis in Hollywood’s cash markets, Netflix’s net profits were $1.2 billion, almost twice as high as last year’s $837 million.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticised the studio for relying too much on the rights to comics, and predicted a “shock” of Hollywood.
In the light of the current collapse, some commentators declare that there may be something on his catastrophic warning.
With the introduction of possible major casino markets in the summer of 2015 including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Mimon and Jurassic World, other numbers are more optimistic in the film industry.
X-Men producer Simon Kinberg recently described the decline in sales as simply “cyclical.” For Hollywood Reporter, “Next summer will be the summer of the biggest casino markets in history and no one will worry about selling.”
DPRK threatens Seoul again, launches another short-range missile
North Korea has launched another short-range missile into the sea, Seoul said.
The alleged missile test took place shortly after the end of joint military maneuvers between the United States and South Korea, which Pyongyang sees as preparations for the invasion.
Chagang Province is located in the northwestern part of the KDLR at the border with China.
A spokesman for the South Korean Defense Ministry said the missiles had been fired from a location in the northwestern DPRK and had flown some 200 kilometers away.
North Korea has apparently fired a missile from Chagang province for the first time, South Korean media said, referring to military circles.
In the province, there is an underground firing ramp for Scud missiles.
This is another of a series of similar tests carried out by the isolated North Korean regime in recent weeks.
North Korea has conducted an unusually large number of missile and artillery tests this year.
NATO Summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
Over the weekend, protests against the NATO summit took place in Newport.
Hundreds of people gathered in downtown Newport on Saturday to take part in the anti-NATO march.
And on Sunday, about 150 people came to Cardiff City Hall for a meeting that was described as anti-summit.
Stephen Fairclough watched the situation over the weekend and spoke to protesters arriving from Bridgend to Belgium.
The teenagers had to be transported by air from the Blue Mountains.
Two young tourists were picked up by plane and taken to safety after spending the night in the Blue Mountains in New South Wales.
A sixteen-year-old girl and an eighteen-year-old man went on a tour of Govetts Leap in Blackhead after Sunday afternoon.
When they did not return home, worried relatives called the police at around 8 p.m.
A search crew, including local police and a rescue team, was dispatched and the pair were found near Bridal Veil Falls at around 11 p.m.
The girl hurt her knee, and the man fell and fell into her head.
The policemen stayed with them overnight and were picked up on Monday morning.
In a stabilized state, they were transported by ambulance to Blue Mountains Hospital.
Olomouc brought from Opava only a point, had a win on the leg Va<0xC5><0xA1>i<0xC4><0x8D>ek
It was the 23-year-old forvard who could decide, but in the two biggest chances he failed.
After the goal, the main shot was called close to three minutes before the end, but the place in the net ended up on the goalkeeper of Opava Josef Kv<0xC4><0x9B>to<0xC5><0x88>.
I had it on my feet, I have to give it a chance.
I'm mad at myself," your ash fell on his head.
"Maybe I should have put it up under the lid, I'm a little tired," he thought.
Defensive Sigma did not allow much of Opava, except for Mikul's 11th minute attack, which was covered by the Reichl goalkeeper.
Then they began to push the Hanats, but they did not let them down in the block of the defenders and the munitions from a distance were captured by the Flower.
Fifteen minutes were compared, and then we took the initiative.
In the second half we were already better, we had more of the game and Opava only threatened us with standard situations.
But the chance Va<0xC5><0xA1>i<0xC4><0x8D>ek did not change, and so it ended 0:0," said Han<0xC3><0xA1>kko coach Leo<0xC5><0xA1> Kalvod.
Opava also took the point due to the absences in the assembly, where, in addition to the pair of injured, Petr Vav<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k and the three-point shooter Petr <0xC5><0xA0>ev<0xC4><0x8D><0xC3><0xAD>k, who are in Silesia from Sigma, were missing.
This, unlike its previous policies, did not allow them to enter.
Substitutes deserve acquittal.
Sigma was more of a footballer, but we didn’t leave her to nothing until one standard,” said Slezan coach Petr Bar<0xC3><0xA1>nek.
There was a lot of emphasis, aggression, and combativity to be seen.
The draw is well deserved, the point is a decent profit for us," he added.
The Sigma scored four points, which is the 13th place.
Nothing that could satisfy the head of the club Josef Lebra, who after the defeat with Znojm conditioned his million-dollar deposit in the cash register with diametrically different performances in the next matches.
"We were aware of Mr. Lebra's warning, so it can't be that the boys don't want to fight," Calvoda remarked, adding to the address of the sleeping shooter Va<0xC5><0xA1>i<0xC4><0x8D>ka: "I believe it will come and when he scores, it will start to fall there.
But after the first hit, I'll replace him right away so he can save goals for another game," Calvoda laughed.
Al Pacino has beaten Venice twice.
The film industry is experiencing a crisis.
After a huge enthusiasm for the opening film Birdman, whose director Alejandro Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez I<0xC3><0xB1><0xC3><0xA1>rritu has been ranked among the serious candidates for the Golden Lion, other days gave the impression that the interest in the 71st anniversary of the festival in Venice was somewhat.
Either because the number of seats in the largest hall increased to fourteen hundred, or because Birdman was followed by critically acclaimed, but less appealing, films for viewers such as a document on the genocide in Indonesia in the 1960s, he made his homecomings in the 1990s.
Heroes of the Comics
Not even the red carpet in front of the festival palace has been replaced by such crowds as in the past and it is said that it has ceased to be a problem to get a place at the last minute in the hotel.
There is more talk of the crisis in Italy than anywhere else and it is no wonder that it has hit even such esteemed institutions as the Biennale and the oldest film festival in the world.
Fortunately, the crisis is not manifested by a lack of personalities, but present exclusively in connection with films.
While younger fans longed for the autographs of comic superhero Michael Shannon and Andrew Garfield, who have successfully performed dramatic roles in 99 homes, the main event for all generations has become the visit of legendary actor Al Pacino.
He also starred in two films.
In Revealed Out of Competition, which was filmed by Oscar-winning Barry Levison after Philip Roth’s novel, the forty-seven-year-old Pacino has a role that is close to him: an actor at the top of fame who suffers from depression at the end of his career and personal life.
But to see him the next day as the strange owner of the ironworks from a rural town in the film Manglehorn, filmed by David Gordon Green, it was really an unforgettable experience.
Volpi’s Cup for the best acting performance should not be missed – but does the artist still need the Pacin format for prizes?
Perhaps the greatest satisfaction for him is the love of the audience, and of the Italian in particular, because although he was born in New York, Al Pacino proudly claims to the country from which his grandparents come.
Body for Italy
In fact, the Italian film is doing very well in Venice this year.
The Black Souls, directed by Francesco Munzi, became Birdman's first award-winning long applause.
The Calabrian mafia is viewed by the view of family relationships between clans fighting for power and money, and the director has been able to reconcile all the prerequisites for a good film: a quality script, camera, music and actors.
The chamber psychothriller Hungry Heart, which filmed Saverio Costanzo with Alba Rohrwacher as a woman who almost lost her own child with her narrow anxiety.
On the contrary, French competitive films did not expect a warm reception either of The Redeemer for Glory or of the Three Hearts, both of which are based on a traditional model of consumer films based on the popularity of actors.
But after all, two really great movies, Birdman and Black Soul, are not so few at the first half of the festival.
And although the festival’s images have a lot of depressing ideas, Peter Bogdanovich’s new film, called She’s Funny That Way, a comedy that’s been featured in Venice outside the competition and shot in the style of American comedians of the 40s, has been able to raise it one day.
Police arrested four manufacturers of pervitin in Prague, drugs drove from Poland
"In the past few days, the detectives have arrested three men, ages 42, 42 and 37, and a twenty-five-year-old woman, who from November to August last year produced and sold the drug pervitin in Prague 9," police spokeswoman Jana Rössler said.
First, on Tuesday, August 12, the intervention unit in Cihl<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>sk<0xC3><0xA1> street caught a forty-two-year-old organizer and dealer in one person and a young woman who appeared in the group as a drug buyer in Poland and a drug dealer.
The next day, the detectives arrested another member of the group, a thirty-seven-year-old man, with the prior consent of the State Attorney.
The last of the four police officers were found on Wednesday morning, August 20, at the site of the Malay combustion plant," the spokeswoman said.
A woman was given a third of the drugs for transporting drugs from Poland
The main organizer had a wide range of activities.
In the workshop of the airfield, in the garden house in Horom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice, in the apartment in Kon<0xC4><0x9B>vov street and in other places in Prague 9 he produced pervitin, supplied various tools and chemicals necessary for its production and ensured the transport of drugs with pseudoephedrine from the Republic of Poland.
He further weighed the manufactured drug, divided it into plastic bags and subsequently sold pervitin.
He was helped by a twenty-five-year-old woman who had not yet been punished with transporting drugs from Poland or selling drugs to drug addicts.
For this, she received a reward from the organizer in the form of a third of the drug produced," added Rössler.
On the orders of the judge, the criminals also carried out several home inspections, where they secured drugs, industrial chemicals, digital scales, salaries bags, injection syringes, hoses and other tools and items that can be considered to be a complete production according to the expertise of met.
The dealer has been fined seven times since 1995.
“From the available records, the police found that since 1995, the chief organizer has been sentenced seven times for property crimes, and the woman has not been prosecuted,” the police spokeswoman added.
The last detainee was sentenced in 2006 for a crime of sexual abuse and a thirty-seven-year-old auto mechanic, who is being tried for freedom, has been tried nine times since 2009.
Even in his case, it was mostly a criminal activity.
The investigator accused three men and a woman of committing a crime of illicit production and other handling of narcotics and psychotropic substances and poisons, threatening them with up to ten years in prison.
In the case of three persons, the investigator finally submitted to the prosecutor a proposal for the imposition of a bond, where the judge eventually placed them," she said.
The fourth defendant, a thirty-seven-year-old recidivist, was released.
His position and role in this case was not as important as that of the other defendants.
The cops are still working with this man.
Ferrari offers chessboards made of wood and carbon.
Ferrari offers very interesting things within its other products at a lot of "interesting" prices.

The customer will receive a set of wooden black and red lacquered figures stored in a wooden box covered with carbon fibers.
It’s no surprise that instead of a classic rider, players have at their disposal a figurine of a climbing horse.
If the chess doesn’t seem like a gift of sufficient value to you, you also need a Ferrari 500 F2 made (of course by hand) on a scale of 1:1.8.
The price of this toy is 318 305 CZK.
Interrupting high school and high school makes no sense.
The Czech Republic has few generally educated people and statistics also show that gymnasts have good applicability.
The beginning of the school year is here.
In the last 14 days, great preparations were underway in the schools.
Usually these are routine matters, such as transferring pots from a summer storage room back to the classroom and inhaling chalks.
They'll have a little bigger frmol at the bitter gymnasium.
A few days before the start of the season, they scan furniture, computers and other technical equipment and literature into the library.
There was no robbery or disbelief, the four-year gymnasium in Ho<0xC5><0x99>ice opened and resumed its activity after three years.
Not on a public platform, but on a private platform.
The lack of material equipment is not caused by the fact that the founders were so incompetent.
They had to wait for the existence of the school to be confirmed by inclusion in the register of schools managed by the M<0xC5><0xA0>MT.
“French socialists should shut up and put France in order,” says key ally Francoise Hollanda.
Valls calls on the strongly fragmented left to "show its support" for the militant socialist president, whose new division of functions was not met with the approval of the majority of the French.
The President deserves universal respect, he deserves loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It's our duty to stay by his side," he said, clapping his applause.
As a pacifist gesture, the prime minister insisted that his government would not challenge the controversial French thirty-five-hour work week, despite the passionate agreements made by Emmanuel Macron, the new finance minister, who voted in the beginning.
On Saturday, Hollande called on the Socialists to remain “coherent” with the government.
But Christiane Taubir, the minister of justice, made a line across the budget when she appeared at a meeting of rebel socialist MPs where she criticized the Socialist Party for having "the French lost faith in the future" because of her.
Marine Le Pen, the ultra-conservative right-wing leader, laughed at the constant internal disputes among socialists when she said she did not expect Valls' new government to last for more than a few months.
Emperor Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande is naked and Prince Manuel Valls as well. They were forced to form a new government when the previous one could not endure even until the end of the summer.
"And the new won't last until the end of autumn or winter," Le Pen told her supporters.
She reiterated her party's call for the dissolution of Parliament and said that she was convinced that the party could win early elections and that she was ready to rule the country.
The French ruling party suffered defeat in the March municipal elections and in May, the extremely conservative right was successful in the elections to the European Parliament.
According to a poll by the Journal du Dimanche, 76 percent of French people believe that the Socialist Party is at risk of splitting into several rival factions before the end of Holland’s term of office in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at the University of Sciences Po, warned that the French would soon have patience if the new socialist government failed to improve the economy and reduce record unemployment.
“It’s a limited space for opportunity, but the public has to think that the situation is changing,” he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could get worse.
Gambling and street art will no longer limit Prague to elections
Changes to the relevant decrees should be prepared and approved until the new leadership of the capital.
No more games will disappear from the streets of Prague before the municipal elections and the city will not limit street art.
There will be no restrictions on dogs.
Prague will not reach the October elections to prepare and approve changes to the relevant decrees in the representative office.
"Moreover, the decision on changes should not be made by the current leadership of the city, which will end its mandate in a few weeks," said Councillor Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Manhart (TOP 09).
Several councillors, such as Prague 5 and 7, have decided to cancel gambling on their territory in the past few weeks.
But the games won’t go away, the gambling announcement won’t change yet.
It is the task of the new leadership of the city after the election.
Now we wouldn’t even technically achieve that, given the deadlines for commenting and so on,” Manhart explained.
He added that the last meeting of the current representation, which must approve the change of the decree, will take place on September 11.
A referendum on the ban on gambling will be held on the day of the municipal elections of the Prague 1 and Prague 8 districts.
Currently, the ban on gambling applies, for example, in Prague 2 or Prague 12.
The decree will not change for the same reasons in the case of street art, so-called busking.
Praha 1, which has already sent the Magistrat a proposal for places to expand the current list of prohibited places, complains about this.
Musicians also don't want Prague 5 in the surroundings of And<0xC4><0x9B>la.
The decree regulating the departure of dogs the city plans for several months, yet it is not completed.
The location of the heren and the problem of busking are solved by city decrees.
They may be issued or edited only by the representative of the capital.
The councils have only an advisory voice, they are not allowed to issue decrees themselves.
Last week, he placed the victory of the proponents of Scottish independence at hand
The Scottish independence campaign was in danger of making this mistake for the third time when it almost put on billboards across Scotland the question of whether the Scots want to be rich.
But you won’t get to the heart of Scottish voters by appealing to their wallets, or earn their respect when you start threatening them.
The New Testament is still alive in Scotland, although few Scots still go to church today.
The Scots have a far greater tendency to expel the exchangers from the temple than to let them dictate how to vote.
The head of the Scottish nationalists, Alex Salmond, is well aware of this, and therefore, in a televised debate, he repeatedly asked his rival, Unionist Darling, whether he was willing to respect the "sovereign will of the Scottish people" if Scottish voters voted for independence, and began to support Ang unilaterally.
This forced Darling to choose between Scottish civil society and London financiers, and he fell into this trap with a grimace.
Of course, Darling will not support the Scottish electorate.
However, the debate about what the currency of Scotland will have been more or less neutralized.
What really motivates Scottish voters is fairness, job opportunities and the public health defense that citizens have for free.
Darling supported London’s bankers on the currency issue and also raised the impression that he would not protest the privatization of healthcare.
As Salmond put it, “he went to bed with the conservatives.”
This is a very dangerous situation for any Scottish politician.
Every Scottish voter knows that Scottish businessmen are in bed with conservatives.
This was confirmed by David Cameron, who in Scotland spoke not to the voters but to the "boss" association, to the Confederation of British Industry.
It is becoming clear that Cameron’s refusal to debate independence with Scottish Prime Minister Salmond was a serious mistake for the Unionist campaign.
Cameron looks like a cowardly absentee.
The Scots would respect him if he came to the debate with the Scottish Prime Minister.
At least Cameron could say that Scotland could be a “successful independent country.”
Alistair Darling can't say anything like that, it's almost a physical pain.
What he communicates is clear: the Scots don’t have to jump and they have to accept what they are.

The end was the best of the holidays at all, the last week that never happened and we just said goodbye and covered with the baby in the summer, the silence before the storm, the calm before the stress.
New clothing, when it could be obtained from Tuzex, boots from East Germany.
Reading the Fast Arrows, already in the fifties, climbing the mountain around the Empire to the back of the Vary, somewhere to the tennis courts, it was no longer hot, the sun was flattening back and shoulders, the beams doubled on the farewell.
In the evening a slight nervousness, still a holiday mode, sleeping until half-eleven, in a week will be worse, the moments before going to sleep stretch from a few minutes to two hours, then in the morning get up at half-seven.
He's coming Monday.
Most of the time it doesn’t rain, on the contrary, the summer slumps maliciously in front of the school.
To cling to the plaque in a spooky light and feel like a plastic figure in a glass mine, there is the school, ZDS A.
Z<0xC3><0xA1>pot<0xC3><0xB3>tok<0xC3><0xBD> with an enormously pink plaster, and in front of it the old familiar faces and a few new ones, boys more drawn out, girls more boobs.
There's the cowards out there, avoiding them, just as interesting as they're infallibly clinging to each other and how early they're here.
And these grown-up-looking girls who came screaming are now laughing hysterically at something, maybe something has changed in their lives over the holidays, while I'm in the old one.
And the new freshmen, some nervous and other thrills, why are they even coming here?
Because he has to, he's compulsory for military education.
So inside, the cold humidity of the floor and the slight smell of disinfection, the poisoned pupil with mope, unfortunately still the same as the one who says borrows the pupil a key from the sheet metal box, where the textbooks can be left and which are still so few.
For the bottle.
The smell of the dress remains in memory, now it is not happening, it is nicely ventilated, but in a week it will be worse.
It's just the idea that the stomach is closing and it starts to hurt.
A head that understands the lesson of mathematics even worse, the devilish game for the chosen, which I do not belong to and never will be.
Again the threes and fours, not the fives, hide from trial, fall into a bench and best sublimate, be there and not be, exist only as a name in the classroom, and dream not yet a few stories about the nicest girls and the nicest buildings.
The longest year has ten months.
And it's only the first day, now like years ago.
She let her daughter-in-law die.
She will face an extraordinary punishment - Novinky.cz
The first birth took place in March 2012 in a public toilet cabin at the bus station in Jihlava.
Without the help of a stranger, a little girl was born, who, after cutting the umbilical cord, wrapped it in a prepared blanket, hid it under the jacket, and took it to the roadside, where she placed it in the bushes several tens of meters away from the road.
Born on the way to school
I think it came to me a little earlier.
I was on my way to school.
On the bus I needed to go to the toilet, I gave birth there.
She was born alive, looking at me.
I cut the umbilical cord with scissors that I wore to school,” the accused described, saying she was ashamed of being pregnant.
"The next day she returned to the place, put the body of the child in the backpack and took it away, took the body out of the backpack, wrapped it in a black igelite bag and hid it and left it under the staircase in her grandmother's house in Havl<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>kova Brod," says the new-born mother-in-law.
It could be in tens of minutes, but also a few hours after birth, suffocation when covered with a blanket or when put under a jacket, subcooling or bleeding from an unbound umbilical cord.
A similar scenario was repeated the following year in the spring.
The woman, in an unidentified period from February to April 12, when the child’s body was found by random witnesses under a crust at a pond in Havl<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>kobrodsko, gave birth herself again in secret.
This time in the bathroom of the attic apartment in the family house.
Without checking whether she was born alive, she cut and tied the umbilical cord around her neck, inserted the baby into several plastic packages including an igelite bag, and left it in the bathroom.
Later in the afternoon, he and his then-partner were taken to the pond.
Finally, a friend gave it to her.
The father of the two children was just a friend of the defendant, who allegedly did not know about his partner's pregnancy.
For this reason, he is not currently in court, he was only punished for a crime against the Funeral Act.
He was also the one who later turned to the police.
I don't like him being punished as a co-worker.
He manipulated the child against my wish.
I know my solution wasn’t right, but it seemed to me as human at the time,” the accused, who was supposedly subject to the man’s relationship and was afraid of him, said.
During her remarks, the young woman spoke fairly evenly.
Tears fell into her eyes until the moment when she talked about the relationship with her parents, from whom she left after reaching adulthood.
She said she didn't want to kill
“They come to visit me every 14 days, they do everything for me, even though I know I don’t deserve it,” she said.
I didn't buy a suit because I didn't want children, I felt young.
I wanted to put it in the baby box, but I don't know what happened that I didn't.
I can't explain it to you," the judge answered the question.
However, she refused to act with rethinking and intent to kill the newborn.
The second child, according to her, was also born dead.
She did not stop drinking alcohol during her pregnancy.
But I've limited it.
And she didn't drink hard.
“I also smoked,” she said.
Although the pregnancy was seen on her in both cases, everyone, even on repeated questions, claimed that she had health problems, that she was introduced.
And that's my friend.
The main lawsuit will continue at the castle court on Tuesday with statements by court experts.
A judgement could be made on Wednesday.
The woman is threatened with a criminal rate of up to 18 years in prison, or even an exceptional punishment.
Norwegian Cruise is close to a three-billion-dollar acquisition of Prestige Cruise
According to sources familiar with the whole matter, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings s.r.o. (NCHL.O), the world’s third-largest cruise operator, has advanced the acquisition of Prestige Cruises International Inc. for approximately $3 billion.
The deal by Norwegian Cruise, a $6.8 billion market-valued company that competes with greater competition from Royal Carrebian Cruises s.r.o. (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N), allowed access to luxury cruise ships Prestige Cruises and rich clients.
The deal could be released as early as this week, a source said on Sunday, but noted that the negotiations may still not end successfully.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, a private investment company of Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns a 20 percent stake in Norwegian Cruise.
The sources did not want to be named because the actions are not public.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to the request for comment, a spokesman for Apollo declined to comment on the situation.
Headquartered in Miami, Norwegian Cruise operates thirteen cruise ships on cruises in North America, the Mediterranean and the Baltic Seas, Central America and the Caribbean.
The company’s revenue in 2013 was $2.57 billion, up 13% from 2012.
Prestige Cruises operates under the Oceania and Regent brands, which together own eight cruise ships sailing to Scandinavia, Russia, the Middle East, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
The company reported revenues of $1.2 billion in 2013, 6% more than in the previous year.
It is expected that the 29 billion cruise segment will benefit from the growth of the middle class in emerging economies such as China and India in the coming year.
The companies are competing to make them the preferred option for these customers when selecting trips.
Prestige Cruises registered its first public tender with U.S. regulators in January 2014.
Apollo has held a majority stake in the company since 2007 since the close of the $850 million deal.
Norwegian Cruise has existed in its current form since 2000, when it merged with a cruise operator owned by Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a consortium of leisure businesses and casinos controlled by Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
In 2008, Apollo invested a billion dollars in Norwegian Cruise.
Norwegian Cruise introduced the stock on the stock exchange in January 2013.
At the end of June, Genting held a 28 % stake, Apollo 20 % and the private investment company TPG Capital LP 8 %.
According to registration documents, the first public offer includes Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruises in total 82% of the volume of North American passengers.
Pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong provoke Chinese authorities on the day after voting decision
A group of people loyal to Beijing were standing nearby, carrying the Chinese flag.
The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress on Sunday approved that only two of the three candidates will participate in the 2017 elections in Hong Kong.
All candidates must first get the support of the nominating committee, which is likely to consist of members loyal to Beijing.
Because of this decision, it is almost impossible for opposition Democrats to get on the ballots and force pro-democracy activists to renew their promise to protect Hong Kong’s financial center by the “Occupy Central” protest movement.
In Hong Kong, political reform is the main reason for tensions, with Chinese leaders fearing that the demand for democratization will spread to other cities.
After Beijing published a detailed report lining China’s official authority in Hong Kong in June, Democratic activists held an informal referendum on elections in a special official district and hundreds of thousands of people marched into the city’s trade and commerce district.
The press conference, to be held by Prime Minister Li, is organized by the government in Hong Kong and the Chinese liaison office in Hong Kong.
During the day, Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Legislative Commission Zhang Ronghsun and Deputy Director of the State Council of the Office for Hong Kong and Macau Feng Wei were also to speak at several press conferences.
Student activists said they were meeting in front of the Hong Kong government’s office this afternoon.
Until the last days of colonial rule 150 years ago, Britain never mentioned democracy in Hong Kong.
Putin calls on Kyiv to start negotiations with eastern Ukraine on “state sovereignty”
Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday asked the Ukrainian government to stop fighting separatists in the east of the country and immediately start negotiations on the “state sovereignty” of the torn-off areas, according to the Russian newspaper.
His spokesman Dmitry Peskov later explained that Putin did not intend to suggest in his remarks that the areas of eastern Ukraine under the control of separatists would become part of Russia, but that their status within Ukraine should be re-evaluated by the legislatures to make the Russians speak to the region and the right.
Putin’s call to the Kyiv government to treat the pro-Russian rebels as equals corresponds to an obvious strategy that follows from the outbreak of unrest five months ago: Help the separatists besiege the territory by the factionists and force the Russians not to overthrow the Ukrainian government.
In an interview for the first state-run TV channel, Putin condemned Ukrainian military actions to retake the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions, which were dominated by separatists in March and April after Moscow annexed the Crimean peninsula on March 18.
The Kremlin and the separatists have referred to the newly occupied territories as "New Russia" or "New Russia", a term that refers to the famous pre-revolutionary days of the Russian Empire.
Russian news agency Itar-Tass published Putin's words that "prison is an illusion" anyone who believes that there are peaceful negotiations on the horizon, because Ukrainian politicians launched campaigns before the separatist elections on October 26, as civilians overthrew government units.
“In the interests of the people living in these areas, we must immediately initiate meaningful negotiations, not only on legal matters, but also on the political organization of society and on the status of the state sovereignty of southeastern Ukraine,” he said.
Peskov said Putin’s call for state sovereignty was conceived in the context of broader autonomy, which has been negotiated with Kiev’s leadership for several months and which is intended to mitigate concerns of Russian-speaking areas over endangering cultural and language rights.
Peskov said that only the Ukrainian government can grant the necessary autonomy to the eastern regions.
It is not a matter of negotiation between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, “because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal Ukrainian conflict.”
The Kremlin spokesman’s move to correct Putin’s “misinterpretation” of his remarks underscored Russia’s approach to resolving the separatist uprising in the east, which is different from the open occupation of Crimea, where the majority of the two-million-strong Russian population originated.
Moscow would have much more trouble annexing Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million people are not Russians, and public opinion polls that took place before the conflict have shown broad support for the continuation of Ukraine.
The autonomy that Russian diplomats have negotiated in international forums would give regional governments in Ukraine the power to define their own trade agreements and international relations, and thus give the Kremlin factual control over the territory that would connect the Russian mainland.
The Black Sea peninsula, annexed five months ago, is home to the main Russian naval fleet, maritime commercial facilities and historic coastal resorts.
The areas between Russia’s Rostov and Crimea are also the center of downhills, factories and foundries that produce important components for the Russian army.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, during his inaugural address on 7 June, proposed that Ukrainian legislators - after the new elections - consider changes to the constitution that would give various regions more control over their finances and language status.
However, this vision of autonomy differs considerably from that of the Kremlin and the separatists, and Moscow is accused of arming and inciting violence.
Putin’s last call for Kiev to act as a separatist, followed by another insurgent march last week after Russian troops and tanks invaded eastern Ukraine from previously peaceful areas along the Azov Sea.
The Russian-intensified separatists have seized control of Novoazov with such force that Ukrainian security authorities fear it is a move to occupy strategic coastal territory as far as Crimea.
This accelerated the enormous civilian and military effort to fortify Mariupol, a port with metallurgical combinations of 500,000 inhabitants, which lies between Novoazovsk and the narrow entrance gate to the Crimean peninsula.
Poroshenko spoke at a meeting of EU leaders in Brussels on Saturday and called for action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, the former Soviet Republic, which has been independent for 23 years.
"We are approaching a point from which there is no return," Poroshenko warned.
There are now thousands of foreign military units and hundreds of foreign tanks on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit has not taken any definitive steps - leaders are calling for further sanctions against Russia in the event of a more unspecified escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Colonel Andriy Lysenko, a spokesman for the Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council, told reporters in Kyiv on Saturday that Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilovavia after separating two columns of Russian armored vehicles last week in order to bolster the armored vehicles, and sub-divisions for 1,000 military units.
The first of the 63 reported Ukrainian soldiers captured in Ilovajsk during the Russian invasion were exchanged on Sunday for 10 Russian launchers captured a week ago in the hinterland of Ukraine, Lysenko said on Sunday.
Australian celebrities and Gabi Greece are also involved in the scandal with the photos revealed
Geoffrey Edelstein expressed his dislike for hackers who likely stole intimate photos of his fiancée Gabi Grecko and other influential Hollywood stars.
Tinseltown is in shock after in the biggest scandal with hacked photos of celebrities got on the internet a series of explicit photos naked Jennifer Lawrence.
The hacker claims to have sixty photos with naked star Hunger Games Lawrenco and other stars including Kate Upton and Cary Delevingne, singer Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Ley Michelle and actress Kirsten Dunst.
Due to the leak from iCloud, personal images of Australian actresses Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski and Melbourne actress Greece were also reportedly made public.
There are 101 celebrities on the list.
Edelstein, who asked for his hand last month, told Confidential magazine: "It's disgusting."
All private correspondence and all private images should be kept private. <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80>
It is a shame that personal information can be stolen and spread to the public.
Greece, which is now in New York, told reporters online newspapers that the hacking is “unshameful” and those who have become its target “become humiliated.”
The hacker is believed to have obtained 30 photos of Palmer with his ex-boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two shots of him unfolding up by the pool.
Palmer, for example, acted in the film Love and Honor, where she was Liam Hemsworth's counterpart.
Palmer, TV star Chuck Strahovski, and actress from the Sucker Punch Browning thriller did not comment on the stolen footage yesterday.
Lawrenc's TMZ spokesperson said: "This is a clear breach of privacy."
Seth Rogen tweeted: “Publishing photos from hacked phones is exactly the same as selling stolen goods.”
From a legal point of view, the publication of stolen images should not be tolerated.
Sigma footballers beat Lebra, even without a win
Olomouc - The thunder and lightning that the co-owner of the Olomouc Sigma Josef Lébr sent to his subordinates last week, seems to be the past.
In the end, Opava brought only the point of a wireless draw.
They have only improved a little by the commitment and combativity of the club boss.
The money for the payoffs could be coming to the club soon.
"I'm going to have another game, as I talked about last week, but I'm much more optimistic," Lebr said, adding that despite Sigma's failure to win, the players convinced him of improved performance.
The combat and commitment that we played mainly in the second half was exactly what I wanted to see from the players.
In that case, I'm able to forgive him for not winning.
If we had been playing like this since the start of the season, I'm sure we haven't lost yet," Lebr thinks.
Sigma in Opava stopped the introductory pressure of the home team, then settled the game and in the second half she was already better.
After Calvod's victory, the trustees scored but failed to reach the goal, so they could not win.
The result is not according to our ideas.
However, we had only one chance to be completely satisfied," said Lebr, who does not believe that the change in the attitude of footballers was caused only by his threat.
There were certainly more aspects.
Whether from my side, from the coach or from the fans," Lebr said.
Sigma has to rely on pressure.
After the match in Opava, the players did not want to comment much on last week’s event.
I'm trying to put these things away completely.
I tried not to allow it," the young goalkeeper Michal Reichl shook his head.
Without comment, he left a question about Lébrov’s statement from last week’s striker V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Va<0xC5><0xA1>i<0xC4><0x8D>ek, who did not change Sigma’s biggest opportunity in Saturday’s match.
But then he talked a little bit about the pressure.
We'll always be under pressure.
They're all trying to pull us off.
“Today we showed that if we fight and drive everybody’s ass, it’s going to work,” he said.
They took the warnings to heart.
Even coach Leo<0xC5><0xA1> Kalvoda did not argue that preparing for the match was not the easiest due to the atmosphere that prevailed in Olomouc last week.
It was hard enough.
But I think the boys realized it, and today it was seen that they took Mr. Lebra's warning to heart.
Even if it wasn't about not wanting to fight and they're going to take it off," said the Olomouc coach.
It was similar to the first 15 minutes today.
It took us a while to compare ourselves to the toughness and realize what the second league was all about.
That it's not just about football, it's about combat," Calvoda said.
All we have to do is hope that in the next game Sigma will work from the start.
"I'd love to believe it," he added.
