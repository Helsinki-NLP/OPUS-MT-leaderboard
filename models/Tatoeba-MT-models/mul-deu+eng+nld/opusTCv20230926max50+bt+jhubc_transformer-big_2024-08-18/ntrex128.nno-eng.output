Welsh members of the National Assembly are afraid not to be taken seriously
Several members of the National Assembly were recently horrified by a proposal to change the name from assembly member or AM (Member of Assembly) to member of the Welsh Parliament or MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The reaction came due to plans to change the name of the National Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of several political parties are concerned that they may be ridiculed.
A member of Labour said his group is concerned about your "MWP rhymes with Twp and Pwp"
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, "twp" means silly and "pwp" means silly.
A member of the Plaid party said the group "is not satisfied" and has proposed alternatives.
A Welsh Conservative member said his group has an "open mind" when it comes to the name change, but added that MWP is not far from the word "muppet".
In this context, the Welsh letter w is not pronounced unlike the English Yorkshire dialect's pronunciation of the letter u.
The National Assembly's delegation, which is now writing bills to introduce the name change, said, "The final decision as to what members of the National Assembly should be named will of course be up to the members themselves."
A 2017 Welsh official decision gave the National Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the delegation published the results of a public hearing on the naming proposals that demonstrated great support for calling the Assembly the Welsh Parliament.
As for the title of National Assembly members, the delegation preferred Welsh MP or WMP, while the MWP election received the most support during the public hearing.
The members of the National Assembly have reportedly come up with other proposals, but the struggle to become one has given the head of the delegation, Elin Jones, the main work. She is to submit the bill in a couple of weeks.
The legislation of the reforms contains other changes to how the delegation should function as well, including rules on disqualification of assembly members and the design of a committee system.
Assembly members will be able to vote on their name when debating the bill.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday whether to change the name of their country to "Republic of North Macedonia."
The revolt was determined to resolve a conflict that has been going on for many decades with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of the neighboring country in the north represents a claim to the territory and has had many objections to Macedonia's membership applications to the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the referendum on the name change, said he will look away from the result.
Those who support the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price to become a member of the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin quiet as the churches of Harlem, New York, struggle
"The old people I've spoken to said that in the old days there was a bar and a church on every corner," Adams said.
"Today none of the parts are found."
He said he understands why the bars are disappearing.
"People are socializing in other ways now to date," he said.
"Bars are no longer stables in the neighborhood that people visit to normally."
As for the churches, he is concerned that the money from selling the properties will not last as long as the leaders believe, "and sooner or later they are back where they started."
He added that churches can be replaced by community facilities filled with the kind of people who don't care about helping the historic sites in the neighborhood.
"The vast majority who buy commons in these buildings are white," he said. "and so comes the day when all the churches are closed, because it is unlikely that these people who move into the commons will become members of these churches."
Both churches were built of white parishes before Harlem became a black neighborhood - Metropolitan Community in 1870, St Martin's Church a decade later.
The original White Methodist Congregation moved out in the 1930s.
A black friar who had preached nearby, moved into the building.
Saint Martin was taken over by a black bishop led by Pastor John Howard Johnson, who also led the boycott of the shops in 125th Street, a main shopping street in Harlem where the owners were opposed to adding or promoting blacks.
The building suffered major damage in a fire in 1939, but when Pastor Johnson's followers planned to rebuild it, they also ordered a new clock game.
Pastor David Johnson, son of Johnson senior and successor in Saint Martin, was proud to call the clock game "the bells of the poor."
The expert who played at the July clock game called it something else: "A cultural treasure" and "a historical instrument that cannot be replaced."
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also commented that it was the first clock game in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who left the church to play at the larger clock game in the Riverside church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said that Saint Martin found no replacement for him.
What has happened in St. Martin in recent months has become a complicated tale of architects and building workers, some of them added by the leaders of the lay people of the church, and others by the episcopal diocese.
The sacristy, which leads the parish and consists of the leaders of the lay people, wrote to the diocese in July with concerns that the diocese "would ask the sacristy to pay," although the sacristy was not involved in the diocese's addition of architects and construction workers.
Some members of the parish have complained of the lack of openness of the diocese.
13-year-old shark injured in hummer dive in California
Authorities report that a 13-year-old was attacked by a shark on Saturday while diving for lobsters in California on the opening day of the lobster season.
Arrested her just before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel commented to KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had dived with habits for about half an hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy cry for help. He paddled to the boy with a group and pulled him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought only the boy was thrilled to have caught a hummer, before realizing that the boy was shouting "something beat me!
Someone's got me!"
"His whole collarbone was torn off," said Hammel that he observed when he reached the boy.
"I screamed that everyone had to get out of the water: There's a shark in the water!" added Hammel.
The boy was picked up by an air ambulance and taken to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, and his condition is critical.
It is unknown what kind of shark it was that attacked the boy.
Bathing guard Captain Larry Giles said in a press conference that a shark was observed in the area a few weeks earlier, but that shark was not a dangerous black shark.
Giles added that the boy suffered serious injuries to his upper body.
Authorities closed access to the water from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours to investigate and secure the area.
Giles commented that there are more than 135 different species of sharks in the area, but most are not thought to be dangerous.
Shop chain Sainsbury's bets on beauty products
The British chain Sainsbury's will compete with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams' beauty products and offer store services in the store.
As part of an investment in the UK's beauty market, which is worth <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion and continues to grow as the fashion and interior rooms go down, Sainsbury's will test out their beauty products in 11 stores next year, and several stores if it becomes a success.
The investment in beauty products comes at a time when the shelves that used to be filled with TVs, microwaves and interiors are now empty.
Sainbury's said they will double the number of beauty products to 3000 products and offer the brand names Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
They are to give the brands L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees more space and have separate areas for each brand such as in the Boots stores.
The store will also relaunch its own makeup series Boutique and make most products vegan, which will attract more young customers.
In addition, perfume dealer Fragrance Shop will test the hall of its perfumes in two of the Sainsbury's stores. The first opened in Croydon, London, last week, and the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Acting online and a shift to buying small amounts of food every day from local small stores, means that large store chains need to find new ways to reach customers.
Mike Coupe, managing director of Sainsbury's, has commented that the stores will look more and more like department stores, while the store chains are trying to fight the low-priced Aldi and Lidl stores with multiple services and non-food items.
Sainsbury's has merged with the interior chain Argos in hundreds of stores and introduced several Habitat stores, since they bought up both chains two years ago. Sainsbury's claims that this has increased the grocery store and thus defended the acquisition.
The store chain's previous attempt to renew the beauty and pharmacy departments was not a success.
Sainsbury's collaborated with Boots in the early 2000s, but this ended when the parties did not agree on how to share the profits from the pharmacies in the stores.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold the pharmacy chain Celesio, which had 281 pharmacies and owned the Lloyds pharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
They added that Lloyds still has a role to play and will offer an extended luxury range of skin products, including the La Roche-Posay and Vichy brands, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, commented, "We have changed how the beauty shelves will look and experience to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also recruited colleagues with special expertise who should be able to offer beauty services.
Our brands are designed to suit all needs, while the attractive environment and convenient locations mean that we are now an attractive beauty destination that challenges the old way of acting."
Peter Jones 'sudden' after Holly Willoghby resigns from deal worth <0xC2><0xA3>11 million
The star of the television program Dragons Den, Peter Jones, is "striking" after TV host Holly Willoughby withdrew from a deal with his lifestyle brand worth <0xC2><0xA3>11 million to focus on their new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby does not have time to promote their interior and accessories brand Truly.
The couple's collaboration has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The host of the program This Morning, 37, made the news known on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has left the Dragons Den star, Peter Jones, amid the development of their new collaboration on a lifestyle brand to focus on her own contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources report that Jones was "astonishing" when the golden Holly confessed during a tense meeting on Tuesday at Jones's headquarters business in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that Holly's new contracts - worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million - mean that she no longer has time to collaborate on interiors.
The collaboration has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was thought to double Willoughby's estimated fortune of <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
Willoughby, 37, used Instagram to make her not to work with Truly, while Jones fled the UK to settle down in one of her holiday homes.
A source said, "Truthy was absolutely at the top of Holly's priorities.
It would be her long-term plan for the future, and would last for many decades.
Her decision to withdraw has surprised everyone involved.
No one believed their own ears on Tuesday, Truly was so close to launch.
There is a warehouse in Marlow filled with goods ready for sale."
Experts believe that the decision of the This Morning host, who is one of the richest stars in the UK, may cost the company millions due to heavy investment in products, from pillows to candles to clothing and interiors, and may cause delays with the launch.
And that can mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, who is the mother of three, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been close friends of Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby created the brand Truly together with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined the board in March.
The couple vacation together and Jones owns 40 percent of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will become brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity program.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We are not commenting on his business."
Tough conversations "and then we fell in love"
He joked about the criticism he would receive from the media for making a comment some might experience as "unpresidential" and to be so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Said Trump with his silly voice as "news cheering".
"I haven't given up on anything."
He commented that Kim is interested in a new meeting after their first meeting in Singapore in June, which Trump called a major step towards the dismantling of the nuclear weapons program in North Korea.
However, negotiations on the nuclear weapons program have stalled.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea has not received a "similar response" from the United States alleging North Korea's early disarmament.
Instead, he added, the United States continues with sanctions to push North Korea.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech.
"It's going well between us and North Korea," he said.
“We were going to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have a great relationship."
He added that his work to improve relations with Kim has brought positive results - the end of rocket testing, help in the release of hostages and the return of the remains of American soldiers.
He defended his unusual approach in terms of relations with Kim.
"It's so easy to be presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get in, we had about 200 people standing right there," Trump said pointing to the group standing in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia destroy island and kill hundreds
After the Lombok earthquake, foreign aid organizations were notified that there was no need for them.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok residents had to flee, no one declared a national state of emergency, which is needed to obtain international emergency assistance.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they have been very clear that they don't want international help, so it's a bit challenging," Sumbung said.
While Save the Children put together a team to travel to Palu, it is still not certain if the employed with a foreign passport is allowed to work in the field.
Sutopo, the spokesman for the agency for national crises in Indonesia, said that authorities are assessing the situation in Palu to see if international organizations are allowed to offer emergency assistance.
Although Indonesia is susceptible to earthquakes often, the country is not particularly prepared for natural forces.
In the Aceh area, they have built shelters for tsunamis, but they are not common in the rest of the country.
Despite warnings against tsunami in Palu, there was no alarm, which most likely led to more casualties.
Travelling between the Indonesian islands is to usual quite challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship lying at the quay in Lombok to treat those injured in the earthquake is now on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo focused on improving Indonesia's infrastructure during the presidential election, and has spent a lot of money on new roads and railways.
But lack of funding has made it difficult for President Joko's administration, and next year there are elections again.
President Joko is also being pressured when it comes to sectarian tensions in Indonesia, while members of the Muslim majority have welcomed his conservative belief.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands had to flee as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets and used machetes, arrows and bows, and other primitive weapons.
See: Daniel Sturridge saves Liverpool vs. Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss against Chelsea by scoring in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge got the ball from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 metres from Chelsea's goal while the position was 1-0.
He pushed the ball to the left before kicking him up and towards the goal.
The attempt sailed high above the penalty area and fumbled towards the right upper corner of the target.
Finally, the ball fell over a jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and into goal.
"I was just trying to get into that position to take the ball, and I knew that players like Shaq are trying to get as far away as possible, so I was just trying to give myself as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw that Kante came and lost the ball once without thinking about it, and then I shot the ball."
Chelsea led 1–0 after the break after the scoring in the 25th minute by Belgian star Eden Hazard.
Prior to the goal, Hazard gave the ball to Mateo Kovacic before moving off the city near the midfield and into the Liverpool half.
Kovacic quickly picked up the ball on the midfield.
Then he fired it nicely and hired Hazard into the penalty area.
Hazard ran faster than Liverpool's defense and scored with his left foot right past goalkeeper Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will play against Naples in the group stage of the Champions League at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea are scheduled to play against Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
Death toll in Indonesia tsunami rises to 832
The number of victims of the Indonesia earthquake and tsunami has increased to 832, the country's emergency agency reported early Sunday.
Many people were trapped in the ruins of buildings that collapsed in the earthquake, which occurred on Friday and had a strength of 7.5 followed by 6-metre-high waves, the spokesman for the emergency agency, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, reported in a press conference.
The town of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, is now covered with collapsed buildings.
British police arrest 32-year-old man suspected of murder after woman was stabbed to death
A murder investigation has started after a woman was found killed in Birkenhead, Merseyside today early.
The 44-year-old woman was found stabbed at 07:55 in Grayson Mews, John Street, while a 32-year-old man has been arrested, suspected of murder.
Police have asked for tips on the incident from local residents.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said, "The investigation is still in an early phase, but I am asking everyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead who saw or heard anything suspicious about contacting us.
I also urge everyone, including taxi drivers, who can catch something on the dashboard camera, to contact us in case they have important information."
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman found is from Birkenhead, and that she was found in a home.
This afternoon, customs who believe they know the woman have come to the area to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation continues and police have stated that they are in the process of informing the victim's family.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews has tried to get into his own apartment, but has been told by police that no one is allowed to enter or leave the building.
He didn't know what to say when he found out what had happened.
Residents have been notified that they will not be allowed to enter their apartments for many hours.
Someone overheard a police officer saying to a man that the entire area is a place.
A woman came to the scene crying.
She says over and over again "it's so terrible".
At 2 p.m., two police cars could be seen inside the police band and another police car outside the band.
A crowd of police officers stood within the police gang and observed a block of apartments.
If anyone has information, they can send DM to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously by calling <0x2B>44 (0) 800 555 111 with the reference "log 247 from September 30".
Parliament statue of Cromwell becomes last victim of "rewriting history"
The removal of the statue would be the karma of Cromwell and the Taliban-like destruction of several cultural and religious objects in England as his Puritan followers did during the Civil War of the 17th century.
However, the Cromwell Association described Crick's proposal to remove the statue as "noise" and "an attempt to write about history."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Federation, said, "It was inevitable in the current debate on the removal of statues, that the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminster Palace would become a target.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil War was corkly ordered or carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would have been sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor, Thomas, in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's excellent representation of Cromwell is evidence of 19th-century public opinion, and is part of the historiography of a figure that many still think is worth celebrating."
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph, "Cromwell was in the 19th century, and is still today, regarded as a defender of parliament against external pressure, and in his case it was, of course, against the monarchy.
Whether this representation is correct or not, is still a topic of discussion in historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has shaped the development of our nation, and Cromwell was an individual as we know represented one side of that divide.
What he achieved as Lord Protector is also worth celebrating and remembering."
Assassin's Creed Attacks and Kills Chinese Farmers
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China, according to local media reports.
The man, named Yuan, was found dead, with a pulse wound cut and covered with blood, near a pig's beetle on the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou Province, South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing to give pigs vaccines on a farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He had recently traveled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, he found his cousin's death, and discovered that the gate to one of the pigs was open.
He said that in the binge there was a large manger with blood around his mouth.
The autopsy showed that a 250 kg pig had killed the farmer, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and destroyed," the cousin, named Wu, told Guiyang Evening News.
Surveillance camera shows that Yuan came to the market at 04:40 on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed him did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The market leader told Evening News that the pig had been locked in order to prevent him from attacking others, while police gathered evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family is now negotiating compensation with the leader of the market.
Although rare, such attacks from pigs have occurred before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband in Massachusetts, injuring the man seriously.
Ten years earlier, a 295 kg pig held a Welsh farmer caught between himself and a tractor, until his wife scared the pig away.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba reported to CBC News that pigs are not aggressive to normal, but that the taste of blood can trigger the animals.
"They just want to play.
They like to bite a little, they're curious ... they won't hurt you.
You just need to have enough respect for them," he said.
Remains of Hurricane Rosa bring rain to southwestern United States
As predicted in the weather report, Hurricane Rosa becomes weaker over the cool waters along the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring rain to northern Mexico and southwestern United States in the coming days.
Rosa had wind speeds of up to 136 km/h and was a Category 1 hurricane until 05:00 in the Eastern Time Zone of the United States on Sunday, and the hurricane center was 620 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is moving north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low pressure forms over the Pacific Ocean moving eastward toward the west coast of the United States. Rosa comes closer to the Baja California peninsula on Monday in the form of a tropical storm, and will move tropical humidity northwards to the southwestern United States.
Rosa will bring up to 25 centimeters of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
The tropical humidity will react with the low pressure and cause heavy rain in the southwest in the next few days.
Locally, between 3 and 10 centimeters of rain can create dangerous floods and possible landslides in the desert.
Tropical humidity will cause rainfall of between 5 and 7 centimetres per hour in some parts of the southwestern United States, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Between 5 and 10 centimetres of rain is expected in parts of the southwestern United States; especially across much of Arizona.
Dangerous floods can occur due to scattered terrain and tropical rainfall.
It was warned against hiking in the desert on foot due to the danger of tropical rain.
The rain can turn gulfs into blizzarding rivers and lightning and thunderstorms will bring strong winds and dust.
The incoming low pressure will also bring rain to parts of the coast of southern California.
Total rainfall amounts of more than 1 centimeter are possible, which can create small blunders and smooth roads.
This will be the first rainy season in the region.
Spread tropical rain towns will start in Arizona late Sunday evening and early Monday morning, before rain rises late on Monday and Tuesday.
The Four Corners region can expect a lot of rain on Tuesday and Wednesday.
October can witness intense temperature fluctuations throughout the United States as the Arctic becomes colder, but tropical regions will still be quite hot.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic differences in temperatures, even between small areas.
Sunday was an example of dramatic temperature differences in central parts of the United States.
There is almost 20 degree temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, late summer heat will try to build up and spread again.
Much of the central and eastern United States is expected to experience a warm start in October, with 25 degrees and up from the southern part of the large plains to parts of the northeastern United States.
New York City can reach 25 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above average.
The long-term forecast indicates that there are high chances of above-average temperatures in the eastern U.S. through the first half of October.
More than 20 million viewers at Brett Kavanaugh hearing
On Thursday, more than 20 million people watched the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh in the U.S. Supreme Court and the woman accusing him of sexual assault in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six different television channels.
At the same time, the political discussion around the case continued, with interruptions in the regular television programs of various broadcasting companies to reveal the latest news on Friday: a consensus reached by Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake that the FBI should investigate the charges within the next week.
Ford told the Supreme Court Committee that she is 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh felt her when he was drunk and tried to take off her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh said, during a sensitive rehearsal, that he is 100 percent sure that it wasn't her.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people saw the deportation on Friday, according to Nielsen.
The company reached this number by finding the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News and MSNBC.
The numbers were not clear from other channels that showed the rebuttal, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen also has trouble counting viewers watching from the office.
To put this into perspective, there is a similar number of viewers looking at an American football final or Oscar award.
Fox News' hosts have supported Kavanaugh, and the channel was also the one with the most viewers during the day with 5.69 million viewers, Nielsen said.
ABC was in second place 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
People are still interested after the hearing.
Flake was in focus during the drama on Friday.
After Flake, who is a moderate Republican, declared that he is on Kavanaugh's side, he was filmed by CNN and CBS while protesters shouted for him on the way to a hearing with a judging committee on Friday.
He stood and watched the ground for several minutes while the protesters sneered at him on CNN live.
"I'm standing here right in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you believe he will tell the truth to our country?"
Some said to him, "You have power, while so many women are powerless."
Flake said his office has made a statement, and before entering the elevator he said he would have more to say during the committee hearing.
The broadcasting agency showed the hearing on television when the jury committee would vote for or against the nomination of Kavanaugh to the full Senate and further voting.
But Flake said he could only do so if the FBI investigated the allegations against Kavanaugh over the next week, which Democrats have also demanded.
Flake was partially persuaded after talking to his friend, Democrat, and Senator Chris Coons.
After speaking with Coons and several other senators afterwards, Flake made a decision.
Flake's decision proved to have power, because it became clear that the Republicans could not vote for Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the complaints against Kavanaugh.
Theresa May blames critics for "leaking politics" when it comes to Brexit
Britain's Prime Minister, Theresa May, blames the critics of her plans to leave the EU to "make policy" with the future of Britain regardless of national interests, in an interview with The Sunday Times newspaper.
Theresa May is in Birmingham, England, to attend the Conservative Party's conference on September 29, 2018.
Next to the interview with May on the front page of the Sunday Times is an interview with former Secretary of State Boris Johnson, in which he tackles the so-called Chequers plan for Brexit and says that the proposal for Britain and the EU to collect their fees is "totally absurd."
Wayde Sims shooting in USA: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson for Sims shooting
Police have arrested a man suspected of the fatal shooting where Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player from Louisiana State University (LSU), was killed.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, is arrested and jailed for intentional murder, police statement in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.
An official video shows the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said that Sims lost their glasses during the battle.
Police found the glasses at the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, according to a report from the WAFB channel, which is linked to CBS.
After the Simpson interrogation, police said he admitted to having shot Wayde.
Simpson's bail was set at $350,000, reports local newspaper The Advocate.
The coroner of east Baton Rouge published an early autopsy report on Friday showing that the cause of death was a shot in the head that entered the neck.
Baton Rouge police thank the Louisiana state police's special forces, state police's crime lab, Southern University police and local residents for helping them find Simpson.
LSU's athletic director, Joe Alleva, thanked the local police for being "year-wake in achieving justice."
The Sims were 20 years old.
The 2-metre-high basketball player grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
On average, he scored 5.6 points with 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team is "t-shirtless" after Wayde was killed.
"This is something we're always afraid of," Wade said.
Volcano spews out ashes over Mexico City
Ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached southern parts of the capital, Mexico.
The National Center for Crisis Prevention asks Mexicans to stay away from the volcano on Sunday after activity increased in the crater and the center recorded 183 gas and ash emissions within 24 hours.
The center had observed several rumblings and quakes.
Images on social media show thin layers of ash on cars in various neighborhoods of Mexico City, including Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noted an increase in activity in the volcano, located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital, since a 7.1 magnitude earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano is known as "Don Goyo" and has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists within the jubilee of the vote on independence
Six protesters were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after self-defense protesters clashed with police forces, and thousands of other protesters protested against self-defense one year after the vote on possible eviction from Spain.
A group of masked separatists were held back by police forces while throwing eggs and powder coatings that created dark clouds of dust in streets that are usually filled with tourists.
Collisions also broke out later in the day, and police used batons to prevent escalation.
For several hours, the separatists shouted, "Don't forget, don't forgive" while the protesters towards themselves shouted, "Long live Spain."
Local news channels reported that fourteen people were treated for minor injuries following the protests.
The mood is still pressured in the region and many will still have independence one year after the 1 October vote, which was called illegal by Madrid, but was celebrated by separatists in Catalonia.
Most voters voted for independence, but there was also low voter turnout among those opposed to independence and boycotted the voting.
According to Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to prevent the voter turnout and electoral clashes occurred in the region.
Groups who were too independent slept in tents on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the state police.
However, the demonstration went off the stack, but it was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who took part in the separatist protests along with his wife, said that he no longer has hope of independence in Catalonia.
"Last year we experienced one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying for joy for being able to vote for themselves, but now we're stuck again," he said.
Although they won the regional elections earlier in December, the Catalan parties that are too self-governing struggle to hold power this year, while many of their leaders are in exile or detention while awaiting trial for their role in the organization of the referendum and the subsequent self-government.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who filmed the protests in support of police on her phone, said the conflict was housed by policemen on both sides.
"The tension is increasing more and more," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been part of ongoing trials since last year, declared that he will run for election to the European Parliament next year.
"To stand as a candidate in the European elections is the best way to condemn the regression of democratic values and the oppression we have experienced from the Spanish state," he said.
Londonderry, Northern Ireland: Men arrested for accidental car crash into house
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 have been arrested after deliberately crashing into a house several times in Londonderry, Northern Ireland.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 19:30 local time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the car caused damage to the entrance gate and the building itself.
An armrest may have been used to shoot at the car.
Menga Scots give Livingston a 1-0 victory over Rangers in Scottish football
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secure says
Upset Livingston surprises the Rangers and Steven Gerrard experiences his second say after 18 games as a coach for the Ibrox club in Glasgow.
Dolly Menga's shot proved to make the difference while Gary Holt's side evened with Hibernian in second.
Gerrard's side has no away winners in the Scottish Premiership league this season, and is scheduled to play against the Hearts, who are eight points behind, next Sunday.
Before that, the Rangers are scheduled to host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston has six wins in a row, and head coach Holt has still not lost since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses chances against the away team
Holt's team should have been hired long before they scored, creating more problems for the Rangers with their direct play.
Scott Robinson broke through, but had low effort towards goal, causing Alan Lithgow to work hard after meeting Craig Halkett's heading over the goal.
The home team was happy to let the Rangers play in front of them, well aware that they could create trouble for the away team.
And that's how the decisive goal was scored.
The Rangers agreed to a free kick and Livingston made an opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson went against Menga, who took a touch and scored from the middle of the penalty area.
Before then, the Rangers dominated the ball, but saw that the home defense was solid and keeper Liam Kelly was focused.
This pattern continues into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to save a goal.
Scott Pittman tried to score, but was stopped by Rangers keeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgow fared after the ball was returned from Livingston.
Passes were sent back and forth in the Livingston penalty area, while two penalties - after Halkett's challenge to Glenn Middleton, and one for hand - were waived.
'Phenomenal' from Livingston - analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal match and a phenomenal result for Livingston.
Each player played fantastic and still impresses on the curve upwards.
Their playing and player style has barely changed since they returned to the top class, but much of thanks go to Holt for the way he has shocked the team since he became a coach.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was intense, organizing a defense at the military level, while Menga distracted Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall throughout the battle.
The Rangers, on the contrary, were not motivated.
However, as good as they have been under Gerrard, they were not good enough this time.
They didn't play well enough, and only cut up the home half once, which should make the Rangers realize they're not reaching up anymore.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an gets mixed welcome in Cologne
The leaders of Turkey and Germany smiled under the blue sky as they met for breakfast on Saturday, September 29 in Berlin.
It is the last day of Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - which it is hoped will repair relations between the two NATO countries.
Countries have been unified in terms of human rights, press freedom and Turkey's role in the EU.
Erdogan went to Cologne to open a large, new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police prevented a crowd of over 25,000 from gathering in front of the mosque for "security reasons," but many of Erdogan's supporters came up to see their president.
Hundreds of Protestants against Erdogan - many of the Kurds - also came up to condemn Erdogan's policy and the German state's decision to welcome him into the country.
The duelling Protestants reflected the distinction between German Turks, who view Erdogan as a hero, and others, who view him as an autocrat.
Car Accident in Deptford, London: Cyclist Died After Car Crash
A cyclist has lost his life in a collision with a London car.
The collision occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford in southeast London, at 10:15 local time.
The driver stopped and ambulance personnel arrived quickly, but the man died at the scene.
The collision occurred just a few months after another cyclist died when the driver ran off in Childers Street, about 1.6 miles from today's accident.
London police reported that they are in the process of identifying the man and informing his family.
Roads have been closed and buses have to run around the area, while other motorists have been urged to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison in England: Six guards injured in riot
Six prison guards have been injured in a riot in a men's high-security prison, the prison office in England says.
Ongoing unrest erupted in HMP Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire around 09:30 local time on Sunday.
Special "Tornado" forces have been obtained to calm the rebellion, involving eight prisoners in a secluded part of the prison.
The guards have been treated for minor facial injuries.
A prison official said, "Specially targeted guards are supposed to calm down the ongoing rebellion in HMP Long Lartin.
Six guards have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we are ready that those responsible will be reported to the police and may have to sit in jail any longer."
There are more than 500 people in HMP Long Lartin, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the UK.
In June, it was reported that the prison director was treated for injuries, after a prisoner took action.
And in October last year, special forces had to come to the prison to calm a serious revolt, where prisoners threw billiard balls at the guards.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City with flooding (in favor of drought area)
Tropical low pressures are rare in Arizona, but it is precisely such a weather phenomenon that is heading towards Arizona early next week, in that the remnants of Hurricane Rosa stretch southwest over the desert and create fear of flare.
The National Weather Service has issued warnings against flooding on Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona and southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to move directly over Phoenix on Tuesday, and may give rain already late Monday.
The National Weather Service of Phoenix tweeted that "only ten tropical cyclones have had tropical storm or low-pressure status within 300 km of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that reached 60 miles within the Arizona border."
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center report between 5 and 10 centimetres of rain, with isolated amounts up to 15 centimetres in the Mogollon Rim area of Arizona.
It can rain between 2 and 5 centimetres in other areas of the southwest desert, including central parts of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, with isolated total amounts up to 10 centimetres.
For areas outside flammable risk, the rain from Rosa can be a blessing in the drought.
Although flammable is a serious concern, this forecast will likely benefit areas in the southwestern United States that are susceptible to drought.
According to drought monitors in the United States, extreme drought is in over 40 percent of Arizona, which is the second highest drought category, reports weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa will move across the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
With winds of over 135 kilometers per hour, Rosa is on Sunday morning 619 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north at a speed of 19 kilometers per hour.
The storm encounters colder waters in the Pacific Ocean and therefore calms down.
It is expected to reach the coast of Mexico with tropical storm intensity, Monday afternoon or evening.
It is going to rain a lot in parts of Mexico, which can increase the risk of embarrassment.
"Rain between 7 and 15 centimetres is expected from Baja California to northwestern Sonora, with possibility of up to 25 centimetres," reported weather.com.
Rosa will pull northwards along Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the border of Arizona early Tuesday morning as a tropical low pressure, which will pull further up through Arizona and into southern Utah on Tuesday night.
"The biggest danger with Rosa or the remains of this is a lot of rain in Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and the American southwest desert," said the National Hurricane Center.
This rain is expected to create life-threatening floods in desert areas and landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton, England: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested, suspected of murder after a 16-year-old was found stabbed in Somerset, England.
The teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton around 04:00 on Saturday.
He was taken to hospital, and his condition is stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested last night in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset police report.
Police have urged people who may have mobile footage of what happened, to contact.
Trump says Kavanaugh "suffered" during how "bad and angry" Democrats were against him
"A voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice against the ruthless and unfair tactics of the Democrats," Trump said during a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh has "suffered" under how "bad and angry" the Democrats were through the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified in front of Congress on Thursday, and emotionally denied the accusation from Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her decades ago, when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified about her guilt during the hearing.
The president said on Saturday that the "American people were able to see how brilliant and brave" Kavanaugh was that day.
"A voice of Judge Kavanaugh is a voice of one of the most skilled lawyers of our time, a lawyer with flawless public service," he said to a crowd of followers in West Virginia.
The president also referred to Kavanaugh's nomination when talking about how important it is for Republicans to vote in the midterm elections in the United States.
"Five weeks to one of the most important choices of our lives.
I'm not asking, but I'm really asking," he said.
"That's why I'm traveling around to fight for good candidates."
Trump argued that the Democrats are looking to "resist and block."
The first important vote in the Senate on the nomination of Kavanaugh is expected to take place by Friday, a Republican representative told CNN.
Hundreds killed in earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia, death toll rises
At least 384 people have been killed, many of them taken by huge waves on beaches, while a severe earthquake and a tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities reported on Sunday.
Hundreds of people were gathered to attend a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday when the waves, which were six feet high, struck the beach at sunset, taking many people while destroying everything they came across.
The tsunami came after an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5.
"When the warning about the tsunami came yesterday, there were still people on the beach who didn't leave immediately and so they became victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the Indonesia BNPB crisis relief agency, in Jakarta.
"As if the tsunami wasn't enough in itself, he carried cars, tree trunks, houses; he hit everything ashore," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had traveled across the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coast.
Some climbed trees to avoid the tsunami and survived in that way.
Around 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Photo from the air published by the emergency agency shows many destroyed buildings and shops, distorted and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
Aftershocks continue to hit the coastal town on Saturday.
The earthquake could be noted in the surrounding area, which has a population of 2.4 million.
Indonesia's Agency for Testing and Testing Technology (BPPT) stated that the energy from the earthquake on Friday, was about 200 times stronger than the energy from the atomic bomb over Hiroshima during World War II.
The geography of the city, located at the end of a long, narrow wave, may have increased the size of the tsunami, the agency said.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels have collapsed.
The bodies of the dead have been found during the remains of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and that 29 are still missing.
Nugroho said that the death toll and the size of the destruction may be greater along the coast 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the quake.
"We haven't heard anything from Donggala, communication has been cut" said Nugroho.
"More than 300,000 people live there," said the Red Cross, adding that their employees and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse," said the Red Cross.
The crisis agency was criticized on Saturday for not informing that a tsunami had hit Palu, although authorities said waves came within the period of time that was warned.
An amateur video shared on social media shows a man on the top floor of a building shouting desperately at people down the streets to warn them of the coming wave.
A few minutes later, a wall of water hits the coast, bringing buildings and cars.
Reuters could not verify the video at first.
The earthquake and tsunami caused power outages and cut off communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate emergency relief.
The military has started the process of sending in cargo planes with emergency assistance from Jakarta and other cities, authorities report, but the refugees still need food and have other basic needs.
The city's airport was reopened to receive emergency assistance, but will continue to be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit the evacuation centre in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll in Indonesia exceeds 800.
It's really bad.
The World Vision employees from Donggala have safely arrived in Palu City, and have set up tents in the backyard of their office. On their way to the city, the totally devastated areas passed, Doseba said.
"They told me that they saw many destroyed houses," he said.
It's really bad.
While emergency relief organizations are starting work to help those affected by the tsunami, some have complained that foreign emergency workers with expertise in crisis management have been denied entry to Palu.
Under Indonesian law, foreign aid organizations and their employees cannot begin work until Indonesia has declared the area a national crisis zone.
It hasn't happened yet.
"There is a crisis at the provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Red Cross in Indonesia.
"When the state says, 'OK, this is a national crisis,' we can open for international emergency aid, but they have not updated the status yet."
It is evening again in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, and friends and family of those still missing still hope for a miracle, but know that such natural disasters do not end well.
On Saturday, a little boy was rescued from the sewer.
On Sunday, a woman was rescued from the remains of a collapsed building, where she had a doctor trapped next to her dead mother for two days.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian paragliding team, trained two of the missing paragliders from the Asian Games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
One man called Mandagi said that one of the people trapped in the Roa Roa hotel were his students.
"As someone with a lot of experience in paragliding, I have my own emotional burden to bear on," he said.
Gendon told him that he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the paragliders from Palu, who had taken part in the local beach festival, after he heard that the Roa Roa hotel had collapsed.
However, his messages showed only one gray hawk, instead of two blue hawks.
"I think that means the messages didn't come up," he said.
Thieves stole $26,750 from cash desk in Newport, Levee, United States
On Friday, a thief stole $26,750 from a worker in the Brink's company in what he was filling up a mini bank in Newport, Levee, United States, according to a press release from Newport police.
The worker had just emptied a mini bank in the entertainment area and was in the process of delivering more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy said in the press release.
While the worker was busy, "a man jumped up behind the worker" and stole a sack of money to be delivered.
Witnesses observed several suspects while fleeing the scene, according to the press release, but police could not determine the number of people involved in the robbery.
If anyone has information about who was involved, they should call the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changes name to Ye
The rapper Kanye West changes his name - to Ye.
He declared the name change on Twitter on Saturday, writing, "The creation formerly known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has had Ye's nickname for a while, and used the name as the title of his eighth album, which he released in June.
The name change came just before he was to perform on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande on the show after she canceled due to "emotional reasons," said the host.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current artist name, West has previously stated that the word has a religious meaning for him.
"I think the word 'ye' is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you,'" West said earlier this year when discussing the album title with radio host Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
The name has changed from Kanye, meaning the one, to only Ye - to reflect the good we do, the bad we do, our confusion, everything.
The album reflects on who we are."
Kanye is one of several famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs is formerly known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he declared that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who has collaborated with West before, has also changed the writing style of the name with and without brackets and capital letters.
Future President of Mexico vows not to send military against civilians
The future president of Mexico, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has promised never to send military forces against civilians. The country will soon mark the 50th anniversary of the bloody treatment of students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would "never use the military to oppress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, the military shot at peaceful protesters and killed about 300 people, at a time when left-wing student movements spread in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly support to students and opening several free universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of access to education have led young people to join criminal gangs.
U.S. Should Double Investment in Artificial Intelligence
Since China is more actively working on artificial intelligence, the United States should double its investment in research on the subject, says the investor and user of artificial intelligence, Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
His comments came after various parts of the U.S. government made statements about artificial intelligence, although the U.S. lacks a formal strategy for the use of artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China introduced its plan last year, aiming to be number 1 in artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
"A doubling of the budget for research on artificial intelligence would be a good start, since all other countries are so far behind the United States, and we are looking for the next breakthrough in artificial intelligence," said Lee.
A doubling in funding could double the chances of the next major breakthrough in artificial intelligence happening in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, who published the book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" this month via publisher Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the Managing Director (CEO) of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the largest artificial intelligence companies in China, Face<0x2B><0x2B>.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University with an artificial intelligence system that beat the highest-rated player of the game Othello, and later worked as a leader in Microsoft Research and was chairman of Google in China.
Lee recognized earlier technology competitions organized by the U.S. state, such as "Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge" and asked how long the next competition should be, allowing him to join and identify the next visionaries.
Researchers in the United States usually have to work hard to get support from the state, Lee said.
"It's not China that takes the academic leaders, it's the big companies," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired excellent university students to work with artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy can also help the United States strengthen research on artificial intelligence.
"I think that doctoral students in artificial intelligence should be automatically granted a residence permit," he said.
The State Council of China published its plan for the next generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
China's National Federation of Natural Sciences funds students at academic institutions, not unlike the U.S. National Science Association and other state organizations' way of distributing money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a joint center for artificial intelligence, intended to involve partners from industry and academia, and the White House declared the formation of an artificial intelligence committee.
This month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI (Artificial Intelligence) Next.
The National Science Association invests more than $100 million a year in research on artificial intelligence.
At the same time, no one has been working on legislation on national security and artificial intelligence for several months.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change the country's name
The Macedonian people voted on Sunday in a referendum on whether they should change their name to the Republic of North Macedonia in order to resolve a decades-old conflict with Greece, which has tried to prevent Macedonia from becoming a member of the EU and NATO.
Greece, which has a province named Macedonia, insists that the name of the neighboring country in the north represents a claim to their territory, and has vetoed to vote against Macedonia's membership of NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the new proposed name, but nationalist opponents argue that the name change may undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority of the population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum, and a boycott has sown doubts as to how far the referendum will reach the at least 50 percent of the population it needs to be valid.
The question on the referendum seat is: "Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership and agree on the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the price of the name change is worth membership in the EU and NATO. Macedonia is one of the countries that achieved independence after the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I am here today to vote for the future of this country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the EU, because it means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the voting is not binding under the law, a sufficient number of Members of Parliament have said that they will follow the result of the voting to make her decisive.
For the name change to happen, the parliament needs two-thirds of the turnout.
The State Electoral Committee reported that nothing unusual had happened before 13:00.
Only 16 percent had the vote, as opposed to 34 percent in the previous 2016 parliamentary election, when 66 of all registered voters voted.
"I vote for my children, we belong in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dusko voiced in Strumika in the Macedonian referendum on whether to change their name and open to join NATO and the EU on September 30, 2018.
Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, organized a boycott of the referendum in front of the parliament in Skopje, by setting up tents and chairs.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we are not for changing the name of our country," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want us under the name Macedonia, we can go to others, like China and Russia, and become part of the Eurasian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev has stated that NATO membership will draw investors to Macedonia, which has over 20 percent unemployment.
"I believe that the majority will vote for the change, of which 80 percent of our citizens will become a member of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after voting.
He said that a "yes" result can be interpreted as a "statement of our future."
A poll last Monday by Macedonia's Institute of Policy Research showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters will participate in the referendum – which is below the required number.
Another poll by the Telma TV channel in Macedonia, showed that 57 percent of voters plan to vote on Sunday.
Of these, the channel said 70 percent would vote yes.
In order for the referendum to be closed, at least 50 percent must vote, plus one vote.
If the referendum did not close, it could harm the policies of the left-wing government that took over in May.
See: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero navigates through Brighton defense and scores
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling wrecked the Brighton defense leading to a 2–0 victory for Manchester City on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy, scoring in the 65th minute.
The Argentine peak received a midway pass at the start of the sequence.
He crashed past three Brighton defenders and reached open ground.
Suddenly, Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He came around one defender, before running past several others on the edge of the Brighton penalty area.
He came past a pass on the left and found Sterling.
The English tip used his first kick in the field to give the ball back to Aguero, who used his right foot to beat Brighton keeper Mathew Ryan with a shot straight into the right end of the goal.
"Aguero still struggled with his feet," City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about that he could play 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored when he did."
But it was Sterling who gave them sky blue the first advantage in the Premier League game.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball deep inside the Brighton territory.
He kicked the ball beautifully along the left end of the track to Leroy Sane.
Sane held on to the ball as he led Sterling towards the goal.
The sky blue tip kicked the ball into goal right before slipping out of the course.
City will play against Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage at 12:55 on Tuesday in the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer to play spoiler against Rockies in American baseball
With the Nationals eliminated from the "playoff content" there was not much reason to force a new start.
Scherzer has a high competitive instinct, hoping to take the "moon" on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if it could lead to a "playoff" for the Rockies, who lead with one game over the Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West.
The Rockies won at least 5-2 against the Nationals on Friday night, but look forward to locking the first division title firmly.
"Although we're not playing for anything, it's worth playing because of the atmosphere here in Denver, with the audience and the other team most likely playing at the highest level so far this year.
Who wouldn't want to play with such relationships?"
It is still unclear who will start in the Nationals on Sunday, but it may be Scherzer will "pitch".
Scherzer, who then starts for the 34th time, throws a "bullpen session" on Thursday and is supposed to "pitche" normally on Sunday.
Scherzer, coming from Washington, is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 "strikeouts" in 220 2/3 "innings" this season.
Trump Gathers Voters in West Virginia
The president obscurely referred to his first election to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while talking about how important it was for Republicans to vote in the midterm elections in the United States.
“Everything we’ve done so far is at stake in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our lives.
This is one of the big, big -- I'm not asking, but I'm running around everywhere to fight for the best candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "You can see this terrible, terrible group of Democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they're convinced that they're definitely going to take back power, you see how ugly they are, how ugly they are.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to run against to take power and control, that's what they want, power and control, we're not going to give it to them."
Democrats, he said, are on a mission to "oppose and block."
"And you can see it based on the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "angry and ugly and ugly and dishonest."
He referred to Senator and Democrat Dianne Feinstein, who made his audience bow.
"Do you remember her answer?
Were you the one who leaked documents?
Uh, uh, what?
No, uh no, I expect—it was really bad body language—the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer tolerant.
They are intolerant of those who say what they think
When the Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, it was not surprising.
After all, I am the last in a series of Labour MPs who have been told that I am not welcome – just to say what I mean.
My colleague in parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated the same way because she protested anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
When it came to the importance of operating responsible economy, national security, Europe, and other similar topics that Jeremy ironically disagreed with previous leaders about.
In the call for the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday, it stated, "We want the meeting to be inclusive and productive."
In my last eight years as Labour MP, the Friday meeting was just like that.
Unfortunately, today's meeting was not so, and the promise of "kinder" politics has long been forgotten, if it was followed at all.
It has become more and more evident that different views are not tolerated in Labour, and that every opinion is judged by the leaders of the party.
This happened shortly after Jeremy became party leader, when colleagues I used to politically agree with suddenly expected me to change my mind and agree on things I would never agree with - whether it was national security or the internal market in the European Union.
When I speak in public it has nothing to say what I say, I always get shut up on social media and people want me to quit while they criticize center politics and say I shouldn't be a member of the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments against me are at least political.
I admire my colleagues who are getting gender-discriminating and racist bullies targeted every day, and who are still professional and do not resign.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this time period, is how normalized it has become to harass police officers.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour party should become more tolerant.
In short, we are no longer a tolerant party that has something for everyone. For every proposal of distrust and for every change in party rules, the party becomes narrower and narrower.
I've received a lot of advice in the last two years from people who have said I need to calm down and not be so loud, so maybe people will "like me better."
But that's not why I chose to join politics.
When I enrolled in Labour, when I was still going to school 32 years ago, it was because I was angry at Thatcher and how the government failed the country. My classroom was about to collapse, so I wanted better public services for those who needed them most. whether it was then government or municipal council
I have never concealed my political views, neither in previous elections.
No one in Nottingham East could have been in doubt about what I stand for and which of the current leaders I do not agree with.
To those who voted for the proposal on Friday, I can only say that when the country crashes into a Brexit that will harm private, local businesses and public services, I don't understand why people care about wasting energy on questioning my loyalty to the Labour party leader.
But actually, then not the only message I have addressed to Nottingham Momentum, but to the voters in the constituency, whether they are Labour voters or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no one can make me resign or change my policy and prevent me from serving you in the way I think everyone is best for you.
Chris Leslie is Member of Parliament for Nottingham East
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Invincible Ayr goes to the top in Scottish rugby
Two late "threes" may have changed the result a bit, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win this very entertaining Tennent's Premiership match today.
They now stand on top of the pallet as the only invincible team of a total of ten.
It was their sovereign defense and ability to take chances that gave the home team and their coach, Peter Murchie, good reason to be happy.
"We've been seen on trial in recent games, and we're still invincible, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "Air deserves praise, they were better than us to take chances."
Grant Anderson had a "try" in the 14th minute, where Frazier Climo attempted a "conversion," putting Ayr in front, but a yellow card from Scotland captain Rory Hughes of the Warriors let Melrose gather, and Jason Baggot took an "unconverted try."
Climo received a penalty just before the break, he scored and "converted" a "solo try" to give Ayr 17-5 before the break.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's "try," which became "converted" by Baggot, reduced the slingshot by five points.
A long pause occurred when Ruairidh Knott was seriously injured and put on a carrier, and from the reboot Ayr advanced through a "try" from Stafford McDowall, which Climo "converted."
The acting captain of Ayr, Blair MacPherson, received a yellow card, and again Melrose tried an "unconverted Bruce Colvine try," at the end of a series of aggressive games.
The home team played back, and when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card to deal with Climo without the ball from the penalty lineup, MacPherson scored a "try."
Climo "converted" again after Kyle Rowe took David Armstrong's "box kick" and sent the "flanker" Gregor Henry away from his home team's fifth "try."
The star of the Scottish series, Still Game, starts a new career in the restaurant industry
Scottish Still Game star, Ford Kieran, seems ready for a new career in the restaurant industry, after it was discovered that he is the director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC program, which he writes and plays with his partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo have announced that the upcoming ninth season is going to be the last, and it seems as if Kiernan is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official lists, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor will not comment on the case, but a source from the Scottish Sun newspaper has hinted that Kiernan would engage in the "advanced restaurant business" in Glasgow.
"The sea is ours": Bolivia hopes the court will open waterway to the Pacific
Sailors patrol Marine Headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings flags with ocean blue flags.
Marine bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are covered with the motto: "The sea is ours. We are right
and duty to return to it.”
In enclosed Bolivia, the people can still remember a coastline the country lost to Chile, in a bloody conflict over resources in the 19th century, longing to sail in the Pacific again.
These hopes may be stronger than in many decades as Bolivia awaits the judgment of the International Court of Justice to come on October 1, after five years of encroachment.
"Bolivia has drive, peace of mind and is united, and of course expects a positive result," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will look at the judgement of the International Court of Justice, hoping that the Court of The Hague supports Bolivia's claim, and that Chile - after decades of negotiations - gives Bolivia an independent outlet to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic native president of Bolivia - who is struggling to be re-elected next year - has good reason to hope for a positive result.
“We will soon be returning to the Pacific,” he promised in late August.
However, some analysts do not believe the court will allow Bolivia access to the sea - and that little would have changed even if they were accessed.
The Netherlands-based United Nations Court does not have the power to transfer Chilean territory to Bolivia, and has stipulated that they will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
That the court's ruling comes just six months after the last proceedings, indicates that the case "was not complicated," said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean expert in international law.
The last four years have far from promoted Bolivia's cause, they have done the opposite.
"The problem of access to the sea has been taken over by the current Bolivian administration," said Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate.
Morales, with his warlike rhetoric, has killed what is left of Chile's benevolence, said Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate.
Bolivia and Chile will at some point continue the negotiations, but it will be extremely difficult to discuss the issue after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
The former president, Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, who is Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was unusually fast.
On Monday, Bolivia will have "an extraordinary opportunity to open new relations with Chile" and a chance to "set aside 139 years of unanimity and rather benefit both," he said.
Calzadilla also rejected that Morales, who is still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, used this maritime issue to win votes.
"Bolivia will never give up the right of access to the Pacific," he added.
"Judgement is an opportunity to see what we need to do to forget the past."
North Korea says they won't abolish nuclear weapons if they can't trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister, Ri Yong Ho, says his nation cannot be the first to abolish, if they cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to follow up on the promises they made during the meeting in Singapore between the U.S. and North Korean leaders.
Ri's comments come at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pomepo, seems to want to restart his locked nuclear weapons diplomacy, more than three months after the Singapore meeting with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Un.
Ri says the United States has a false hope that North Korea will submit if the United States continues sanctions and opposes any declaration of the end of the Korean War.
Washington refuses to agree to any declaration of the end of the war, without Pyongyang abolition first.
Both Kim and the U.S. President, Donald Trump, will hold a new meeting.
However, many are critical of Pyongyang's seriousness in terms of demolition and that the country most likely sees its weapons as a guarantee of security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump meeting.
Paris shows that massive headwear is the latest fashion on the way to a shopping street near you
If you want to upgrade your hat collection or block the sun completely, then you don't need to search anymore.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne have revealed a number of large and special headwear in their SS19 collection, the headwear astonishing audiences during the fashion week in Paris.
Highly impractical hats can be seen on Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their shocking creations right on the catwalk.
The most magnificent garment was an opulent, beige Valentino hat with a feather-like, at brakes covering the models' heads.
There were also other oversized accessories during the fashion show, including a jeweled watermelon, a magician's hat, and even a pineapple - but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a collection of bizarre masks - just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had lips that were sewn together and resembled more Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One of the creations resembled diving gear, complete with snorkel and mask, while another looked like an ice cream melted in biscuits.
If you like this hugely dramatic fashion, you can only ignore yourself.
Fashion experts predict that the huge hats will come for sale in a shopping street near you.
The oversized hats come right after "La Bomba", the straw hat with the 60 cm wide brake that has been seen on celebrities from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind the highly impractical hat, which was everywhere on social media, has now sent out a new creation on the catwalk - a stranded beach bag of the same size as the bikini-dressed model that wore her.
The beach bag, with the color of burnt orange and fringes topped with a white leather handle, was the most eye-catching part of Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection during fashion week in Paris.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage commented to FEMAIL, "I expect to see big hats and beach bags in the fashion boutiques next summer - the designer has made such a big impression that I doubt it is possible to ignore the demand for oversized accessories."
John Edward: Global citizens need language skills
Private schools in Scotland are known to be at a high academic level, and this continues in 2018 with excellent exam results, which are only amplified by individual and shared success in sport, art, music, and other community activities.
With over 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), work to offer the best services to the students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for advanced and higher education, career paths, and the role of global citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a tailored curriculum, we see that modern languages are popular electives in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, the message goes to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, the message goes to his heart."
This is an important reminder that we can't just rely on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
Looking at the exam results from this year, we can see that languages are at the top of the league tables with the highest ski ratings for independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who took foreign languages received A.
The data, collected from SCIS' 74 member schools, show that 72 percent of students received A in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who took German, 69 percent of those who took French, and 63 percent of those who took Spanish also received A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital traits, which children and young people will absolutely need in the future.
Languages as electives are considered equivalent to STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering studies, and mathematics) in the pensuma of independent schools and elsewhere.
A survey carried out by the British Selection for Addition and Properties in 2014 showed that 17 percent of employers struggled to fill positions due to lack of language skills in the applicants.
Therefore, language in school is becoming more and more important to prepare young people for work.
With multiple job opportunities for linguists, these characteristics are essential in a globalized world.
No matter what kind of career a youth chooses, if they have learned a second language, they have a real advantage in the future with such a property.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically give a multilingual person advantages in a competitive world.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in 2013, 75 percent could not speak any language other than English well enough to keep a conversation going, and French was the only language spoken by a dozen percent, 15 percent.
This is why it is so important to invest in language education for our children.
Knowing more languages, especially the languages used in developing countries, can give children a better chance of finding good jobs in the future.
In Scotland, each school is different in terms of what language they teach.
Many schools focus on the classical modern languages, while others teach languages that are classified as important in the UK when we look forward to 2020, such as Mandarin and Japanese.
No matter what your child is interested in, there will always be a multitude of languages to choose from in independent schools, and teachers who are specialists in this area.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated and want to create a learning environment that will prepare children and give them the qualities they need to close, no matter what the future brings.
One cannot deny that in this global, business-oriented environment, languages are vital to the future of the country, so this must be reflected in the education sector.
Modern languages should be called "international communication properties."
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, thus offering diversity and high competence for Scotland's youth.
We have to do it right.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council for Independent Schools
LeBron to make his Lakers debut on Sunday in San Diego
The waiting period is soon over for fans looking forward to seeing LeBron James debut at the Los Angeles Lakers basketball team.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the pre-season game on Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how long he will play has not been determined yet.
"It's going to be more than a minute and less than 49," Walton announced on Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter, Mike Trudell, tweeted that James most likely will play for a limited time.
After training this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' schedule for the preseason.
"I don't need preseason games at this stage of my career to make me ready," he said.
Trumps West Virginia Rally Time, YouTube
President Donald Trump begins on a whirlwind of campaigns tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of Trump's five planned stops in the coming week, including stops at friendly locations such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote waiting to elect to fill the Supreme Court vacant position, Trump is aiming to build support for upcoming midterm elections since Republicans are in danger of losing control of Congress when votes are to be cast in November.
What time is Trump supposed to be in West Virginia tonight, and how can you see it online?
Trump’s rally in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 19:00 tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's West Virginia collection online below, via live stream on YouTube.
Trump will likely record this week's hearings of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who became tense over allegations of sexual abuse, with an expected confirmation vote from the Senate waiting for up to a week while the FBI is investigating.
But the primary goal of this cage of gatherings is to help Republicans meet the November elections and get some momentum (drive).
Thus, President Trump's campaign says that these five meetings next week are aimed at "advocating volunteers and supporters that Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"Congress control is so critical to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we enter the busy campaign season," said a Trump campaign spokesman who refused to be informed to Reuters.
Scheduled for the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, the evening's collection can bring supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and draw coverage from the Pittsburgh media", according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is in demand in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president needs to come and try to give him a boost in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows belly for fight to keep hope alive on the singles on Sunday
After three one-sided sessions Saturday afternoon's foursomes could only be what this Ryder Cup was like.
The swinging pendulum of momentum is a completely invented sporting intervention, but one that players really believe in, and never more than in competitions like these.
So where would they say moments are now?
"They had a six-point lead, and now it's four, so we take it as a little moment , I suppose," Jordan Spieth said as he walked off for the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, four points ahead with twelve more at stake.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel that they have some wind in their sails, and they have much to be encouraged by, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day, and each has three points from four.
Spieth has been lethal from tee to green and rent by example.
The guttural screams of the celebration became higher as his round continued, seeking an important put to take match four all-squao.re as he and Thomas had been two down after two.
His putt that won those matches at 15, was met with a similar scream, the type that tells you that he thinks the American team is not out of this.
"You've actually only got dig deep and worry about your own fight," Spieh said.
That's all each of these players have left now.
18 holes to make a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the invincible story of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's distinctive but sweet pairs are four out of four and can't do anything wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only pair not to shoot a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back nine (the last nine holes on an 18-hole course) on Friday morning.
The race, and the way their energy seems to flow both to and from this noisy, engaged audience, cementing that they are the players to be beaten on Sunday, and there would be no more popular players to seal a potential European saying when the sun goes down over Le Golf National, than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both at the same time.
Talking about European honor will still be premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson did short work by Sergio Garcia, the morning's four-ball hero, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the first nine, coarse the Spaniard and the Swede into a hole they never came close to climbing out of.
But on Sunday, no one can help you out of your hole.
The fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to look at closely due to the interaction between opponents, advice they give, and advice they don't give and the way a strategy can change in a moment.
Europe has played better as a team so far and takes a significant lead into the last day, but this foursome session also showed that Team USA has the stomach of the match that someone, especially Stateside, had doubted.
Europe take 10-6 lead in Ryder Cup final
Europe will have a healthy advantage into the final day of the Ryder Cup after coming out of Saturday's four-ball and foursome games with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
Inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two victories over a struggling Tiger Woods to take their match so far on Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European side ordered to retain the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated a faulty American side tomorrow's fourballs, and took the series 3–1.
The United States offered more resistance in the foursomes and won two games, but they could not bring in the deficit.
Jim Furyk's side needs eight points from the 12 singles games on Sunday to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row while he and Molinari, called "Molliwood" after an eye-catching weekend, is only the second pair to win four points from their opening in four games in Ryder Cup history.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, they looked so great to beat outgoing Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with an even more sought after 5 and 4.
Woods, who struggled through two games on Saturday, showed sporadic brilliance, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 games in the fireballs and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who rested for the morning's fourballs, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes to a 2 and 1 defeat by Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - ranked one and three in the world.
Europe did not yet get everything they wanted on a pleasant, windy day southwest of Paris.
Three-time major winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas put the reference to the Americans by two points on Saturday.
They won a brave 2 & 1 say over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs and came back later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 & 3 in the foursomes as they had lost the two holes in the opening.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history, a team has come back from a four-point understatement and entered the singles, although as holders Furyk's side needs only to draw to retain the trophy.
However, after being the next best for two days, it looks like a Sunday moot attack will be outside of them.
North Korea says it won't talk about arming down unilaterally without trust
North Korea's Secretary of State told the United Nations on Saturday that if sanctions continue, the distrust of the United States will increase and that the country would in no way give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Government's annual general meeting that North Korea had taken "significant measures" to improve conditions over the past year, for example, they have stopped nuclear and missile tests, dismantled the nuclear test site and do not promise to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we don't get anything similar back from the United States," he said.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security, and under such circumstances it is not possible that we unilaterally disarm ourselves first."
While Ri, a well-known North Korean, has filed several complaints about Washington's opposition to a "phased" approach to the abolition of nuclear weapons, in which North Korea would be paid for taking gradual steps, his resignation proved significant by not rejecting unilateral nuclear degradation, as Pyongyang has done.
Ri referred to a joint statement printed by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a first summit ever between a sitting US president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim promised to work for "degradation of nuclear power on the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea say.
North Korea has wanted a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to ease tough international sanctions in North Korea.
"The U.S. insists on "destruction of nuclear power first" and increases the pressure of sanctions to achieve its purpose by force, and they even opposed the "declaration of ending peace," said Ri.
"Trusting that sanctions can break us is a false hope among those who are not interested in us.
But the problem is that as the sanctions continue, our distrust only increases."
Ri did not mention anything about the plans for a new summit between Kim and Trump, as the U.S. president highlighted in the United Nations earlier this week.
The minister instead scheduled three meetings between Kim and South Korea's leader, Moon Jae-in, over the last five months and added: "If the party in this call for the demolition of nuclear weapons was South Korea, and not the United States, the demolition of the Korean peninsula would not have stopped as it has now"
However, the tone of Ri's speech was dramatically different from last year, when he told the U.N. General Assembly that it was not possible to stop North Korean missiles against the U.S. mainland, after evil President Trump called Kim a rocket man on suicide missions.
Trump, who last year believed to "totally destroy" North Korea, extolled Kim for his courage to take steps to disarm, but said much work still needed to be done and that sanctions had to remain in place until North Korea deflected its nuclear weapon.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time frame for this, saying, "Whether it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should pay Pyongyang for the measures taken.
But the United States' Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, told the United Nations Security Council on Thursday that, "The sanctions of the Security Council must still be maintained vigorously and without fail until we get the complete, final, verified dismantling of nuclear weapons."
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to thwart Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly and subsequently said that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare a new summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times already this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said progress had been made, but a few hours later, North Korea condemns him for making "ganger-like demands."
North Korea, in a meeting with Moon this month, promised to dismantle a missile site and also a nuclear complex if the United States did "appropriate measures."
He said Kim had told him that the "appropriate measures" he sought were security guarantees as Trump promised in Singapore, and steps towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take courses in getting enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has helped all students get more sleep, in an effort to fight the growing macho culture that goes on to study in caffeine all night, meaning you use caffeine to stay awake all night to study.
One academic found that students at top universities are often careless when it comes to the very most basic - how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after talking about the impact sleep deprivation has on learning.
"At the end of it, a girl came up to me and said, "Why am I being told this now, in adulthood?"
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleeping - something that surprised me, he told The Telegraph.
The course, rolled out for the first time this year, explains to students what is important for how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, as well as improve their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and managing director of the university's health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after the students got seriously worse sleep during the week.
The hour-long course involves a number of interactive tasks.
In one section, there is a picture of a dormitory, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, trainers, and books to be told about the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is affected by sleep deprivation, as well as how important it is to evening routines.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of campus, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
'We know that it won't change the behavior of students right away.
But we believe they have the right to know - just as you have the right to know, the health effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes, Prof. Czeisler added.
The culture of pride over the times still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and ever-increasing pressure on students means that lack of sleep is a growing problem.
Ensuring you get enough sleep, of good quality, should be the student's secret weapon against stress, fatigue, and anxiety, he said - even avoiding gaining weight, since sleep deprivation puts the brain in swallowing mode and makes them constantly swollen.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old from California who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler develop the course, having been a student with him the previous year, his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to push to get a course for the entire campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all doctoral students to complete a similar study program before they start at the prestigious institution.
Prof Czeisler recommended that students should consider setting an alarm for when to go to bed, and also for when to wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" coming from electronic displays and LED lighting, and which can convert the internal problem with so to the clock in total.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga Goals Give Gerrards Men Down
The Rangers went on a new away defeat when Dolly Menga's post sent Steven Gerrard's covert side to a 1–0 loss at Livingston.
Ibrox side were looking to take their first victory off the field since the 4-1 triumph at St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team caused only Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as a leader, giving eight points, a round under Ladbrokes' Premier League leader , Hearts.
The crowd beat to seven minutes before halftime, and a Ranger performance with a lack of inspiration never seemed to match.
As the Rangers now fall to sixth place, Livingston climbs to third and is only behind Hibernian on goal difference.
And there may be additional problems in store for the Rangers after lineman Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound, after an object apparently was thrown off the side.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that swept Ayr into the Betfred Cup semi-finals.
Holt , on the other hand, went with Livy 11 who took a point with a dream shot last week, and he would have been thrilled by the way his well-drilled outfit took the choker's roof on his opponents on each shift.
Rangers may have had the ball most , but Livingston did more with the ball they had.
They should have scored after only two minutes when Menga's first post sent Scott Pittman over to Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder failed in his giant chance.
A long free kick from Keaghan Jacobs then found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner, Alan Lithgow, could only shoot far on the return post.
The Rangers took control, but there seemed to be more hope than faith in their game in the last third round.
Alfredo Morellos decided he should have a penalty on the 20 yard mark when he and Steven Lawless collided, but judge Steven Thomson waved away the Colombian's wish.
The Rangers only managed two shots on goal in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was hardly concerned by Lassana Coulibaly's header and a nice shot from Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi's opening in the 34th minute may have been against the rules of the game, no one can deny that they defended it just because of the "shot".
Again, the Rangers failed to handle a deep death ball from the Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher hit the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept cool to pick out the Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard made the break as if he were swapping Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the swap caused an immediate effect as the winger made a loop for Morelos, but the impressive Kelly ran forward to block.
However, Livingstone continues to overlist the guest team to play exactly the game they liked, with Lithgow and Halkett sending forward long shots on long shots.
Holt's team could have increased their lead at the end, but McGregor was successful in preventing Jacobs from doing so, until Lithgrow left a long post from the corner mark.
Ranger's reserve, Glenn Middleton, had a new demand for punishment when he supported with Jacobs, but again Thomson ignored it.
Almanack: The Inventor of the Geiger Teller
And now a page from our "Sunday Morning" Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and WE REACH ... the day on which the physicist Johannes Wilhelm "His" Geiger, was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the apparatus known as the Geiger counter.
As a scientific support beam ever since, the Geiger counter also became a support beam in pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", with the seemingly improbable latent cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What in the world is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, it can be used to find radioactive minerals, for example uranium.
When you turn on these earphones, you can actually hear the effects of the atom coming from the radioactivity of the minerals."
Evans: "Yes, now it bubbles!"
"His" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" red cells.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" red cells and kill them
Vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize red cells, as part of treatment
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, and changing them in the laboratory
They can then see a protein common in many cancers, and then reinject
A test vaccine shows promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize red cells, experienced that the ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, changing them in the laboratory, allowing them to "see" a protein common in many cancers, called HER2, and then reinjecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said, "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "drives the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer," explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to extracting immune cells from patients and "learning" them how they target cancer cells, has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West ordered a Pro-Trump diatribe, wearing a MAGA-lue, after visiting the Saturday Night Live TV show. .
It didn't go so well.
Kanye West was fired in the studio during Saturday Night Live after an unbelievable performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump, saying he would run for office in 2020.
After taking his third song for the evening, called Ghost Town, where he wore a Make America Great-caps, he gave the Democrats a tirade and repeated his support for Trump.
"So many times I talk to a white person, and they say, "How could you like Trump, he's racist?"
Well, if I were concerned about racism, I would have moved out of America long ago," he said.
SNL started the show with a number along with comedian Matt Damon, whose Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony in the Senate Judiciary Committee on the allegations of sexual assault from Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not broadcast, the recording of West's tirade was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is unclear whether Rock tried to mock West with the post.
Vest had also complained to the audience that he had the difficult backstage due to his main platoon.
"They're hitting me behind the scenes.
They said, Don't go out there with that hat on.
They're bullying me!
And then they say I'm in a submerged place," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see the sunken place?" saying that he would "take on the superman cap, because this means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to go forward?
Try your love.”
His comments led to pissing at least twice from the audience, and SNL cast members seemed embarrassingly touched, Variety reported, with one person there telling the publication, "Heil the studio was silenced."
West was brought in as a late replacement for singer Ariana Grande, when her former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days ago.
West confused many with a performance of the song I Love it, dressed like a Perrier bottle.
West received support from the head of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner who tweeted: "To one of the most courageous spirits: THANK YOU FOR STAYING UP TO THE QUESTION."
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West "simplely was just who he is and that's absolutely amazing."
"But I chose NOT to reward anyone (by buying his music or clothing or supporting his 'art') whom I believe embraces and spews out ideology that is harmful to my society.
He's free.
That's us too," she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and said he was now "formally known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Co-rapper, Snoop Dogg has been named Snoop Lion and of course the last music legend Prince, changing the name to a symbol and then the artist who was formerly known as Prince.

Game of Thrones star Kit Harington goes out against toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his sword-swinging role as Jon Snow in HBO's elective medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31, has gone out against the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that such roles on the screen often cause young boys to feel that they need to be tough to be respected.
In conversation with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that he believes something has gone wrong and asked how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the <0x23>MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he feels "very strong" to address the problem.
"Personally, I'm convinced that something has gone wrong with masculinity." he said.
"What have we taught men when they grow up, when it comes to the problem we see now?"
Kit believes that TV is partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to very male characters.
He continues, 'What is innate and what is being taught?
What is being taught on TV and in the streets, what makes young guys feel like they have to be this particular side of being a man?
I think it's really one of the big questions of our time - how do we change that?
For it is clear that something has gone wrong for young men."
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not make Game of Thrones runners or sequels when the series ends this summer, saying he is "finished with battlefields and horses".
From November, Kit will play in a remake of Sam Shepard's True West, which is the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he is looking at the meeting with his wife Rose to be the best that came out of Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife on this show, so that's how it gave me my future family and my life on," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the one named for Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family property in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, health officials say.
About 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases were transmitted through sex, marking a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly through certain parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the amount of people who received HIV in this way was reduced to almost zero, Chinese health professionals said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, from year to year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute problem in China’s LGBT environment.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT/HBTQ people is claimed to be widespread.
Because of the conservative values in the country, studies have numbered that 70-90% of men who have sex with men, will eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of the diseases come from insufficient sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medication as part of an attempt to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies adding lacquer information from the GOP senator, it explodes in 'dangerous lies' and 'conspiracy theories'.
United States Rep. Maxine Waers on Saturday condemned claims that a member of her staff had posted personal information about three Republican U.S. senators on the Wikipedia pages of the legislators.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the allegations were pedaled by "extreme-right wing" polls and websites.
"Lies, lies, and more contemptuous lies," Waters said in a tweet.
The released information included informative home addresses and phone numbers of the Americans Sens. Lindsey Graham, South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared on Thursday, was sent by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing on the charges of sexual assault against Supreme Court judge Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came soon after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was linked to Waters' office and released the information of a member of Waters' staff, Hill reported.
"This baseless claim is completely false and an absolute lie," Waters continues.
"One of my employees - who has been given their identity, personal information and security compromised as a result of these untrue and false claims - was in no way responsible for the leakage of this information.
This baseless claim is completely false and an absolute lie."
Water's statements quickly received criticism online, including from former White House press secretary, Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is angry," Fleischer wrote.
"This suggests that she does not have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is blamed for something they didn't do, they shouldn't be angry.
They must not be tough.
They must not question the motives of the debtor.
They must be calm and peaceful."
Fleischer turned out to compare Waters' reaction to the criticism of the Democrats by Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of being apparently angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate trying to take Waters' place in the midway election, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Short if it's true," he tweeted.
In her resignation, Waters said her office had warned "the right governments and law enforcement entities of these false claims.
"We will make sure the perpetrators are exposed," she continues, "and that they will be held legally responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to each of my employees."
Johnny English strikes again - spy bullshit by weak Rowan Atkinson
It is traditional to look for Brexit landmarks in all new films with a British angle, and it seems applicable to this revival of Johnny England's action-comedy spoof-franchise - which started back in 2003 with Johnny English and was revived in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will self-satisfied satire, which deals with how openly ugly we are, become the new export possibility in the country?
In any case, the grandiose, incompetent Johnny English with the rubber plate has for the second time been renewed his permission to fuck things up - his name signals more than anything else that he is a broad comic creator for cinematographers in non-English-speaking countries.
Of course, he is the stupid, secret agent who despite his bizarre desire to spread some glamour has received a little bit of Clouseau, a dash of Mr Bean and a portion of that guy contributing a simple melody to the Fire Cars, theme during the 2012 London Olympic Opening Ceremony.
He is also originally based on the traveling and international mystery man Atkinson once played in the now forgotten Barclaycard TV ads, leaving chaos behind.
There are one or two nice moments in this last JE excursion.
I loved Johnny English who approached a helicopter while he was dressed in a medieval armor suit while the rotor blades hit his helmet.
Atkinson's gift of physical comedy is on screen, but the humor feels quite weakened and strangely redundant, especially since "serious" movie brands like 007 and Mission Impossible even now safely offer comedy as an ingredient.
The humor feels like he's aimed at children instead of adults, and for me Johnny England's noisy accident isn't as inventive and focused as Atkinson's unreplicated cloth in the person of Bean.
The permanent current premise now is that the UK is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated Britain's super-secret web network of spies, revealing the identities of all agents Britain has in the area, to the horror of the agent at work - an unfortunately small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last straw for a prime minister who is a pompous and war-torn figure, who already has a complete collapse of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does her very best with this quasi-Theresa-May character, but there is not much in the script to work with.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that once every single active spy has been charged, she must bring in someone who has retired.
And it means that the incompetent Johnny English himself, who works as a teacher at a somewhat elegant establishment , but provides unofficial lessons on how to work undercover: a couple fine jokes here, since English offers a School of Rock-type academy for espionage.
English is sent back to Whitehall for a emergency briefing and reunited with his former understanding assistant Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, moved on to a submarine driver's job, an over-enthusiastic role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a bit wasted.
So Batman and Robin's ability to make things terribly crazy in Her Majesty's Secret Servants is back for full in the encounter with Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatale, Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister falls dangerously under the charismatic technology of the billionaire's spell, which claims he can solve Britain's computer problem: the monstrous Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their journey of farce-like wild games: disguised as waitresses, set them on fire at a nice French restaurant; they create chaos and smuggle themselves aboard Volta's pleasure boat; and English triggers pure anarchy as he tries to use a Virtual Reality headset to make himself known by Vols.
All stops are surely pulled out to the last sequence, but as loving and undisciplined as it is, there's quite a lot of children's TV all over it.
Quite moderate things.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I couldn't help but think: Can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really does justice to his talents?
Labour denies that they are continuing to draw up a plan for the English to work a four-day week, but be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour party is now considering a radical plan that wants the British to work a four-day week - but gets paid for five.
According to the report, the party will send further savings made through the Artificial Intelligence (AI) revolution to employees, giving them an extra day off.
Then the employer would be able to enjoy a three-day weekend - but still get the same pay.
Sources said the idea would "fit" with the party's economic agenda and plans to increase benefits for workers.
The change to a four-day week has been approved by the Trades Union Congress as a way for workers to benefit from the changed economy.
An older Labour source told The Sunday Times: A policy statement is expected to be announced before the turn of the year.
'It does not happen overnight, but a four-day working week is a desire that fits into the approach the party has to balance the economy in favor of the worker, as well as the overall of the party's industrial strategy.'
The Labour Party would not be the first to approve such an idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day working week in its 2017 election campaign.
At the moment, however, the ambition is not approved by the entire Labour party.
A Labour Party spokesman said, 'A four-day work week is not party politics and it is not being considered by the party.'
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's working conference to reinforce his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from "faceless directors" and "professionals" in wealthy businesses.
The plans of the Shadow Chancellor also mean that current shareholders in the water holdings cannot regain their full effort as a Labour Government could make "repudiations" due to perceived misconduct.
He has also confirmed plans to put employees on board of directors and create Inclusive Ownership Funds (including ownership funds) to provide 10 percent of the equity in private sector enterprises to employees, who would receive annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500, approximately NOK 5,000.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy, tells in the TV show "60 Minutes" about FBI s in investigation of Kavanaugh could cause them to change their thoughts
The FBI investigation into complaints against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week, and it raises the question of how found the agency could influence some Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview sent Sunday, correspondent Scott Pelley in "60 Minutes" asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham, if the FBI could reveal anything that would cause them to change their mind.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
"I said on my way into the hearing, I said, I have spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, that claim came out and said, 'Have you done it?'
He was determined, determined, unequivocal.”
However, Graham's voice seems to be set in stone.
"I've made up my mind about Brett Kavanaugh, and it would take a dynamite charge to change me," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And all her names couldn't confirm it.
That's 36 years.
I don't see anything new changed."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York hosts the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that features a hugely impressive array of performing stars and an equally impressive mission; ending poverty in the world.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people flocking to Central Park's big lawn, to not only enjoy watching Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes perform, but also to increase awareness of the true goal of the event to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which started in 2012, is an expansion of the Global Poverty Project, an international support group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless you were willing to pay for a VIP ticket), concert attendees had to complete a number of tasks, or "actions" like volunteer work; send emails to a world leader, call a phone call or other meaningful ways to help raise awareness of their goal.
But how much success has Global Citizen been with 12 years left to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a real way to persuade people to demand a call for action, or just another case of so-called "clickivism" - people feel that they make a real difference by signing an online appeal or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, participating in and pushing on a variety of goals.
It says these actions have helped world leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group showed 390 commitments and announcements following their actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid out or collected.
The group estimates that the funds secured so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the most important commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and entrepreneurs committed to "helping children reach their full potential"; vowing to give Rwanda $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country. having received more than 2 million from global donors.
"With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and global citizens, just like you, we can turn the social injustice of malnutrition into a footnote in history," - told the Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, the audience during a live April 2018 concert in London.
The group also said that after taking more than 5,000 actions to demand that the UK improve on nutrition for mothers and children, the UK government announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutritional treatment.
In response to one of the common questions on their website, they ask, "What makes you think that we can end extreme poverty?"
Global citizens responded, "It will be a long and difficult road - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But as the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements lead us, we will succeed, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are among some of the actors performing at this year's event in New York, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use Fleet as "blockade" to block Russian energy exports - Home Secretary
Washington can "if necessary" resort to its fleet to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including in the Middle East, international secretary Ryan Zinke has revealed, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's involvement in Syria - especially where they operate at the invitation of the legitimate government - is a blow to exploring new energy markets.
"I believe the reason they are in the Middle East, is that they want to convey energy, just like they do in Eastern Europe, the southern part of Europe," he said.
And according to the official, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States has this ability, with our Fleet, to ensure that the seaways are open and, if necessary, blocked to ensure that their energy does not go to the market," he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants of the event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, an non-profit group that presents itself as the "voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they are actually the same.
"The economic solution to Iran and Russia is more or less to utilise and replace fuel," he said, while pointing to Russia as a "one-trick pony" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statements come as the Trump administration has been commissioned to increase exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe, and replace Russia, the much cheaper option for European consumers.
In connection with this, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which according to Trump made Berlin Moscow's "captive".
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is set to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's eager opposition to the project is driven only for economic reasons, and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. stance has withdrawn retaliation from Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has urged the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state disrupts our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, leader of the German Industry Federation (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "run hard" to run for president in 2020, says Massachusetts Senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would take a "depth look" at running as a presidential candidate after the midterm election.
During a council meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider running as a candidate.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our bad government, and it includes a woman at the top," she said according to The Hill.
"After November 6, I will consider thoroughly running as a presidential candidate."
Warren took in President Donald Trump during the city hall meeting and said he is "bringing this country in the wrong direction."
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren has been critiqued in his criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court judge Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said "Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote."
However, a poll released on Thursday showed that the majority of Warrens' own voters do not think she should stand as a candidate in 2020.
51% of "probable" Massachusetts voters said the senator should not run as a candidate, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/ Boston Globe survey.
Thirty-two percent supported such a candidacy.
The survey showed more support for a round by former governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting a potential candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other high-profile Democratic names discussed with respect to a potential 2020 candidacy include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would decide officially in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin argues for Track Palin’s PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) at Donald Trump collection
Track Palin, 26, was a year in Iraq after being recruited in September.
He was arrested and charged with an incident of violence at home on Monday night
"What my own son goes through, what he goes through when he comes back, allows me to relate to other families affected by PTSD and some of the wounds our soldiers are returning with," she told the audience at a gathering for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said of his son and other war veterans that "they come back a little changed, they come back the herd, they come back and wonder if the respect for what they and fellow soldiers and aviators and all other military, have done for the country, exists".
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and was charged with physical violence in the home against a woman, for interfering with a report of violence in the home and the storage of a weapon while he was in a rush, according to Dan Bennett, spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. support challenge for new asylum policy
Eighteen states and districts of Columbia support a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang elections or home elections.
Representatives from the 18 states and district filed a friend-of-law brief Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker who challenged the policy, NBC News reported.
The plaintiff's full name in Grace v. Sessions fits that the American Civil Liberties Union (American Civil Liberties Union) filed in August against federal policy has not been revealed.
She said that her partner "and the elective gang member sons" abused her, but U.S. officials denied her application for asylum on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
The lawyers of the States supporting Grace describe El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, producing a large number of applicants for American asylum, whose nations face pervasive problems with gangs and violence at home.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision from the Immigration Act, which allowed illegal immigrants fleeing violence at home, to apply for asylum.
District of Columbia Justice Minister Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores many decades of state, federal and international law."
"Federal law requires that all asylum cases be judged for the particular facts and circumstances of the claim, and such an obstacle contravenes this principle," said friend-of-court briefly.
Lawyers further argued in the summary that the policy that denies immigrants access harms the U.S. economy, saying it is more likely that they will become entrepreneurs and "offer necessary work".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims who fled abuse and gang-selection in June.
"Asylum is available to those who leave their homeland due to persecution or fear due to race, religion, nationality, or membership in a particular social group or political opinion," Sessions said in its June 11 announcement of the policy.
Asylum was never meant to alleviate any problem—even any serious problem—that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue work in Palu while death toll doubled in race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation became increasingly serious.
"It feels very excited," said 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, who consoled her fever-sick baby zone at an evacuation center in the destroyed city, Palu.
"Every minute ambulances come with bodies.
Clean water is difficult to find."
Residents are observed on their way back to their destroyed homes, in what they search through water-damaged properties and try to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and the hospitals destroyed by the earthquake, which had a strength of 7.5, were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who had broken back and shoulder, rested outside Palu's Military Hospital, where patients were treated outdoors due to still strong aftershocks.
Tears filled his eyes as he told him that he felt the powerful earthquake shaking the hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter on the fifth floor.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was pushed into the ruins of the wall, I think," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife crying for help, but then it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. ambassador blames China for "mobbing" with "propaganda ads"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper ran a 4-page advertisement in a U.S. daily newspaper and highlighted the mutual benefits of trade with the U.S. and China, the U.S. ambassador accused China of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to China Daily's paid allowance in the Des Moines register - Iowa's largest salsa newspaper - after blaming China for trying to interfere in the U.S. congressional elections on November 6, a debt China denies.
Trump's guilt that Beijing was trying to interfere in U.S. elections marked what U.S. officials told Reuters was a new phase in an escalating campaign by Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place advertisements to support trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in an increasing trade war which has seen them in turn increasing taxes on each other's imports.
China's retaliatory tariffs early in the trade war were designed to meet exporters in states such as Iowa who supported Trump's Republican party, Chinese and American experts have said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and the former longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had harmed U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
"China," Branstad wrote in a statement in Sunday's Des Moines register, "is now doubling bullying by running propaganda ads in our own free press."
"In its dissemination of propaganda, the Chinese government uses America's beloved tradition of freedom of expression and a free press by placing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines register," wrote Branstad.
"In contrast, at the newsstand down the street here in Beijing, you will find limited divergent voices and will not see any true reflection of the different opinions that the Chinese people may have on China's problematic economic path, given that the media is under the firm thumb of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers diverted the offer to publish" his article, although he did not say what for a newspaper.
Republicans advocate female voters leading the midterm with Kavanaugh Debacle, warns Analysts.
As many top Republicans are stand-by and defend Supreme Court elected Brett Kavanaugh in the face of multiple charges of sexual assault, the analyst has warned that they will likely see a setback, especially from women, in the upcoming midterm elections.
Feelings around this have been extremely high, and most Republicans are on record that they already wanted to move on with one vote.
These things cannot be regretted, says Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, to The Hill for an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) last moments of pressure for an FBI investigation will be enough to calm angry voters.
"Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday - they are not going to forget it tomorrow, and not in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn on Friday. Washington, DC newspaper.
On Friday morning, Protestants chanted "November is coming!" while demonstrating in the Senate Hall when the Republicans, who govern the Court Committee, chose to proceed with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be beyond the chart," said Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst, to the news page.
"People say it's already been high, it's true.
But it can be higher, especially among female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18 to 29-year-olds, who, while not like the president, often do not vote."
Even before Ford's public testimony detailing the allegations of sexual assault directed at appointing Supreme Court nominees, analysts suggested a backlash could follow if Republicans pushed forward with the confirmation.
"This has been a confusing mess for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former leader of the Republican National Committee, early last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the vote of the committee or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh is seen on the bench, it's also about how Republicans have handled this and how they have treated her," Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group contributing to the election of Democrats, pointed out for the news channel.
However, the Americans seem to be a little bit divided over who they should believe in in the wake of Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony, with a little more sidetracks with the latter.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents definitively or likely believed Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they definitively or likely believed Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they believed Kavanaugh was likely or definitely lying during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford, and also at least one other complainant, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford testified to the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh completely assaulted her at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee showed her sex organs while attending a party during the time they studied at Yale University in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to meet Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a startup that seeks to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of technology legend, Inrupt, is a company building of Berners-Lee's open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where data is stored and what people have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the meaning of Inrupt is "world domination".
"We have to do it now," he said of the startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data store" or a POD.
It can contain contact lists, memory lists, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive; Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are all available in one browser and all at the same time.
What is unique about the personal online store is that it is entirely up to the user who can access all sorts of information.
The company calls it "personal authority through data."
The idea of Inrupt, according to the company's managing director John Bruce, is that the company should include resources, process, and appropriate capabilities to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM and some add-on developers with contracts to work on the project, as well as a community of volunteer encoders.
From this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google about not introducing a complete change where all their business models are completely turned on their heads overnight.
"We are not asking for their permission."
In a media post published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new network collection built on Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he established the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been a voice with great influence in the debate on net neutrality.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic about this next era online," added Berners-Lee ten l.
Bernard Vann: WW1 Victoria Cross divine fair
The only English church diocese to win a Victoria Cross during World War I as a fighter has been celebrated in its hometown 100 years later.
Lt Col Pastor Bernard Vann won the prize on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never knew he had won the highest British military honor.
A memorial stone was unveiled by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "brilliantly symbolic", that the stone would be unveiled just 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning achievement.
According to the London Gazette, Lt Col Vann led his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentin on 29 September 1918 "through a very thick shot and under heavy fire from fields and machine guns."
He later ran up to the front line, and with the "greatest galantery" the line advanced before rushing forward alone with a field gun and knocking out three of the group.
Lt Col Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "something I know I could never live up to, but something I am humbled for."
He and his brother Dr James Vann also left a wreath after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he felt very honoured to play a role in the parade, adding that "the value of a real hero is shown by the support given by many people."
MMA fans were up all night to see Bellator 206, they got Peppa Pigs instead
Imagine this, you've been up all night to see a packed Bellator 206 but then you won't see the main event.
The San Jose bill contained 13 matches, including six on the main card and was shown live through the night in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepare to meet, viewers in the UK were again anaesthetized when the covers changed to Peppa Gris.
Some were little impressed after they had stayed awake until the early hours especially for the match.
A fan on Twitter described switching to the children's cartoon as "a kind of sick joke."
"It's public regulation that at 6 p.m. if the cache was not owned like this, then they had to switch to the children's program," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communication, when asked about the transfer.
"Peppa pig, "yes."
Bellator company president Scott Coker said they will be working on planning to include British viewers in the future.
"I think when I think about replay, I think we can probably figure it out," Coker said.
"But it's six in the morning on a Sunday, and we don't find out of this until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when it passed, there were many texts going back and forth, and not all were friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical error.
But it wasn't; it was a public problem.
I can promise you, next time it won't happen.
We keep it to five games instead of six - as we usually do - and we tried to surrender to the fans, and we just went over.
This is an unfortunate situation.”
Previous articleDesert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt “underdog” because of sexuality
Olympic stupor Tom Daley says he felt worse than anyone in his upbringing because of his sexuality - but that gave him the motivation to become a success.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize until he went to secondary school that "not everyone is like me."
Speaking on the first Radio 4 Desert Island discs presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke out about gay rights to give others "hope".
He also said becoming a parent made him less concerned about winning the Olympics.
The regular reporter of the cross-country ski show, Kirsty Young, has been released for several months due to illness.
What might look like a loss in Laverne's first program, Daly said he felt "less than" anyone else growing up because "it was not socially acceptable to like boys and girls."
He said, "Until today, the feeling of feeling less than and feeling different, were the real things that have given me the strength and strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so he didn't disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The two-way bronze Olympic medalist has become a professional LGBT campaign and used his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to several countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke out because he felt lucky that he could live open without branching and wanted to give others "hope".
The three-time world champion said that falling in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "surprised me."
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, last year, but he said that the age difference had never been a problem.
"When you go through so much at such a young age" - he went to his first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said that it was difficult to find someone of the same age who had experienced similar heights and drops.
The couple became parents in June to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that the whole "his" perspective had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, then it was all about I need to win a gold medal," he said.
"You know what, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he was going to die and one of the last things he had asked for was whether they had tickets to London 2012 – when he wanted to be in the first line.
"I couldn't tell him that you're not going to be in the front row," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and it wasn't until he actually stopped breathing and he was dead that I finally recognized he wasn't invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I only knew that this was what I had dreamed of my whole life - to pop in in front of a home audience at an Olympic Games, where fans don't feel any better," he said.
It also inspired his first song choice - Proud of Heather Small - which had vibrated with him in the construction of the Olympics and still gave him goose skins.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Out of shape sit Mickelson on the bench at Ryder Cup Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he must turn his form to avoid it being an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who played in the two-year event for a record 12th time, was set on the bench by Captain Jim Furyk in front of Saturday's golf game in fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being in the middle of the action, as he has often been for the United States, the five-time major winner split his day between being a cheerleader and working on his game within reach for the hope of correcting what bothers him.
Never the most competent long shots. Not even at the top of his career, the 48-year-old is best at hitting the long shots on the dreary, French main course, where balls hit outside if the golfer is not exactly with the stroke.
And if the track itself isn't scary enough, Mickelson meets in the ninth game Sunday, the exact British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their games this week.
If the Americans, four points down by starting the 12 singles games, get to a hot start, Mickelson's game can be entirely decisive.
Furyk expressed confidence in her husband, not that he could say much else.
"He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a slap on my back and put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has great confidence in himself.
He is a Hall of Famer, and he has added so much to these teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn't think he played two games.
I thought more, but it was the way it was, and it was the way we thought we had to do.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else."
Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record in most Ryder Cup games played on Sunday.
It may mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never completely matched the heights of his individual record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, although Furyk said his proximity added some intangible properties to the team.
"He's fun, he's sarcastic, entertaining, likes to have fun with people and he's a nice guy to have in the storeroom," he explained.
"I think the younger players had the fun that got a deal with him too, this week, which was fun to see.
He contributes much more than just playing."
Europe Captain Thomas Bjorn knows big lead could soon disappear
Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant lead on the way into the final days of the Ryder Cup singles can easily be turned into an unpleasant ride.
The Danes made their debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where a side captain of Seve Ballesteros held a five-point advantage over the Americans, but only came across the goal line with the nose leading with the narrowest margins, winning 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a great lead at Valderrama; we had a great lead at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won, but only so far," Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn said, after seeing the 2018 Klassa win 5-3 both on Friday and yesterday to lead 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So history will show me and everyone on that team that this is not over.
You're going to the full opening tomorrow.
Go out there and do all the right things.
This is not over until you have the points on the board.
We have a goal, and that's trying to win this trophy, and that's where the focus stays.
I've been saying all along, I'm focusing on the 12 players that are on our side, but we're so well aware of what's on the other side - the biggest players in the world."
Glad about how his players have performed on a tough golf course, Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn added, "I would never take the victory for granted.
Tomorrow is another day.
Tomorrow is the individual achievements coming up, and there is another thing to do.
It’s great to be out there with a partner when things go well, but when you’re out there individually, you’ll be tested to the fullest of your capacity as a golfer.
It's the message you need to convey to players; get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner, and he has to go and get the best out of himself too."
In contrast to Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn, opposite number Jim Furyk will be looking for his players to perform better individually than they did as partners, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk himself has been at both ends of the turnouts of the major days, having been part of the winning team in Brookline before quitting as a loser as Europe pulled off the "Miracle of Medinah."
"I remember every fucking word of it," he said in response to being asked how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 captain, had gathered his players on their way into the final day.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you want to get started with the quick start you saw on Brookline, as you saw on Medinah.
When that moment is allowed a way, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle matches.
We set up our line-up accordingly and start the guys in a way that feels good, you know, we're trying to do something magical tomorrow" .
Thomas has been assigned the task of trying to lead the match and meets Rory McIlroy in the top game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter the other Europeans in the top half of the order.
"I went with this group of guys in this sequence because I think it covers the whole way through," Bjorn said of his choices of singles.
Germany's new warships postponed once again
The latest frigate of the German Navy was supposed to have been ordered in 2014 to replace aging warships from the Cold War era, but it will not be there until at least next year due to faulty systems and devastating costs, local media reported.
Launch of Rheinland-Pfalz, the leadership of the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit-Zeit newspaper, citing a military spokesman.
The vessel was supposed to join the fleet in 2014, but the worrying problems after delivery plagued the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships the Navy ordered back in 2007, will come as a replacement for the ageing Bremen-class frigates.
It is understood that they will contain a powerful cannon, a variety of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some hidden technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to deploy the latest frigates for up to two years away from the ports at home level.
Nevertheless, continuous delays mean that the groundbreaking warships, which apparently allow Germany to exercise power abroad, will already be outdated when they enter service, notes Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 frigate made headlines last year, when the German fleet officially refused to accept the vessel and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the German fleet has returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media cited a number of important "software and hardware errors" that made the warship useless if deployed on a combat mission.
Software errors were particularly important as the ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class will be operated by a crew of around 120 sailors - only half of the workforce of older Bremen frigates.
It also turned out that the ship is dramatically overweight, reducing performance and limiting the ability of the fleet to add to future upgrades.
The 7000-ton Rhineland-Palatinate is believed to be twice as heavy as similar ships used by the Germans in World War II.
Apart from faulty hardware, the price of the entire project - including training the crew - also becomes a problem.
It is said to have reached staggering <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) - up from initial <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion (EURO)
Problems related to the latest frigates, are becoming particularly important in light of the latest warnings that Germany's naval power is decreasing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defence committee of the German parliament, acknowledged that the fleet is actually "almost over on distribution-competent ships".
The officer said the problem has built on it over time, because old ships were dismantled, but no replacement vessels were delivered.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class frigates were able to join the fleet.
National Trust Listens to the Secret Life of Fleas
New research conducted on a property in the Scottish Highlands aims to reveal how bats use the landscape in the hunt for food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the behaviour of the unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study of researchers at the National Trust for Scotland will follow regular and soprano pistrelles and also brown long-eared and Daubenton bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in important locations around the property to track bat activities throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of bat conversations and which species do what.
A habitat map and report will then be produced to create a detailed landscape-scale picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, natural science advisor to the NTS, hopes the results will reveal what areas of habitat, natural habitats, which are most important for bats and how they are used by each of the species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work such as the acquisition of meadows and how it is best to maintain close forest area for bats and other related species.
Flagger mouse populations in Scotland and across the United Kingdom have declined significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects resting places and loss of habitat/habitat places.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as well as flying paper and some chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks by pet cats.
Fleas are not actually blind.
However, because of their nocturnal hunters, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echolocation technique to find faults and obstacles in their flight route.
The NTS, responsible for caring for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, takes bats very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who regularly conduct investigations, resting place inspections and sometimes save lives.
The organization has even created Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve at the Thrave Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
Property manager David Thompson says that the property is the ideal territory for them.
"Here at Thrave we have a great area for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, many veteran trees and all the good habitats.
But there is a lot about bats that are still unknown, so the work we do here and on other properties will help us understand more about what they need to thrive."
He stresses the importance of checking for bats before carrying out maintenance within property, as it is possible that endless destruction of a single habitat can kill up to 400 female bats and young people, and perhaps eradicate a whole local population.
The bats are at peace and it is illegal to kill, plague or disturb them or destroy their resting places.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer for the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to come in and help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and too many of our species we don't know how dangerous their populations are."
Ronaldo rejects bail charges in what lawyers sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has labeled the confessional charges against him as "fake news", saying that people "want to stand out" by using his name.
His lawyers are set to sue German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
Portugal and Juventus forward have been accused of selecting an American woman, called Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is claimed to have paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
In a live Instagram video, Ronaldo, 33, says to his 142 million followers just hours after the charges, that the charges are "fake news."
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, fake news, says five-time Goldball winner into the camera.
"They want to market themselves by using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be known for saying my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and all good, "let the player smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they have called "an unacceptable reporting of suspicions within the area of privacy", according to Reuters
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player would seek compensation for "moral damages in an amount that stands to how serious the rule violation is , which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident is said to have taken place in June 2009 at a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player's room, claiming that he had selected her anal, according to documents filed at the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and told him that he was "99 percent" a "good guy" and failed with "one percent".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that there was consent.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had photographed her injuries taken at a hospital, but was later agreed on a settlement because she felt "feared of retaliation" and was concerned about "being publicly humiliated."
The 34-year-old says she is now trying to change residence as she continues to be traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer he moved to Italian giant Juve in a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million deal.
Brexit: UK 'will forever regret' to lose car manufacturers
Britain "will regret it forever" if it loses its status as a world leader in automotive manufacturing after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark has said.
He added that it was "about" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if the UK left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," Clark said.
The Japanese car manufacturer said the effect of border delays in case a non-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant - which makes Toyota's Auris and Avensis - produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, where 90% was exported to the rest of the EU.
"My opinion is that if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, we will see production stops at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director at Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers have raised fears of leaving the EU without agreement on how cross-border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says it will close its Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns concern what the car manufacturers say are supply chain risks in the event of a non-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line is operated on a "just-in-time" basis, with parts coming every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars ordered.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, disruptions at the border may arise as the industry says may lead to delays and lack of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day's worth of inventory at its Derbyshire factory, the company said, and thus production would be stopped.
Mr Clark said that Theresa May's Checker's plan for future relations with the EU is "net top calibrated to avoid border checks."
"We need to have a deal. We want to have the best deal that will allow, as I say, not only to enjoy the success today, but for us to seize this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's day program.
"The evidence from not only Toyota but other manufacturers is that we absolutely must be able to continue what has been a very successful set of supply chains."
Toyota could not say how long production would be halted, but in the longer term they warned that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years, and is the Unite union at the facility, said that his members are more concerned: "From my experience, when these jobs go, they never come back.
A government spokesman said, "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, says White House
Donald Trump's high-profile meeting with deputy attorney Rod Rosenstein could be "pressed back a week" as the fight against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian election interference, links between Trump aides and Russia and potential obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether or not Trump will dismiss the general of the case lawyers or not, and thus endanger Mueller's independence, has fed Washington gossip for months.
Earlier in the month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed a lead to record talks with Trump and the possibility of removing the president using the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But earlier Monday, he went to the White House, and it was reported that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, then at the UN in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would "prefer" not to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid crashing with the Senate Commission hearing where both Kavanaugh and one of the women who have accused him of sexual harassment, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh, delaying full voting from the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said, "No date has been set. It may be this week, but I can and can see that it will be delayed another week because of everything else going on in the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I always like to keep the press updated."
Some reporters will probably disagree on that: Sanders has not held a press briefing for the White House since September 10.
The host, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders said the lack of orientations was not due to a dissatisfaction with TV reporters' game for the gallery, although she said, "I don't disagree with them doing so."
She mentioned and that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
"The president holds more press conferences than any president has done before," she said - right enough without coming up with evidence for the claim. "We have looked at the speech."
Sanders says updates will still happen, but "if the press gets the chance to ask the President of the United States directly, it's much better than talking to me.
We've tried to do it such a part, and you've seen us do it often in recent weeks, and it's going to take over instead of a press orientation if you can talk directly to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly receives questions when he travels from the White House or attends open sessions or press conferences with visitors.
It is unusual for the president to hold press conferences alone.
In New York this week, the president perhaps demonstrated why, where he performed leading reporters without shame, and almost bizarrely.
Health secretary writes about Brexit fears to EU workers at NHS in Scotland
The Health Secretary has written to EU workers working at the NHS in Scotland to express gratitude and a wish that they continue after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter although it is less than six months before Britain resigns from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to bear the costs of applications that have the status of determined for EU residents working in delegated public services.
In the letter, Freeman wrote the following: "During the summer, negotiations regarding withdrawal between the UK and the EU have continued, and it is approaching the expected end of autumn.
Nevertheless, the British government has stepped up preparations in case there is no deal.
I understand that this must be a difficult time for all of you.
Therefore, I will now repeat how much I value the contributions of all employees, regardless of what nationality they have.
Colleagues from the EU, and beyond, bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and affect the work in the health sector and are beneficial to patients and communities.
Scotland is clearly your home, and we want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after head injury
Linebacker Christion Abercrombie, who plays for the Tennessee State Tigers, went through an emergency operation after wearing a head injury when the team lost 31–27 against Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, reports The Tennesseean newspaper.
Head coach of Tennessee State, Rod Reed, told reporters that the injury occurred just before the break.
"He came to the sideline and collapsed, in a way," Reed said.
Trainers and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before placing it on a carrier and taking it behind for further evaluation.
An official spokesperson from Tennessee State, told WSMV that Abercrombie had completed surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
There are no details on the extent of the damage yet, Harris said, adding that Tennessee State is still trying to figure out when the damage occurred.
Abercrombie attends the second year of university, and is in his first season after being transferred from Illinois.
He had a total of five tackles before being injured in Saturday's game, and is now up in 18 total this season.
Foreign buyers must pay a higher document fee when buying property in the UK
Foreign buyers have to pay a higher document fee when buying property in the UK. The extra income will be used to help the homeless, according to the new plans of the Conservatives
The decision will neutralize Corbyn's success in attracting young voters
The increase in document fees will be added for those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Treasury expects an increase of up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year - to help the homeless
Theresa May will today announce that foreign buyers will have to pay a higher document fee when buying property in the UK. The extra income will be used to help the homeless.
This decision will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success Jeremy Corbyn has had in attracting young voters who earn a lot, with the promise of offering affordable housing.
The increase in document fees will be added for individuals and firms not paying taxes in the UK, and the extra money will strengthen the government's desire to reduce the number of envoys.
The fee, which comes in addition to the current document fee, includes the higher levels introduced two years ago on housing number two and rental housing, can be as much as three percent.
The Treasury expects the decision to bring in up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
Approximately 13 percent of London's new buildings are bought up by residents outside the United Kingdom, which makes prices higher, making it more difficult for first-time buyers to enter the housing market.
Many affluent areas of the country - especially in the capital - have become "ghost cities" due to the large number of foreign buyers who most of the time reside in other countries.
This new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson would cut document fees to help more young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction firms of keeping prices up by getting property but not using them, and asked Theresa May to give up the quotas on reasonable housing to fix Britain's "habitation shame".
Corbyn has announced a series of eye-catching proposals for housing reforms, including controlled rent and the termination of expulsions for no reason.
He will and will give the council more power to build new settlements.
May said, "Last year I said I would dedicate my position to bringing back the British dream - that life should be better for every new generation.
It means fixing the ruined housing market.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
Nevertheless, it may not be right that it should be as easy for individuals who do not live in the UK, or foreign firms, to buy housing as it is for hard-working, British residents.
For many people, the dream of owning a home has come too far, and the humiliation of being a convert is real.
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate ambition is to lead Scotland'
The head of Sunderland, Jack Ross, says his "ultimate ambition" is to become a manager for Scotland at some point.
The Scots (42) are delighted with the challenge of reviving the club from the north-east. Currently, they are third in League One, only three points from the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer, having led St Mirren back to the Scottish elite series in the previous season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B national team match, and that was it," Ross told Scotland's BBC Sportsound.
"But I grew up seeing Scotland at Hamden along with my father, and there has always been something that has pulled me back.
That possibility can only come if I'm successful as a club manager."
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland manager, include Dick Advocate, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of Alloa Athletic says he has not been anxious to come up with so many established names in such a large club, since he has previously declined approaches from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"For the moment, success for me will be measured in whether I can 'get this club back in the Premier League.'
Given the structure and facilities of this club, there is no doubt that they belong to the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to get them there, but I can probably only see myself as successful if I can get the club back there".
Ross is only three years into his career as a manager, after a period as an assistant manager at Dumbarton and a 15-month period in Hearts' coaching apparatus.
He then helped Alloa to recover from relegation to third level, turning St Mirren, who was about to move down, into a championship series title winner the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now, than he ever did while playing in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was another road divide," he says of leading Alloa.
"I genuinely believed that being a manager fits me much better than being a player.
It sounded bizarre, because I did well, lit well and enjoyed it relatively well.
But playing can be tough.
There are a lot of things you need to get through each week.
I still notice it when it comes to the stress and pressure of the job, but it feels right to be a manager.
I've always wanted to be a manager, and now I am, that's the most comfortable thing I've felt in my own body in my whole adult life."

This summer's heatwave has led to an increase in the intensity of strenuous pubs in the UK, but also increased pressure on restaurant chains.
In July, sales increased by 2.7 percent in the children's sector - but for the restaurant industry it declined by 4.8 percent, the statistics show.
Business adviser Peter Martin, who is behind the statistics, said, "Continuous sunshine, and the fact that England was in the World Cup longer than planned means that July followed the pattern of June where pubs went up 2.8 percent, only that restaurants became even harder hit.
The 1.8 percent decline in the restaurant industry only got worse in July.
Pubs and bars selling drinks made it significantly better and went up more than restaurants went down.
Pubs selling food, received and noticed the decline in the sun, although it was not as dramatic as for restaurant owners.
It may seem like people just want to go out for a drink.
Among pubs and bars, the drinking hall had increased by 6.6 percent this month, while food had decreased by three percent.
Paul Newman, travel and leisure analyst at RSM, said, "These results are the continuation of the trend we have seen since the end of April.
Weather, and the impact of a huge social or sporting event, will still be the biggest factors when it comes to salaries in the nightlife industry.
It is no surprise that the restaurant industry will still struggle, with a drop in sales of 4.8 percent per year will be painful to get on top of a running cost pressure.
The long, hot summer could not come at a worse time for operators who operate with food, time will show whether the more moderate temperatures that have been in August can provide a long-awaited breathing room."
The total salsa soaking across pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the downsizing in the release of brands.

One in five children have secret social media profiles they hide from their parents
One in five children - some as young as 11 - have secret social media profiles that they hide from parents and teachers, a survey shows
Examination of 20,000 students on progress reveals an increase in "false Insta" profiles
This news has increased the fear that sexual content will be posted
Twenty percent of students say they have a "head" profile they show their parents
One in five children - some as young as 11 - create profiles on social media that they keep secret for adults.
A survey of 20,000 students in secondary school revealed a sharp increase in "false Insta" profiles – a reference to the Instagram image sharing platform.
The news has increased the fear of sexual content being posted.
Twenty percent of students say they have a sterile "head" profile they refer to parents, while they also have private profiles.
A mother who stumbled over the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who urged others to "choose me".
The research, done by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) at various schools, found that 40 percent of those between the ages of 11 and 18 had two profiles, and half of these admitted to having private users.
The head of HMC, Mike Buchanan, said, "It's disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create places online where parents and teachers can't find them."
Eilidh Doyle becomes "the voice of the athletes" in the Scottish athletic board
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the board of Scottish athletics as non-administrative director at the board's annual general meeting.
Doyle is the most decorated athletic athlete in Scotland, and chairman Ian Beattie describes the event as a great opportunity for those who lead the sport to benefit from her extensive experience at international level over the past decade.
"Eilidh has a lot of respect across Scotland, the United Kingdom and the world's athletic community, and we are sure that the athletic community in Scotland can benefit from getting her on board," said Beattie.
Doyle said, "I'm eager to act as a voice for athletes, and I hope I can be contributing and helping the sport in Scotland."
The American, who has gold from both the 200m and 400m in Atlanta in 1996 among his total four Olympic golds and is now a regular guest at the BBC, was unable to go after a drop.
On Twitter, he wrote, "Today it's been a month since I got hit.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that it was only the time that could tell me if I was going to get well again, or to what extent.
It's been exhausting work, but I've gotten all right again, learned to walk again, and today I do flexibility exercises!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Split opinions on the Internet about breast pump advertising comparing mothers to dairy cows
A breast pump company has split opinion on the Internet with an advertisement comparing breastfeeding mothers to dairy cows.
To mark what has been described as "the world's first silent, in-situ breast pump", the technology company Elvie released a tiny advertisement inspired by music videos to demonstrate the freedom the new pump gives mothers who extract milk.
Four real mothers dance in a high-filled barn of cows, to a song that includes texts such as: "Yes, I milk myself, but you see no tail" and "In case you don't notice it, this isn't a spanner, it's my dolls."
The chorus continues, "Pump it out, pump it out, I feed these kids, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my ladies".
The advertisement, published on the company's Facebook page, has, however, created controversy online.
With 77,000 views and several hundred comments, the video has received mixed reactions from viewers, and many say it illuminates the "horror" of the dairy industry.
“Very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, only that the calves are trusted from the just days after birth," writes one.

Another commented, "Understandably traumatic enough for both mother and child
But yes, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their kids?"
Another added, "For a randomly removed advertisement."
Others defended the advertisement, and a lady admitted that she thinks the song is "festive."
"I think this is a brilliant idea.
I would have one if I were still breastfeeding.
Pumping made me feel online like a cow.
This advertisement is a little crazy, but I took it for what it is.
This is a brilliant product," wrote one.
Another commented: "This is a fun advertisement aimed at mothers who pump (often at work or on the toilet) and feel like cows.
This is not an advertisement that boasts or judges the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, the group of women reveal that they have all danced with the discreet pump wrapped in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the insights that many women who pump say they feel like cows.
The Elvie pump, on the other hand, is completely silent, has no leads or pipes, and its discreet inside a breastfeeding bra, giving women the freedom to move, hold their kids, and even go out while pumping.
Ana Balardin, partner and creative director of Mother, commented, "The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between mothers who extract milk and milk cows, we want to put the spotlight on breast pumping and the challenges associated with it, and at the same time demonstrate the incredible sense of freedom the new pump will bring, in an entertaining and recognizable way.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump has created headlines.
During the fashion show in London, a mother of two appeared on the podium for designer Marta Jakubowski, while she was using the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children move in silence to tent camp on Texas border
The number of imprisoned immigrant children has peaked even though monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, partly because the strict policy the Trump administration has introduced makes it harder to place the children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most of the sponsors have been undocumented immigrants themselves, and they fear that standing up and accepting a child may threaten their own ability to stay in the country.
The risk of it increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult family members are being urged to submit fingerprints, and that these data will be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence of Immigration and Customs Enforcement testified to Congress saying that the agency has arrested dozens of people who have applied to be sponsors of single minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of the arrested had nothing on their scroll from before.
"Nearly 80 percent of those who are either sponsors or family members of sponsors are in the country illegal, and a large part of these are criminal aliens.
So we're going to continue chasing these people," Albence said.
According to the camp, new rules have now been introduced to handle the children, which require some of them to be in court before a month has passed, against the previous 60 days.
Many will attend via video calls and not by personal attendance, to have their case tried leading an immigration judge.
Those who are not eligible for freedom will be deported quickly.
The longer the children are in custody, the more likely they are to develop anxiety or depression, which can lead to selective outbreaks or escape attempts, they say, adding to the camp.Reports that have appeared in recent months say the same.
Spokespersons say these concerns are greater at large facilities such as Tornillo, and due to the size of the facility, children are more likely to be overlooked.
They added that moving children to the tent camp without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally, or saying the hatred of friends, can amplify the trauma that many are already struggling with.
Syria asks U.S., French and Turkish occupation forces to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also asked for Syrian refugees to return home, although the country is now at war in its eighth year.
Moualem, who and serves as Deputy Prime Minister, said that forthcoming forces behave illegally on Syrian soil under the auspices of defeating terrorism, and "will be treated in from there".
"They must withdraw immediately and without prejudice," he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that "the war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011, and millions have been removed from their homes.
He said Damascus will continue to "fight a holy fight until all Syrian territory has been cleansed" for both terrorist groups and "illegal presence of outsiders."
The United States has approximately 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly for training and advising both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground in that war-torn country.
When talking about the refugee problems, Moualem said it was safe for them to come back, and he blamed "some Western countries" for having "spread irrational fears" about the surroundings that caused the refugees to stay away.
"We have asked the international community and the humanitarian organizations to facilitate the return," he said.
"They're making policies out of something that would be a purely humanitarian problem."
The United States and the EU have warned that there will be no help for reconstruction in Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war is in place.
United Nations diplomats say a recently created agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in Idlib, which is the last major insurgency stronghold, has created an opportunity to continue pushing ahead with political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement averted a major attack by Russian-backed, Syrian forces on the province where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action would be directed against jihadists, including warriors from the Nusra Front, associated with Al-Qaeda, who "will be exterminated."
The UN envoy, Staffan de Mistura, hopes to soon gather the first meetings of a new committee consisting of government and opposition members to prepare a post-war law for Syria, and pave the way for the election.
Moualem set terms for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that the panel's work should be limited "to review the articles of the current constitution", and warned of disruptions.
Why Trump is going to win another term
With that logic, Trump will win the re-election in 2020 if not, as many liberal viewers are likely hoping, the presidency gets an early end due to scandals and federal law.
It would undoubtedly be "the most dramatic ending of a presidency ever!"
At the time of writing, there is no sign that viewers have been bored.
Since 2014, CNN has doubled its rating in best broadcast time to 1.05 million, while MSNBC has nearly tripled its rating to 1.6 million.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at its best broadcast time, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has played at the top of the cable ratings with as much as 3.5 million viewers on evenings with major news.
"This is a fire that people get lured into, because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer in the ABC drama "Designated Survivor", which is about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the congressional building.
Nell Scovell, old comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver said he was going to vote for Trump.
Why? she asked.
"Because he makes me laugh," he replied, according to Scovell.
It's entertainment value in the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the history coming from Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can be reunited and the health of the global economy.
Turning off is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet it goes beyond being an informed citizen when you find yourself on the sixth hour to see a panel of experts debate Bob Woodward's use of sources with "deep background" for the book "Fear," Paul Manafort's analytic bomber jacket of strawberry leather at $15,000, Daniel's analytic unwritten, Washington's unwritten unwritten, "a ragged tjuk"
Personally, I'll never look at Super Mario the same way again.
"Part of what he's doing that makes it feel like a reality show is that he gives you something every night," said Brent Montgomery, daily manager of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", about the show that takes place with Trump's employees and daily disputes (go into a fight with Jom-Kim, praise NFL).
You can't afford to miss a single episode, otherwise you won't hang with anymore.
When I met Fleiss this week, it was over 25 degrees and sun outside his home on the north coast of Kauai, but he sat inside and watched MSNBC while recording CNN.
He failed to turn away, not when Brett Kavanaugh faced the Senate Commission and the future of the Supreme Court hung in a thin thread.
"I remember when we did all these crazy shows before in time and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Fleiss said.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right."

External money flows into the most densely contested midfield
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th district sees an abundance of money, thanks to a redeployment of the districts of Congress that led to two sitting members fighting for the same seat.
The newly converted Pittsburgh suburban district promotes Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district through a special election in the spring of last year.
Lamb is fighting another sitting member, Republican Keith Rothfus, today representative of the former 12th District of Pennsylvania, which largely overlaps with the new 17th District.
The map was repainted after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January determined that the old districts were illegally designed to benefit the Republicans.
The competition for the 17th District has launched an arms draw on the funding of the campaigns, between the major parties' money arsenals, the Democratic Congressional Committee and the Republican Congressional Committee.
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a button says in a closely followed special election in Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
The seat had belonged to a Republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by over 20 points.
Political experts have given the Democrats a scarce advantage.
U.S. Considers Punishment of El Salvador for Support of China, But Withdraws
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing without negative reactions from Washington.
Trump had a warm meeting with the president of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama to partners threw out the Trump organization's leadership group.
The Secretary of State decided to bring back the US heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over the "last decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, the ministry's spokeswoman, in a statement earlier this month.
However, penalties were only considered against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in US aid in 2017, including for drug control, development, and financial support.
The proposed penalties, which contained cuts to financial support and targeted restrictions with regard to visas, would have been painful for the Central American country and their high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings evolved, North American and Central American officials deferred a conference on security and economic prosperity to follow up a similar gathering last year that was seen as a step forward to prevent immigrants from coming to the United States.
However, in mid-September, the top administrators announced that they wanted the conference to continue, thus putting an end to the assessment of the punishment for El Salvador.
It has now been said that Vice President Mike Pence will meet the conference, which has been scheduled in mid-October, as a signal on the relevance the administration attaches to the meeting, the diplomats said.
And the three U.S. envoys returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new tough messages or penalties from Washington.
A spokesman for Bolton would not comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal considerations on the premise of anonymity.
Their description was confirmed by an outspoken analyst who works closely with the administration and also spoke under the premise of anonymity.
Studying History
One awaits special adviser Robert Mueller's report on Trump's possible obstacles to justice, for which there is now significant evidence in the public protocols.
According to the reports, Mueller is said to have turned the focus in the investigation towards whether Trump's campaign conspired with Russia's idea of attacking our election.
If Congress were to change directors, Trump would have to stand up in this body, in preparing to persuade voters and possibly a jury of his peers.
There is a lot of "what about", and I don't mean to suggest that Trump's fall is inevitable—nor for his counterpart in Europe.
It is a choice to take for all of us on both sides of the pond, which will affect how long the fight can be.
In 1938, German officers were ready for a coup d'état against Hitler, only the West had stood against him and helped the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed, and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of bloodshed this entailed.
The course of history revolves around such turning points, and democracy's impenetrable march is accelerated or postponed.
Americans are facing several of these turning points now.
What will we do if Trump fires Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been on deep water ever since this newspaper revealed that last year he proposed to interrogate the president in secret, speculating whether he is unfit for his role.
Rosenstein says The Times' description is inaccurate.
"How will we react if the recently-questioned FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair – or is he accepted by the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault, and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we in the midterm elections vote for a congress that holds Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, democracy will face a long winter.
But I don't think we're wrong, because of what I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied the country I have my embassy in.
She survived, immigrated to the United States, and 60 years later she sent me off guard to light Sabbath lights on the table carrying the swastika.
When this is my legacy, how can I not be optimistic about the future?

Rangers Graham Dorrans is optimistic before meeting with Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will welcome Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that saying over the Austrians, after an impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will give them a good starting point to qualify from Group G in the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance this season before the 2–2 result against Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use this result as a springboard for larger things.
"It was a good point for us, because Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old.
"We went into the fight with the belief that we could get something, and came out again with a point.
Maybe we could take it towards the end, but all in all, the draw is probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half, and then we came out in the second half and were the better team.
On Thursday, there will be another great European evening.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it's going to be a tough game. They got a good result in their previous game, but with the crowd behind us I'm sure we can run on and get a positive result.
The last year has definitely been tough, with everything that has happened to my injuries and the changes at the club, but now everything feels good.
The stable is good and the boys thrive; the training is good.
Hopefully we can drive on now, put the previous season behind us and be successful."
Women Lose Sleep Over This Fear of Retirement Savings
Despite the fact that participants in a survey had clear thoughts about how they would be cared for, few spoke to family members about it.
About half of those who participated in a survey from insurance company Nationwide, they said they talked to their spouses about the costs of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their kids about it.
"People want a family member to take care of themselves, but they're not taking the necessary steps to have that conversation," says Vice President of Nationwide, Holly Snyder.
Here's where you start.
Talk to your spouse and kids: You can't prepare your family to take care of you if you don't make your wish known well in the foreground.
Collaborate with a counselor and your family to discuss where and how you will receive care, since these choices can be a big part of determining the costs.
Get a financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you figure out how to pay for these expenses.
The financing options for long-term care can include a traditional long-term care insurance, a life insurance with cash value to help pay the expenses, or that you insure yourself with your own wealth – as long as you have the money.
Create legal documents: Deter legal battles before they start.
Get a health authority in place, so assigning a person you trust to oversee your medical treatment and to ensure that professionals act in accordance with your wishes in case you cannot communicate.
You can also consider a mandate for your finances.
You should choose a person you trust to make financial decisions and make sure your bills are paid if you don't have the opportunity yourself.
Don't forget the little details: Imagine that your old parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Could you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Write down all of these details in a written plan to be ready.
"It's not just the finances it's about, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What kind of medication is it?
Who will take care of the dog?
Have the plan ready.”
Man shot several times with air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man has been shot several times with an air gun in what he was on his way home after a walk in the city.
The victim in his 40s was in the area around Oxford Grove, Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
Police constables describe the shooting, which occurred around 02.30 local time, as a "random action".
The victim did not see the attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and police are asking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a severe earthquake and a tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, public officials say.
Without the ability to communicate, aid workers have not received any information from Donggala, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the quake that had a strength of 7.5.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster was a fact.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, located on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central Sulawesi province and is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the quake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is an area stretching over more than 300 km with coastline northwest of the island.
The area, which is an administrative region lower than a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming is the berbelt of the economy of the central Sulawesi province, especially in the Donggala coastal region.
Nickel extraction is important in the province, but is mostly concentrated to Morowali, on the other side of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times over the past 100 years, according to the Disaster Reduction Office in Indonesia.
In 1938, more than 200 people were killed and several hundred houses destroyed by a tsunami in Donggala.
In 1996, the west side of Donggala was hit by a tsunami that killed nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Ocean seismic fire ring and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major quake on the west coast of Aceh Province in northern Sumatra on 26 December, triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of these in Aceh.
2005: A series of major quakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Several hundred died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that crashed into the south coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near the town of Padang, capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people lost their lives.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 quake struck one of the Mentawai Islands outside Sumatra and triggered a tsunami of approximately 10 metres that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A small quake struck the Pidie Jaya area of Aceh and caused destruction and panic when people were reminded of the 2004 quake and tsunami.
No tsunami was triggered this time, but more than 100 lost their lives due to buildings that collapsed.
2018: Great earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok and kill more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The quake destroyed several thousand buildings and left several thousand tourists temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested and charged with domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested, charged with assault.
According to a report released by Alaska State Police, Palin (29) was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interference in reporting domestic violence and opposing arrest.
According to the police report, he took the phone from a female confessor when she tried to call the police to report the crime.
Palin is being held in Mat-Su prison, and is being held for bail of $500, KTUU reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday and declared himself "not guilty" when asked, giving up the network.
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanors, meaning he can be jailed for up to one year and get $250,000 in fines.
He has also been charged with a Class B misdemeanor, which can be punished with a day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
It is not the first time Palin has been charged with anything criminal.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
Her mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
The case is up in the vet's court in Alaska.
In January 2016, he became the target of domestic attacks, interference in a reporting of domestic violence and possession of a weapon while he was intoxicated in connection with the incident.
His lover had claimed that he hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after linking her son's selective behavior to PTSD stemming from his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of people lost their lives
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The quake, with a strength of 7.5, triggered a tsunami and has destroyed several thousand homes.
Electricity and communications networks are down, and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck just outside the central part of Sulawesi, located northeast of the capital Jakarta.
Videos showing the dramatic moment at which the quake hits are thriving on social media.
Several hundred people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the shores.
Federal prosecutors want rare death penalty for suspect in New York terror
Federal prosecutors in New York will have the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, suspected in the terrorist attack that killed eight people -- a rare punishment that has not been executed for a federal offense in the state since 1953.
Saipov (30) reportedly used a rental car from Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bike path along the West Side Highway on lower Manhattan in October, where he drove down pedestrians and cyclists on the road.
In order to justify a death penalty, prosecutors must be able to prove that Saipov killed the eight victims "intentionally" and that he "intentionally" inflicted them serious, bodily harm, according to a note filed in the southern district of New York.
Both of these events may be the basis for a possible death penalty, it states in the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal jury handed over a list of 22 indictments, including eight counts of murder aimed at extortion, usually used by federal prosecutors in connection with organized crime, and a count of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "substantial planning and deliberation", said the prosecutors and described the way Saipov carried out the attack as "abhorrent, cruel and corrupt".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused damage and loss to family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", it states in the note.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It is ten years ago the last time the southern district of New York has sentenced the death penalty in a case.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of killing two drug providers, but was ultimately sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time a death penalty was carried out in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
On June 19, 1953, both were executed in the electric chair.
Saipov, originally from Uzbekistan, showed a lack of remorse in the days and months that followed, according to court documents.
He told the detectives that what he had done was known best, police said.
Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching videos from ISIS on the phone, it said.
He also asked to have the ISIS flag in the hospital room, police said.
He has not pleaded guilty on every charge.
David Patton, one of the federal, public defenders representing Saipov, says they are "clearly disappointed" with the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to go after the death penalty, rather than accepting a declaration of guilt for life in prison without possibility of release, will only prolong the trauma of the incident for all involved," said Patton.
Saipov's defenders had previously asked the prosecutors not to go after the death penalty.
Tory MP thinks Nigel Farage should rent Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the people's army" today, during a protest at the Tory country meeting.
The former leader of the British Independence Party said police had to "feel the pressure" from Eurosceptics – with one of Theresa May's MPs suggesting he should rent the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone told demonstrators in Birmingham that Britain "had been out" now, if Farage was Brexit minister.
With the challenge May faces reconciling her deeply divided lines has been underlined by a separate protest in the city, held by Tories who want to stay in the EU.
The Prime Minister struggled to keep plans with the Chequers compromise on track after attacks from Brexiteers, Remainers as well as the EU.
Allies insist that she will push for a deal with Brussels, despite the backlash – and force Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose between her package and "chaos".
Bone told Leave Means Leave grouping in Solihull that he wanted to "reject Chequers"
He suggested that Farage should be given noble rank and given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had ruled, we would be out now," he said.
The Wellingborough MP, added, "I want to fight for Brexit, but we have to reject Chequers".
To mark his opposition to the EU, he said, "We are not fighting world wars to be subordinate.
We will make our own laws in our own country."
Bone rejects the claim that the people's opinion has changed since the 2016 election: "The idea that the British people have changed their opinion and want to become is completely untrue".
Tory Brexit advocate Andrea Jenkyns also participated in the march, telling reporters: "I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people!"
"Chequers are not popular in the population, the opposition is not going to vote for it, it is not popular in our party or our activists who frequent the streets and get us elected in the first place.
Please drop the Chequers and listen.”
In a message addressed to May, she adds, "Ministers of State retain their jobs when they keep what they promise".
Farage said that police must "feel the heat" if they come to betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
"Now it's about trust between us - the people - and the political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell them that 'we're not going to let them get away with it'".
In a message to the enthusiastic audience, he added, "I want you to get the political class, who is on the brink of betraying Brexit, to feel the warmth.
"We are mobilizing the people's army in this country that gave us say in Brexit and will not rest until we have become an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.
At the same time, the Remainers marched through the streets of Birmingham before holding a two-hour meeting in downtown.
A handful of activists waved "Tories Against Brexit" banners after launching the group this weekend.
Labour colleague Lord Adonis made fun of the conservatives for security problems they had with a party app during the opening of the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can have all the computer systems in place and all the technology for Canada plus, for a frictionless limit, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's a total farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.
Warren plans to take a "careful look" at running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will take "a careful look at running for president" after the November election.
Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future during a city meeting west of Massachusetts Saturday.
Warren, a regular critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was but as a board member in Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She has been the center of too much speculation that she may want to try against Trump in 2020.
The event in Holyoke on Saturday, was her 36th meeting with voters in a town hall since Trump joined.
A participant asked if she had plans to run for president.
Warren replied that it is time "women take the trip to Washington to fix our destroyed government, and that includes a woman at the top."
Arrest made in shooting by Louisiana State University player Sims
Police in Baton Rouge announced Saturday that a suspect has been arrested in the case where Louisiana State University (LSU) basketball player, Wayde Sims, was shot and killed Friday.
At 11:00 local time, police announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson (20), in a press conference for ET.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help identifying a man set on the video clip.
Sims (20) were shot and killed early Friday in the southern area of the university.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound in the head and eventually died as a result of it," Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told the media Saturday, writes 247sports.
Wayde went in to defend a friend and was shot by Simpson.
In interrogation, Simpson has admitted he was on the scene, with guns, and admitted that he shot the Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without drama and held in custody by the police department in eastern Baton Rouge.
A third-year student of nearly two metres, raised in Baton Rouge, the Sims played 32 games, ten of them from the start of the previous season, where he averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points, and 2.9 rebounds in each game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title after team orders give say over Sebastian Vettel
It became clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the Mercedes team drapes would have a major role in the race.
Bottas got a good start on the race, letting Hamilton take care of himself in defending his position for the first two rounds and inviting Vettel to attack the teammate.
Vettel was first into the depot and let Hamilton get into traffic at the back of the track, which should be decisive.
The Mercedes drove into the depot a round later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton ported in front after some action side-by-side which caused the Ferrari driver reluctantly to let the inside be at risk of not being able to defend himself at the third corner.
Max Verstappen started, on his 21st birthday, in the back row and was in seventh place at the end of the first round.
After that, he led much of the race as he went for a quick finish with the goal of driving past Kimi Raikkonen who was in fourth place.
He entered the depot in the 44th round, but failed to increase the speed of the last eight rounds while Raikkonen took fourth place.
It's a difficult day, because Valtteri did an amazing job all weekend, and was a real gentleman who let me by.
The team has done an exceptional job that has both first and second," said Hamilton.
It was really bad body language
President Donald Trump made fun of Senator Dianne Feinstein at an election meeting Saturday due to her insistence that she did not make the letter from Christine Blasey Ford in which she indicts Supreme Court-nominated Brett Kavanaugh for sexual abuse.
During a speech at an election meeting in West Virginia, the president did not mention the testimony Ford had given the Senate Commission directly, but rather commented that what goes on in the Senate showed that people were "bad and ugly and spoke untrue".
"It ate the thing that can happen, and the beautiful thing that has happened in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and evil and uncomfortable and speaking untrue," he said.
"When you look at publications and leaks and then say, 'Oh, I didn't.
I didn't."
Do you think?
Dianne Feinstein, do you make it?
Do you remember her answer... you made the document - "oh, eh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't make it."
Wait a moment.
Let us... No, we didn't make it," he added, mimicking the senator.
Feinstein received the letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh from Ford in July, and it was played earlier in September - but Feinstein denied the leak came from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't make her story," Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
"She asked me to keep it confidential, and I kept it confidential, as she asked."
But her denial did not fall to good ground with the president, who commented on it at Saturday's election meeting: "I tell you, it was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
While continuing to defend the Supreme Court nominee, who has been accused of poor sexual conduct by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats use the charges for their own gain.
"They are determined to take back power in any way they deem necessary.
You see the badness, the uglyness, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to run against to gain power and control," said the president, according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars - Belfast Giants (5-3)
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for Giants against Dundee
The stars from Dundee compensated for the loss against the Belfast Giants on Friday by winning the return game 5-3 on Saturday.
The Giants received an early two-goal lead due to attacks from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie offset before Dwyer once again sent the Giants in the lead.
Francois Bouchard compensated for Dundee before two goals by Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory.
It was the third loss in the league this season for the boys of Adam Keefe, who defeated Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday.
This was the fourth meeting between the teams this season, where the Giants have won the last three games.
Dwyer's opening came in the fourth minute after an assist from Kendall McFaull, and David Rutherford served an assist to Beauvillier who doubled the lead four minutes later.
In what was a busy opening period, Sullivan won the home team in the game again in the 14th minute, before Matt Marquardt secured Cownie's compensation in the 16th minute.
Dwyer ensured that the Giants took the lead into the pause as he scored his second goal for the night on the tampon of the first half.
The home team regrouped, and Bouchard once again secured an equaliser with a brilliant goal after 27 minutes of play.
Late in the second half, Cownie and Charles Corcoran collaborated to help Nielsen secure Dundee's lead for the first time in the game, securing the victory with the team's fifth goal halfway in the last half.
The Giants, who have now lost four of the last five games, meet Milton Keynes at home in the next game, which is on Friday.
Air traffic controllers lose their lives to ensure hundreds of planes escape earthquake
A flight attendant in Indonesia is hailed as a hero after he lost his life in what he continues to ensure that a plane with several hundred passengers safely got into the air.
More than 800 people have lost their lives and many are missing after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi and triggered a tsunami on Friday.
Strong aftershocks continue to disrupt the area, and many are trapped in debris in the city of Palu.
However, despite his colleagues fleeing for life, Anthonius Gunawan Agung (21) refused to leave his post in the control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu, although it swung wildly.
He stayed behind to make sure that the aircraft on the runway, Batik Air Flight 6321, took off safely.
He then jumped down from the control tower as he believed it collapsed.
He later died in the hospital.
The spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said that the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, reported ABC News Australia.
We sent a helicopter from Balikpapan, Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in a larger city.
Unfortunately, he passed away this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"This is heartwarming," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities are afraid that the death toll will increase to thousands, while the country's emergency relief agency says access to the small towns of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
“The death toll is increasing as we find bodies trapped under buildings, many of which we cannot reach,” said agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves of up to six metres have destroyed Palu, which is scheduled to hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Need assistance comes in with military and commercial aircraft.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News, "Every minute an ambulance comes with several bodies.
It is difficult to find clean water.
The little shops have become robbery.”
Jan Gelfand, the leader of the Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN, "The Indonesian Red Cross is striving to help the survivors, but we don't know what they will find when they arrive.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse."
The President of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, came to Palu on Sunday and said to the military in the country, "I ask you all to work around the clock to do everything you can to help with the evacuation.
Are they ready?” reported CNN.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by an earthquake in Lombok, and 550 people died.
Flight crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now reports man missing after lagoon crash
The airline operating a plane that crashed in a lagoon in Micronesia in the Pacific reports that a man is missing, having previously stated that all 47 of the passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the plane before it sank.
Air Niugini stated that as of Saturday afternoon they do not know where the male passenger is.
The airline said they are working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not provide more details about the passenger, and his age and nationality are unknown.
Local boat owners helped save other passengers and the crew after the plane hit the water as it attempted to land at the airport on the island of Chuuk.
Authorities said on Friday that seven people had been sent to hospitals.
The airline said six passengers were still at the hospital on Saturday, and all were in stable condition.
It is still unknown what caused the crash and what actually happened.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon not far from the runway.
Some witnesses believed the plane was flying past the runway.
The American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was very low.
"It was extremely good," said Jaynes.
Jaynes added that he and other passengers were able to water through the water, reaching them up to life, to the nautical exits of the plane before it sank.
He said the flight crew was panicking and screaming, and he suffered a head injury that was not serious.
The U.S. Navy said nearby sailors, who were working to repair a quay, also rescued passengers with a rubber boat that they used to carry passengers to land before the plane sank by about 30 metres.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network website shows that 111 people have died in crashes of PNG-registered airlines' aircraft over the past 20 years, but none of them flew with Air Niugini.
Analysts Create Timeline Over Night When Woman Was Burned Alive
The prosecution submitted all evidence on Saturday during the indictment trial of a man charged with burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice's analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as an expert witness in intelligence analysis.
He presented to the jury how he put together recordings from mobile phones to find out what happened the night when Jessica Chambers (19) was killed by the defendant, Quinton Tellis (29).
According to The Clarion Ledger newspaper, Rowlett said that he used location data from several cell phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, contrary to what Tellis explained earlier.
When the location data showed that Tellis' cell phone was with Chambers's cell phone at the same time as he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he was outside that day.
At the prosecution, Tellis asked if he was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said he " lied, because my car was in Nashville."
Another contradiction was that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
However, their mobile phone bills showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that shortly after Chambers died, Tellis deleted messages, calls, and Chambers' contact information from his mobile phone.
"He deleted her from his life," Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to close the case on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the trial to go to the jury later the same day.

Another black person?!
New York babysitter sues couple for fired after "racist" text message
A New York babysitter sues a couple to fire her based on discrimination after she received an incorrect text message from her mother complaining that she was "another black person."
The couple have denied being racist, comparing the lawsuit with "extortion."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two, was dissatisfied when she saw that the babysitter she had added, Giselle Maurice, was black when she first came to work in 2016.
"NEEEEEEEEEEEEEI, ENDA A BLACK PERSON," Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a text message to her husband.
But instead of sending the message to her husband, she sent it to her child-care provider Maurice, twice.
Realizing her mistake, the inappropriate Plasco-Flaxman fired childminder Maurice, saying that the former childminder, who was African-American, had done a bad job, so now she wanted someone from the Philippines, according to The New York Post.
Maurice was paid for one day's work before they sent her home in an Uber.
Now, Maurice is suing the couple for compensation for having her fired. She wants $350 a day for six months for the job she should have had, even if it was without a contract, where she would live with the family.
"I want to show them that it's not okay to do that," she told The New York Post on Friday, adding, "I know there's discrimination."
The couple have denied being racist, saying that giving Maurice fired was the only thing they could do after insulting her, of which they were afraid that she would take revenge.
"My wife had sent her something she didn't mean to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists," husband Joel Plasco told The New York Post.
"But would you let someone you've insulted take care of your children, even if you didn't mean to insult them?
Your newborn baby?
Think about it.”
Plasco compared the lawsuit to "extortion," saying that his wife was seven months pregnant and was in a "very difficult situation."
"Are you really going to attack a person in such a situation?
It's not a nice thing to do," said investor Plasco.
As the case progresses, the public has been quick to judge the couple on social media, criticizing them for their behavior and logic.
The publisher behind the Paddington books was afraid that people would not like a talking bear, reveals new letter
The daughter of author Michael Bond, who was born shortly after the approval of the first book, commented, "It's hard to imagine what it was like to read the book for the first time, before it was published.
It's really fun to know now how successful Paddington became."
Jankel said her father, who worked as a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired to write the children's book about the little teddy bear, would be optimistic even if the book had been rejected, adding that she had mixed feelings during her book's 60th anniversary, because her father died last year.
As for Paddington, whom she described as "a very important member of the family," she added that her father was proud on the inside of how much success he made.
"He was a pretty quiet man, and he never barked," she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having kids that achieved something: you get proud of them even if it's not really you who's behind it.
I think he looked at Paddington's success that way.
Although it was his creation and imagination, he always gave all praise to Paddington himself."
My daughter was going to die and I had to say goodbye on the phone
When she landed, her daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice in a hurry, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to say it was really bad, that they didn't think she was going to make it," said Ednan-Laperouse.
"So Nad called to say that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, dear you.
I'm coming soon to be with you.
I'll be back soon.
The medications the doctors had given her for her heart to continue pumping were slowly getting out of her system.
She had already died and now the body was about to disintegrate.
I just sat there, knowing this happened.
I couldn't wave or scream, because I was in a room surrounded by families and people.
I really had to keep everything inside."
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, now mourning the loss of her daughter, had to board the plane along with other passengers who did not know what she had just gone through.
"Nobody knew anything," she said.
"I sat with my head bent while the tears fell."
It's hard to explain, but it was on the plane that I knew how much sympathy I had for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Sudden women hang patches on bridge to prevent suicide
Two women who lost their loved ones who committed suicide try to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have attached patches on a bridge in Wales to inspire and get people who are thinking of taking suicide to change their minds and call the numbers on the patches.
Davis's son Tyler was 13 years old when he began struggling with depression and took his life when he was 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day."
Davis, 45 years old and living in Lydney, said her son was a talented cook with a smile that infected.
"Everyone knew him because of his smile.
They said that his smile lit up every room."
But before he died, he quit his job, because he was in a "really dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old brother was the first to find Tyler after he had taken his own life.
Davis said, "I'm still worried that the little brother may have been affected by Tyler's death."
Davis wrote the notes "to let people know that there are other people out there who care and with whom they can talk, even if it's a friend.
Don't sit there alone – you need to talk to someone."
Humphreys, who has been Davis' friend for many years, lost her partner Mark after they had been together for 15 years and he had recently lost his mother.
"He never told me he was sad or depressed or anything," she said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed that he began to behave differently.
He was in the basement emotionally on Christmas Day 1, when the kids opened their gifts he didn't even look at them."
She told that his death was very traumatic for the children, and they continue to work through the trauma: "There is a huge void in our family now.
We're completely destroyed.
But we all have to fight to live on.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in a thin thread as FBI starts investigation
"I thought that if we actually got something similar to what he is asking for – a limited investigation – then maybe we could achieve some loneliness," said Flake on Saturday, adding that he is afraid the committee is "falling together" in the middle of a partisan lockdown.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
They hesitate because of the timing.
The midterm elections in the United States are only five weeks away, on November 6, and if the Republicans are not doing well, this will make it difficult for them to elect Kavanaugh to the U.S. Supreme Court.
George W. Bush has called senators to get them to support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Bush and was introduced to his wife Ashley in that way, then was Bush's secretary.
What happens when the FBI presents its report?
They will vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats sit.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh manages to collect at least 50 votes in the Senate. With 50 votes, Mike Pense, the Vice President of the United States, can give him the last vote and confirm him in the Supreme Court.
North Korea's number of skippers 'decreases' under Kim
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker reports
Park Byeong-seug referred to data from the South Korean Ministry of Unity, saying there were 1,127 jumpers last year – compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park said tighter borders between North Korea and China and more expensive smuggling fees are the main reasons why the number has declined.
Pyongyang has not spoken publicly.
The vast majority of North Korean deportees receive South Korean citizenship.
Seoul reports that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most fled via China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the strictly demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Korean countries.
China views fugitives as illegal immigrants and not as refugees, often sending them back by force.
Relations between North and South Korea – which are purely technically still at war – have improved in recent months.
This month, the leaders of the two countries in Pyongyang met to negotiate the disarmament of nuclear weapons.
These talks come after the historic June meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed to work for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the United States of not achieving anything since.
"Without being able to trust the United States, we cannot trust that our country is safe, and in such a situation we cannot disarm our weapons first," Ri said in a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical," saying he cannot serve in Supreme Court
Minority leader Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh, who is nominated for the Supreme Court, "hysterical" and said he has too much temperament to serve in the U.S. Supreme Court.
Pelosi called Kavanaugh "hysterical" in an interview during the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas, on Saturday.
"I know that if a woman had behaved in that way, she would have been called 'hysterical,' Pelosi said of Kavanaugh's testimony in front of the Senate Court on Thursday.
Kavanaugh was emotional and denied any allegations that he sexually harassed Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
In Kavanaugh's opening speech, he was very emotional and shouted at times with clumps in his throat while telling about his family and the years of progress.
He criticized the Democrats on the committee, calling the charges against him "grotesque and a planned assassination on his reputation," organized by liberal police who were angry that Hillary Clinton did not win the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi added that she believes Kavanaugh's testimony proves that he cannot serve in the Supreme Court, because it shows that he is biased towards Democrats.
"I think the way he behaved disqualifies him, and what he said about the Clinton family and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi made an objection when asked if she would try to get Kavanaugh to resign if he is elected to the Supreme Court, and if the Democrats achieve a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I can say this – if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he can't serve in the Supreme Court, nor in the court he serves now," Pelosi added.
Kavanaugh is a judge of Washington D.C.'s federal appellate court.
Pelosi also said that as a Democrat, she is concerned about potential judgments from Kavanaugh against the law known as Obamacare and the case of Roe vs. Wade, because Kavanaugh is known to be a conservative judge.
In the hearings to confirm Kavanaugh, he avoided answering questions about whether he would turn certain decisions in the Supreme Court.
"It's not the right time for a hysterical, prejudiced person in the Supreme Court who expects us to say he's great," Pelosi said.
And women have to swing the sword
It's a fair, bitter criticism, after months and years of anger, and she can't get it out without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do you think?"
She went on, "I got a lot of help from a woman in a high corporate position, who said that she branched when she was angry, but developed a technique where she said to the person who made her so angry that she branched, "You might think I'm sorry because I was crying.
I'm angry."
And then she just continues.
I think it was brilliant.
Tears serve as a way to get the mind out, but that's what many people misunderstand.
In one of my strongest memories of a previous job, where most of my colleagues were men, I was in a situation where I branched out of anger, and a woman older than me took me in the neck – she was a cold leader I had always been afraid of – and pulled me out onto the hallway.
"Never let them see you crying," she said to me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sorry and that they won because they made you cry."
Patricia Schroeder, who at the time was a congresswoman, a Colorado Democrat, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, Hart was caught out on a boat called Monkey Business, and resigned from the campaign. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, thought she could as well run for office as president herself.
"I didn't really think through it well enough," she said to me while laughing, 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates running for election, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called the situation "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Since the campaign had already been going on for a while, she had not raised enough money, so she promised that she would only be silent if she was able to raise $2 million.
It was impossible.
She discovered that her supporters who gave $1000 to men only gave her $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she asked.
When she declared that she was not going to run however, she was so emotional and full of gratitude to those who had supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and target the voicemails instead of the delegates, and anger at the gender discrimination, that g began to subside.
"You should have thought I had a nervous breakdown," Schroeder said of how the press reacted when she branched.
"You should have believed that Kleenex was my main sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are they going to write on my gravestone?
"Ho branch"?
How the U.S.-China trade war could be good for Beijing
The opening salves of the trade war between the United States and China were eye-catching, and as the battle continues, a rift between the two countries could be an advantage for Beijing in the long term, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump fired his first shot this year taxing key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The battle escalated this week, with tariffs on items worth over $200 billion, which in effect means that half of all goods from China to the United States are taxed.
Beijing has taken home and set tariffs of between five and ten percent on US goods worth $60 billion.
China has promised to answer the United States for every shot they fire, and the second largest economy in the world is most likely not going to fail with the first.
To get Washington to quit, China must do as the United States wants, but to bow to the United States is too embarrassed for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing keeps its head cold, U.S. pressure can have a positive effect on the Chinese economy in the long term, by reducing the degree of dependence between the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could cause both economies to go under is more dangerous than people have dared to admit in the past," said Abigail Grace, a researcher focusing on Asia at the Center for American Security, a think tank.
Syria 'ready' for return of refugees, says foreign minister
Syria says they are ready to accept refugees who want to return voluntarily, asking for help to rebuild the country that has been destroyed after more than seven years of war.
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in the country are making progress.
"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and safe, thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists to regain normal areas.
All provisions are now in place for refugees to be able to return voluntarily to the country they travel to due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures that went beyond daily life and livelihood.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
An additional six million people in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian government is willing to accept assistance in rebuilding the destroyed country.
However, he stressed that they will not accept assistance or help with terms from countries that sponsored the rebellion.
Europe wins Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup when they beat the American team with a final score of 16.5 against 10.5 in Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost on European soil six times in a row, and they have not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown in that team of the Danish captain, Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn, reaching the 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who played most of the tournament, beat the ball in the water from a tee at hole 16, par 3, thus giving the victory to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari did well in all his rounds and became one of four players who have ever received 5-0-0 since the tournament started its current format in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was knocked out 5&4 by the player with the lowest ranking on the European team, Danish Thorbj<0xC3><0xB8>rn Olesen.
Dustin Johnson, with the world's highest ranking, became 2nd and 1st after Englishman Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
Spanish veteran Sergio Garcia, who has participated in eight Ryder Cups, became the most winning European with 25.5 points in his career.
"Usually I didn't cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a tough year.
So grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I am so, so happy to get the trophy back.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I could help," said an emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He passes the relay stick on to compatriot John Ram, who defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in singles games on Sunday.
"I feel a tremendous pride in beating Tiger Woods, I grow up looking at him," said Rahm (23).
Woods lost all four of their games in France, and now has a 13–2–3 I Ryder Cup score up throughout his career.
A strange statistic from one of the world's best players, who has won 14 major titles and is only beaten by Jack Nicklaus.
The American team struggled to find the fairway all weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who impressed with high-level golf throughout the tournament.
Jim Furyk, the American captain, said after a disappointing display from his team, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
There were periods this morning where we made it hot for Europe.
- Slash me.
The hat off for Thomas.
He is a single captain.
All of his 12 players played very well.
We're going to regroup, I'm going to work with the PGA in America and our committee for the Ryder Cup and move on.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be captain.
You have to take off your hat.
We were rounded up."
