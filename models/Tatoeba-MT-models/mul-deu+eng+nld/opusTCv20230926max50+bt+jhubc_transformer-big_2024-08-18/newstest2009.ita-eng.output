The Prague Stock Exchange at the close of the market had a negative collapse.
After the collapse of the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange restored the losses.
Transactions of CEZ stocks have reached almost half of the current daily trade.
Since the beginning of Tuesday, the Prague Stock Exchange has resumed from the collapse of the day before it was almost 6%.
Behind this downturn is the collapse of stocks on Wall Street.
Thus, also by us, there is a market reaction to the result of the House of Representatives vote in America, which refused to support the local financial sector stabilization plan.
Shares collapse in Asia
On Tuesday, stocks of the Asian Stock Exchange experienced a dramatic collapse, although the indices, however, during the day later erased some of the losses.
The Hang Seng Index of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange during the day cancelled almost 4%, but later also some of the losses stabilizing at 2.5%.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index, which follows the movement of Chinese stocks on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, fell by 3.8% while in Shanghai the markets were closed.
Shares on the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than 5%, but in the end losses amounted to 4.3%.
The Thay-Wan Stock Exchange, according to the local index, fell by 3.6%.
“The planning of the rescue action is uncertain and this will affect financial markets around the world,” said Joseph Yam, head of Hong Kong’s currency office.
Hong Kong, despite being part of China, manages financial policy on its own, so without relying on the Central Bank.
Hong Kong has interest rates at the same level as the United States.
U.S. lawmakers, according to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, should quickly return to dialogue and approve the proposal for financial support.
Otherwise, there is a risk that other countries will suffer the consequences as well.
U.S. Stocks Strike
The U.S. Parliament on Monday rejected the plan to support the financial system, for which $700 billion (almost 12 trillion Czech crowns) was to be allocated.
Lawmakers have thus ignored President Bush’s call to support the plan.
According to Bush, the plan would solve the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
U.S. stocks on Monday suffered a stroke and major stock indices recorded the biggest collapse in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones index fell by almost 7% and a similar collapse was last seen in 1987.
The index was already falling before the vote, but as soon as it was seen that the bill was not passed, it went into free fall.
Congress has conceded that the U.S. government can issue $700 billion to banks.
The top representatives of the U.S. Congress and President George W. Bush’s government have agreed on a broader form of an understanding of economic support for the U.S. financial system.
The vote on this will be at the beginning of next week.
U.S. lawmakers have broken the ice in the dialogue on approving the bailout plan in the form of economic aid to the U.S. financial system for a total of $700 million (almost twelve trillion kroner).
But it is not yet said.
Representatives of Congress, therefore, must define some details of the agreement before publishing the final form of the law and voting on it.
The financial system support plan will be discussed on Monday on the territory of the House of Representatives.
He told Reuters on Sunday, the chairman of the House Banking and Financial Services Committee, Barney Frank.
The Senate, according to some sources, could vote on the plan probably not before Monday.
According to the economists, the announcement that the financial plan will be approved should be the first and fundamental psychological factor that can awaken the financial markets.
Subsequently, however, there will be a return to reality due to the complexity of the mechanisms with which, in practice, to achieve the help of the markets.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
“We have taken a big step forward.”
"We have clarified our differing views on how the market stabilization package is presented," Democratic Nancy Pelosi told Bloomberg.
According to the same, the final vote could take place again on Sunday.
Delegates of the legislature met on Saturday and Sunday night with U.S. Finance Minister Henry Paulson to give final shape to the government’s financial funds.
These funds should be used to acquire non-transferable mortgage assets from financial companies, which lead financial companies to serious losses and endanger the stability of the entire system.
“We are fulfilling the definitive agreement of the plan that will work and that must also be effective in the market.”
“We need to move forward with the recovery plan, but I think we’re there,” Paulson said.
The Signal for Asian Commerce
The global financial crisis relies heavily on stock markets that are collapsing sharply.
According to Nevada Democratic Senator Harry Reid, lawmakers are thus trying to reach a definitive deal in Congress before Sunday.
They want to calm investors before trading on Asian financial markets, which are, in order of time, the first to influence the market on Monday following the decision of Congress.
But for now it is not definitively clear when the two Houses of Congress will vote on the law and even if negotiations can be stopped at the last minute on some issue.
Legislators hope it will be approved in the next few days.
But the law will still undergo many changes.
The total amount foreseen for support of the system must be divided into two parts.
The first $350 billion must be available as soon as possible, as President George Bush has requested.
But Congress can block the allocation of the rest of the sum in case it will have the impression that the program does not perform its function, blocking the next $100 billion and after the end of the 350.
Bush appreciated the progress in the negotiations.
Although the President may veto this decision, Congress may override its right to veto.
Despite these changes, the basic thinking of the program has remained, i.e. to get the finances to buy the passive mortgage securities, whose price has collapsed due to hundreds of thousands of Americans who are unable to pay their mortgages.
“We processed everything.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the law on Sunday and the Senate on Monday," the Republican senator said.
U.S. President Bush is also pleased with the progress in the negotiations.
His spokesman Tony Fratto said Bush was satisfied with Saturday’s positive move and appreciated “the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy.”
Restriction of Golden Parachute
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd, the main spokesman, said legislators have agreed on the responsibility of the financial program, protecting taxpayers from losses, closing the budget of cuts, splitting the financial plan.
The new law must also limit so-called gold parachutes for executives of companies participating in the program and is setting up a committee that will control the funds.
These should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
“We have worked very hard and we have taken a big step forward towards the agreement that will work and will be useful for the market and also for all Americans,” Paulson said.
The plan counts on helping homeowners who have problems with payments.
The government should negotiate the new mortgage rates it will buy with the goal of lowering monthly expenses on the rates for debtors and allowing them to keep their homes.
Marek: psychological support
The proposed plan is, according to the main economist of Patria Finance, David Marek, a good idea but its implementation will be very difficult.
"And that's because we don't know how and at what price problematic assets will be purchased.
This will determine how the losses will be divided between the financial sector and the government," Marek told iHNed.cz this week.
Whether the plan will be approved now or at the beginning of next week is not, according to Marek, so fundamental.
“Much more importantly, this week Congressional representatives will come to an agreement on the support of this plan and baptize it as soon as possible.
The psychological significance of this agreement that will be approved is more important at this time,” Marek said.
Duel to the Last Blood: MP3 Players Against Cell Phones
We will advise how to choose
While almost every cell phone can read MP3 files, no MP3 player can make a phone call.
From this it is clear that it is better to buy only the phone.
Nevertheless, there are many reasons why you should get a standalone reader.
The choice depends entirely on the way of use and the needs of the future owner.
Maybe you could hardly buy an expensive high-quality turntable to listen to Maxim Turbulenc's latest album.
First of all, these music products do not come out as LPs and from a qualitative point of view there is no objective reason for this.
But if your shelves are crowded with hard-rock, jazz or blues vinyls, at least you dream of a turntable like that.
It also works with portable music, i.e. compressed music or simply in MP3 format.
Here, too, there are price and quality categories.
For some it may be unacceptable to spend for a reader 8,000 crowns, as well as a fan of Pink Floyd perhaps hardly digests the headphones from the twenty-crown market.
Two extremes between which there is enough space for everyone.
The choice is wide.
The decision is the battery life.
Some high-quality music players are able to do much more than just read music, but they don’t even do cell phones by mistake.
There is no other current device as universal as the mobile phone.
In addition to the primary functions, phone and text, it can read music and videos, record both and has a camera, sometimes better worse and maybe even navigate.
And if we take smartphones and palms into consideration, you will also have a miniature computer in your pocket.
It’s a little miracle that no refrigerator can grill and no TV can photograph anything.
The universality of the cell phone also brings disadvantages.
The more functions you use on the mobile phone and before the indicator on the screen will require the charger.
Reading music consumes a lot of energy.
Few mobile phones can read music for more than twelve hours, usually, and much less.
In this sense, music readers (especially the simplest ones) are much more effective.
As for cheap mobile phones, don’t count that they can last for more than a few hours.
If you still add us, from time to time, some calls, get another charger at work for safety, this also applies to the most expensive appliances.
But you won’t have this problem with an MP3 player, even the worst ones last at least 9 hours at continuous functionality with a recharge.
Another problem occurs when you download music to your mobile phone.
Unfortunately, only a limited number of devices have a universal USB port and not all of them can be connected to the computer without special software.
Sure, the music can be recorded directly on the memory card, but only a few memory players are able to do it without an adapter for the minicards that are not used in mobile phones.
Players, with some exceptions (iPods) do not need any special software.
Simply fill the device with music via USB from the computer.
Most mobile phones and readers create a media library by themselves, sorted by the performer's name, album name, genre, or user's classification.
Some devices only reproduce the tree structure of folders, similar to the Explorer tool in Windows, and some know how to do both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smartphones with operating system).
Readers are easier to handle, mobile phones can do more.
When choosing a particular device, you are especially interested in the battery strength, memory capacity, quality and type of audio outputs and clearly the ease of use.
If you need music mainly as background and if you listen to it every day only briefly on the tram, you just need a mobile phone that reads MP3.
This can be done now, clearly on any cell phone.
You don’t have to worry too much about which formats your mobile phone or reader recognize.
The MP3 players support them all, the global majority of the music that comes to you will be in this format.
In addition to this format that belongs to the most common ones, the total majority of devices support music in WMA format.
There is less AAC (the format used by Apple and its iPods).
The best mobile phones also allow, for example, to buy music online.
Just visit, through the mobile internet network, the corresponding pages of the operator (or another provider) and buy the song or album.
This same service could already be a valid topic to buy a mobile-reader.
Unfortunately, the offer of operators is poor and is usually limited to only hits at the time of the radio.
The prices are not very low.
But it is generally assumed that this very mode of selling music (either via GSM, internet or wireless internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people always carry their cell phone behind them.
Anyone who wants to listen to something fluffy in their pocket while the MP3 player remains forgotten at home.
However, it also depends on whether you always carry behind the headphones or at least the wireless headphones.
If not, you can use the built-in player that almost every cell phone, but only a small portion of MP3 players, has.
Perhaps the biggest advantage of mobile-readers will, for many, be the price.
The cheapest ones usually cost less than 3,000 kroner.
For 3 and 4 thousand crowns you will already buy a very dignified walkman.
Usually, however, you will be limited by the absence of an entrance for common headphones.
The best and most technically equipped mobile phones and even with the 3.5 mm socket for common headphones cost up to 15,000 crowns.
On the other hand, the advantage of readers is, among other things, ease of handling.
The simplest ones are not necessarily the cheapest (see our choice) we really do anyone to handle them.
The minimum of functions, the similarity of handling once with the common stereo or perhaps the turntable, is obvious.
There is no danger of accidentally crashing the mobile internet network and consequently a giant bill for data transmission.
Which device to take
Even the cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for interchangeable memory cards (type M2, microSD etc.).
When it comes to the purchase of the respective card, you are included in the 2,000 kroner.
But be careful.
Basic models only support cards with a maximum capacity of 2GB.
Only the most expensive ones can be done with 8GB memory cards.
If you already have a mobile phone and want to buy an inexpensive MP3 player, take Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB) you do not have to spend more than 1,100 crowns.
If you are one of the most demanding listeners, prefer to take specialized mobile phones - walkman (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have individual keys for MP3 and the convenience of service so you approach the same MP3 player.
In this area has made more Sony Ericsson, which walkman cell phones have the same scale of use as MP3 players sold separately.
The MP3 players of the above brands provide you with the same service and the same price category up to 4 000 kroner, but with a greater memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery resistance (usually 15 hours, in line up to 35 hours).
The first virtual operator will reach the Czech Republic from this year.
Possibly
Perhaps the mobile phone market in the Czech Republic is quite mature and our operators offer virtually all services as their partners in Western Europe.
Here, however, something is missing – a virtual operator that forces the traditional ones to lower the price.
Maybe it won't be long.
The fact that Czech operators belong to the most expensive in Europe we have already written many times on Mobil.cz.
In the end, <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> also confirmed this, which noted that the price of SMS is higher than in the rest of the Union.
After the European Commission's latest steps in the regulation of roaming charges, perhaps a paradoxical situation will be created - for some customers of Czech mobile operators, SMS will cost less from abroad than at home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic remain so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, it lacks the competition that would really like to start the fight.
It may sound absurd, and here too we have three mobile networks and coverage far above 100%.
Mobile telephony operators, on the other hand, like to argue that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this sense, the head of the Czech Telecommunications Council (<0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>), Pavel Dvo<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xA1>k, has also often stressed that there is no place for another operator in the Czech Republic.
It is perhaps true that the traditional operator with its own network probably no longer has many possibilities. (By the way, it would probably be difficult to find other frequencies by now).
But there is still another possibility - the virtual operator.
It is precisely the entry into the market of virtual operators that has led to a significant drop in prices, to which traditional operators would have to react.
At the same time, even before sharks like Tesko Mobile and Virgin Mobile entered the market, similar voices sounded in Britain as we did.
However, it has been shown that the place for such operators is there and that they can be truly successful.
After all, we do not have to go very far.
In February of this year we informed you about the arrival of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland.
In just half a year, this operator managed to acquire more than 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest local operator.
At the same time, behind Mobilking is the financial group Penta, to which in the Czech Republic, among other things, U:fon belongs.
The advantage of virtual operators is the ability to focus on a much more concrete target group.
In order to be able to work effectively, that is, many fewer customers than a traditional operator.
They do not carry, i.e., relatively high costs for the creation, operation and maintenance of the mobile network.
So in the world, virtual operators usually present themselves at a low cost, offer low-cost calls and SMS, which is often in balance with the narrower offer of services.
For example, Tesco Mobile in the UK offers SMS that cost at least half of its competitors.
But as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows can be a pretty good move even betting on a target group not so long ago.
This operator is aiming to say so specifically about men.
“The real men choose the Mobilking operator they like and trust,” says David Seibertz, CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, which produces this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say whether we can claim a similar concept as in Poland.
Vodafone press spokesman Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD>: "The Czech market is relatively small for a fragmented approach, on which most virtual operators rely.
In addition, from the point of view of services it is relatively saturated."
In the Czech Republic there is no possibility, mobile network operators say
But it seems almost certain that if there will ever be an operator in the Czech Republic it will not be Mobilking.
“We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic the negotiations do not have many expectations.
The ignition of Mobilking will take place rather in other countries in our area," Jana Studni<0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1>, spokesman for the financial group Penta, told Mobile.cz.
So he indirectly confirmed that the current operators in the Czech Republic are certainly not very favorable to this idea.
Rather, they try to do everything because you do not create any potential competitors.
For some time he has not concealed his interest in starting a virtual operator, the GTS Novera group that would like to take another step to become a real competitor of Telef<0xC3><0xB3>nika O2 in the field of corporate customers.
“We have a great interest in being able to offer our customers not only fixed services but also mobile telecommunications.
And first you do better it is.
We have repeatedly negotiated this possibility with all Czech mobile network operators.
We have already managed to make progress in the negotiations with some of them," said Group spokesman Pavel Kaidl.
So maybe better times will come.
Unofficial information shows that the first virtual operator will probably have it by the end of the year.
But for now, around its creation, an impenetrable wall of silence is erected.
“At the moment, we do not believe that there is room in the Czech market for the creation of a full-fledged virtual operator.
The Czech market, unlike other markets, is very specific.
So far no subject with a complex and serious project has addressed us," Vlastimil Sr<0xC5><0xA1>e<0xC5><0x88> of Telef<0xC3><0xB3>nica O2 said in his statement to Mobil.cz.
Other operators also rely on the specificity of the Czech market.
T-Mobil press spokesman Martina Kemrov<0xC3><0xA1> adds in a rare agreement with the O2 statement: “For now we have not noticed any commercial projects that are vital and beneficial to both, on which it is possible to continue to build.”
He adds: “On the T-Mobil network, a virtual operator will hardly appear by the end of the year.
At this point, we will already have to have a concrete agreement on the table, so that it can be considered on the horizon."
Vodafone focuses its attention rather on achieving its own 3G license requests.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> adds: “We are open to the negotiations of potential virtual operators, especially in the area of cost-sharing and infrastructure.
We consider this, from the point of view of customers, the most producer.
Vodafone’s main strategy in this area is to find a partner to build a common network for fast mobile internet.”
Competent authorities - with accomplices
The attitude of mobile operators can be easily understood, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would lead to a decrease in prices and thus a decrease in profit.
Why then facilitate the rise of such a competitor?
The inconveniences surrounding the creation of U:fon testify that when operators hold on to something they know how to remarry on the same side.
Perhaps the great pressure was exerted against <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> in the period of creation of U:fon towards the company of T-Mobile.
This is evidence of public access information from <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>’s web pages.
But right now U:fon serves as an argument for which you do not accept the virtual operator.
Martina Kemrov<0xC3><0xA1> commented: “The competitive environment of the mobile phone market has been little further enhanced with the entry of the fourth mobile operator into the market.
With regard to the type of mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that the entry of another competitor would place high demands on him and above all on his services."
However, the attitude of mobile operators is quite surprising the complete disinterest on the part of Czech regulators.
It is not only the attitude of the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> that, unfortunately, in the Czech Republic – unlike Great Britain and other developed countries – has no competence to interfere in economic competition.
It belongs exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (<0xC3><0x9A>OHS).
This, however, with regard to the whole problem has taken its typical position.
"The entry of the virtual operator into the mobile telephony market would be possible after the conclusion of the contract for the rental of the necessary infrastructure between the mobile operator and the virtual operator.
No such contract has been concluded so far because the offer of potential buyers has probably not been interesting enough for traditional operators," said Kristian Chalupa, from the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS external relations section, in answer to our question.
Such a statement by representatives of operators may not be surprising.
Instead, on the part of the office that has to defend the interests of consumers and above all to take care of the fact that no one takes advantage of its position on the market, it is more than a delicate business.
Especially when Kristi<0xC3><0xA1>n Chalupa adds: “Overseas where virtual operators commonly operate, we can observe that their entry into the market has contributed to lower prices for mobile telephony services.”
But, of course, the pressure on the proper functioning of the market environment and the lowering of prices do not belong to the interests of <0xC3><0x9A>OHS.
Truly shocking in the whole situation is the almost exciting harmony of these three operators resulting from their reactions.
The question of whether it is really just a coincidence is on its own.
Just as the same price of gasoline for all gas stations is certainly the result of coincidence and competitive struggle.
“The section has found no evidence of anti-competitive behaviour in this regard and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
No trader has a dominant position, so it has no corresponding greater responsibility for its market behavior.
The necessary tools for opening the mobile network market for virtual operators may also be missing from the telecommunications regulator,” Chalupa said in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position in the market is one of the many controversial points.
Of course, there is the analysis of the relevant markets developed by <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>, according to which telecommunications is the only market from the point of view of economic competition.
On such a market, of course, no Czech trader has a dominant position.
But some legal experts offer another approach – for the creation of a virtual operator it is always necessary the agreement of the network operator.
And the mobile operator has, logically, the monopoly of its network.
So for a certain portion it must be dominant by force.
But even if we do not admit this argument, for <0xC3><0x9A>OHS it should be a minimum warning that three mobile operators proceed in such a strangely similar way.
At the same time, complaints by interested parties (including the mentioned company GTS Novera) show that during negotiations with all operators they encounter very similar obstacles.
Downloading responsibility to <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> in telecommunications is a fairly frequent trick with which <0xC3><0x9A>OHS is kept out of the whole thing.
We have already seen this in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, it was not possible to promote the expansion of <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>'s rights in the field of economic competition in telecommunications until the recent update of the Telecommunications Act, despite the fact that many experts expected the situation to improve.
This fact the representatives of <0xC3><0x9A>OHS must know more than well, but perhaps their interests are elsewhere.
You can do it when no one is looking
While without us noticing it, the operation of these pseudo-virtual operators, of which there are even some in the Czech mobile networks.
These are companies that publish their own price lists of mobile telephony services, but they are only partially public.
These are usually companies that are engaged in multi-level marketing.
Thus, for example, Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and a number of others offer their own mobile telephony services.
The price lists of these companies usually reach only the predetermined people.
The magic lies in the fact that the company vis-<0xC3><0xA0>-vis the operator appears as a classic business customer, who orders a large amount of SIM card.
As an important customer, he then receives special price offers (and more).
The problem is that the commercial conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit a similar pre-sale.
"If there were the cases you are talking about, which we will be interested in, it could be a violation of the contractual conditions, and could result in the conclusion of cooperation with such a company," Martina Kemrov<0xC3><0xA1> replied to the question in question.
But it is quite unlikely that such an activity would not reach the ears of those responsible for mobile operators.
Especially in the cases of the 3 mentioned companies it can be thousands of customers.
No operator defends himself at the same time from such an attitude.
From the business of these companies they make a non-indifferent profit and at the same time - unlike the real virtual operators - they are not damaged in any way with their official marketing.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> warns of possible problems: "The law allows for such speculation, but only a negligible percentage of customers use the services of these companies.
These must also accept that the SIM card in their phone is not registered in their name, so they cannot fully dispose of it as the usual customers of mobile operators "
But this should be a strange minimum at <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>.
In addition, another question opens up for <0xC3><0x9A>OHS.
If mobile operators close their eyes to such an attitude, why do they block the creation of the virtual operator?
It is necessary to add that <0xC3><0x9A>OHS has strong enough rights to expose similar activities and if it does not want you will not have to be satisfied with the explanation of operators who have no idea of all this and that their commercial conditions prohibit it.
When we won't be more expensive
As has already been said several times in the text, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market has led to a significant drop in prices for services.
At the same time, in virtually every country where operators were born, traditional operators were more or less trying to prevent their creation.
The topics they used were virtually identical - too small market, too saturated limit, problems with the quality of services etc.
But in developed countries precisely in these cases, regulators intervened to defend not mobile operators but their customers.
Both with formal measures and non-formal pressure, then came to the creation of the first virtual operator and he got others.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory bodies throw from one to the other the whole case like a boiling potato.
In our experience we cannot get rid of the feeling that the lack of clarity of skills in these cases makes him more than comfortable.
But let's not throw the sponge away.
If the background information is correct and the virtual operator will appear really soon from us, the Czech mobile market will get back on track.
If one of the operators had consented to the creation of a virtual mobile operator only hardly <0xC3><0x9A>OHS could remain impassive to the rejection (discrimination) of the other interested parties.
And perhaps we will stop calling at higher prices than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best one
Listen to the four new versions of the Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek on the occasion of the Day of Recognition of the Czech State presented in a solemn manner the new recordings of the national anthem "Kde domov m<0xC5><0xAF>j".
The new recording of the anthem was made by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> B<0xC4><0x9B>lohl<0xC3><0xA1>vek.
There are four versions available – solo with male or female voice, chorus passage and instrumental edition.
The song is directed by Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Kn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD>nkov<0xC3><0xA1> and Adam Plachetka.
The authors of the hymn revisions are Otakar Jeremia<0xC5><0xA1> and Jaroslav Kr<0xC4><0x8D>ek.
On iHNed.cz you can listen to all four versions.
B<0xC4><0x9B>lohl<0xC3><0xA1>vek considers the Czech national anthem one of the most beautiful anthems.
Already before, he told the radio "<0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xBD> rozhlas" that he chose specifically to sing the variants alone, the singers with the young voices most representative, which are expressive and popular.
“From the beginning, I tried to make sure that both of them and the choir have clear diction, that the text is understandable, that they are in harmony,” he said.
Then the national anthem will celebrate next year the 175th anniversary.
The song "Kde domov m<0xC5><0xAF>j" was first performed in 1834 on the stage of the Stavovskéh theatre in Josef Kajet<0xC3><0xA1>n Tyl's original Fidlova<0xC4><0x8D>ka opera accompanied by the music of Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek <0xC5><0xA0>kroupa.
It has gained popularity and people have spontaneously made it theirs.
The first verse of the song after the founding of Czechoslovakia in 1918 then became the natural part of the national anthem.
It remained one of the seven national symbols even after the birth of the autonomous Czech Republic.
How does the "new" anthem sound?
The MHD Wednesday in Prague will accompany you for the first time with an electronic card
Wednesday, October 1, 2008 will be written in the history of the Prague Transport Company as the date when in the metro, tram and bus will be the first passengers who instead of the paper ticket will have an electronic card in their pocket.
At the moment if you can get it about a hundred thousand people who own their Opencard card.
Passengers can purchase the 30-day and 90-year ticket (which will be valid from January 1, 2009) and at the same time have their card reloaded at the Infopoints and the offices of the Transport Company and at the metro station Muzeum, M<0xC5><0xAF>stek, N<0xC3><0xA1>dra<0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD> Hole<0xC5><0xA1>ovice, And<0xC4><0x9B>l, Roztyly, Ra<0xC5><0x88>any, Letty<0xC5><0x88>any.
The cuts can be purchased from yesterday on the Internet at the website of the Transport Company www.dpp.cz.
More than 400 customers took advantage of the service before the afternoon.
Those who will start using the service via the Internet can completely forget the counters at the metro stops where they had to make long rows for paper tickets.
The cutting is purchased via the Internet and recharged on the Opencard at one of the twelve branches of the Municipal Library.
“In these places, passengers have a staffed gate at their disposal that will help those interested in buying on the internet and will also record on their card the credit acquired,” said project spokesman Martin Opatrn<0xC3><0xBD>.
In addition to the libraries it will be possible to load the electronic cutters on the Opencards in ATMs and self-service that are installed at the entrances of the metro.
How are these ATMs?
They are red, they resemble the obliterators of the tickets and passengers have already noticed them at the metro stops Roztyly, Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovick<0xC3><0xA1>, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavsk<0xC3><0xA1>.
"There are now five in the whole city but by the end of the year there should be eighty," Opatrn<0xC3><0xBD> concluded.
The cutting will be controlled by the ATM instead of the driver.
The ATM service that will work from tomorrow is very simple.
Just insert the Opencard card and after pre-payment of the cut, it will be charged on top.
Electronic cards are valid from tomorrow not only in the capital but also in its surroundings.
That is, in the urban lines of trains and buses from 300 to 499, which the inhabitants of the municipalities of central Bohemia take to reach the capital.
"In the trains added to the integrated transport of Prague there are controllers equipped with card readers with which they verify the temporal and zone validity," explained the method of checking the Filip tickets by the organization Ropid, which sets the schedules of the public transport of Prague.
Urban buses have card readers integrated in the driver’s cab.
During the climb it is therefore necessary not only to show the magnetic card to the driver, but in addition to supporting the Opencard at the specified point next to the box.
Thus, the driver checks the validity of the charged cutters.
"If the passenger needs to verify the validity of the loaded cutters, there is nothing easier than asking the driver for this type of information," Dr<0xC3><0xA1>pal added.
Passengers who take the city buses and will not remember, when the cut expires, they can again go to the self-service ATMs, where the cutters are loaded on the card.
Here you will see information about the validity of their documents on the screen of the device.
Sudeten Germans Want a US Referendum
The Sudeten Germans in 1945 asked to include <0xC5><0xA0>umava in the United States.
This is the result of the letter deposited in the Scientific Library of South Bohemia.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live at least under the patronage of the United States.
With this desire, according to what is said, some Sudeten German groups turned in 1945 to the President of the United States.
This is the result of the letter kept in a private archive and today deposited in the Scientific Library of South Bohemia.
<0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xBD> Krumlov’s Germans in the letter to the US president ask not to allow the return of the “<0xC5><0xA0>umava district” – occupied by Hitler under the Munich agreement – to Czechoslovakia.
"We understand the situation and want to be sure of the promises that American units will arrive on German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," the letter reads, "The people who hold the fate of <0xC5><0xA0>umava with all their heart."
Because, they say, the annexation to Czechoslovakia – knowing the Czech national character – gives the Sudeten Germans hope only for the brutality, the lack of regard, the misunderstanding, the oppression and the slavery, the authors of the letter now always pray the American president to take over.
“We cannot believe that without regard for the opinion of a quarter of a million inhabitants, you would recognize this territory as a foreign state to us, which oppresses and eradicate ethnic minorities and has not contributed at all, for nothing, to the victory of the Allies,” the letter reads.
The reason why the authors cannot sign it is the alleged fear of the thirst for revenge by the "Czech oppressors".
If the president of the United States were to doubt the German conviction of <0xC5><0xA0>umava, it would suffice to organize in the district a referendum on the will of its inhabitants to become part of the United States or live under the domination of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may seem naive with our knowledge of post-war history, according to some witnesses it appropriately describes the expectations of the Germans of the Sudetenland at the time.
Although the Czech Germans had to at least imagine that it would be their removal from the republic, only a few of them fully admitted such a possibility.
Some expected the United States and Britain to negotiate some sort of autonomy for the peoples of the Sudetenland.
Others believed that they would simply remain in Czechoslovakia.
This is also confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice.
He was mobilized during the war as a German of Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice in the maritime power of the Baltic Sea.
When at the end of the war he was captured by the British and put in the prison camp at Hol<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC3><0xBD>n, dozens of other Czech Germans went to see him for him to teach him Czech.
"They thought that once they came home the Czech would make him comfortable," Chalupa said.
None of the German prisoners who lived in Czechoslovakia before the war, according to him, relied on the fact that on the basis of Bene<0xC5><0xA1>'s decrees they would be moved from the Republic.
Don't think - you'll pay!
The emotional campaign will attack the drivers
The most expensive action in Czech history aimed at road safety.
Even so, it could be called the emotional media campaign, which the Ministry of Transport intends to leave on Wednesday.
Minister Ale<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0x98>eb<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek’s office expects this to discourage drivers from dangerous driving behaviour.
The campaign of 150 million will appear on television, radio, cinema, the Internet, but also on flyers.
It should discourage drivers from driving fast and under the influence of alcohol while driving.
And also remind him to put on his belt before he leaves.
It wants to touch in the consciousness especially young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and not least professional drivers.
What will appear in the spots?
Especially the stories of people who will affect emotions.
And this is also evidenced by the "bloody" slogan of the entire campaign:
Don't think - you'll pay!
The word "don't think" is written in capital letters on the plaque.
And in a pot of blood there is the word "pagherai".
This must symbolize that a person can in a moment of distraction pay with his life.
The spots will "sleep" viewers until 2010.
The Ministry has been inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where you can commonly see images with dramatic scenes of the victims of accidents.
It promises to reduce the number of accidents and deaths on Czech roads.
The spots were prepared by the Euro RSCG agency.
Cart and sticks to the drivers
"With drivers, the carrot and stick system works.
The carrot for them is for example when they pass with the red and thus save time.
The stick is the danger of a fine or accident.
You have to remember the risk to the drivers," says the psychologist of the Ministry of Transport Martin Ko<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xA1>n of the hospital Na Homolce.
And that’s why we need information campaigns in the press and above all negative advertising, the psychologist believes.
According to him, the panels warning drivers of the danger are already less effective.
"If the fixed warning panel has been installed, it will probably soon be confused with the environment and drivers will no longer pay attention to it," Ko<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xA1>n warns.
Olmert would return almost all occupied territories in exchange for peace
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert expressed his support for the restitution of virtually all occupied territories in 1967, including the borders of Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace between Palestinians and Syrians.
So he said in the dialogue he published Monday, the daily Jediot Achronot.
“We need to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all (occupated) areas, if not all of them,” Olmert told the newspaper.
“We will retain a certain percentage of these territories but we will have to leave the Palestinians the same percentage [of the Israeli zones], because without this there will be no peace,” he added.
He admitted that the possible restitution would also include East Jerusalem.
"He who wants security in Jerusalem and above all does not want the snails or the spies to pass him on, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up part of Jerusalem," Olmert noted in the note of the two July attacks in the city, during which people were wounded and some were injured.
According to the prime minister, it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Temple Mount, the sacred and historic places," which are within the Old City.
“Whoever wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This will not work," he also stressed.
Retreat from the Golan Heights
Olmert also voiced his support for Israel’s withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which he believes is a necessary condition for the conclusion of this peace agreement with Syria.
But that would also require a certain effort on the part of Damascus.
"I do not propose peace with Syria solely on the basis of the withdrawal from Golan," he warned.
"The Syrians know very well what they will have to give up to get the Golan Heights.
They will have to give up the current relationship with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship with Hezbollah (the Shia movement); they will have to give up the permanent support, which they offer to Hamas terrorism, (the Shia movement) of Al-Qaida (the prime ministerial network) and jihad in war.
Questions after the incident: Are stewards on buses illegal?
The law doesn’t recognize them, you can’t walk on a long-distance bus
In the context of the tragic incident near the Italian city of Padua of the bus company Student Agency came out the question whether the stewards and passengers can move on the bus during the race.
“If we want to strictly and formally comply with the laws, the steward’s activity is in conflict with the law of road traffic,” said Transport Ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka.
Last week’s crash that killed a 22-year-old hostess was caused by a truck that cut the road to the bus.
Unfortunately, the girl was sitting next to the driver on the less secure spot of the bus, despite the fact that there were still two other seats assigned.
But the bus can make an accident or slow down abruptly even at the time of distribution of coffee or newspapers.
Depends on whether the bus is equipped with standing seats according to the circulation booklet.
If it is not approved, passengers must be seated.
The buses of Student Agency have no standing places, the director of the company Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura confirmed on the website Aktu<0xC3><0xA1>ln<0xC4><0x95>.cz.
“We evaluated this with the Ministry and at first it did not allow the movement of passengers on the bus.
After it was revoked and we concluded that passengers can use the toilet during the race if they have the seat assigned,” he said.
The law does not recognize the steward.
“There is no clear legal interpretation of the steward’s role – no law deals with the regularization of this role.”
However, no regulation prohibits the carrier from performing the services.
The law of road traffic recognizes only the accompaniment of the vehicle, its rights and duties are not defined,” Hanzelka added.
The director of the Department of Road Traffic of the Ministry of Transport Josef Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD>, on the other hand, believes that the law takes sufficient care of this problem.
It depends on whether the bus has approved standing positions.
Everything here," he says.
It categorizes buses in urban areas where there are standing places and the maximum speed is limited, interurbans with standing places with higher maximum speed and long distance without standing places with the maximum speed allowed and seats equipped with seat belts.
Just like on a plane, says the expert.
BESIP road safety expert Jaroslav Ho<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>n does not find the underlying problem in the movement of stewards on board the bus.
"During a quiet run there are not many dangers, the situation can be compared to service on airplanes.
It’s not even safe there when there’s a turbulence and the flight attendant can hit the head.”
“If the bus makes a sudden stop, of course, the laws of physics are valid.
Same as in the city bus or on the tram.
The carrier must solve the safety of stewards with an internal regulation," he says, and also means that, from the point of view of the law, the problem is not solved.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura is willing to suspend services.
Student Agency is the only transport company that offers the services of stewards.
It takes about two hundred of them.
Even after the accident, the director does not consider their profession dangerous.
“As soon as I have the feeling that I have to consider the steward’s profession as a dangerous job, I will abolish it.
Passengers can receive coffee and newspapers as they leave.
Costs will also be reduced,” he said.
The director of Asiana Alexej Litvin, who runs a fraction of the lines with respect to Student Agency, motivated the absence of stewards on his means as an interest in security.
“We don’t have hostesses, we’ve been against each other since the beginning.
Sooner or later it will end with a fatal accident," T<0xC3><0xBD>den.cz said less than a year ago.
There has been an immense tragedy.
In the accident of the line to Naples died a young hostess from the region of Plze<0xC5><0x88>, who had worked for the company for two years.
A Slovenian truck probably got out of the emergency lane without using the arrow and blocked the road to the bus.
The bus driver tried to avoid it with a sharp maneuver, but struck it with the right front.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura rejects the fact that the two seats reserved for the rest of the stewarts were occupied.
"It is not possible to reserve these seats in long-haul buses, they are inaccessible."
The company has in mind to denounce the driver of the truck.
The agency will not wait for the court’s ruling to pay the damages to the girl’s family, but it expects financial compensation from the culprit.
The revision of the law?
Not in sight
The revision of the law, on which a group of 30 experts from the Ministry of Transport has been working for more than a year, could lead to clarification of the movement of stewarts on board buses.
“But they have not achieved any concrete results.
They are not considered so much by buses, they are more concerned with the scoring system, maximum speed on the highway and mobile use while driving,” says expert Hor<0xC3><0xAD>n.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of the stewarts as a major threat to the safety of passengers," said Havelka, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Transport, who concluded that the control of the safety of buses is the responsibility of the police and the security offices.
Dusseldorf's hopes point to Frankfurt
There is no shortage of words in the letter of the director of WestLB addressed to the employees of the house.
In the letter published on Monday that it could form "the capital market center of the financial group of savings banks" through the unit meeting of the bank institution in Düsseldorf with the Deka-Bank in Frankfurt.
West LB would launch a “competent block” with lasting profits in such a company.
In addition, any such union could be a decisive push for further ties in the banking sector of the Länder.
Thus it is read, when a board of directors in difficult times wants to demonstrate the ability to act.
Because the WestLB sufferer is still under strong pressure.
Not only on the part of the EU Commission, but also through the National Financial Supervisory Service, having pointed out long ago to the regional government of North Rhine-Westphalia that time is squeezing in search of a future solution.
The links between the Deka-Bank, which the customers of the Savings Banks themselves are already familiar with because of their investment funds, and the WestLB has certainly been talking about for quite some time, even from Frankfurt.
In late August, the head of the Deka-Bank Franz Waas reported at the time of the presentation of the first half of the year's turnover that a merger of the house at via Magonza with a national bank such as Helaba or West LB made no sense.
But the Deka’s board of directors, which is halved by regional banks and savings consortia, delegated the board of directors to hold talks with West LB on joint negotiations.
It could be market negotiations or parts of them.
But the conversations, as they say in business square, have just begun.
The Deka-Bank, with its 3,000 employees, is one of the most important in Frankfurt, not the first time when it comes to consolidating the savings bank sector.
In 2003, for a short period it seemed that the Deka-Bank could merge with the regional bank of Rhineland-Palatinate and Helaba.
Nothing was done about this association of three.
As soon as the projects were published, the regional bank of Asia was opposed to the participation of Helaba.
The remaining two institutions have also proved unable to reach an agreement.
The regional bank of Rhineland-Palatinate instead went to the regional bank of Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart.
Yet they have always thought about it for a Deka-Bank merger with regional banks.
But in the end Günther Merl, chairman of Helaba’s board of directors, spoke out against design games to reunite with his house.
Apart from this, it seems that you create the cognition, that it is necessary to approach the different houses of the public sector.
Since the election of the Bavarian Parliament has passed, a meeting of the Bavarian Landesbank with that of Baden-Württemberg could first take place.
This is not good news for Helaba.
If the pressure for other mergers increases, the partners will be missing.
In the South there would now be the junior partner, although so far it has overcome the financial crisis much better than the houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
The association of savings banks Assia-Turingia, which participates with 85 percent of Helaba, set the chain at the meeting with the WestLB.
Only the NordLB will remain.
These geo-strategic considerations are just an account.
On the other hand, there is also the question of how to match the different business models of the individual houses.
In June, Merl noted that the decisive question, with which business model the future of regional banks would be assured, would not yet be answered by the German Savings Banks Association.
In the end, the division of West LB could also come out, which on the part of it is naturally not desired.
Thus the letter of the board of directors expresses the will to aspire in any case to a "general solution".
You will see how the reunification of the individual parties with the Deka-Bank will work.
The second weekend of the beer festival is dedicated to Italians
For Elena it is the first time, while for Luca it is the third or fourth.
This time Elena is present at the party as a companion, and so she says that everything is different.
Behind them next to the 5l barrel of the Kaiser brand stands a massive beard and shows to about 200 travelers what the deep tones it can produce from the throat.
Elena first gives Luca a treat and then a kiss.
They came from Bologna to Verona.
From here to the bus parking next to Porta Nuova station, tonight at 23.45 four couriers depart to Munich, Festa della Biera" , arrival expected at 6.30.
Three couriers are mainly reserved for Italians, in another they travel only Brazilians.
In a corner of the parking lot, the South Americans are singing with the flag in hand, having already celebrated during the night.
It’s so noisy, Marco says, that it’s nothing for Italians.
Marco who wears a long coat with fake fur lining and a pair of glasses with silvery wide steaks belong to him buses.
From 5 years go to the Oktoberfest, this year there are 3 tours.
The walk at night, during the day to the party, return at 22:30.
Overnight would only create unnecessary expenses, Marco says.
The cost of 45 Euro includes the trip, the welcome toast with the Kaiser beer, made according to the Bavarian rules of authenticity, the health insurance and the German guide – Marco attended a German course in Frankfurt.
And so at night the buses leave at the same time as the Brenner.
There's no beer yet.
Suddenly the silence falls on the bus, the travelers sleep.
Better yet, they will still need their strength.
Stops in Brixen and Holzkirchen, where other buses with Italian sign on the A9 motorway before Munich take a short break.
When, as expected, Marco’s group arrives at the parking lot near the Theresienwiese at 6.30, there are already about 50 more buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco explains the attack program for the last time.
First, put on the yellow hat.
On it on the left is written "Oktoberfest" next to the Internet address of Marco's travel agency: "Conocersiviaggiando.it".
Second: "When they open the doors of the beer tent it means to run!", quotes Marco in the early morning.
"Run!" Run and occupy the seats at the bottom of the tent.
"Not in front, otherwise we block, and not all the yellow beards sitting on the same benches, divide into tight space!"
The mouthpiece costs 8.25 euros, Marco screams.
And don't forget to tip.
"Prove to the security service, that we behave well!
As soon as you leave the posts, they're gone!"
Third: "Tonight at 10:30 p.m. we'll meet again here! Understand?"
He's already leaving for the party.
On the street one attacks as you follow away the yellow berets to the trees, to the street signs and even to a billboard of a large Bavarian popular party.
You want to be ready to fight the retreat.
It is the second weekend of the festival, known as "Italian weekend".
Exact data do not exist, we talk about 50 thousand, who leave to cross the Alps and invade the tendons, it is claimed that 10% of visitors come specifically from Italy.
The Munich police are reinforced with 7 South Tyrolean agents, Italian volunteers support the Bavarian Red Cross, which makes a statistic on nationalities, where Italians are at the top with 200 medical care in front of the English (about 60 medical care) and Austrians (about 80).
Especially loved by the Italians is the tendon of the Hofbräuhaus.
1. Sleepless nights for Hypo Real Estate creditors
The German banking system is relatively stable, Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück confirmed last week.
It is good that the politician used the word “relative” and also mentioned that the German banking sector is not spared from critical developments.
Because the crisis started on the weekend.
The real estate lender Hypo Real Estate, noted in the DAX, gets a billion-dollar loan from a consortium of German banks, to be able to protect against market turbulence.
An expert on the situation told Reuters on Monday, the support credits would reach up to 35 billion euros.
Hypo Real Estate only has to pay interest for the requested party.
Money comes from both private and public banks.
At the end of the day are the losses of the Deffa affiliate.
The state financier, according to a newspaper article, has refinanced itself in the very short term – which is no longer possible due to market mistrust.
In the first half of 2008, the bank’s reserves had decreased by 95% from EUR 2.37 million, while the share of equity also fell from 1.6 to 1.45.
Current income and net income from financial transactions had fallen to 0 compared to last year, profits from increases in both demand and certain actions as well as from the settlement of credit side-effects have fallen by more than 70% on the 5 million euros.
Only thanks to higher incomes from the return of subordinated clearing costs that come from both the restructuring of the former Depfa group and the repayment of interest according to the single text of the tax laws and the management of business for business consortia, the negative profit was 6% with the approximate1.
The former public financier after being privatized in 1990 was lost in speculation with commercial real estate loans, which were merged into Aareal Bank.
Since the income in the classical state funding was too low, Deffa has been more involved in infrastructure projects and in financing joint private and state investors (PPP) projects and has diversified internationally.
The Hypo Real Estate now has to amortize the value of the affiliate, which will have a fundamental material effect on the Group’s profit and loss account.
The fact is that the dividends have been cancelled.
By 2007, they had been reduced by 2/3.
Hypo Real Estate after the absorption of Deffa is an important state and infrastructure financier.
It is more dependent on refinancing on the market between banks compared to other institutions, because it has no trust deposits from customers.
Due to the collapse of the U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago the granting of loans between banks largely dried up, because banks are accumulating liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate annually requires for a portion of Deffa’s credit portfolio – about 50 billion – short-term refinancing.
According to the notice of Hypo Real Estate the group's financial need was covered by the credit for a certain period and the company protected from the influence of the mostly non-functioning international monetary markets.
From other sources it is felt that thanks to the money the refinancing is insured until the end of 2009.
On the contrary, HRE’s chairman Georg Funke said that the HRE group will not need monetary markets in the near future.
The Bundesbank and the National Financial Supervisory Service (BaFin) rely on the fact that the marketability of the HRE group is still ensured.
This is expected for the shareholders and creditors of the bank.
In view of the dynamics and impenetrability of the crisis, there will be no guarantee.
It is possible that the funding is not fully used.
But the opposite is also not to be excluded.
After Sunday night the bank to what it learned was about to fail, the momentary rescue failed to calm the spirits.
The share price fell 75% on 3.30 Euros.
Mortgage courses are pretty good.
While front-grade debts are almost immovable, deferred credit rates yield.
Particularly affected are the loans of the subsidiary Württemberg-Hypo, understandably dues with an expiry date beyond 2009.
Before the HRE loans seemed to be a speculative alternative investment, now their value must, after the strengthening of the crisis of the banks and the institution itself, that with the importance of the Deffa the crisis has overtaken, be considered dependent on the stability of the international financial system.
While the least-damaged central banks, governments, and banks are still ready, you can count on an annuality depreciation by the deadline.
Or it goes into effect, which no one dares to hope – that the financial crisis will be overcome within the next 15 months.
But regarding the information overturned due to the partial stateizations the almost certain probability has become a justified hope.
It will especially create long-term investors some sleepless nights with the decision whether to split from their commitments.
Short-term investors may conclude the reporting of losses for future payments of the surplus value compensatory tax.
Sylvana and the Bento-Box Secrets
When 16-year-old Sylvana Hiltrop, the first day of school, is due to show up at Tachibana Highschool, the girls start laughing: German is completely "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana knows the word already from Mangas-in the new Exchange Log tells of Japan.
The first day of school in Japan
How excited I was.
I also had the guts to go to school.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo towards Kawasaki and I need 40 minutes by train to get to Tachibana Highschool.
I had to find the road by myself and fortunately I didn’t get lost.
The beginning of the first hour of class does not seem to have been set as by us in Lower Saxony.
The students arrive slowly from 8 a.m. onwards, until 8.40 a short interview with the professor, the so-called "home room" begins.
But before the class started, it was up to me to introduce myself.
I’m not the kind of guy who talks happily in front of people, in front of a class of 40 schoolchildren.
Since I didn’t have the school uniform yet, I put on an old host mother’s skirt, along with a shirt, blue socks and black leather shoes.
Dressed like this, I sat in front of the cathedral and tried to pronounce well: "Sayonara Wo she Sylvana..." - my name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and celebrate my birthday in a week.
At the time, I was very happy that I had already started learning the language two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class whispered, laughed and made a sign and I continued to hear the word "Kawaii".
I knew this from my manga.
It belongs to the essential vocabulary of Japanese girls to survive and means "sweet, sweet."
Then I ran quickly to my place.
The girl next to me giggled, for her it was an honor to be sitting next to an exchange student
The rest of the lesson was quietly continued, but when he played the gong, I was assaulted in the true sense of the word.
They were all talking clumsy and laughing and drying me up with questions – then it’s really hard to understand Japanese English.
In the pause, everyone opened their Bento.
My host mother also made me the lunch basket- it's different from the boring German sandwiches.
I had risotto with spices, sausages, cucumber salad and algae, fruit and a kind of wrap with meat and tofu..
To be honest, I don’t even know what I eat in Japan.
Things look strange and have a completely new taste.
The fact is, everything is really good.
Maybe except the plums put under salt, brrr!
The Bentos are not just lunches in Japanese schools.
It sometimes happens that a girl gives a Bento made by herself, prepared artistically enough, with the hope of then getting to know the boy during recreation.
I read it in my Manga comics.
I'm really curious if you can find out.
"Why Japan?" my friends asked me when I told me that I would like to go to school in Japan for a year.
I always said:
"Because it fascinates me"
I have been reading Mangas for years now.
And to better understand the comics and the culture they contain, sooner or later I began to learn a little bit of Japanese.
I was completely convinced that I would come here once.
I am also fascinated by tradition, customs and customs.
They hold us here a lot.
On the one hand, Japan is a place of technology and latest trends - on the other hand: strict, disciplined and traditional.
Since everything is well organized, I’ve never felt lost, even though Tokyo is the largest city I’ve ever seen in my life.”
1. Rats also have feelings
A rat or a cockroach flee when they feel the danger. Meaning, do they also feel the fear?
The neuroscientist Joseph Le Doux is convinced that even many animals have feelings.
4. But how could we find out if, when they behave in our own way, they have our own feelings?
In the Internet newspaper "Edge" for a few years are published articles of famous scientists.
6. SPIEGEL ONLINE in a series presents choice answers to the question: "What do you think is true, without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have feelings or other states of consciousness, without me or anyone else having been able to prove it so far, since we cannot even prove that other men have consciousness.
But in this case, we must at least hope that all human brains have the same basic configuration.
9. As soon as we turn to other species and ask questions about feeling or consciousness in general, we enter an impracticable territory, because the base of reference does not fit.
When a rat is in a dangerous situation, it does the same thing as other animals do, i.e. it pretends to be dead, flees or attacks.
People behave in a similar way, from where some scientists understand that there is a comparable subjective feeling.
I don't believe that.
Two aspects of the structure of the brain make it difficult for us to convey our feelings towards animals.
On the one hand, the lateral prefrontal cortex is often connected with human consciousness, the associated circuits (this is due to its direct participation in short memory and executive and control functions).
In man this vast area is much more developed than in other primates and it seems that among other creatures it is completely lacking.
At least in those aspects of our consciousness dependent on the prefrontal cortex, including knowledge, who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, the basis is thus accepted on the premise that man differs even from other primates.
Another dramatic feature should appear in the way of speaking about man: since much of life is connected to language, it is often said to be related to consciousness.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
Though consciousness does not depend on language, it would influence it so that the animal’s awareness, as it is done, certainly differs greatly from the circumstances of our consciousness.
This is why it is difficult to find out how consciousness can be seen in other animals.
If it is not possible to measure it as an internal and subjective thing, in analyzing it through your experience because of the special hardware, their research will cause us great problems.
Most interpretations refer to the content of conscious experience, but apart from this there is another aspect of consciousness to which science would have easier access.
Animal consciousness processes could be analyzed without regard to their contents, and this is precisely what happens in studies of the short memory of primates, particularly the example of visualization.
So for this principle, which Christof Koch and Francis Crick follow, one goes first to the neural correlations of consciousness than to the causal mechanisms: both may be identical but not necessarily.
Interestingly, this principle also highlights the value of the prefrontal cortex for the implementation of the visualization.
What, then, is outlined for feelings?
I attribute them to the fact that an emotional system like that of fear is activated in one of its conscious brain activities.
What we refer to as “fear” is the state of mind in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its consequences, such as the reactions of the body) occupies the working memory.
In this way, the feelings are closely related to the regions of the cortex, which characterize primates and in particular the human being.
With speaking nature, subtle nuances of hearing are created, because with the help of words and grammar we can distinguish and categorize situations, to describe them to others.
Antonio Damasio, for example, believes that feelings result from more primitive activities in the body regions of the sensations of the cortex and the cephalus, similar to Jack Pankseep, who nevertheless focused more on the cephalus.
Since this network has not changed much in the course of human evolution, this could absolutely be part of the feelings extended to the species.
On a purely theoretical level, I cannot contradict it, but I find it indemonstrable.
Pankseep argues that what appears to rats and humans as fear is probably so with the senses in both cases: but how could it occur, if rats and humans experience the same thing when they behave in a similar way?
A cockroach in case of danger flees as if he too felt fear?
In my eyes, the mere similarity of behavior cannot yet prove any vital similarity.
That is, the neural comparison continues to help: rats and humans have similar paleoencephalics, cockroaches don't even have a brain.
But is the paleoencephalopathy responsible for feelings?
And even if it could be demonstrated for humans, how would one want to prove it in rats?
I think rats and other mammals, maybe even insects (who knows?), have feelings.
But I didn't know how to prove it.
And since their feelings are fundamentally different from ours (since human consciousness is based on specific circuits and language), I prefer to study emotional behavior rather than the emotional sensations of rats.
In any case, there is progress here at the neural level, provided that you give up the same procedure on rats and men.
As I don’t research language and consciousness in rats, so I don’t research their emotions, I don’t even know if they exist.
This may be considered myopic, but I prefer to take steps forward rather than continually knocking against a wall.
I'm, by the way, a practical emotional one.
UEFA President Platini: postponement for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Wasjunik said the preparations will soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government sees the decision of UEFA in Bordeaux as a demonstration of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organize Europeans with Poland," Wasjunik said.
“This is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun and there is still a lot to be done in both countries.”
Both host countries are on the roadmap for the construction or reconstruction of stadiums, roads, hotels and airports.
Eventually, the number of stadiums to be used for Europeans will even be reduced from eight to six.
“We can’t waste more time.
Now we have to work with the utmost speed," said the president of the Ukrainian association Grigory Surkis.
"Uefa will keep an eye on us all the time"
An even more radical step has been taken in Poland.
After numerous scandals, the management of the Polish association PZPN was suspended by the National Olympic Committee and replaced with the independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The committee met at the request of Sport Minister Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
It would pose “the serious danger that the PZPN is not able to operate according to the rules,” Drzewiecki told the Polish news agency PAP.
"In a letter we assured UEFA President Michel Platini that preparation for the 2012 European Championships will not suffer."
Numerous representatives of the first division only last season have been convicted for manipulation, in the end it was even necessary to postpone the start of the League at the last moment.
Dennis Quaid retaliated
She wanted to promote a new film, in an interview she talked about private and now she has a crush on the ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan has declared her former Dennis Quaid adultery.
He foams with anger and resentment.
“War of the Roses” is a retarded affair for ex-husbands Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their separation, the two Hollywood actors now quarrel with each other in a gruesome dispute – in public.
Meg Ryan in an interview with American magazine InStyle last week for the first time spoke about the reasons for the marriage's failure: "Dennis has been unfaithful to me for a long time, and this has been very painful."
The extent of the betrayal she would have known only after the separation.
The occasion for the “soul spoiler” was Ryan’s press work for her new film “The Women” – the story of an adultery is told.
The reaction of Dennis Quaid to his being publicly declared adultery husband was clear: he would be “unheard of,” the fifty-four-year-old told the New York Daily News, that “Meg once again repeats and reworks the story of our relationship.”
It would also be "deplorable" that Jack, the sixteen-year-old son they had together, is again "publicly remembered the pain and subverting, which a separation means to each child."
While Ryan is separated, Quaid is remarried and soon becomes the father of twins.
And so his judgments close with the arrow: "My life anyway goes on.
I consider myself lucky to have a wonderful family to which everything goes for the best.”
Prices for air tickets and hotels fall.
In the first half of 2008, flights and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, according to a current study, flights would be up to 50% cheaper
Flights and hotel stays have become again more affordable - this is the result of a study of the financial provider and travel American Express.
The company analyzed its booking data for the first half of 2008 and after a price increase in the first quarter saw a marked decline in the second quarter.
After prices on the hotel market have risen for years, overnight stays in many places have already fallen in price.
From January to March, prices rise in 41 of the 48 European cities still examined on average at around 6.9 compared to 2007.
However, from April to June prices were already 3.6% lower than the previous year.
The most obvious trend would have been in Paris and Rome, where travelers had to pay 30 to 37% less than a year earlier.
The American Express sees as the reason for this the weak dollar quotation, which would have led to a "warm desire to travel American tourists"
Financial centres such as Frankfurt and London would also be affected by the hotel price recession in a stronger way than industrial centres such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, hotel prices with an increase of 26.3% even hold the record in Europe
As far as flight prices are concerned, the trend in the first quarter is still up:
Due to the kerosene intake, Economy Class passengers had to pay an average of 7.1% compared to 2007, fuel-intensive long-haul flights would even be up to 29.2% more expensive
From April to June, the prices of Economy Class air tickets fell by an average of 12.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter, but in the first class and in Business the price changes were much weaker.
In Germany, prices have fallen even more sharply than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices had risen by 11.9 %, in the second quarter they fell by 23.6 %.
As for domestic German flights, according to the study, prices have even halved.
On the one hand, the reason for the fall in prices would be economic growth downwards, the company explains.
Demand in many segments of the air travel market has shrunk.
On the other hand, there would be increased competition pressure due to the open-air agreement, which liberalises air traffic between the United States and Europe.
A sign of the critical situation would be the suppression of non-profit routes at the airline, as well as the high number of airlines that in the first half of 2008 would have declared failure – only in Europe there were 24 airlines.
HSV beats Gladbach by 1 to 0
With a simple goal and methods, the Hamburg SV becomes the capital.
At Borussia Luhukay he still can't find a group of 11 that works.
Here Kristoffer Klein worsens the lucky landing for national player Marko Marin.
The Gladbach player first got into the game late and failed with a shot on the cross
His message was formulated with precision, he passed on his lips in a convincing way.
He knew he was absolutely right.
"We need the second goal," said Hermann Rieger in the hallway of the Hamburg Arena.
Not much had happened in the catacombs, the game pause was over and most were sitting back in their place.
Rieger has been an HSV physiotherapist for almost 3 decades, enjoying an even higher estimate of certain old players.
And so his warning found also listening in the high spheres.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol has annihilated and raised his thumb as a sign of approval.
Cornelius is the brother of the head coach of Hamburg Martin Jol.
His order must have played in a similar way: here is the second goal!
The change of position did not occur.
"It wasn't all nice to see here today," Marcell Jansen later admitted.
Bastian Reinhardt would have “wanted to be more relaxed.”
For the 1-to-zero Hamburgers have to thank Mladen Petric’s head-to-head (11) and the fact that many of Gladbach’s weak players couldn’t hurt Hamburg’s weak players.
"It was a dirty victory," Martin Jol said.
The SV Hamburg will be 121 years old this Monday.
Viewers have already celebrated before, on Saturday afternoon, themselves, the blue sky on the arena and the flickering ranking on the video screen, which legitimized their sports company as before the class.
It will be a birthday without a real party.
“We are able to put everything in place,” said Marcell Jansen.
He has the notion that the provisional table certificate is more indicative of the unpredictability of the championship than of the dominance of his HSV.
The team with its late new arrivals – the Brazilian Neves und Silva, the goalkeeper Petric as well as Jansen blown up at FC Bayern – slowly finds herself, but has not yet managed to shine.
“We need more atmosphere and more Dribbling,” Jol said.
After the defeat of the vote
There is fear on Wall Street.

Dark Matter Affects the Flight of Spacecraft
For years a mysterious phenomenon has created perplexity among scientists: dark matter influences the speed of space probes during the so-called Swing-by maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity may not be entirely accurate.
The Ulysses spacecraft has been flying through space for nearly 18 years.
Because of the fuel pipes that freeze quickly, her death from freezing is now on her.
Among scientists for years, a mysterious phenomenon creates confusion – the anomaly of the Swing-by
The Swing-by is a flight maneuver of space probes, with which they obtain additional momentum/spin/oscillation in the gravitational field of a celestial body, for example of Earth.
So the probes can save a lot of fuel.
The European-American research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical device as well as the Ulysses solar probe.
What has surprised scientists for years is that rockets do not behave quite as you would expect under the law of gravity.
In fact, there are irregularities in speed.
The probes suddenly become faster or slower.
So far, physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
The year renamed the Swing-by anomaly.
Some experts fear that perhaps even Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity, which describes the attraction force of matter with a curvature of space, may not be entirely accurate.
American physicist Stephen Adler of the Princeton Institute for Advanced Study firmly believes as before Einstein was wrong, and tries to explain the Swing-by anomaly by means of the so-called dark matter that astronomers have seen in the cosmos.
“Responsible for the anomaly could be dark matter that could also be very close to Earth,” he writes.
The existence of dark matter has only been known by space scientists for about 10 years.
There is obviously a force of attraction coming out of her, the effect of which on other celestial bodies is seen.
Instead, she herself is completely invisible, that is, she does not send or reflect any kind of electromagnetic radiation, especially any visible light.
According to scientists, dark matter accounts for at least one-fifth of the total mass of the cosmos.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
After 10 days in the hands of their kidnappers, the kidnapped tourists in Egypt would once again be free, as confirmed by the Italian foreign minister.
The kidnappers from Sudan had asked for several million euros in ransom.
In a shootout before the release, six kidnappers were killed.
Five Germans were kidnapped in southern Egypt.
Redemption negotiations are already under way.
The Germans are always on the lookout for the kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE describes the most important cases.
European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are undoubtedly free.
This was reported by Egyptian state television, Arab broadcaster Al-Arabija and Italian media.
Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release after the story of the Italian television broadcaster Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and other hostages have been released
We are examining their state of health," Frattini said.
The five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian as well as their eight Egyptian escorts would be in good health and safe, Egyptian state television reported.
The 19 members of an expedition to the desert are already on their way to Cairo.
The background of a shooting before the release of the hostages remains unclear: so the kidnappers after the indications of an Egyptian public security agent would be ready for the conclusion of the kidnapping, before the Sudanese army surprisingly killed 6 of them.
"The problem had been solved.
They agreed to a ransom,” the official said.
It would have been "still just a deal to take hostages" when suddenly "this surprise" arrived.
Sudanese soldiers in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt on Sunday killed six of the kidnappers in gunfire and captured two of them.
The kidnappers had demanded a ransom of 6 million euros from Germany; the money should have been handed over by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The newspaper "El Masri El Jom" reported in reference to a German intermediary, the release of the hostages would be delayed, because the kidnappers feared for their safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers wanted to release women as hostages after the ransom was paid.
The men would have to remain in detention until the kidnappers had had a safe escape route.
The German embassy in Cairo has refused to take a position on the report.
The abuses of the paternal "brought to suicide"
Years of abuse by the stepfather led to a woman killing herself, a court said.
Michael Trerise, 57, of Stithians, Cornwall, was jailed for 6 years after admitting eight cases of sexual assault.
The Truro Crown Court learned that he regularly harassed his daughter Stephanie Randle when she was between the ages of five and seven.
Trerise wrote in a confessional note: "I feel responsible for his death."
The court learned that Ms. Randle had committed suicide at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
When she was a child and lived in Coventry, Trerise harassed and bandaged her before having sex, while her mother was out working in a pub.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s, and he returned to live in Cornwall.
His daughter went to Plymouth.
But the court learned that Mrs. Randle, who had spent a lot of time volunteering at the National Trust, was tormented by the abuses that had caused her.
In 2006, Public Prosecutor Ramsey Quaife told the court that Ms. Randle's friends, who had been a very good surfer and cyclist, were "emotionally dead", and that she had "moved with life".
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
She is thought to have killed herself by suffocating herself with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle comforted his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a letter of confession that ended: "I bound her and bandaged her."
"I didn't sexually harass her.
I feel responsible for his death.”
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise: “You are an extremely strange fetishist, and for your victim it must have been terrifying, especially when he was only seven years old.
"This unpleasant saga ends with the victim taking his life.
Even harder is the fact that if he hadn’t done it, it would have been difficult for the facts to end up in court.”
I notice the effects that Stephanie’s father and mother describe having had on their daughter in these years.
"Otherwise, it was clearly probable that she was a promising and happy young man of success."
The officer who lost the data will be punished.
The Cabinet Office official who left top-secret documents on a train in June has to be indicted by the Official Secrets Act, the BBC learned.
The man was on his way from the Department of Defense when he left two highly classified documents on the train to Waterloo.
The documents were forwarded to the BBC before being handed over to the police.
It is the least delicate of the accusations made under this law and there is nothing to suggest a criminal intent.
BBC defense correspondent Frank Gardner said the move would come as a surprise to many in the administration.
"They will have thought that this was treated internally at the Mod and the Cabinet Office," he said.
The employee, who cannot be appointed, is about to be charged under section 8.1 of the act, the clause concerning the safeguarding of information.
The Crown Prosecution Service recommended that the officer be charged by the metro police because of the highly sensitive nature of his work.
The documents he lost contained assessments of al-Qaeda and the capabilities of Iraq’s security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was taken away from his home and taken to a hidden location.
Construction companies face the account of B&B
British construction companies could face an account of over <0xC2><0xA3>80,000 after the rescue of the Bradford & Bingley bank.
The government has given <0xC2><0xA3>14 billion to protect the deposits of 2.6 million savers from Bradford & Bingley.
Interest on that loan will be paid by all companies that take the money from the savers, including the 59 construction companies.
Adrian Coles, director general of the Building Societies Association (BSA), said it was “irritating” that companies and their members had to pay.
The <0xC2><0xA3>14 billion loan will eventually be repaid when Bradford & Bingley’s loans are redeemed.
But the interest that will mature in the meantime will be paid each year to the 700 financial companies that take deposits. But the interest that will mature in the meantime will be charged each year to the 700 financial companies that accept deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme confirmed to the BBC that the 59 construction companies would be included in that number.
It is irritating that those institutions that have behaved prudently... are now called upon to pay part of the account of those institutions that have been much less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
He said that every company had to pay in proportion to the deposits it had, and that companies among themselves had to pay 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that interest on the loan will amount to <0xC2><0xA3>450 million in 2009.
This means that companies will have to find <0xC2><0xA3>81 million to pay the first year of interest.
Adrian Coles, general manager of the construction company association, told the BBC that he believes it is unfair.
“It is irritating that those institutions that have behaved prudently in the home-recovery market are now called upon to pay part of the account of those institutions that have been much less prudent.”
According to the BSA, no company has failed since documentation began in 1945.
“We need to look at all aspects in the coming weeks to see what options there are to protect construction companies and their members from what could be a significant account,” Cole added.
The interest due in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September this year to the end of March.
In 2010 the interest of an entire year will be due and this could be almost twice as high.
Since construction companies are mutual organizations without shareholders, their members end up paying the account through higher rates or lower interest rates on savings accounts.
Milk goes up to 5 pence per liter
People in Jersey are facing the fact that they have to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy has announced that there will be an increase in the wholesale price of its milk for an extra five penny per litre from Monday.
It is the second price hike this year, after a two-penny hike in February, and comes after a search carried out by a consulting company.
Retailers have to decide for themselves if they want to download the price increase on their customers.
(DANILO) Before the February increase, the wholesale price changed for the last time in 2002.
Ex-Bangladesh Prime Minister's bail denied
A Bangladeshi court has rejected a bail request from former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, which means she could be arrested when she returns to the country.
Her lawyers said the court refused to grant her a bail for extorting 50 million taka ($729.700) to a businessman when he was a member of parliament.
The case is one of the many corruption charges we have against you.
Sheikh Hasina's longtime political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina's return to Bangladesh is scheduled for the next few weeks but his party, the Awami League, has called for the country's military-backed interim government to give them first full freedom.
Correspondents say that while she was going abroad for medical care on her word, it is not clear according to the terms of her release, whether she will be able to remain free when she returns to Bangladesh.
His lawyers say he will appeal to the Supreme Court against the order of the High Court.
“The High Court has rejected the bail request for Sheikh Hasina by claiming that she cannot have the bail since she is already abroad on word for medical care,” says her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
"We will file an appeal against the order of the High Court."
His lawyers explain that he needs bail to return to the country from abroad to prepare for the December elections.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return home after Oct. 17, a senior leader of the Awami League party said on Sunday.
She was detained last year after the government sided with the military force took power, but was released in June, to go abroad for medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia deny all charges against themselves.
Afraid of Afghan anti-polio campaigns
Nearly 200,000 children in Afghanistan are missing from the recent immunization campaign due to Taliban-related violence, the UN says.
The U.N. launched a vaccination program in six provinces last week.
But it is said that it cannot reach the children in the parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for security reasons.
A U.N. spokesperson said this was happening despite promises from the Taliban that they would not attack or hinder thousands of staff carrying the vaccines.
BSkyB loses legal battle with ITV
BSkyB lost its legal battle with the Competition Commission’s decision to force the company to reduce its participation in rival ITV television station.
BSkyB was told by the competition’s appeals court to cut its shares in ITV from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
Previously, the commission had said that BSkyB’s participation impeded competition and allowed unfair influence on ITV.
BSkyB acquired the stake in 2006 in an agreement that effectively blocked NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Office of Fair Trading reported that the acquisition of BSkyB's participation in ITV raised doubts about ITV's independence, prompting the Competition Commission to launch an investigation.
Virgin’s head, Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and Ofcom’s regulator opposed the purchase.
BSkyB argued that forcing it to reduce its ITV stake was unreasonable and a disproportionate remedy - particularly as BSkyB had said it would surrender its voting rights.
New investigation into U.S. prosecutor's case
The U.S. Attorney General appointed a special prosecutor to examine the dismissal of nine U.S. attorneys in 2006.
The operation took place when a report on the case by the Inspector General of the Department of Justice criticized the actions of administrative officers.
The report was critical of the White House, lawmakers and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was triggered by the fear that prosecutors had been removed for political reasons.
Special Public Prosecutor Nora Danney will now investigate whether officials questioned during the investigation lied to investigators in an attempt to obstruct justice.
“Serial charges involving potentially criminal behavior have not been fully investigated or cleared,” Inspector General Glenn Fine said in his report.
The assignment of a special public ministry with the power to compel witnesses to testify was one of the main recommendations.
The dispute began when nine U.S. prosecutors were removed from their positions by the Department of Justice in December 2006.
At the time, the department said the lawyers had been fired for poor performance.
But later it turned out that the dismissed lawyers had not been rated more sluggish than many other colleagues, leading many observers to conclude that the dismissal had been motivated by politics.
Some of the prosecutors had been involved in the legal action against high-profile Republican members of Congress, while others had refused to investigate the charge of fraud to the detriment of democratic voters.
U.S. prosecutors are investigating and proceeding to court on behalf of the government.
They can be fired at any time, but they cannot be fired for political reasons.
The then head of the Justice Department, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, was in the storm for dismissals, and finally resigned his position.
A number of other Justice Department officials resigned.
(The Inspector General’s report was very critical of Mr. Gonzales’ role in the case, saying that he had a primary responsibility in the dismissals, that he had abdicated from his leadership role and had been extraordinarily detached during the process.
Other officials, including former senior assistant to Bush Karl Rove, were criticized for not cooperating with the investigation.
The Meat Loaf epic will be celebrated
The rock star Meat Loaf is about to be honored at the Q Awards for his epic anthem Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will withdraw his special gold award at next week’s ceremony in London, said he was “honoured” to win the award.
The song, which lasted nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title track of the hit of Meat Loaf's 1977 album.
Coldplay will lead the nominations for this year’s awards, being on the list of nominees in four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said: "There are some songs that transcend things like time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is undoubtedly one of those."
The song, composed by Jim Steinman, required a strong vocality that was provided by the Meat Loaf.
It opened with an instrumental section that lasted almost two minutes.
The song was released as a single in the UK in 1979 and peaked at number fifteen.
But Meat Loaf's album Bat Out Of Hell remained in the charts for almost nine years and sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - real name Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered from health problems in recent years, including an intervention for an irregular heartbeat in 2003 after collapsing on stage.
In 2007, acute laryngitis forced him to cancel the concerts.
He later emerged that he had a cyst on a vocal cord.
Dark city streets, often forgotten and perhaps soon for sale
New York City has thousands of avenues, boulevards, streets and other crossroads, some famous, others merely of use.
But also many veteran taxi drivers and residents for a long time find it difficult to give the position of Extra Place, mostly because they have never heard of it.
The tiny street is in the East Village and goes north from the First Road – without making the Second Road – between Bowery and Second Avenue.
About 30 feet wide and 120 in length, it looks more like a dusty alley than an active traffic lane.
There are no road signs.
It is virtually impossible to see it on a normal atlantic.
The road, however, must have admirers.
For example, there’s Avalon Bay, the luxury building real estate company recently built on First Street.
You want to reopen Extra Place and create a cleaner passage for shops and boutiques that should open in new buildings.
Other admirers include long-time neighbors who say they were hit by the crumbling road simply because it was one of the last remnants of the gentlemanly neighborhood of the past.
But the city’s conservation and development department, which has road control, has no interest in keeping it.
During a meeting of the county municipal commission land use committee, some representatives of the city agency and Avalon Bay outlined a proposal for the real estate company to buy the roads.
But the committee prefers the road to remain in the hands of the city, and has asked for a new plan to be presented next month, says Susan Stetzer, the district director of the Community Board 3.
“There is very little space left to the city’s ownership, and we would like the city to continue to own Extra Place,” he said.
"There could be proposals to set it up and manage it, which could be done by Avalon, but we also want to ensure public access."
Avalon Bay announced many months ago that it wants to reopen the small street and install seating, including some to be used for a café the real estate company hopes to rent out the space.
The idea that Avalon Bay bought the road was made public for the first time at this month’s meeting.
Michele de Milly, an Avalon Bay spokesperson, said that although the company wants to use the road, it does not necessarily mean that it wants to own it.
"The main concern of Avalon Bay is to renew this abandoned alley and turn it into a public amenity," he said, adding that the city has suggested the sale.
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for Housing Preservation, said it was the city’s desire to sell the road and noted that the agency’s purpose was to develop the property rather than administer it.
Compared to its more colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place has left a slight historical imprint.
Some believe it took its name in 1802, when a large farm owned by Philip Minthorne was divided among his numerous sons and the narrow strip of land was not claimed.
The back door of CBGB, the punk rock monument that closed in 2006, opened on Extra Place, and the street is perhaps best known as the set for the cover photo of the Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia."
“The terrain was beautiful,” said Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones, who took the photo in November 1976.
"It was full of rubbish, flakes of clothes and pieces of barrels, posters, leaves, strings."
Some residents, including some bloggers who write of East Village’s “gentrification,” have opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, citing that the piece of public property, modest as it is, should remain public.
Others praised Extra Place as a rarity – a fragment of town for almost nothing changed that should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, who has a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitled, "The Book of Complaints: A Slightly Nostalgic Look at the Enduring City"), published part of a City History Speech that appeared on The New Yorker in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a sluggish street with no way out, dark even in the daytime and bordered doorways of rusty iron warehouses and windows with snails, with week-old newspapers rolling along the bottoms."
With a few exceptions, the road seemed almost the same as a recent evening.
A rat ran agilely through the back of the road near a door leading inside the CBGB, which is now the site of an aristocratic clothing store.
On the walls were graffiti and an empty 22-ounce beer bottle lying next to a group of abandoned fresh newspapers.
Few passers-by have said that they rarely thought of Extra Place but suggest that it would need to be a little bit beautified.
Mr. Fields, for his part, said that he also thinks some people underestimate the attraction of the road in its current state.
"The best years of my life," he said, "were in dark, dirty, disgusting places."
The bilingual debate: immersion in English
In this essay, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the position of candidates on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, a senior member of California studies and the senior director of educational studies at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of the book “Not as good as you think: Why the middle class needs to choose a school.”
To really attract Hispanic voters is a complicated business.
Barack Obama’s educational projects are a significant example.
Mr. Obama’s campaign notes that, “African-American and Latino students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students,” which is true.
To combat these shortcomings in achieving the goals, Obama’s educational plan specifically supports, among other things, “transitional bilingual education” for English students.
Yet the question for Obama is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which emphasizes classroom teaching of languages other than English, does not take into account his interest in filling the gaps in learning.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an elementary school in East Los Angeles County.
The school’s students are mostly Hispanic and low-income.
More than a third of students, many of whom have recently arrived, are studying English.
But, among fourth graders, an astonishing 100 percent of students took the upper-level test in the 2008 math state exam.
Equally astonishing 93 percent of fourth graders took the expert level test on the art-of-language-English.
This incredible result was achieved using a different ingredient than Mr. Obama’s favorite.
Sixth Street emphasizes rehearsal and exercise, constant assessment of skills and a “no excuse” attitude.
In addition, and it is here that Mr. Obama should take note, according to Linda Mikels, director of Sixth Street, the obstructive approach of the school for English students is "full immersion."
The use of English emphasizes the almost exclusive use of English in the context of education.
Ms. Mikels, who opposes bilingual education, told me, "We had a fantastic success with a student who just came from Mexico and if you were in class 12 months later you wouldn't have been able to identify which one it was."
"It works," he observed, "it works for us."
Would Obama model a school like Sixth Street Prep to replicate it in other Hispanic-majority schools and with English students?
The school’s findings make the answer to that question very easy, but the education policy in its own party (the National Education Associations is a long-standing supporter of bilingual education) and its own continued support of bilingual education prevent it from predicting Mr. Obama’s response.
While he agrees that immigrants should study English, Obama recently made the subject trivial when he said that people should stop worrying about “only English” legislation.
Instead, he said, "you have to be sure that your children are able to speak Spanish."
If Obama really wants to close these achievement gaps, he should carefully consider the educational models that work rather than despise or trivialize them.
Oil is falling sharply and economic fear is renewed.
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday due to concerns that even the U.S. bailout plan for financial markets may not be able to boost the economy.
The futures of the crude fell 7 percent to $99.80 a barrel on the New York Stock Exchange in the morning operations.
Prices have lost more than $20 a barrel since last Monday.
Over the past two weeks, the commodities markets have been shaken by the financial turmoil of Wall Street, and by a couple of powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After peaking at $145.26 a barrel in June, prices fell to nearly $90 a barrel earlier this month, before going back again against a backdrop of tremendous uncertainty in financial markets.
Anxiety affected investors again on Monday even after congressional leaders had said they had reached an agreement over the weekend about the bailout plan, the biggest in history.
The news has been obscured by fresh concerns that the financial crisis was far from over.
In the final episode of the progressive merger, Citigroup will acquire the banking operations of Wachovia Corporation, the government said on Monday.
At the same time, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalized the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Analysts at Barclays Capital said the hectic weekend negotiations had led to a bailout deal "seem to have failed to revive market sentiment.
As the economic situation worsens, demand for raw materials, including oil, is expected to calm down.
“The outlook for global equity, interest rates and exchange rate markets has become uncertain,” Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a note to investors.
“We believe that raw materials will not be able to escape the contagion.
From a raw material perspective, our most pressing concern is to what extent the American virus will spread globally and specifically to China.”
Bank analysts have lowered their expectations for next year as household oil consumption due to slowing economic growth, reducing forecasts on oil and gas prices by about 20 percent for 2009.
Exploit in the second quarter marks a team record.
After spending more time than anyone in the Jets uniform over the past eight or more seasons, defender Shaun Ellis thought he had seen it all.
Then he watched the second quarter take place on Sunday, when the Jets turned a pointless game into a rebound.
"I've never seen anything like it," Ellis said.
The second quarter began after the Jets and Arizona Cardinals had matched the graying of the menacing clouds that overpowered them with a fickle game.
Then quarterback Brett Favre found Laveranues Coles for a 12-yard touchdown, providing the perfect signal for an afternoon where their growing tune took a giant step forward.
Favre found Coles for two more touchdowns in the fourth, including one when a cornerback fell and another with 10 seconds left at the end of the first half.
"I didn't get out of my way," Favre said of all the steps he took to Coles.
He's a fantastic player.
Our communication was great, despite what people can think.”
While Favre and Coles were playing catch-up games, the defense heavily hit Cardinals quarterback Kurt Warner.
The cornerback Darrelle Revis intercepted a vacant pitch and relaunched it for 32 yards in a touchdown.
Security Eric Smith foresees another passage and intercepted it.
The linebacker David Bowens forces a Warner fumble.
The last turnover, the fumble forced by Bowens, may have been the most remarkable.
The Cardinals went ahead on that possession of the ball, with 10 seconds left, and after the Jets had picked up the ball with 10 minutes left, Jay Feely kicked a goal of 20 yards, with an edge of 34 to 0.
It was more than the Jets ever scored in a quarter.
When asked to describe the madness, Jets coach Eric Mangini said, "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
When he was told both - the Jets gave 21 unanswered points in the third quarter - Mangini said: "I can tell you I liked the second quarter much more than the third."
There have been a lot of points in a small amount of time.”
Gebrselassie rested surpasses its world record
Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia showed again why many consider him the best marathon ever, breaking his own world record at the Berlin marathon on Sunday and becoming the first person to run a 26.2-mile race under 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a win over the favourably flat run in 2:03:59, Gebrselassie sent his previous score of 2:03:26 last year in Berlin into the fray for 27 seconds.
At 35, Gebrselassie sets the 26th world record for such an amazing career that it has produced a world championship or a world record at every distance from the metric mile to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie skipped the Beijing Olympic marathon, fearing — perhaps too alarmingly, retrospectively — that air pollution would worsen her asthma problems.
Instead, he decided to run to Berlin.
In near perfect conditions - sunny and 48 degrees on departure, 55 degrees on arrival - Gebrselassie won Sunday with a blazing average of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
As soon as half-timers like Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat of Kenya have gone long distances, the marathon record has fallen by more than two minutes in the past decades, since Ronaldo from Costa del Brazil won in Berlin in 2:06:05 in 1998.
After Sunday’s victory, Gebrselassie told reporters that two weeks ago he had cramped his hips and missed a week of workouts.
Clearly, the rest left him fresh, not rusty.
"I'm so happy," Gebrselassie told reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I started over a week ago, and I had some doubts today, but in the end everything went well.”
He was a bit criticised – especially in Kenya, Ethiopia’s East African rival – for orchestrating his races excessively, generally avoiding many of the world’s top marathon stars, relying on approximate riders as if it were a half-back race, and placing world records above the sense of competition.
But these criticisms rarely diminish the size of Gebrselassie’s skills as a marathoner.
With four Kenyans cadenced on Sunday, Gebrselassie reached the halfway point in 1:02:04.
Two Kenyan elite riders, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, held Gebrselassie in competition after the riders vanished.
Just over three miles from arrival, Gebrselassie made a final sprint to separate from Kwambai, who finished second in 2:05:36, improving his best personal time by almost 5 minutes.
Kamathi came third in 2:07:48.
In the women's race, Irina Mikitenko, a native of Kazakhstan who is now a German citizen, completed a remarkable year by winning in 2:19:19, the seventh fastest time ever.
Paula Radcliffe of Great Britain holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, Mikitenko, 36, was a surprise winner of the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She lost the Beijing Games with what is described as a bad accident, but was healed to win in Berlin, making her best personal time of almost five minutes in the third marathon she ran.
She ran a race doing the calculations well, letting a quartet of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners leave with a big detachment, taking them back after about 18 and a half miles.
Ethiopia's Askale Tafa Magarsa finished second in 2:21.31, while Kenya's Helena Kiprop finished third in 2:25:01.
In a city apart, pride and processes of a black life
Hidden in the theme park on the outskirts of Orlando, a few miles from the splendour, the noise, the huge, lies the quiet city where the pride and complications of the African-American experience come into life.
Eatonville, the first all black town incorporated into the country and Zora Neale Hurston's birthplace, is no longer as simple as he described it in 1935: "the city of five lakes, three croquet courts, 300 brown skins, 300 good swimmers, abundance of guava, two schools and no prison."
It is now a place of pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the annual Zora! Festival in Eatonville to show their respect for Hurston, the most famous Harlem Renaissance writer.
Yet in many ways, the city he described – and that makes tourists stop by understanding it in Florida’s travel guide produced by the Depression-era Federal Writers’ Project – remains a place apart.
It is as independent, dignified and private as it was in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resisted sharing their thoughts with the white man, that "knowing so little about us, you don't know what you're missing."
Even now, in a year where a black presidential nominee, Senator Barack Obama, has been called for an opening speech on the race, many here remain dissatisfied with the look of the outsider.
“We are very careful about how our story is being told,” said Hortense Jones, 59, a lifetime resident and member of the city’s oldest church.
"It must be fair."
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and difficulty.
It is both a historical model of black power grab and a community of nearly 2,400 where the poverty rate is twice the national average.
It is a literary center but also an example in the shadow of the oaks of the rural culture of the southern blacks - sometimes disdainful, sometimes rewarded - born from American slavery.
Not surprisingly, the residents here are both proud and protective.
And the worry about Eatonville's imagination really started with Zora, who everyone here calls Hurston.
She introduced the world to her hometown through sincere, dialect-rich books such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs of Florida's guide transformed the city, just outside Route 17, a road running through Florida's often-forgotten center within a scenery of black history and human drama.
Low as a mess in both life and literature, Hurston brought readers to the store owned by Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then diverted to more private areas.
"Out of the road to the left," he wrote, "is the modern public school, brown with white finishes, with its well-kept gardens and courtyards, which Howard Miller always looked after, thinking he could barely read and write."
She also mentioned Dash's new husband and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of all kinds and whatever fits in the passage rooms."
So in just a few hundred words, Hurston connected Eatonville with self-government but also with illiteracy, second marriage and sex.
Clearly this wasn't Fodor's.
In fact, it was not a portrait that everyone appreciated.
"Zora was saying it as it was," said Ella Dinkins, 90, one of Johnson's girls who Hurston immortalized her by quoting men singing coarse songs about their beauty.
He adds, "Some people don't like it."
Hurston is still remembered here as a lively eccentric who often returned from his family moved to Jacksonville, Fla.
Augustus Franklin, 77, remembers that when Hurston was raining in the city, he usually arrived unannounced in a triumphant Chevrolt, smoking and wearing pants in a city that still boasts decent clothing today.
Many residents were fascinated, Mr. Franklin says, while others were sniffing.
“People were always very happy to see Zora,” Mr. Franklin said.
But, he added, waving on his patio chair on the back overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston most likely was baptized, "she never stayed long".
When Hurston died in 1960, he was poor and his books had gone out of print.
Along with the rest of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten it.
Although she was once a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes, and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in a plaque-free grave in Fort Pierce, Fla., where she had lived.
In Eatonville, there were no major commemorative ceremonies, and no major conference.
"I don't think they understand her contribution to the world or her legacy to everyone," said Valerie Boyd, author of Wrapped in Rainbows, a Hurston biography published in 2003.
A change took place in the 1980s.
Orange County officials wanted to place a five-lane highway through the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the main two-lane highway.
Orlando's expansion has already pushed Interstate 4 across the city's western boundary.
The proposal came when Eatonville was still recovering from a difficult period in its history.
Forced integration, among other things, had put an end to the relative idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the battle over racial mixing brought hatred to the front door of the community.
“During that period, a group of white boys came and threw oranges and stuff to the people sitting on one side,” says Mr. Franklin.
“In fact, we had a girl who was killed by that once.
They threw a cockroach out of a car."
In a 1955 letter to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston made a request to the Supreme Court for forced integration, defining his Brown decision against the school office as "an insult rather than an honor to my race".
Residents now say that the disintegration of schools, despite having been positive in some respects, dilutes Eatonville’s cohesion and threatens the confidence of its youth.
“Black children were used to being embraced — I remember this — hugging your teacher in the morning, hugging your teacher in the evening,” said N. Y. Nathiri, the daughter of Ella Dinkins and the executive director of Preserve the Eatonville Community, a non-profit group.
This lasted, he added, until teachers and students came from the same place.
"You didn't embrace your white teacher because your white teacher... - I mean, there's a cultural division there," Ms. Nathiri said.
Civil rights, however, helped and created space for many other Zora Neale Hurstons - black writer, actress and artist who overcame prejudices, as she did, with cheerful self-confidence and lines like: "How can some deny themselves the pleasure of my company!
I can't really understand."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker embarked on a long journey to Hurston's unmarked tomb and began to fight for the resurrection of her reputation.
Five years later, an acclaimed Hurston biography by Robert E. Hemenway hit bookstore shelves, reintroducing it back into the American canon.
The project of the highway came just as his most famous daughter had turned the lights on the sidewalk again.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a saviour.
The community began designing a festival dedicated to Hurston in 1988 to show what could ruin the state with its highway.
Thousands of fans came to the inaugural event two years later, and every January, many return for the commemoration.
Many years later, the state withdrew from its road project.
“The five lanes of the resuscitated highway brought what would be called high speed, a real pride for the city,” Ms. Nathiri said.
Mrs. Boyd makes it simpler: "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory over the highway project helped change the city’s image of itself.
Outsiders like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who began coming to church here in 1993, began to appear in large numbers, and residents began to reevaluate the past.
Eatonville was added to the public historical register in 1998.
A new one-storey library (called as Hurston, of course) opened in 2006 on a repainted and beautified Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains a Florida anomaly: just six miles from downtown Orlando, it can give the sensation of a secondary road under summer rain, as small as when it was founded with just 27 black families in the 1980s.
(It’s 90 percent black today.)
Outsiders who come to search for the history of Eatonville, for its meaning, are often still treated with caution.
A pre-requested permission is required for most of the interviews, to some things — like the murals on Eatonville’s oldest church, painted by a white man, who show black men in the fields — do not have permission to be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Ms. Jones, a fat teacher, with a weak for bright red, still fear that their island community will be misunderstood.
Yet, as soon as the Hurston festival expanded, a high level of citizen pride also emerged.
Young people, in particular, tend to see Eatonville with Hurston seeing her entire race: beautiful, problems and everything, neither better, nor worse and proud, creative, great worker, stupid and confused as other races and ethnic groups in America.
It’s heartfelt civic affection what can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin’s grandson, Edwin Harvey, 18, who plans to return to Eatonville after college to work in the local government or for the Police Department, who he said may need help.
And even those who are younger, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, 11-year-old twins from Winter Park, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
“A lot of people, if they’ve just come in here, will think, ‘Oh, this city is nothing compared to all the others,'” said Alondra Kenon after mass on a recent Sunday.
“But if you really stop and take a moment to look at history, it’s really a pretty city.”
Here in New York we all talk fluently about finance
On the surface, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from the newsstands and the huge TV screens of Times Square, they wouldn’t notice being in the eye of the cyclone.
They would never guess that the glass offices, with bee nests above their heads, the bankers and hedge fund managers who monopolize New York every day live the worst "bad day in the office" since the collapse of 1929.
Farmers shake metal carts for the the through the sidewalks, carrying muffin trays for breakfast meetings.
Latin Americans drag their feet between condos carrying, like human mules, 50 and broken stretched shirts hung on a stick on their shoulders.
Employees are still waiting in line for their morning bagel at the food carts on the sidewalks, and it is still impossible to take a yellow taxi between 16 and 19 on a working day.
It didn’t seem like there was a real crisis, until, with all the talk of ruin and sadness, I decided to open a new savings booklet on Thursday afternoon.
Although I had planned the matter so that it coincided with the late afternoon break at my JP Morgan Chase branch, a queue of about twenty was already waiting in line.
Not in front of the cashier’s door, to withdraw money or make deposits, but in front of the customer service door, where old customers order checkbooks, tourists ask for directions to the Macy warehouse and new customers open accounts.
Many of those in front of me, I would later learn from Starr, my "trust banker", were in line for my own reason.
Unlike me, however, they have already taken savings from the smaller banks from the places from which they make commuters, such as those from New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They have taken money from so-called thrifts (a bit like a construction company), credit unions, and types of city savings banks whose branches operate only within a state, and they say they treat customers like family members.
In the past few years, 15 of these banks have gone bankrupt.
In recent days Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion in assets, has been submitted to the controlled administration, and while New Yorkers were heading home for the weekend on a Friday afternoon, another bank, Wachovia, with savings savings of $440 billion, was on the lookout.
The employees and contractors who were in front of me, scared of another collapse, were moving their money to a bank perceived as a safe port, the bank that is asking for more bailouts on Wall Street.
The common New Yorkers in recent weeks have become competent in finance.
A woman at my trusted Chinese supermarket, speaking on the phone, referred to Lehman Brothers, the bank that went bankrupt, and her bloody CEO Dick Full in all familiarity, as if lying about a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, the uniformed doorman, almost fifty years old of my condo, has changed the subject from our normal conversation topic about Brad and Angelina or the delivery of my expenses.
She told me, after my visit to the bank, "Now I have all my savings in market funds!.
I've changed, I'm not taking any risks."
Muslim graves are profaned as Austria turns to the right.
Heinz-Christian Strache, on the left of the Austrian right wing of the Freedom Party and Filip Dewinter of the Belgian right-wing party Vlaams Belang, take part in a demonstration to present the organization "City against Islamization" in Antwerp, on Thursday 17 January 2008.
They carry road signs like those representing mosques with a red line passing in the middle.
Police blamed right-wing extremists for desecrating a Muslim cemetery in Austria, the same week that far-right political parties gained a lot in national general elections.
More than 90 graves were severely damaged at Traun Cemetery near Linz, some hours between Friday night and this morning, in what police believe was an organized action.
The culprits traced Jewish symbols like the Star of David over some graves, but investigators believe it was an attempt to mask extremist motivations driven by hatred for Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident is related to the election.
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said they were "deeply shocked" by the news of the desecration, which occurred towards the end of Ramadan, a month of religious significance for Muslims.
Austria, meanwhile, embarked on a spiritual research journey following its right-wing turn in yesterday’s parliamentary elections.
The two far-right parties that took almost 30 percent of the vote, the Austrian Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, campaigned with vehemently anti-immigration tickets and some of their slogans were defined by xenophobic critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party who won more than 18 percent of the vote, campaigned against veils and burkas and also voiced his opposition to foods that are perceived as connected to Islam.
At the final meeting in Vienna, he spoke of a “European brotherhood” to prevent the growth of Islam.
Both parties seem to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, adding that they are political symbols of a continuous Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Polls and analyses made immediately after the elections, which established the far right as the nation’s strongest political blockade, indicating that the change was brought in predominance by young voters who are worried about their future in the European Union.
Travel abroad prohibited by Gary Glitter.
Gary Glitter, the glamorous rock star guilty of child sexual abuse, has been banned from travelling to France and Spain from court.
Magistrates imposed a six-month ban on Glitter after he had informed authorities that they were controlling him to go to Spain via France.
The ban on travel abroad was granted to Kent police on Thursday after it provided judges with evidence of Glitter's previous arrests for sexual abuse of minors.
Glitter, real name Paul Gadi, was not present at the Ashford Pretoria hearing in Kent but was represented by Corker Binning's lawyers.
A Court Service spokesman said: “On Thursday, September 25, at the Ashford Pretoria, Kent police filed a request to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd’s trip abroad to France and Spain until March 25.
"Paul Gadd was not present in person."
Glitter, 64, had informed authorities that he wanted to travel abroad as required by the sex crimes record.
He must notify the authorities if he wishes to travel abroad for more than three days.
He is also asked to give the police a seven-day notice of his scheduled departure date.
Failure to notify the authority may result in a sentence of five years in prison.
Kent police said they did not want to discuss individual cases or possible Glitter moves in the country.
A Kent police spokesman said: “The Kent police will do whatever it takes to protect children in this country or abroad.
“From our point of view, it’s easier to control someone who stays in the UK because we have adequate comprehensive systems to manage every potential risk more effectively.
“Protecting Kent residents is the main concern of Kent Police and we are working closely to monitor the behavior of convicted sex offenders registered in the country to minimize any possible risk to the public.
Glitter returned to the UK last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abusing two 10- and 11-year-old girls.
When Glitter arrived, he flew to Bangkok where he was supposed to board a flight to London.
But he said he felt sick and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities would not have him transferred to passport control and eventually took a flight to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also refused to let him in and returned to Bangkok where Thai police and immigration officials insisted that he return to England.
He finally arrived at Terminal 3 in Heathrow on 22 August and stayed there while his lawyer David Corker went to the Uxbridge Pretoria, west of London, since Scotland Yard had successfully applied for an order to put him in the register of sex offenders.
Glitter had previously been imprisoned in the UK in 1999 for possessing child abuse images.
A source from the Interior Ministry said that Jacqui Smith, the Secretary of the Interior, felt reassured and happy that Glitter had been stopped from traveling to France and Spain.
"I photograph the master away from the scene to extract his character" Günther Bauer, photographer
No heels, no steering wheel, no clothes.
Only the essence of the great masters of flamenco, stripped of the concentration that characterizes the interpretation, to look at the relaxed appearance of the man or woman.
On the one hand, the artist.
On the other hand, the person.
Two inseparable faces, except in the private, in those moments far from the public, when the intimacy of a gesture, the depth of a stolen look or the expressiveness of the hands, are natural because they do not have to go on stage.
The German Günther Bauer in "Flamenco-People" alternates the theatricality of some shots to singers, dancers and guitarists on stage with the lesser-known side of these masters.
With this lens, the photographer offers an original iconography of flamenco, taking it from different angles of view.
The exhibition, included in the program of the Flamenco Photography Month, reflects the international importance of this dance, every day increasing," explains the artist and clarifies that in "Flamenco-People" it could also be ordinary people, but seeing the photos, the observer realizes that they are not the typical images of artists.
These people portrayed "on the street" are "artists capable of transmitting passion, sadness, joy when they are on stage ... and capturing the audience.
To capture the personality of these great men you do not need to portray them on the scene,
because their personality and character are internal.
What I was interested in was creating an intimate atmosphere that allowed me to capture with the camera the personality of the great flamenco.”
With a passion for the festival "Cante de las Minas", Bauer began in 1997 a long journey aimed at portraying singers, guitarists or dancers using a ballet camera.
They are portraits that, because of the type of machine and the material, remember the classic photography.
The application of different stylistic techniques breaks with the traditional principles of image, conferring on the photo modernity, according to an idea that reflects the conception of Bauer's own flamenco: "A music with very traditional roots that evolves and is able to surprise every day."
Not the dance, the singing or the playing itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, able to conquer the audience with his art.
The search for an encounter with the essential elements, with the magic that becomes visible in a certain way of feeling and being, are and have been the constant of this work, on display these days at the El Photomata gallery.
Famous flamenco artists such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, are included in this selection of about seventy portrait artists.
The project has become a kind of flamenco anthology, and will soon be published in a book that will collect the portraits exhibited during the exhibition.
The passion for portraiture led Bauer to repeat the idea two years ago with "Portraits of veteran athletes" ("SportARTproject").
Although in "Flamenco-People" the concept is different, the photographer admits "I love to portray people, know them and be able to penetrate for a moment in their lives, whether this is a long or short moment.
I think portrait is the most difficult genre in photography.
You meet or compare with people, characters you sometimes don’t even know or who give you just a few minutes to take a picture.
Beyond these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to put my ideas into practice.”
The collection of portraits of contemporary flamenco, entitled "Flamenco-people" is set up at the gallery El Photomata, at number 20 on Via de la Mata, parallel to Via Alameda de Hercules, and will be open to the public until next 16 October.
Vargas Llosa reveals that the novel he is writing is a "gamble"
It is set in places he still does not know and deals with unknown topics: despite this, Mario Vargas Llosa is struggling with a new project he is working on, a novel whose protagonist, Roger Casemant, is an Irish nationalist who has lived in the Congo for twenty years and has crossed the Amazon.
He has always been a favourite for the Nobel Prize in Literature, and he confessed yesterday at the Hay Festival in Segovia, that the project he is dealing with today is “a gamble” and that “everything indicates that I shouldn’t write it.”
“If it makes sense, I wouldn’t write it, but I’ll do it anyway and I hope to finish it as soon as possible,” concluded his speech at the festival for the exchange of ideas, thoughts and words that for four days saw hundreds of writers, historians, journalists and thousands of people pass through the city of the Aqueduct.
The author of "La ciudad y los perros" was, as predicted, the leading figure at the third edition of the festival of the word.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival award for being the most voted writer by the participants – an ancient edition of Dickens’ book “Our mutual friend”, filled the theater’s Juan Bravo seats.
Introduced to him by Félix Romeo, the writer found himself in front of an audience to whom the time flew when the Peruvian, with a wonderful memory and with great doses of humor, recalled how the literary vocation was born in him, derived from the "extraordinary adventure" of the "pleasure to read" and the "olderive it.
The Hispanic-American novelist, admitted that "there is no way" to measure and know if books can change people's lives, "but I refuse to believe that literature is pure entertainment, an ephemeral experience," he emphasized his own. "It has more to the cevole" Vargas Llosa, arguing that, "conversely, "has no effect on people."
Time hinders the Pozoblanco Festival, depriving it of races
The celebration of the races that should have sealed the days of the Pozoblanco Festival was suspended yesterday morning, after the bullfighters selected for the races had verified that the ground conditions of the square were not adequate.
Therefore, the company, in agreement with Fermin Bohorquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernandez, decided to suspend the celebration of the race.
The weather has warmed up against this festival preventing it from celebrating two days out of three.
On Saturday, rain prevented the second bullfight from taking place.
The posters included Jose Luis Moreno, Curro Diaz and Juan Bautista, who were supposed to face a Castilblanco bull.
Therefore, the Festival was held on a regular basis only on Friday.
On this occasion it was Daniel Luque who triumphed, cutting three ears and being brought out in triumph, after tore with taste and aesthetics.
On the same afternoon, Alejandro Talavante completed his two races by collecting greetings and an ear, granted more by the public than by virtue of the race itself.
The worst of all was El Juli, passing through the arena of Los Llanos without glory and without punishment.
With the second bull, after a tremendous grind, he gained the whistles of much of the audience.
A truck with two thousand kilos of hashish crosses the blockade in Alava
Five minus ten in the morning.
The officers instigate the altitude to the two occupants of a van who instead of stopping, run away.
Officers infiltrated the alt to the two occupants of a van who instead of stopping, fled.
Their load, more than two tons of hashish, is a good reason not to stop.
The agents, after chasing them, manage to arrest one of the two occupants, a man about 28 years old, identified as A.A.J., according to a statement from the Basque government’s Department of the Interior.
The arrested person is accused of drug trafficking and falsification of public documents.
The incident occurred when some officials of the Alava road were carrying out a traffic check on the N-1, at the point where it crosses the municipal district of Armi<0xC3><0xB1><0xC3><0xB3>n.
They were about to stop a van for inspection when the driver, violating orders, accelerated abruptly and passed the checkpoint.
Officers went after the vehicle until, after a couple of kilometers, it stopped on the roadside and its two occupants fled into a wooded area.
The Ertzaintza agents then managed to arrest one of the fugitives and seize the 2,178 kilograms of hashish they were carrying and that they took note once the van, an Iveco Daily, was inspected.
The hashish pans, which were in the rear of the vehicle, were subsequently placed under police custody for an in-depth investigation and weight detection.
In addition, since officials confirmed that the registration had been "doubled" as it did not coincide with the one reported in the van's documentation, the arrest was also charged with the crime of falsifying public documents.
Ertzaintza is pursuing investigations to arrest the second suspect, who has managed to escape as already stated, and to determine the origin of the drug seized.
The 28-year-old A.A.J. detainee was taken to the police station to carry out appropriate procedures and be available to the judge in the next hours.
Actress Heather Locklear Arrested for Driving Under Drug Effect
Actress Heather Locklear, the Amanda of the popular Melrose Place series, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara, California, for driving under the influence of drugs.
A witness saw her perform dangerous maneuvers as she tried to get out of the parking lot in Montecito, according to a California road spokesman revealed to People magazine.
The witness specified that at around 4.30 p.m. the Locklear "screwed down the accelerator, making a lot of noise, and trying to take the car out of the parking lot with abrupt maneuvers back and forth.
Shortly thereafter, the witness, who at first sight apparently did not recognize the actress, saw that Locklear had stopped on a nearby road and left the vehicle.
It was this person who alerted the emergency services, because "she was worried about Locklear's life."
When the police patrol arrived, she found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, which partially blocked the road.
"She seemed confused," and that's why agents took her to a drug and alcohol center for a test.
According to a police spokesperson, the actress has proven herself collaborative and the over-alcohol hypothesis has been discarded from the outset, although "according to what officials observed at first, we believe Locklear was under the influence of some drug."
The Locklear was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of some unspecified substance and was locked in the local prison at around 7:00 p.m., to be released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear was rehabilitated from a specialist clinic in Arizona after being hospitalized following an episode of anxiety and depression.
Llamazares urges the Andalusian IU federation to assume its responsibilities in the Silva case
The general coordinator of the UI and member of the party Izquierda Unida, Gaspar Llamazares, confirmed today that it will be the responsibility of the regional federation of the formation to make a decision on the case of the former adviser to Youth and Sport of the Municipality of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned the client's resignation last week.
"In these cases I am particularly federalist, and it will be the Andalusian organization that will have to take on its responsibilities," said Llamazares regarding the resolution that the party will have to adopt in relation to what has been an advisor in the council of Seville so far.
However, the UI leader stressed the need for "transparency" in all possible investigations into the irregularities that Silva would have committed. "The UI has always wanted this type of investigation to have the utmost transparency."
He also stressed that training is regulated by “very strict ethical codes for all public offices.”
"Sangre de Mayo", Garci's epic bet
Inspired by Benito Pérez Gald<0xC3><0xB3>s’ Episodios Nacionales, Jose Luis Garci proposes in Sangre de Mayo the famous Spanish revolt against the French, in what is the most ambitious film of his filmography, with almost 15 million euros in budget.
With this film, the director tried to "illustrate the torrent of characters and at the same time social analysis" that he always admired in the work of the famous novelist, explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutierrez and Paula Echevarr<0xC3><0xAD>a leading a wide cast of performers.
Sangre de mayo, for more than two and a half hours, debuts this Friday in cinemas, to become in the future a television miniseries of more than four hours on TeleMadrid.
A great admirer of the literature of Gald<0xC3><0xB3>s, Jose Luis Garci claims to have realized with this film "a dream of his childhood", and believes that he has to thank Esperanza Aguirre, who from the Community of Madrid had commissioned him three years before filming on the basis of the story.
The 15 million budgets allotted by the Community of Madrid represented a "unique opportunity" for Garci to recreate the appropriate scenery and costumes to portray "a stupefied Spain that mistakenly chose the leader for which Garci to fight and the fact that the struggle for independence has been under development" brought to the people a huge retard.
However, the director regrets not receiving funding equal to those of Alatriste or Los phantasmas de Goya - more than double that of Sangre de mayo, so it was not possible to shoot some scenes provided by the scenography that he himself had signed together with Horacio Valcarcel, collaborator of almost his entire career.
This, for the director of Back to Start, influenced his usual practice of working, staging with the actors, with whom he often uses to try before filming with those who will not be part of the cast, because he considers it "humiliating," considering that "part of the director's work is in going to the cinema and tea."
Many of the performers, some of whom are part of the cast of Sangre de mayo, prove in front of his car, as in the case of Michael Rell, Carlos Larranaga or Fernando Guillen Cuervo.
Candidates for the Oscar for four times - winning one - Garci believes that none of the three films candidates to represent Spain at the Academy of Hollywood this year - his Sangre de mayo, Siete mesas de billiard fran<0xC3><0xA8>s and, the last selected should be spaceves with "Los sunsoles blindos."
From this film Garci does not expect prizes.
“At first you think you’re working for posterity, then you realize you’re only working for prosperity, and at some point you’re compliant with just shooting an extra movie,” Garci explains after more than 30 years of career.
Isabel Bayon rediscovers the essence of the Seville dancer Tortola Valencia
A Sevillan dancer pays tribute to another Sevillan dancer.
Carmen Valencia Tortola, Catalan father (Firenze Tortola Ferrer) and Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana district, and at the age of three he moved with the family to London.
She was a free dance dancer and an Oriental dancer.
She led a fascinating life and was a pioneer of female emancipation, of the calibre of Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and vegetarian, and defended the cause for the abolition of the corset that prevented women from moving freely.
The life of this woman, who marked a revolution in dance and aesthetics in Europe between the two wars, has always fascinated Isabel Bayon.
"I would have liked to work with Pepa Gamboa and she proposed this character to me. It seemed amazing to me."
She said: “We don’t intend to tell her whole life, but gather her spirit.
The titles of his dances have suggested some basic elements of flamenco to me.
So, "the butterfly dance" suggested me a guajira, or "the snake dance" some tangi.
His dance was sensual and I was told that my way of dancing is also part of this aesthetic.”
The staging includes two exceptional contributions: that of Miguel Poveda, who will sing again Isabel in one of his shows, as a face in "La puerta aperita"; and that of the teacher Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to work with the one who had been his pupil.
"Matilde plays Tortola as an adult, the character of maturity.
I am happy because he has accepted to work on my work and I am very honoured for this.”
The arrangement also includes the musical composition and guitarists such as Jesus Torres and Paco Arriaga, the song of Miguel Ortega, the Pulga y Moi of Mor<0xC3><0xB3>n; the percussion of El P<0xC3><0xA1>jaro, as well as the viola of Rafa La Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfran Ju<0xC3><0xA1>rez "who always have played the role of eternal and accompanying artists."
In some form the life of this woman is also present in the opera, which takes place in distant places, especially for that time, such as India, the United States or Russia, and then all of Europe, since, usually, she resided in London.
“I wanted to remind her, because I think she is one of the women who have had a huge influence in a given historical period and now nobody remembers her, let alone consider her work as something of value,” Bayon said.
The show will begin today at 8:30 p.m. at the theater of Lope de Vega.
With the publication of the "Diario de un poete quizén casado" also closes the Triennium
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Diario de un Poeta Reciencasado" at the church of Saint Stephen (New York), where Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, belongs to the activities programmed by the Assessorate to the Culture of the Junta of Andalusia.
Thus, the "Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramon" concludes with the re-edition of this work, with the International Congress that took place in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel house-museum and with the itinerary exhibition "Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Jiménez: Aquel chopo de luz", which was inaugurated with the New York Provincial: Aquel chopo de luz.
In addition, the Department of Culture of the Junta de Andalusia has acquired a total of eight hundred copies of the "Diario de un Poeta Reciencasado", curated by Pietro Tabernero and illustrated by James Perez-Enciso, to continue the dissemination of the figure and work of one of the Andalusian poets of the highest value.
America likes a little less without Paul Newman
“Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them.”
The phrase is from actress Sally Field, who worked with him in "Ausencia de malicia" and gives the idea of the impotence of American cinema, and of all of America, in the face of the shocking idea that Newman has gone.
It took him a long time to get an Oscar.
He has been retired since 2007.
He also knew that he was very sick.
Despite this, it was a very hard hit for everyone.
"Sometimes what one proves goes beyond any expression, and I have now lost a great friend," cried Robert Redford, "my life and my country have been better because of its existence."
No one was afraid of being ridiculous or exaggerating.
A father of cinema and homeland died in a particularly dark moment, out of fear of terrorists and markets, with self-esteem from the American people on the ground, desperately seeking new motivations to feel worthy.
When times are so difficult, men so without virtue and are good people to admire, you don’t need to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all he embodied the platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official opponent of Richard Nixon and advocate of lost and won causes, from the drug-fighting foundation created in honor of his first child who died of overdose to the creation of the homemade and organic food brand.
All gifts to a country that costs a lot to go beyond a suicidal food culture.
The wave of admiration went beyond Hollywood, without taking care of either nationality or passports.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, observed that a man has not died, an era is over.
Another British director, Oscar-winning director Sam Mendes, said working with Newman was nothing less than the pinnacle of his career.
The bad boy from Australia, Russell Crowe, has gambled to define Paul Newman as his greatest inspiration.
"He has left an example of a very high standard for all of us," says George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who today is trying to live the way Paul Newman did: keeping in high regard the need for uprightness and having a serious and distant private life on cameras.
This is not always easy or possible in today’s media jungle.
However, some prove it, and Paul Newman sets a good example for these.
He divorced once but remained married for fifty years to Joanne Woodward, to whom he remained faithful while certainly not lacking the opportunities to not be.
"Why am I going to eat out a hamburger today, if I have a steak in the house?" he used to joke.
In heaven he is accompanied by pride that his daughters are also his admirers on earth, which is not so common in America.
“Among all the great roles he played, nobody was as proud of him as a devoted husband, loving father, solicitous grandfather and passionate philanthropist,” they say.
The imperfect race of an Olympic Madrid
Yes, the dream of many of us is that sooner or later the Olympics will be held in Madrid and, after the failed attempt for 2012, this could happen in 2016.
But I wonder, are we ready?
If we follow the example of yesterday's race, I would say no!
They called it the "perfect race", but in my opinion it was by far the worst I've ever seen.
A bunch of nonsense, which, if they were later taken into account at the time of the assessment and I had to examine them, the answer would be absolutely negative.
But let's go in order and start from the beginning.
The nonsense began with the withdrawal of the backbone, which supposed to go before.
It didn’t seem like a bad idea, but if they force you to go, be it to withdraw everything (including the chip to avoid queues during the race).
No, it's not.
You had to go just to take the backpack (first stupidity, go only for this) and (after the relative tail), surprise! they had only size 'S' shirts (second stupidity, because I need a size XL).
What world do we live in?
Is it the fault of the crisis if they have decided to buy only small T-shirts, made with less fabric and therefore less expensive?
Well, things like this are inexhaustible compared to the very day of the race.
In addition to having to go very early to pick up the chip, the queue was 15 minutes and, moreover, you had to deposit the backpack.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible for a race that is expected by more than 11,000 people.
So, as was foreseeable, the race started that we hadn’t even deposited the backpack yet, although once we managed in the company, the recovery turned out even worse.
In addition, the rain threatened the wait of more than 40 minutes, to which were added attempts of popular rebellion and assault on the stand.
In at least 500 people tomorrow we will definitely have pneumonia, and some, like me, will not even be in the right order ranking because of the chip that, I suppose, did not correctly record the arrival.
In the future, if they ask me for the perfect race, it will certainly not fit into my thoughts.
So I think we will continue to dream of a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft search receptionist (virtual)
At the MIT conference on emerging technologies, Microsoft presented a preview of a new system of image recognition and human interaction, a kind of artificial intelligence, but without much intelligence, able to perform some basic tasks of the telephone company, such as calling the in-house taxi (or, in the case illustrated by Microsoft, a service ship.
Thanks to a camera and a system of recognition of shapes and faces, this "receptionist" is able to know how many people there are in a room, who they are - including remembering their position in the company - and to listen and understand the keywords in a conversation with them.
You can also group the attendees into conversation groups.
In the example video, the receptionist detects a third person, but understands that she does not belong to the group she is talking to and that she is not an employee of the company.
He asks her if she is there to visit someone and tells her that she will be at his disposal soon.
All without a blue screen protector.
Impressive.
But this, of course, is the future.
Now the company has better to focus on, for example on the next version of its Windows operating system.
This week there was a lot of talk about a strategy change in Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and will not have many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer found that, if computers were equipped with essential functions and less loaded with commercial garbage, they would need five times faster – hey! Steve, it will be for "the least."
All a discovery, if you consider that Microsoft, version after version has continuously added to Windows features and "extra".
The change of direction is appreciable.
Microsoft is right: the operating system is increasingly losing importance, and with it the software.
When Google launched Chrome on the network, I was one of those who supported the theory that it was Google’s first step to competing with Windows.
Many rightly point out that a browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is an essential element for the hardware and software to communicate.
It performs the same function as your wife or husband when you have something to say to your mother-in-law.
That's right.
It will never disappear, but perhaps it is necessary to think of the "death" of the operating system not as an absolute truth, but relative.
What Ballmer said this week confirms this idea.
People are paying less and less attention to the operating system, and more and more to the web browser.
You take your computer just to launch Explorer or Firefox – or Chrome – and we spend more time each day surfing the web than in a remote window environment.
What is half of the operating system’s applications for?
Less is more.
And Windows 7 must be less, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, less overload, less complex.
Microsoft is more interested in integrating its online services to make them a valid alternative to Google.
They desperately need it, in fact, and here is a small example.
I took the photo in this post at one of Microsoft’s employee recreation venues in Redmond earlier this month.
On the beverage machine a sign prompts them to use their own search tool - "Your search. Our future".
In 2006, an independent study found that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search the web.
Last week, the delay in the development of the new version of Windows Mobile 7 was confirmed.
It will not be placed on the market in the first months of 2009, but probably at the end of the year, if not even in 2010.
Microsoft will definitely try to launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 together.
The mobile phone, after all, is becoming more and more a computer.
But the delay, with Android and the iPhone already on the market, is penalizing.
The Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso carried it to the C<0xC3><0xB4>te d'Azur, Leonardo di Caprio shone in Edward Zwick's 'Diamante de sangre', as well as Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola's 'The Godfather' as well as being part of the typical uniform of the muscular gay parish.
And if we try to list the appearances of the stars, we can recall the image of the forcing with the pointed bellows that lifts the weights in the walking circle.
It is, in essence, the typical men's t-shirt, with a cotton inside, buckled and without sleeves.
It is the 'tank', as the Anglophones call it, although, the Belgian Fabuleux Marcel stands out above all.
The "Marcel" excels over the others for the high quality of the cotton, for its unisex cut, for its distinctive coat of arms and for the small Belgian flag (just recognizable), which the most emblematic models of the shirt carry as a detail on the neck.
The "Marcel" excels over the others for the high quality of the cotton, for its unisex cut, for its distinctive coat of arms and for the small Belgian flag (just recognizable), which the most emblematic t-shirt models wear as a detail on the neck.
And be careful, because the production of the Belgian company does not concern only the famous "tanks".
It also includes college sweaters, retro boxers, cashmere cardigans, cotton pants, navy t-shirts, baby-dolls, mini shorts...
Intimate clothing designed to be comfortable.
And it's a shame to use them as underwear.
They're too pretty.
"I want to be a young mom, the candidate doesn't care"
Her great resemblance to her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Monica Cruz is small, but full of vitality.
Currently, the Cruz sisters have taken their new activity in the fashion field very seriously.
For Monica, they are much more than beautiful girls and celebrities who lend their name.
It was in Paris for the promotion that Mango made of its new headquarters, in addition to the presentation of the most important awards that the Spanish fashion house sponsors.
Warm and shy, it conquers you quickly.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I have come to present the new collection that my sister Penelope and I have devised for the fall-winter season of Mango, as well as to participate in the presentation of the second edition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and the dinner at the Opera in honor of Valentino.
Let’s say, a very intense day, but at the same time, exciting.
From what elements does your new collection for Mango start in this fourth season of work for the Spanish house?
Both my sister and I love the cinema of the '50s and '60s, from here we get various inspirations.
Then, I love getting lost in the city and watching women dress up, how they combine and mix their clothes.
Dancer, actress and stylist, you're a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I think so, even if in the end, everything converges and there are many elements in common.
As a child, I liked clothes; I wanted to go to my grandmother’s house to rub my aunt’s closets and see her clothes.
It was a bomb, better even than going to the playground.
Then, once a dancer, I always paid a lot of attention to dressing.
It is known that dancers like to have their own style to go to class and the sages, to look in the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of an actress, when they hand you the wardrobe is the moment when you really meet the character.
So, everything goes together, yes, with a lot of respect for designers and professionalism.
Not long ago, you turned 30, got into a crisis?
No, I'm not.
Never heard better, I like the idea of 30 years.
I find that at that age women are mature and have a good experience to enjoy life by making fewer mistakes.
The biological clock doesn't scare me.
I’ve done the things I wanted to do since I was a kid, and that gave me a lot of inner happiness.
So you think you're going to be a mother, or not?
Of course, I know that I will be a mother because my own body asks me for it and I also want to be a young mother, this I do not want to miss.
As for the candidate, I don't worry too much.
What I will do is give my son great happiness and educate him with great love.
As far as cinema is concerned, you are waiting for several films shot last year to be released in different rooms.
That's right, and I really want them to escape.
Being a woman who comes from the theater, I am very impatient and restless, I would like everything immediately and clearly, but it cannot always be so.
I want you to read "Last Hour" and "In Search of the Tomb of Christ."
Let's see if you like them
A few days ago you debuted on the sidewalk with Naomi Campbell, right?
Well, don't say that.
It's not like I was on the sidewalk as a model.
Simply Naomi Campbell, whom I’ve known for a long time, invited me to go to London to participate in a charity parade for her organization “Women for a Better World” and the clothes we showed – I brought this two pieces of our collection for Mango – were put up for auction.
People don't know this tender side of Naomi.
So much is said about her, that I who have known her for a long time can confirm to you that they are not so true.
In addition, I find myself with this good part in which you are involved.
He asked me to parade for a noble cause, but if he had asked me to do pine, I would have done the same.
If it's to help third world women, you can't back down.
Recurring drivers of alcoholism will have to install the "alcolock"
The Ministry of the Interior requires drivers with three administrative penalties for excessive blood alcohol, to install in his car the system that prevents driving the vehicle in a state of intoxication or if he does not blow into the appropriate device.
The measure was announced last June and is already included in the annual report of the Prosecutor General, according to which it will be a one-year pilot project.
The purpose of this project is to reintegrate the driver, since this will have to attend a rehabilitation course on the road.
In addition to the General Prosecutor’s Office for Road Safety, the Directorate-General for Traffic (DGT) and the Istituto Tecnologico per la Secureza dell’Automobile (FITSA) will participate in this initiative.
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of motorists reported more than once per drunk driving then return to driving the car.
The alcohol lock would avoid this, because it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the rate of alcohol in the exhaled air and prevents the car from starting if the driver does not breathe, or when a higher concentration of alcohol is detected than allowed.
The cost is more than 1000 euros and would be at the expense of the sanctioned.
In this regard, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with such devices can reduce up to 65% of offences committed during the first year of introduction.
And in Spain it is estimated that it could save the lives of 115 people a year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to stop these behaviors before they become criminal offences.
And to facilitate its development, since the legal reform can be carried out by ordinary means, and, without a doubt, the reform necessary for the criminal procedure would require an organic law.
However, the device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial solution, although it has already been introduced experimentally in some industrial and public vehicles.
Tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote on a PSOE initiative in which it proposes to install this system in school buses, as has already been done in France.
In Mexico, and without "peep-toes"
At 5:40 p.m., according to schedule, the Spanish plane in which the Asturian princes were travelling landed in the presidential hangar at Benito Ju<0xC3><0xA1>rez Airport in Mexico City.
The sun was setting but the rays still forced to use the hand as a visor to see the real torque coming off the plane.
At the foot of the ladder, the Spanish ambassador and the other authorities.
A few hours earlier I had asked a taxi driver, on the street, if he knew that the Spanish princes were going to visit the city to formalize an official trip.
- Ah, very well, so you can't go to the airport to load people at that moment ... You're from here or ...
- No, no, sir, she's Spanish, but she lived here for a couple of years.
- Ah, very well...
The Mexican press, on the other hand, knows very well who are the principles of Asturias and the importance of travel.
There are many who are waiting in the airport hangar crushed by the red carpet and the military cord made up of 27 naval soldiers who offer their honorary greetings.
The prince looks smiling, dressed in navy blue, and she, the princess, wind chime, very sober, does not use her usual "peep-toes," perhaps they told her that in Mexico City she was threatening bad weather.
They give photographers a smile and a short pause before passing through the room where the official committee awaits them.
At the door of the hotel where they live, one of the city’s four largest, a spirited Mexican television reporter awaits them.
The best prize offered by fashion
There is probably no more appropriate place in the world to present a fashion award than Paris and there is probably no more exquisite and bont vivan Valentino stylist.
Mango has just presented the second edition of the El Bot<0xC3><0xB3>n-Mango Fashion Awards, to promote the international promotion of new talents in the field of fashion.
It offers a prize of 300,000 euros.
Yesterday, Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at her drawings in the Mango showcase at the 54th Boulevard Haussmann in Paris and almost wept with emotion.
By the way, it is the company’s second largest store in Europe and has just been opened with 1,335 square meters of extension.
The first one is in London.
The many events, coupled with the desire to please the designer Valentino who presided over the jury of the competition, began with a luxury dinner at the Opéra Garnier in Paris.
With the proximity of Chagal’s most exquisite paintings, the presidential gala table prepared by Mango, was even more spectacular.
Born, with a broken heart and doing of necessity virtue, due to the recent death of his brother, he wore a dress of the House and some complements of ELAH to take his breath away and to the arm of his son Luis - a boy almost two meters high - accompanied Valentino d'a la presi<0xC3><0xA8>re.
Andik, owner and gentleman of Mango, did the honors of house and knight who finished, along with Baron Rotchil, without a jacket, because both had given them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who ran the shop in pants and shirts – drawn by her hand – transformed herself for dinner, wearing a long black dress very sensual and was excited during the night walk accompanied by Goya Toledo in the opera.
Inés Sastre did not stop for a walk in the premises of the palace, but had shown us first the photos of his son on his cell phone.
The next day we were delighted to see Olivier Martinez – another young man on a motorcycle – and John Travolta, who had arrived at the Hotel Intercontinental in Paris, with his sheets, his towels and had assured himself beforehand that there was no smell in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh, that's life.
1001, the anti-stress number
There are not 1,000 but 1,000 and a way to forget the chaotic and hectic daily life.
And as if that wasn’t enough, they are all collected in a book that will bring relaxation to the bookstores on September 30th.
Waking up is almost a punishment when it rings every morning at 7 a.m., but it is even worse to imagine yourself involved in the hectic pace dictated by modern life.
The office is called tension and the computer back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
However, there are not one or even two methods to combat daily exhaustion and the fatigue of getting rid of the world of work.
No, this number amounts to nothing more and nothing less than 1001.
Beyond yoga positions, classic massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott collects in the pages of her book, all a “menu” of options tailored to each one’s taste and time.
The anti-stress work is titled "1001 Ways to Relax" and its calm will reach the libraries thanks to the publisher Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If someone believes that it is not possible to gain calm in areas such as work or personal relationships, this "manual" denies that belief.
In addition, it suggests alternative solutions, such as staying in touch with nature, or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If the adrenaline doesn’t already flow into your veins to regain your body’s balance and stress has become a problem, it’s time to sit on the couch, turn off your mind and focus on reading.
Talking in your sleep
Some children talk at night.
I am not referring to those who wake up very agitated to tell us something that happened to them the day before, but to those children who talk while sleeping.
The first time it happens, at the most you take a scare, but in reality it doesn’t matter much.
This is a benign alteration of sleep called sleepwalking.
It manifests itself with a certain frequency, especially in children and adolescents.
Certainly, most of you have been told that you spoke in your sleep.
This phenomenon can occur very sporadically (once in life, for example associated with an episode of high fever) or with greater regularity (every day, once a week, once a month ...), the day after the baby remembers nothing.
There is no single reason to explain this phenomenon.
Sometimes they are episodes associated with other sleep disorders such as nightmares, night terrors, nighttime enuresis (doing the piss in bed), or sleepwalking, but that is not necessarily the case.
As already mentioned above, it can be associated with very high fever stages, stressful situations, or stressful situations.
In any case, it is a phenomenon still little studied.
The intensity with which it appears is also extremely variable.
It can happen that the person speaks with a very quiet tone of voice, with loose words, almost in a whisper, or the opposite happens (crying, screaming, long speeches...).
In cases where the event is particularly intense, it would be advisable to observe the child and possibly consult a specialist to check if there is any issue that is generating an abnormal state of anxiety as a way out of the situation.
We have said that this is a benign alteration so there is no treatment unless it is associated with other sleep disorders that can be treated (for example, if coupled with insomnia or stress situation).
What can be done, however, is to consider a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excite the child too much before going to bed.
Propose quiet games and avoid programs or TV shows that arouse fear or suggest violence.
With very nervous children for whom it is tiresome to relax, you can use relaxation techniques to help them gain some inner calm.
This will allow the child to sleep more calmly.
Once the sleepers appear, try to keep calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the next day he will remember nothing of what happened.
Useful advice
Don't wake him.
It's useless, because he's not aware of what's going on, and you're gonna stop him from sleeping.
Although he's talking, he's sleeping and so he's resting.
Remember that if it appears very anxious and the episodes have a certain frequency it is better to consult a doctor or check where such great anxiety in the child comes from.
If you understand what he says (which is not the most common situation), don’t fall into the temptation to ask him for information.
You will not get anything, because he is asleep and therefore unconscious to organize his thought.
In addition, you are able to hear what it says but not see what it is dreaming to say, so you need to pay close attention to the interpretation of the information and the conclusions it could lead to.
Never tell your child that you can ask them questions at night to know their secrets.
Not even for a joke.
Such a thing causes a great deal of distress.
In short, don’t worry, it’s nothing serious, it’s an episode that lasts only a few minutes.
Illaeusern... finally
The Illhaeusern finally found their way home after a long, unsuccessful period.
Without playing a formidable game, the Yellow-Blacks created the most networking opportunities, transforming one into the game’s victory.
The rhythm was not much sustained during this meeting in which the attackers expressed themselves tirelessly.
After a first attempt by the captain of the host team Kauffmann who reached the seventh with a shot from afar, the Illhaeusern began to have the best and one after the other provoked the defense of the Dannemarie, Fonderflick from afar, then Hirn high, Romain's tip and more.
The Dannemarie responded with a blockade at the center of the field, leaving only the triggered Riahi at the top of the attack.
The start of the second half was decisive with two initial occasions signed Riahi and Temporale for the Dannemarie, and immediately after Marais's first net for the well-placed Illhaeusern, he resumed a rebuffed ball on a first attempt by Diebold (53').
But the cannonier of the Illhaeusern will not be able to enjoy his happiness for long and will be expelled a dozen minutes later leaving his teammates in numerical inferiority.
But Dannemarie will not be able to take advantage of it and will not cause much trouble to the Eleven of the Illhaeusern, just backed to "strengthen" the defense, except in the last minutes of the game when, after a rough action, the ball reached the cross.
Sarkozy Meets Angry Fishermen
Before leaving for the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make a stop in Britain.
Before the demonstration of fishermen who brutally blocked access to several Breton and Norman ports on Monday, the President of the Republic decided to visit the port of Guilvinec, in the department of Finist<0xC3><0xA8>re, on Tuesday morning to enchant its representatives.
The latter have promised to welcome him "in a constructive spirit" and hope that he will "present himself with concrete proposals".
A presidential visit that takes place right at the same time as the general assembly of the "crisis committee", created by the Breton fishermen in order to take measures to cope with the rise in the price of diesel, which has reached its record with an average of more than 1.14 euros per liter.
According to Eliseo spokesman David Martinon, the president "will discuss with them possible solutions to help businesses regain competitiveness and to secure working conditions and the salaries of sailors."
The fishermen are waiting for Nicolas Sarkozy to stand still.
On Tuesday morning, they conducted "snail operations" in Morbihan and Calvados, causing almost 10 km of traffic jams.
The port of Quiberon was also blocked, but connections to Belle-<0xC3><0x8E>le were not interrupted.
On the Quiberon peninsula was implemented a road blockade.
On Monday, sailors had already proved their determination by burning tires and pallets at dawn in front of fuel depots at the ports of Brest and Lorient, while protests were taking place in Concarneau and Saint-Brieuc.
The movement extended to the ports of the Atlantic coast and the Channel, such as Sables d'Olonne, in the Vendée, where the fishing vessels remained at the pier, or to Havre, where about twenty boats prevented the movement of the ships from trading.
The fishermen of La Turballe et del Croisic, at the Loire Atlantica, interrupted in the evening the blockade of the famous Refinery Total of Donges.
In Boulogne-sur-Mer they decided to wait for the meeting to be held at the ministry on Wednesday to decide on any actions.
In Guilvinec, the "Crisis Committee" will decide on Tuesday the future actions of the movement and possible participation in the meeting planned at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by the leaders of the National Fisheries Committee, which did not support the movement.
"The strike will continue" because "the fishermen will not give in" and "they do not intend to move to Paris," said, for example, Liliane Cariou, chairman of the Lorient Fisheries Committee.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay taxes on diesel, currently pay about 50 cents per litre, but estimate that the yield limit of a boat will be reached only with a diesel price of less than 0.30 euros per litre.
Paul Newman the Magnificent
The unforgettable performer of "Butch Cassidy" died of cancer at the age of 83 in his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and Sam Mendes hailed the film legend and engaged actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains delivery forecasts in 2008
The aircraft-constructing company has 215 deliveries this year, despite the recession threats they pose to the world economy.
Embraer, the world’s fourth-largest airliner, maintains delivery forecasts for 2008 with the delivery of 215 aircraft, its president, Frederico Fleury Curado, confirmed.
In the first half, it delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian company has broad confidence in the Chinese market, especially for aircraft in the range between 30 and 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 aircraft to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG to sell more than 15% of its assets
The insurance company American International Group, set up by the U.S. monetary authorities, would cede more than 15% of its assets in order to repay the $85 billion loan, according to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times.
The AIG is ready to consider the sale of much of its assets, as well as the transfer of life insurance branches to the international and U.S. markets, the paper said on the basis of more than authoritative sources.
The Board of Directors of the AIG met on Sunday night to consider possible transfers, according to the FT.
No confirmation has been obtained from the AIG.
The assets that the AIG intends to divest include the airline leasing subsidiary International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in Transatlantic Holdings as well as its real estate portfolio and its private equity investments, FT adds.
No final decision has been taken on these transfers, FT continues.
The AIG must quickly recover liquidity in order to repay the $85 billion loan granted by the Federal Reserve, at the cost of seeing the U.S. authorities take over 80% of its capital.
Paris: cronistoria Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange blamed a historic collapse on Monday, after the House voiced against Paulson’s plan to save financial institutions: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, a decline never seen, approaching 800 points, and the Nasdaq 9,4%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Media (DJIA) finished at 10,365.45, down 777.68 points.
In terms of points, the worst loss in its history (684.81 points) exceeds that of 17 September 2001, the day of the reopening of the Stock Exchanges following the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
The Nasdaq, the main technology stock index, lost 199.61 points closing at 1,983.73 and the Standard & Poor's 500 extended index lost 8.81% (i.e. 106.85 points) closing at 1,106.55, according to the definitive closing figures.
Demoralized at the start of the session, Wall Street collapsed after the unexpected rejection of the bank bailout plan, designed to restore stability to the markets.
With 228 votes against the plan and 205 in favour, representatives rejected funding requested by Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson.
About two out of three Republicans have rejected the plan.
“It’s a negative signal sent to the market, which sees Congress unable to adopt a plan,” said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
“All of this signals how much the market counts on the project,” he added, fearing that in a few days it might already be “too late” to adopt one.
“If the project were actually dying ... then the witness would be quickly passed on to the Fed – the Federal Reserve – and other central banks to solve the crisis, which would further limit credit conditions,” warned Brian Bethune, head of the global finance and finance sector.
And again highlighting the state of emergency, "every day that passes leads to the collapse of a financial institution" in the United States, Pigeon said.
Following the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual on Friday, authorities organized the purchase of Wachovia’s banking assets by rival Citygroup.
In Europe, the crisis has accelerated sharply, calling for emergency intervention in favour of UK, Benelux, Iceland and Germany banks, a sign that markets “are not only facing an American crisis, but a global crisis,” FTN Financial analyst added.
The bond market has risen sharply.
The yield of 10-year Treasury bonds fell to 3.632%, compared with 3.827% on Friday night, while the 30-year Treasury yield fell to 4.161%, compared with 4.357% on the previous day.
Obama to win the first television duel
After Friday’s first debate between the two White House candidates, he has a second to find out who, between John McCain and Barack Obama, was the winner.
Unsurprisingly, the headquarters of the Republican and Democratic campaign proclaimed the respective victory of the television duel, followed by a third of American families.
Politologist David Gergen believes that John McCain’s performance, though meritorious, was not brilliant enough to allow him to slow the decline in polls to five weeks from the presidential elections.
The Gallup Institute, of which an opinion poll published Saturday grants a five-point lead to Obama (49% vs. 44% for McCain), shows that the Democrat had the best.
An instant poll conducted by CbsNews on a sample of undecided voters found that 39% of them think Obama is the winner, while 25% point to McCain.
An excellent performance by his co-star Joe Biden, expected during the first and only debate with rival Sarah Palin, is expected to confirm Obama’s lead on Thursday.
“Underestimating it would be a mistake.
It’s a good intention,” Bill Clinton said this weekend.
The 70-year-old McCain has never stopped promoting his indisputable foreign policy experience, emphasizing the opponent’s “naiveness” with regard to the topics addressed during the first face-to-face.
"Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that he's often said repeatedly.
“I don’t think Senator Obama has the experience and skills to become president,” he said.
What has been a continual target for the Republican television campaign since yesterday.
Obama, for his part, stressed that his election would represent a new future.
Without lengthening, it proved concise and precise.
He promoted his readiness to make the right decisions and his intention to restore the image of the United States on the world stage.
“McCain never understood, unlike Obama,” he retorted, this weekend, a Democratic spot, accusing the Republican of not taking the necessary measures to deal with the impact of the financial crisis on the American people.
During the ninety minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you, Obama denounced yesterday, in front of 20,000 people gathered in North Carolina, under heavy rain, for an election meeting.
He has not even spoken the words "middle class" or "workers". The financial crisis goes in favor of Obama, considered by Americans as the most suitable person to save the economy on the edge of the precipice.
“Next week could be a decisive turning point,” said influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer.
Democratic Representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama’s intuition in economic matters to that demonstrated by Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic candidate, the current collapse “is the final verdict after eight years of very bad economic policy adopted by George Bush and backed by Senator McCain.”
Reaffirming the intention to cut taxes for 95% of Americans despite Wall Street whistleblowers, the Illinois senator also mentioned among his priorities the achievement of a possible energy independence of the country thanks to the promotion of renewable energies and the implementation of a health insurance system.
McCain, for his part, would build a park of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
With caution, the two candidates have shunned questions centered on the $700 billion (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>470 billion) financial bailout plan adopted by Congress last night and extremely unpopular.
In Minsk, "Have you ever noticed that there were elections?"
Young people and opponents were protesting on Sunday evening in the main square of the Belarusian capital to contest the results of the legislation in advance.
Several hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday night immediately after the closing of the electoral seats in central Minsk square to protest the fraudulent nature of the legislature.
While the results were still awaiting, many young people had come to protest against the power of President Alexandre Loukachenko: "the dictator, resignation".
Some confess that they didn't even vote, "What's the point? They'll do as much as they want, of my vote," one boy says.
They do not believe that the regime that has made the foreign observers a good figure in the past with the aim of resuming dialogue with the European Union is ready to take a democratic turn.
Sanctions, including a visa ban for 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of assets, could be lifted if these elections were deemed legitimate by observers.
They were not, according to the opposition.
"We have been removed from the electoral commissions and our observers have not been able to participate in the vote-loss," said Yuri Potemkine, spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous alliance of twelve parties.
"It's a change of fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade," emphasizes Alexandre Milinkievitch, a former candidate of the opposition to the 2006 presidential elections and head of the pro-European movement, because the important thing is who counts the cards and in this case is the executive.
If opposition members enter Parliament, it is because they have been nominated, and not elected.
But their entry into parliament can entail a television space, regional meetings and bills."
The opposition therefore has a duty to enter into the political game because "the dialogue with the European Union must be started.
Because if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, goes into crisis, and we do not provide any reform, we risk becoming a Russian protectorate.
Now we want to be independent.”
The opposition fears that the organisation for security and cooperation in Europe that followed the electoral process recognizes the validity of the vote.
He stresses that participation rates seem too high, and that the generalization of the vote in advance (26% of voters in Minsk) has given rise to any type of manipulation.
"Did you not notice that there were elections?" asks the social-democratic leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of the last two political prisoners released this year, in August.
There was no one in the polling stations.
And there will be a maximum of five opposition MPs in parliament, the most favorable to power."
The silence of the night falls on the square of October.
On television, President Loukachenko and members of the Central Electoral Commission are pleased with their success.
The meeting - The blood is safe again
Héma-Québec celebrated the tenth anniversary of its founding yesterday, and its president, Dr. FrancineDécary, had every reason to rejoice, as Héma-Québec has become one of the safest and most effective blood suppliers in the world.
And above all, it has regained public confidence, seriously shaken by the infected blood scandal in the 1980s and 1990s.
As we know, the national blood reserves managed by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Service were infected with acquired immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C in the 1980s.
Faced with such a drama and the protests of the population, the Government of Canada conducted a public inquiry in February 1994, led by Judge Horace Krever, which aimed to shed light on the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to disseminate recommendations to prevent the re-proposal of a disaster.
While Judge Krever was late to draw up a report, some provinces set up a committee with the aim of devising a new blood management system in Canada.
In Québec, this mandate was carried out by the Gélineau Committee.
Following the Gélineau et Krever reports, two suppliers were created in Canada: Héma-Québec to supply Quebec and the Société canadienne du sang (Canadian Blood Society) to all other provinces and territories.
In 1998, when Héma-Québec started its activities, only 38% of people said they still had confidence in the Québec donation system, recalls Dr. Décary.
The situation was mortifying.
Thanks to the ongoing efforts to improve the safety of blood collections and field research over the following years, we have regained the public’s trust”, he explains before saying proudly that at the beginning of 2008, about 94% of the population of Quebec now had confidence in Héma-c.
However, Dr. Décary is convinced that “trust is something extremely fragile.”
Since its inception on 28 September 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
At the time, there were numerous cases in Europe of the human variant of the mad cow, a new manifestation of Creutzfeldt-Jakob's disease, says the one who has been in the presidency since 1998, the year of the foundation.
"And we did not know at all whether that disease could be transmitted through infected blood.
It is therefore based on one of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gélinau reports, according to which when you have doubts and could achieve a serious disease, in this case the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease that manifests itself with a degeneration of the brain that inevitably leads to death, take measures of exclusion.
In April 1999, the blood of those who had spent more than a month in the UK since 1980 was rejected.
Now, for a few years, it has been shown that this disease is no doubt transmitted through infected blood.
This episode so proved to us that it made sense to apply the precautionary principle."
In 1999, a much more efficient technique for the detection of HIV appeared on the market: nucleic acid (TAN) tests that allow to recognize the presence of the virus in the blood of donors and not that of antibodies against it, on which the tests used until then were based.
TANs have allowed to reduce the window period, that is, from the moment the person contracted the disease to the one where the first viruses can be detected in the blood thanks to our techniques, explains the specialist.
This period could be reduced to a duration of less than one week.
The risk of ignoring the presence of infected donors and not being able to identify them is thus greatly reduced.
These improvements have significantly reduced the risk of contracting AIDS with a blood transfusion.
Today, one in 12 million people are at risk of receiving blood infected with the HIV virus.
In other words, this means that it will be necessary to distribute 12 million blood samples before someone is infected with the HIV virus.
Since Héma-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood samples each year, it will take more than 24 years for a case of HIV transmitted by transfusion to occur.
I believe that today one can feel at ease in receiving or prescribing a blood transfusion to regain health, says the head of the management of the Héma-Québec.
“Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
You never know which pathogen will emerge in the system.
Not later than a year ago, the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted in the blood by an insect.
You have to be constantly vigilant," Dr. Décary continues before stressing that in addition to having secure resources, Héma-Québec must also provide sufficient resources.
“Needs are increasing as the population ages.
Being the most aggressive cancer treatments, patients often need an intake of red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing population also has consequences for the number of donors that on average make up only 3% of Quebec residents acceptable as donors."
However, all healthy people who have reached the age of 18 and meet the eligibility criteria can donate blood every 56 days, or six times a year.
On average, 14% of people who offer themselves as donors are not accepted because they are affected by AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have traveled to a country where it is widespread, they will be rejected for a period of one year.
“With this 3%, we are able to maintain an inventory capable of responding to the needs of hospitals.
Cases of deficiency are very rare.
But we must renew the members of this group of donors as they age and can no longer make donations.
It is now difficult to convince people to donate blood, but above all to hold them back and encourage them to become regular donors.
Nowadays life is so hectic that it is hardly an hour to donate blood,” says Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Héma-Québec distributes not only blood samples, but also human tissues, including bone transplants, eyeball heart valves, and skin that is used almost exclusively for severe burns.
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before being deposited at the Héma-Québec which manages the only public navel cord blood bank in Quebec.
In the umbilical cord, which was once considered a biomedical waste, plenty of blood rich in stem cells that can serve to cure serious diseases, such as leukemia.
“We celebrated, a few weeks ago, the inclusion in the bank of our thousandth sample of cord blood and we plan to take more than a thousand each year.
You should start proposing them for transplants at the beginning of next year,” says Dr. Décary who describes this practice of taking cord blood as very popular.
"Many mothers are disappointed that they cannot have access to you," as Héma-Québec does not have the necessary means to propose this complex and expensive program in all hospitals in Québec.
Football - L'Impact in the semifinals
Impact Montréal qualified for the semi-finals of the Serie A eliminations, winning 3-1 against the Seattle Sounders yesterday, during a second decisive match of the quarter-finals, at Saputo Stadium.
The midfielder Antonio Ribeiro, scored the decisive goal in the 90'.
After a goalless first time on both sides, David Testo and Rocco Placentino scored the following goals for Montreal.
For the Sounders, Roger Levesque was ready to score Matt Jordan.
In the first round, on Friday, the Impact suffered a 2-1 defeat at the Starfire Complex in Tukwila, on the outskirts of Seattle.
The Impact will face the Vancouver Whitecaps in the semi-finals.
On Saturday night in Minnesota, the Thunder filled a first 3-1 in the return game by winning 4-3, but the Whitecaps will still participate in the semi-final.
The Impact will face the Whitecaps both Friday and Sunday, but further details will be confirmed in the day.
In short - Kovalev's decisive network
The Canadien and his axes are ready to restart the season.
The trio consisting of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn animated the offensive phase of the game by winning 3-2 against the Panthers, Florida, last night at the Bell Center.
Kostitsyn, the star of the first meeting, scored a goal, made two passes, and picked up a pass for victory, in the fourth of the Hab preparatory games.
Decisive for the victory the only network signed Kovalev.
“I’m not ready yet,” he warned the Russian.
I need another game to make me feel comfortable.”
“He tried to stab him in the first half,” Guy Carbonneau said.
But I think he appreciated the outcome of the game.
There was a nice ovation.”
Charest Points to the North
The Prime Minister does not rule out the start of elections before the end of the year.
At the conclusion of the General Council of the Liberal Party, Jean Charest went to Jean-Talon, Quebec yesterday, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc, (left), tries to get himself elected in today’s partial elections.
"Expanding the borders of our last great northern border": this is Jean Charest's long-term ambition, presented yesterday in Levis, by means of instruments of strong visual impact, on the occasion of the General Council of the Liberal Party of Quebec.
Behind him, during his speech, the projection of a sort of "Image Mill".
On three maxi screens, they were confused by the spectacular negatives of hydroelectric dams, mining, images of Quebec seen with "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Great means as in the full election campaign.
During the press conference, the prime minister refused to rule out the start of the autumn elections, although he noted that he was very busy.
The "North Plan" is the fourth point of a "project" that the Prime Minister claims to have for Quebec, that of a "new economic area", which includes a first labor agreement with France, a second agreement between Canada and Europe, and other agreements with Ontario.
Often appointed in the most recent speeches of the Prime Minister, the opening of the North – the northern territory at the 49th parallel – had never been the subject of a presentation.
The prime minister has, however, limited himself to explaining why the North would be "a jewel of immense potential", but has not spoken about timings or investment quotas, nor has he explained what specific priorities will be in the implementation of future projects.
He has also limited himself to pointing out what he believes deserves a priority position: hydroelectricity, forests, but above all the mining sector, which has undergone several improvements as a result of the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
According to the list drawn up by Charest, the North contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamonds".
That "territory big double that of France" is here, it's Quebec.
It’s not only here, it’s inside us,” he insisted, as he wanted to urge a national founder myth.
The foundations of Quebec are rooted in its relationship with the North, he stressed: the gold fever in Abitibi, the national engineering, the Bay of James.
"It's up to us, it's our future," he added, after a theatrical break to contemplate the immense map behind him.
The North, 70% of Quebec’s territory, includes a part of the Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, the prime minister said during the press conference.
"It is a position traditionally maintained by all governments.
There is a border line on which no agreement has been in place for a long time, and when the opportunity arises, I will rethink that position in the name of the government.”
“Considering climate change, we need to re-evaluate the North,” he said, speaking of the Northwest Passage, which will be open all year due to the melting of ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister believes that occupying the territory is a duty.”
What about the inhabitants of the place, the First Nations and the Inuit ?
The Prime Minister said that the Quebec government would be very careful about this and that the project would meet their interests, especially those of young people.
Two former ministers from different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former MP of the PQ of Ungava), have already started the consultation of about thirty communities.
An interministerial committee chaired by Beno<0xC3><0xAE>t Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) holds an important position, has started work.
The Prime Minister does not rule out a great meeting, not necessarily a summit, but a moment when "common visions will be provided".
The development of the North would follow the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan will be “concerned, ordered and respectful of the environment,” he promised.
Jean Charest described this “project” as a continuum with that of the liberal prime ministers who preceded it.
“Like the liberals who preceded us, we know how to stand out to turn challenges into new opportunities for growth and development.”
This was one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which began on Friday with a large cocktail in honor of the 50th anniversary of the arrival of Jean Lesage as head of the party.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes the renaming of the Beauharnois Headquarters in the Adélard-Godbout Dam.
“From Godbout, creator of Hydro-Québec, to Lesage who nationalized hydroelectricity, to Bourssa, creator of James Bay, our party has always been able to forge the future,” said Jean Charest.
During the press conference, he used another, conservative reference this time, the program "Strades to the North" by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
Addressing the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric dam project, Charest said that its commissioning would be scheduled for 2012.
"All of this remains between us, but I feel we will do it," he confessed to his militants, arousing applause.
In fact, the prime minister, who in April said there would be no elections in 2008 and probably not even in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of starting a poll in the fall, which could happen in accordance with the law.
He underlines that he is certainly very busy, particularly in a federal council mission in China and at the Quebec-New York summit.
The General Council of the weekend provided the Liberal leader with a platform of nationalist resolutions, in particular of the “constitutional aspirations” that passed smoothly like oil: the PLQ demands above all recognition of the “specificity of Quebec” in the Constitution.
It also hopes that Quebec will nominate members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council and that the latter will have a veto over decisions taken in Quebec.
As far as the opposition is concerned, the draft of the North Plan has been sceptical.
The leader of the PQ, Pauline Marois, pulverized the Northern Quebec Development Policy launched by the Landry government in 2001.
According to her, the liberal government, which came to power in 2003, would not respect its implementation.
If he had done so, "we would have progressed today," Marois commented alongside Jean-Talon's candidate, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise Mercure.
The ADQ said it supports the government’s adoption of the North Plan.
“What we hope is that all this is not simply perceived as a spectacle,” said Sébastien Proulx, Mario Dumont’s replacement, who is returning from the holidays.
Letters - A Dishonored Country
It was Vic Toews, the former Minister of Justice (iron of fate) at Harper’s cabinet, who allowed himself to declare last summer that Louise Arbor was a “shame” for Canada.
Dishonoring in this way a woman who has fought incessantly for justice and who deserves all our admiration says a lot about both the Prime Minister's entourage and Stephen Harper himself.
Here we are before a government that is the only one, among all the Western countries involved, that has not repatriated a citizen of Guantanamo who is being held in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
A government that does not take into account the fact that Omar Khadr was a mere teenager at the time of the charges.
The only government that, despite signing the Geneva Convention, denies its word and leaves a child-soldier stranded in inhumane conditions.
The only one who trusts in a parody of justice to establish the guilt of the accused.
We recall, for information purposes, that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association, in particular, call for the repatriation of Omar Khadraffin so that he may be subjected to a regular trial in Canada.
It is precisely the same government that closes its eyes to torture: it does not care very much that a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, perhaps forever, after so many years of oppression.
We are not yet aware of this, but we are witnessing an insidious erosion of our rights, of freedom and of "democracy", a word that Harper keeps holding and which sounds so senseless on his lips.
Here we are at a time when there is no morality anymore: one can abuse, torture, arbitrarily imprison a Canadian citizen at the discretion of a minority government leader to date (to see what will happen after October 14th...).
Numerous voters believe that a party that preaches Virtue, Respect for Law and Order represents salvation: they do not see that this government has given up what constituted the reputation and dignity of our country.
The shame is right here, Mr. Toews, in giving up all of this, and nowhere else.
Free Opinion - Barrick Gold's Orwellian Speech
In the September 17 edition, Le Devoir published a letter from M. Patrick J. Garver, vice president of the Canadian mining company Barrick Gold.
Pursuing an Orwellian logic, the latter states that the world's largest gold company has filed a six million defamation complaint against three authors and a small publishing house squatted with the intention of starting a "transparent public debate".
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth that they judge, especially in the case of a defamation complaint, but the law.
Without any surprise, this substantial difference is completely hidden by Garver.
Because for Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate would be to bring to ruin anyone who dares to support a position contrary to his.
Regardless of the outcome of the trial, the writers and publisher of the book Canada Nero will have to spend a substantial sum of money in order to organize their own defense and fight, with weapons definitely learned, against an army of lawyers financed by the pockets of the mining company virtually without bottom.
Moreover, in these arms struggles, the tactic is often to ruin the defendant in order to impose a consensual regulation that impels the opposition in addition to frightening anyone who dares to pronounce on the issue again.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it would be up front to the public that she should present her own view of the facts.
Contrary to what happens in many countries where Barrick Gold works, in Canada debates usually take place with the exchange of views and not with manganese shots.
It would have sufficed for the company to open its books, its documents, and set up a real debate, through newspapers, media, publications and the funding of teams of independent researchers who could have shed light on the issue.
But Barrick Gold does not seem to have too much confidence in public opinion and poorly rejects petitions and letters in support of Black Canada’s authors.
Perhaps Garver could explain how he can ask for a "public debate" when his contempt for that same public is evident?
In the world of the vice-president, it seems that this word only refers to the fragrantly paid lawyers and not the whole of the Canadians; here is a rather narrow view of the concept.
In a democratic system, even the denigrators have the right to speak.
What Barrack Gold doesn’t understand – or doesn’t want to understand – is that the public supporting Black Canada’s authors and publishers does it first because it rejects the brutal means adopted by the mining company.
This audience is ready to listen to Barrick and judge, but on the basis of civil exchanges of opinion, and not in view of what many perceive as a sort of blunting (searching for the "public debate", the Barrick Gold smear has just given the authors of Canada's Black's ultimatum an ultimatum.
Beyond Garver’s surreal speech, the Barrack Gold sporting grievance constitutes a direct attack on the freedom of university research and the pursuit of truth, indispensable in every democratic society.
It denies in block the right to citation of authentic sources and to debate on facts and interpretations, which represent the very basis of intellectual work.
If in a country like Canada it is impossible to study and discuss inconvenient topics for the richest companies in the world, many complain, who can do it?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could do so by following the scientific norms as the Black Canada authors do.
You have the right to reply.
For a long time, the university environment, of which we are a part, has been able to handle debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold’s excessive measures clearly show that, contrary to its claims, it does not seek a transparent debate at all.
This is at the expense of the university world, as is the public debate in Canada itself, and it is time for governments to take measures to curb abusive complaints.
Operation – Rescue for Wall Street – Dialogue between Republicans and Democrats
The Bush administration and the head of Congress, representatives of the Republican and Democratic deployment, yesterday finally reached an agreement on the larger bailout plan after the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the $700 billion plan, which aims to curb the months-long financial crisis on Wall Street, has yet to be ratified by the two houses of Congress.
It provides in particular: checks on its effective implementation by the elected leaders, new mechanisms guaranteeing the reimbursement of public money, new provisions to contain the number of houses pinned for non-payment, as well as a right of inspection on the salaries paid to the managers of protected enterprises.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Republican Representative Judd Gregg announced the good news a few minutes after midnight yesterday, at the end of a two-day negotiating marathon.
“We have made great progress towards an effective market agreement,” Bush administration spokesman Henry Paulson said in a statement.
"Every decision has been taken in such a way as to safeguard the economy and the American people from the current crisis on Wall Street," he said.
“It’s the crucial point: if we didn’t act in this way, invaluable defeats and unrest would have spilled over on the daily lives of Americans,” Republican Judd Gregg said in a statement.
The conclusion of the negotiations was marked by concerns about the impact of a new bankruptcy on investors.
The agreed time limit corresponded to the opening of the markets this morning.
Unified later in the negotiations, the two candidates for the U.S. presidential elections were rather in favour of the agreement, but did not avoid expressing their dissatisfaction in advance with the adoption of extreme solutions.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama deserves to have added some provisions to the deal, in particular one that will allow owners to keep their homes and one inherent in salaries for government-covered business executives.
“When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of others, there is nothing to rejoice about.
But these measures are necessary," he said on the screen of American television.
Interviewed on another channel to see if he would vote in favor of the plan, his Republican opponent, John McCain, replied: "I would like to analyze the details, but I hope so."
“As far as I’ve read, it’s something that we all have to digest and that will allow us to move forward.”
The option of a non-intervention is simply unacceptable,” he said.
The 700-billion-dollar plan aims to buy back the dubious, risky, and unsellable assets of U.S. financial institutions with taxpayers’ money.
The plan comes after 14 months of crisis due to the outbreak of a real estate bubble that first led to the collapse of mortgage loans at risk (all), then extend to other more widespread forms of credit securities (PCAAs) and result in the freezing of liquidity and bankruptcies.
It was a group of Republicans in charge that aired the first draft of an agreement last week.
It seems to have come out of that blind alley since the Democrats have accepted that the “toxic” asset of some companies in difficulty is only protected by the government, rather than purchased.
In order to meet everyone, in Congress, a provision was added that, if the government were to face losses over the next five years due to such a program, it could impose new taxes in order to maintain its balance.
The new plan envisages the payment of a first sum of $250 billion, to which another $100 billion may be added if the president deems it necessary.
The $350 billion donation is expected to be ratified by an additional vote of Congress.
In exchange for his help, Washington will get stakes in protected companies that will steal dividends in case of profits and that it will be able to resell when the waters have calmed down.
According to the plan, the federal government will have the opportunity to delay the insolvency proceedings relating to real estate loans and to set limits on the remuneration and start-up allowances paid to the managers of the companies involved.
As of today, the architects of the plan would like to submit it to the vote of the House of Representatives, and to the Senate vote on Wednesday.
Despite all their efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will be given the free way.
In fact, yesterday there were several votes against the project, both in the republican and democratic ranks.
"Obviously, Washington doesn't hear you," Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House Finance Committee, told his constituents.
“Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But I don’t want to take advantage of taxpayers.
Leader of a small group in Congress dubbed the "Caucus of the Sceptics", Democratic Representative Brad Sherman presents the situation differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred eminent professors of economics, including three Nobel Prizes, have written to us to say: We ask Congress not to draw hasty conclusions and to carefully examine the way forward," he said.
At the same time, in Europe, the global nature of the crisis was once again being tested.
After an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for 11.2 billion euros ($16.3 billion).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary when the French bank BNS Paribas announced that it would give up the purchase of its competitor, in full failure after the loss of 2 billion euros (2.9 billion US dollars) due to the crisis of real estate loans.
Fortis has 85,000 employees and is one of the 20 largest banks in Europe and the ten largest insurers.
"It's not lost money," Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said yesterday.
In return, they gain influence and voting rights in banking matters.
It is certainly something that savers and families appreciate now that the times are announcing uncertainties.”
During this period, at the other end of the Channel, the British government seems to be nationalizing another bank at risk of the financial crisis.
According to the British press, the government would take charge of all the loans currently underway at Bradford and Bringley Bank, of which more than 41 billion ($75.5 billion) in real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it will be you to buy the branches and customer accounts of the British bank.
Since the start of the economic crisis, Bradford and Bringley will be the second bank, after Northern Rock, to undergo a process of nationalization by the British government.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a busy icon
The beauty of the blue eyes was for a long time its axis in the sleeve, for others its weak point.
Did he get rid of the narcissistic mirror, the American actor from the sickening smile?
Yes and no.
His discretion, sensibility, and obvious talent would have driven him out of that circle of powerful dedicated to real holy monsters.
But what a constant!
Paul Newman, who passed away on Friday at the age of 83, on his Connecticut ranch following lung cancer, remains one of the last icons of American cinema in the fast-paced years.
Less monumental than Brando, whom he resembled and of whom he was for a long time a sort of rival on the screen, more cautious in his game, certainly more fragile, but he also spoke of freedom and the development of dramatic convictions.
Mixed couples often give birth to magical children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, to a German Jewish father and a Hungarian-born mother.
From these European roots will be born one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
A humble ego, the last mark of quality.
As he recognized an entire country invaded by the safe made man, the fighter of the Pacific War, proud in combat, who at the beginning of the 1950s studied dramatic art in Yale, he later attended the New York Actor Studio, before triumphing in theater, television and soon in cinema.
That same civil rights activist was also the car driver who ranked according to the Mans 24 Hours in 1979, as well as sex symbol, although part of a model pair since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
They go with him the shadows of a reserved, discreet, busy star, allergic to the scandals of the show-business, whose mystery will never be fully revealed.
An honest man, in the noblest sense of the term.
This weekend the disappearance of Paul Newman was a heartbreak for the filmmakers, while his big characters populate the black screen of memories.
Over half a century of American cinema in full transformation reproposes itself through its interpretations.
The charming cowboy of Butch Cassidy (1969) and that boy unable to desire his hot wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in The Cat on the Roof that Burns adapted from Tennessee Williams in 1958 are confused in the memory.
More recently, we remember him as the sensitive Mr. Bridge (1990), disturbed by a marriage that didn’t keep as promised.
Many more Paul Newman have gone down in history.
The boxer Rocky Graziano, delinquent, tormented, violent, memorable in Let's Somebody Love Me, by Robert Wise, a role destined for James Dean and resumed after his death, which officially launched Newman in 1956.
That cute mall in the excellent Stangata, Oscar as best film in 1973.
A bitter and vengeful billiard player in The Splash, a magnificent film by Robert Rossen (1961), The Color of Money by Martin Scorsese, which earned him the only Oscar out of 9 nominations in 1987.
That face over the years, it was his.
It's still him.
The epochs follow through his path.
Young people know him especially for George Roy Hill's cult film Slap Shot (1977), in the role of Reggie Dunlop, coach of an unorthodox ice hockey team.
His fans found him in 1994 in Mr. Hula Hoop, of the Coen brothers.
The circle had closed with one last role as patron of the Irish Mafia in Era My Father, in 2003.
Unlike more cinematic legends who soon abandoned the craft, Newman would stay in the halls for a long time, denouncing Hollywood in all its glory, festivities, and concessions.
Bertrand Tavernier, a French cinematographer, called it, with a hint of irony, "a living challenge to underplaying", considering its performance exaggerated.
The profession has not always been a game for the beautiful Paul Newman, whose roles seemed to fall like manna from the sky.
However, he often preferred the role of the marginalized to that of the young actor: neurotic, alcoholic or desperate characters, of whom he expressed disdain and rebellion with his perfect traits.
As a director, Newman revealed unknown nuances of his true, pudic sensibility.
Jennifer's first time, in 1968 (based on the novel by the Canadian Margaret Laurence), with her wife Joanne Woodward as the protagonist, drew a thin female portrait of melancholy.
He, who lost his son Scott to an overdose, dedicated the 1984 film Harry and Son to him, a discrete and sad film.
Among the innumerable tributes rained on Newman yesterday, his great friend and old gunman Robert Redford (who had performed together in La Stangata and Butch Cassidy) stated with infinite sadness "His presence made my life and this country better."
Generousness and love of life, two great characteristics of the missing actor.
Beyond a career as a legend, a great civil rights activist, ecology, independent cinema, a contestant of the Hollywood drift, is thus shut down.
We’ll have her face splashed out on bottles of vinegar, sauces, biscuits and other foods, judging her a choice of bad taste, although born as a gag.
However, the proceeds from those sales were destined for his Foundation for Children in Difficulty.
Newman, instead of lying on his myth, chose to commit himself to the end.
He left his five daughters a letter saying, “Always and to the end, your father has been incredibly grateful to his good star.
Being there was a privilege.”
And it was equally a privilege for us to follow the path of such a clean and generous American artist.
Citizen model, therefore, and much more.
What was produced in the Zuschlag invoice factory & partners?
The hearing of the criminal case against J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Zuschlag and partners will be discussed shortly on 8 October.
The politician and his associates are accused of repeated commercial fraud committed within the framework of a criminal association that has caused considerable damage, and of other crimes, including forgery of documents.
According to the Prosecutor’s Office, the money obtained from bids was used by them for private purposes, and they have often certified the execution of the activities through fake invoices.
The state and municipal money, totalling 65 million florins, ended up partly in the boxes of the organization Fiatal Balloldal, partly in the pockets of some people.
According to the method, made known by the investigating authorities, they took the money obtained from bids on the basis of invoices for non-existent transactions and the associations never fulfilled the obligations assumed.
According to the indictment, most of the invoices were false.
To do so, the billing blocks were purchased at the J<0xC3><0xB3>zsefv<0xC3><0xA1>ros market, while the circular stamps were manufactured in Kiskunhalas.
And to decide on behalf of which companies to issue the invoices, it was established, among other things, during the trip through the hills above the Balaton where J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Zuschlag had sent Istv<0xC3><0xA1>n Lados.
According to the confession of the latter, he had to choose boarding houses and restaurants.
He asked for an invoice for consumption, on the model of these then the invoices were prepared to be forwarded to the competitions, among others, those of the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs and the Municipality of Budapest.
Most of these are the work of Istv<0xC3><0xA1>n Lados and Andr<0xC3><0xA1>s <0xC5><0x90>ri, who, according to our information, wrote mainly the reports necessary to obtain the funding.
One of the choices of Lados' "study trip" was a brewery.
According to two invoices issued by Zuschlag and members in 2003, the restaurant provided meals for a group of 90 people of the Biztos Pont Egyesület Association.
So many people, however, according to the restorer, would not all come together into the room.
Similarly, the invoice issued in the summer of 2002 to the Fondazione Jobb Jöv<0xC3><0xB5>ért, later called Együtt a Third <0xC3><0x89>vezredért, is a drawback of formal and content errors.
A guest house in Badacsonytomaj has only three rooms, more than 10 people could not stay there, however 130 guests were included in the invoice.
But the compilers of fancy invoices exaggerated when they reported Pigal Kft., also it deals with catering, in which accounting - according to the information released to the judicial authorities - did not even appear the documents on behalf of the companies Jobb Jöv<0xC3><0xB8>ért and Hopp<0xC3><0xA1>.
Gy<0xC5><0x91>z<0xC5><0x91> Farkas, director of the company, told hvg.hu that when he was summoned to the prosecutor’s office and showed him the invoices, he soon realized that they were fake documents.
"On the stamp the name and VAT match of our company were in the wrong place."
He added: In addition to the formal reasons, the fact that according to the invoice were housed a hundred people, when in total they have eleven rooms and there are not so many beds.
By the way, the bill was catering and their restaurant is no longer in operation for a long time.
The assiduous invoice compilers did not bother to inform themselves that the Budapest travel agency of their choice, only organizes trips abroad, so they foolishly indicated on the invoice with payment in cash trips to Hungary, which did not agree with the company's practice of issuing invoices.
In addition, as demonstrated during the investigation, VAT was also included on the invoice, while travel to countries outside the European Union is exempt from VAT.
Among other things, the amount of VAT was also incorrect on the four documents issued by the Hotel Révfülöp Kft. in favour of the Jobb Jöv<0xC3><0xB8>ért foundation, in fact on the services offered by the company you have to apply the VAT at 15% and not at 25% as indicated on the bills.
In addition to this, the "issuers" have ruined other invoices, in the case of a company they have indicated as an activity carried out the transport of goods on the road, as is known from the Procurement procedure, an activity that was not carried out by the company originally founded for investment advice.
In addition, for formal defects - non-conforming invoice format cause, false stamp - it was discovered that the invoices issued in favor of Együtt a Third <0xC3><0x89>vezredért Foundation, of XXI. Sz<0xC3><0xA1>zadi Kultur<0xC3><0xA1>l<0xC3><0xA1>s Egyesület and Biztos Pont are false.
The same happened in the case of Ravenna Bt. or the Sporting Field of Kunfehert<0xC3><0xB3>, whose representatives refused to issue the invoices in question.
The falsifiers also did not pay attention to the fact that the HIB Kft. of Ny<0xC3><0xAD>regyh<0xC3><0xA1>za was in liquidation when (2001) a group of Fiatal V<0xC3><0xA1>rosért Egyesület had lunch, which is why the company’s liquidation manager, according to our information, denied that he had issued that invoice.
They have consciously issued invoices.
Another group of invoice issuers is made up of those who were aware of having to issue fictitious invoices.
The Esély Budapestért Foundation has issued an invoice at the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifj<0xC3><0xBA> Szocialist<0xC3><0xA1>k in favour of the foundation Ygyütt a Third <0xC3><0x89>vezredért of almost 4 million florins.
Ludovic Györfi, one of the defendants, according to the indictment, persuaded the director of Collab Kft. to issue fictitious invoices.
He has collaborated with Zuschlag and members also Biogate Kft currently in liquidation, which in 2003 provided invoices issued for about 5 million firons to the Jobb Jöv<0xC3><0xB5>ért Alap<0xC3><0xAD>tv<0xC3><0xA1>ny foundation, the association Atlasz Egyesület and the economic association Vörösfeny<0xC5><0x91> Egyesület, which is not a real c.
Neither movement of money because the prepared invoices were later cancelled, but the associations forgot to include this aspect in their documents.
In the following group of companies issuing invoices belong those that are related to the accused.
For example, Ivan Kubatov, authorized to the address of the Director General of Delta Tri<0xC3><0xB3> Kft, based in Budapest but not available there, who deals with the trade of fuel and motor vehicles.
The company issued various invoices in October, November and December 2005 relating to the sale of computer media, for a value of about 18 million florins.
According to the data of the investigation, Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas under liquidation since 14 September 2005 purchased these invoices.
The director-general of this firm was a Romanian to whom Ivan Kubatov would submit documents relating to the firm between 2002 and 2005.
As far as we know, during the investigation, Kubatov acknowledged that he had issued invoices on behalf of the company to the companies Atlasz, Hopp<0xC3><0xA1> and Együtt to Third <0xC3><0x89>vezredérdérd Alap<0xC3><0xAD>tv<0xC3><0xA1>ny and the counter-value was taken by him.
At the express request of Ivan Kubatov Romanian masons founded the companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
In fact, none of the firms were operational, because according to the defendant they had not received work.
However, the companies became useful because at the request of the co-indicted lawyer Zsolt Szente, editor of the company’s founding documents, invoices were issued on behalf of the companies to the associations linked to Zuschlag: the Atlasz and the Y-Generaci<0xC3><0xB3>.
On behalf of the companies Cash Investment, Delta Tri<0xC3><0xB3>, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade Kubatov issued to the various entities 15 invoices for a total value of 14.2 million florins.
The prosecutor believes that Kubatov collected 10% of the amounts indicated on the invoices, as well as VAT.
The man also used the Szi-Beri Bt. to issue fictitious invoices, manufactured for the competition ban of Biztos Pont.
Y-Generaci<0xC3><0xB3>n e Sövetség a Modern Magyar<0xC5><0x91>r<0xC3><0xA1>szl<0xC3><0xA1>s in January 2006 presented a ban for the public utility entity of the Socialist Party, T<0xC3><0xA1>ncsics Mih<0xC3><0xA1>ly Alap<0xC3><0xAD>tv<0xC3><0xA1>ny (TMA).
They also won 500,000 florins per head but the sums were not used for the purposes indicated in the ban.
In order to avoid this, they presented to TMA five fictitious invoices received from Works Team Kft.
These invoices were found during the search of the office of <0xC3><0x81>rp<0xC3><0xA1>d Kemecsei at the Ministry of Education.
At the hearing some of the defendants, as they have already done in the prosecution, will probably report on the progress of the production of the invoices.
However, the most interesting thing could be if the defendant number one, J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Zuschlag, decided to lift the veil on everything.
His confession so far has not been very detailed and although he has promised several times to talk about everything extensively, he has not yet done so.
We must see if it is in his interest, it could also be that the Socialists have made agreements with Zusi, who - in exchange for a compensation of 50 million florins, much of the damage - would be willing to do the scapegoat.
Zuschlag for the time being could have offended himself, as his requests for easing his prison conditions, i.e. the granting of house arrests, have so far not been fulfilled.
While the perpetrators of non-compensable commercial crimes and causing much greater harm can freely walk or at least wait at home for the end of the proceedings against them, which is not granted to him.
The Psychology of Excessive Bidding: Why Spend More Money?
At auctions, buyers are likely to spend more, to overvalue the goods.
Neurologists and economists at the University of New York have managed to discover the neuro-economic basis of this known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to their study published in the journal Science, men do not want to stay behind in a race such as the eBay auction, so they are willing to pay a higher price.
Research has sought to trace the nervous pattern of this "game" at the level of the nervous system through experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers played the lot, the other group of players participated in an auction while using the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) method they examined the active areas of the brains of the people participating in the experiment.
In both games the participants could win money, but in the game of the auction, where the essential element is to bid more than the other, the body striat under the cerebral cortex enters intensively when it loses to the game.
This area of the brain, in addition to other functions, plays a role in the mechanism of "self-gratification" of the nervous system.
Therefore, according to the researchers, the rise in price is explained by scanning the vehement reaction of the striped body.
To support their theory, the economists of the research group conducted a financial follow-up survey.
In this investigation, three groups bid against a partner in different conditions.
They reported to the control group what the actual value of the product in question was and they made their bet.
To another group besides this they promised that in case of winning they would receive another prize of $15.
The third group would have received $15 before the auction, but the group members would have lost money in the event of a loss at the auction.
The difference between the two groups was that for one of them the win was highlighted, and for the other the loss.
By testing the neurologists' hypothesis, the members of the group who played "against the loss" were willing to make higher bets than the control group or "winner".
“These results are not deductible from any of the previously existing economic theories.
In fact, these so far explained the phenomena encountered at the auctions with the joy of winning and with the avoidance of risk.
Only the methods of creating the neurological image have helped resolve the contradiction between the two theories, so we have come to a third explanation," said Andrew Schotter, a professor at the University of New York School of Economics.
Hepatitis: When to go to the doctor?
Nearly half a billion people in the world suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, but in Hungary chronic liver disease is one of the leading causes of death.
In Hungary, the number of hepatitis patients amounts to one hundred thousand, of which only 7000 are cured: the reason is that many patients do not know that they are infected.
The definition of hepatitis is the collective name of contagious liver diseases caused by different viruses.
There are many similarities between the symptoms, typical are hepatitis and iteration, but their pathogens and the diseases caused differ from each other.
Hepatitis viruses spread in two main forms depending on the pathogen: hepatitis A and E through the food channel (e.g., water and infected foods), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses with blood and organic fluids (sperm, vaginal leaks, saliva).
For those traveling, it is useful to vaccinate against viruses A and B, there is no vaccine against C.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after eating infected foods, accompanied by general malaise, weakness, abdominal pain and nausea.
After the formation of yellowish spots on the skin and white of the eyes, the feces become clear and the urine dark, the healing takes place within two to three weeks.
A million people die every year worldwide from hepatitis B, the most serious variant of the disease, which causes liver cancer and liver cirrhosis.
The main reason is, according to estimates, that only one in ten people receives pharmacological treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: if left untreated, it can cause liver cirrhosis and liver cancer.
Most infected people do not know that they have contracted the disease because pathogens subtly destroy liver cells, in many cases the first symptoms appear after 20-30 years.
Therefore, it is very important to prevent and carry out regular medical tests.
This disease is much more common than the average in three groups: those who had a blood transfusion before 1991, drug addicts and tattooists.
In the world today, the number of people infected with the chronic hepatitis C virus amounts to 200 million.
Because even a routine laboratory examination reveals the disease is worth talking to a family doctor when you notice any symptoms of unknown origin.
Recognized in time the disease is curable, the virus can be eliminated from the body, so the infectious power ceases and the formation of tumors can be prevented.
September 30 is World Hepatitis Day, organized for the first time in 2004 by disease associations around the world.
The purpose is to draw attention to chronic viral hepatitis, the causes of its development and the early recognition of the disease.
Who believes in God feels less pain?
According to the results of a recent investigation, religious faith works as a kind of analgesic that has made the death of Catholic martyrs more bearable.
Scientists at the University of Oxford conducted an interesting experiment, examining how faith in God influences the sensation of pain, the British Telegraph said.
As part of the somewhat bizarre investigation an electroshock was carried out to 12 Catholic believers and as many atheists, while all of them observed a painting depicting the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to reject much of the pain.
Thanks to the exploratory technique of the human brain it was discovered that Catholics were able to activate the part of the brain responsible for pain control.
The test is the first in a series of research in which, in addition to academics, scientists, philosophers and theologians of the University take part.
The test was carried out exactly like this: an instrument that emits discharges and passes the electroshock was connected to the left hand of the subject of the experiment.
The researchers asked the participants to focus on two paintings, the Virgin Mary painted in the seventeenth century by Sassoferrato and the Lady with Leonardo da Vinci's hermelin painted in the fifteenth century.
The authors of the examination hoped that the image of the Virgin Mary would give rise to some sort of religious status among believers, while Leonardo's painting was chosen because it did not differ too much from the other and considered it to be a reassuring effect.
The subjects of the experiment spent half an hour in front of the MRI scanner and in this time loop received 20 electroshocks in four consecutive series, while observing either the religious-themed painting or the other.
The Catholics reported that the vision of the Virgin Mary made them feel "safe", as if "someone took care" of them and "they were calmed down and they were pervaded by peace".
Looking at the religious-themed image they realized 12% less pain than when they had Leonardo's work in front of them.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who took part in the test himself, believes that a similar result can be achieved with any image with a strong effect even for atheists, but it is necessary to find the appropriate image.
“We need to look for an image that has very positive feelings, like a mother or a father,” he said.
Anglican Bishop Tom Wright was pleased with the results of the search.
“The practice of faith should change, and in many cases it manages to change our personality,” Wright added.
After the excellent results, only the question remains whether the painting of a Madonna by Leonardo or another painter of similar calibre is presented to the believers, what effect could it have on pain control?
Would the vision of a Virgin Mary of quality bring better results?
You are what you say about yourself
On the 10th birthday, Google can claim to be both in people’s pockets and in the sky above their heads; it knows where they spent the holidays, what outpatient clinic they attend and what interests it.
However, according to Eric Schmidt, one of the directors of the company, this is not enough.
As for the skeptics who make a comparison with the Orwellian nightmare, they don’t really see the substance of web 2.0.
Recently, Eric Schmidt told the Financial Times that Google’s primary purpose is to collect as much personal data as possible from its users and this is necessary to adhere to the original goal of the Google founders that was: “Let’s put all the information of the world into a system!”.
According to the director of Google interviewed the company, after 10 years of revolutionary work, it is still at the beginning of being able to handle all the information.
Asked what would happen in five years, Schmidt said: “If Google could answer questions like ‘what do I do tomorrow?’ or ‘what’s the right job for me?’, software can’t answer seemingly simple questions because they don’t know enough about users.
Not all Internet users are aware that during their searches on the Internet, exactly the search words are recorded, from which IP address they are searched and on which page the interested parties stop after the search.
Using the Personalized Search launched two years ago e.g. users can store their browsing history, they can relate to what they have searched and clicked, these then long go will generate much better tailored results; on this same logic is based Recommendations with which the system offers us products and services based on our stated and registered preferences in.
What happens if my data is used against me, if they look at what I do? - ask users concerned about Google's data monopoly.
In most cases, the backlashes of internet users are caused by the fear experienced for the size of the potential power represented by the company, and not for the sense of guilt, for the fear of punishment, for the desire for freedom or even for the rebellion to power.
One fact is confirmed, however, and that is that all the expressions sought are not only recorded but in justified cases can also be provided to third parties, in such legal cases nothing defends the personal rights of Internet users.
The most striking example of this in recent times has perhaps been the coordinated action against Brazil’s paedophiles, in which Google forwarded to the Brazilian government the information that made it possible to identify the paedophiles from the Orkut community page maintained by Google.
Internet users concerned about personal rights, on the other hand, suffered relief in May when the company - in agreement with the electronic legal protection association EFF - successfully demonstrated the truth in court against the FBI: nor can it subsequently inform Google with any point of the constitution to provide.
(At the same time, the federal government successfully scrapped almost 50,000 web addresses and thousands of search terms obtained in reference to the confirmation of the child protection law passed years earlier, but still failed to obtain the search lists of individual users and the entire list of web pages and two keywords.)
Google’s judgment is therefore quite contradictory: those who fear to provide their personal data scoff at Google because they believe that this will affect their intimate sphere and privacy by starting to use its services and rising up with the rebellion of multinationals that stand out for the conservative image.
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and the proliferation of enthusiasts, activists and computer users who have appeared in numerous countries see in them the future generation of the big companies, the "cool corporation", unlike their rival, the Microsoft liquidated as the conqueror of the world because of Windows, however both fight for the same goal.
This can happen because Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask its users for an identification code, does not ask for money for its services, the source code is always kept up-to-date, and the program package is much more accessible, youthful and cool than the official software giant practice.
But it can also happen because geeks see exactly the problematic relationship between personal rights and the internet, which implies one of the most frequently repeated keywords in recent years, web 2.0.
Web 2.0 speaks of nothing but collaboration, of intentionally leaving traces behind us and exploiting the communication channels at our disposal and while the size of these changes for each individual, the substance is the same: to show ourselves.
An average young person can create profiles on multiple community pages, from Facebook to Shanghai, can link them to other services such as Twitter or last.fm that lists his music tastes, all of these can include them in systems such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, can also write blogs on which Flir automatically appears on his photo galleries.
Meanwhile, we read of numerous instances from which it is clear that the girl, seeing the series of photos taken in the morning by the common circle of friends, comes to know easily who spent the night with her naughty boyfriend or a private company can completely fire his employee because he resigned his life.
Those who live an online life make sure to show themselves and so we can formulate the fundamental thesis that hides behind the behavior of young people.
Those who want to hide something or just want to avoid Google’s monopoly can do so (starting with Scroogle using Google’s search system but at the same time not voluntarily leaving a trace).
There are not a lot of people who don’t deliberately sign up for community pages to not be found, Google’s online applications, from text processing to image management and news collection, can be replaced with alternative versions that aren’t linked to huge server parks and that don’t make up our best profile yet.
The public doesn’t even wait so long in secret for the moment when Google will pull out the claws.
Currently, the company with its $156 billion worth worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion), AdWords/AdSense advertising spaces also threaten the revenues of large-scale software companies at Microsoft’s record-breaking, time-consuming services.
However, the critical observers next to all this find alarming points: the corporate summit for example completely rejected the protest of the employees after having doubled the right of the corporate asylum, considered themselves too expensive to them that he agreed on the repeated dining in the daily pleasure of the employees.
One internal rule of our company seems to be that it does not advertise a new service in advance but only when it will be usable, one thing is certain, that the foreseeable problems of the coming months and years will move the world at one point: while some others believe that the project of scanning and archiving have a lot of them.
The fact that Google is building a genetic database can offer good material to the next generation of science fiction writers, the Scrogled account of the famous Cory Doctorow describes the future with Orwellian accents, in which a man with Google data can be approached in an alarming way.
Two minors helped <0xC3><0x93>zd’s double killer to disappear
Police have questioned two minors about <0xC3><0x93>zd's double murder, suspected of having helped to clear traces of the crime, a spokesman for the Borsod region's police quest said on Tuesday.
The young people have acknowledged the crime to their accused, they are currently accused of favoring.
The two minors, two girls according to the MTI, defend themselves on foot.
The benefit is punishable by up to 5 years of imprisonment.
The suspect in the double murder of <0xC3><0x93>zd, a 23-year-old local man, was put in pre-trial detention on Sunday.
He is suspected of premeditated murder committed for profit.
The investigation found that the 23-year-old had a huge debt to a 53-year-old man.
The suspect did not want to settle the debt, so last Wednesday he tricked his creditor into a <0xC3><0x93>zd yard where he and his 9-year-old daughter were killed.
According to information from the MTI, the young man had prepared to commit the crime, a signal is the fact that he committed the murder with a weapon hidden on the spot.
The police are examining the weapon and the circumstances of its use with the involvement of an expert.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange has made an offer for the purchase of the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange offered 200 million euros, about 5 billion Czech crowns, for the purchase of 100% of the stock list of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Poles despite the Czechs having previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange as a possible buyer of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason for the exclusion is the fact that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is owned by the state.
99% of the stock is in the hands of the Polish state that intends to sell more than 60% of its stock within a few months.
The Czech financial newspaper E15 says that the offer of the Poles represents the highest figure so far advanced for the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press so far, they have submitted an offer on the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Transatlantic Stock Exchange Nasdaq, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the German Stock Exchange.
Petr Koblic, director of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that among all those concerned the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst owner and did not rule out that this could lead to the closure of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange at 5-10 billion kroner.
According to the shareholders agreement, almost 90% of the shares would be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is Patria Finance with a share of almost 25%, followed by Banca <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xA1> Spor<0xC4><0x99>telna with 14.7% and Tiger Holding Four S.a.r.l. with 13.5%.
The economic crisis from the point of view of European newspapers
The major European newspapers in their comments on Tuesday devoted to the international economic crisis are already talking about "a second 9/11."
The global financial disaster has happened thanks to the American president, La Repubblica accuses, who has not been able to consolidate his party behind a law that is smeared in a hurry, the purpose of which is to remedy a desperate situation.
Instead of a second Pearl Harbour, as billionaire superfinancier Warren Buffett said, it would be more accurate to talk about a second September 11.
Also part of the Madrid press sees in Washington the scapegoat.
According to El Mundo, the lack of American political leadership has pushed the world economy to the brink.
The danger of the collapse of the American financial system is increasing, and the whole world will suffer from it.
Bush’s plan was not perfect but as a result of the congressional vote there is a danger that Washington will not offer a political means to manage the crisis.
The world economy is suspended in the air, just when the greatest transformation in the history of capitalism is taking place.
It is no longer possible to ignore the threat - notes the Tages-Anzeiger of Geneva.
Some states today can still offer a bailout gift to crippling financial institutions and with taxpayers’ money can save them from bankruptcy.
But if more and more banks collapse as in a domino effect then neither financial means nor improvised new solutions will be enough.
In the long term, it is necessary for the EU member states to overcome their national selfishness and concentrate control on the shattered financial markets.
Only on Monday the weakened financial institutions got more than 100 billion euros - recalls Vienna's Der Standard, according to which increasingly real anxieties that European taxpayers, like those from the US, will have to put their hands on their portfolio to remedy the crisis.
The EU has so far not been very concerned about the crisis that has crossed the old continent like a tsunami.
The "saviors" do not have to lose the <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 billion right away, however, it would be better if they established in which case it is appropriate to touch taxpayers' money to prevent greater damage.
The intelligent machine mimics the flight of the cockroach
What could be the best way to develop anti-collision technologies if not to imitate the sensors of obstacles found in nature?
For example, the bees.
In the astonishing project presented at CEATEC in Japan, the calabrons gave Nissan engineers the initial strategic impetus on how to build the next generation of anti-collision systems.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built the biomimetic robot BR23C, a robotic mini-car with bee properties, with the ultimate goal of creating a system capable of scanning all collisions.
Flying bees form their own oval personal space that really looks a lot like our protective shield - explained to the exhibition Kazuhiro Doi, director of PR and R&D technologies.
Important is the role of the bee's view, capable of a view of 300 degrees in each direction.
The engineers drew on the telemetric laser idea to copy the function of the bee's view.
The BR23C detects obstacles up to two meters away within a 180-degree radius, calculates their distance and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor that immediately transforms it into a command to avoid collision.
In a fraction of a second the robot perceives the obstacle and then, mimicking the bee's movements, immediately changes direction by turning the wheels of the necessary measure to avoid the accident.
This avoidance maneuver, unlike the current system, takes place in a completely instinctive manner.
"If this were not the case, the robot car would not be able to react quickly to avoid collisions," said Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and the robot car project.
It must react instinctively and immediately because this technology corresponds to the damaging and innermost layer of the protective shield, within which the collision is currently considered inevitable.
The whole process must reflect what a bee does to avoid the other bees.
This process must take place at a glance.
But unlike bees, the deviation cannot go up or down or diagonally, it can only be two-dimensional and in the direction of steerability of the wheels.
In this way, instead of the infinite possibilities available to bees to scan the other bees, the robot, as a possibility available, can rotate on itself, speed up and slow down.
The BR23C is powered by lithium polymer batteries, lighter and high energy density, which means that their life is longer than lithium ions.
According to Andoh, the instantaneity of the intelligent reaction is important, not the processing of data or even the ability to store it.
This robot must process some input in a few seconds and react.
No need to store them and react with intuitive logic based on previous maneuver data, so it only uses a few dozen Kb of memory.
There is no need for a gigabyte or megabyte memory.
This is the first step towards the development of a technology for the immediate avoidance of collisions that, Nissan expects, within 10 years, can be installed on standard vehicles.
Further possibility of application can be represented by unification with the GPS satellite navigation system which avoiding the obstacles present on the road leads to the destination.
They also found the very expensive child's name.
The written version of the $700 billion economic bailout law was drafted for the purchase of disproportionate loans, to be applied in several parts.
In the first step, half of the sum is spent.
In the new agreements extended until midnight on Saturday according to the timetable of the east coast, congressional leaders decided on a $700 billion bailout plan after a debate that lasted for days, Reuters reported.
“We have taken serious steps forward,” said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic president of the U.S. House of Representatives, who said it was only left to put the deal on paper.
Both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain, supported the compromise of the plan.
Treasury Minister Henry Paulson, speaking about the result of the compromise, said: the program will work and be effective, but there is still a lot to do. According to Pelosi it is not about saving Wall Street but about reversing the economy.
The written version of the plan was made public before the opening of the Asian markets at 8 p.m. in Washington (Monday night 2 p.m. in Central Europe), but it did not bring much stock growth.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will vote for the first time on the draft defined economic stabilization law of 2008 concerning the program, after which it will reach the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke to the Pelosi on Saturday night, then welcomed the news of the deal with joy at the White House.
"We are pleased with the progress achieved tonight and we appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and defend the economy," White House spokesman Tony Fratto said in a statement.
However, the program differs from the Bush administration’s original proposal, which predicted that the $700 billion would be spent all on the purchase of securities with disproportionate credits behind it.
Now as a first step you can spend up to half of the sum of $700 billion, $250 billion immediately after the vote of the Congress, with these the Treasury will buy securities with disproportionate credits behind, the fate of the remaining $100 billion will be decided by the president.
A special college will monitor the program in which the president of the Federal Reserve also participates.
The spending of the other half of the $700 billion depends on a new Congressional decree.
Under the law, the Treasury can apply a combined tactic: it can simultaneously buy loans, mortgages and securities with mortgages and other types of "poisoned" loans.
The purchase can take place through auctions and directly - have announced competent of the ministry.
The legal norm makes it possible for the companies concerned to participate in an insurance program where the Ministry of the Treasury guarantees the means of concern, for which the companies will pay an appropriate price for the likely damage.
Henriz Paulson said: “The law gives the necessary means for $700 billion to arrive for the urgent needs of the American monetary system, whether it’s buying the wrong financial means, or their insurance, or to avoid the risk of the collapse of a large financial institution.”
"We will take all necessary steps to make ourselves ready to introduce the law just signed into law," he added.
The directors of banks in crisis and waiting for state aid believe that the government will limit their prosperity, defined by the overseas slang simply as golden parachutes.
Payment limitations will only occur in some cases, and the limitations will depend on how the Treasury will offer the help.
In essence, the limitation means that if the ministry acquires within an auction, it will impose an overtax on the gold parachute, if they do not retire the fallen bank director.
At the time of the direct purchase of disproportionate loans, the government will intervene aggressively to ensure that directors’ money is not exaggerated.
In addition, existing gold parachute contracts will not change, the limitation is only valid for new ones to encourage participation in the program.
This is the first case in U.S. history of the entry into force of a legal limitation on the remuneration of general administrators - said the measure Democratic Barney Frank chairman of the committee responsible for the financial services of the House of Representatives.
In addition to this, the state has the right to take a share of the banks participating in the program, reducing the risk of taxpayers, since in the end they can also gain us if the economy, and with it the saved bank, will stand up again.
The bill includes that in the next five years the president must submit to Congress a proposal that has the power to reimburse taxpayers for expected losses from the financial sector.
Of course, there were those on both sides who expressed their doubts about the project.
“This is not what American citizens have asked us to not defend taxpayer dollars,” said California Republican MP Darrell Issa.
Her Ohio Democratic colleague Mary Kaptur believes that the measures were taken by those who are responsible for the Wall Street collapse.

The prices of industrial domestic sales compared to the previous month increased by only 0.1%.
The prices of domestic sales in the processing sector also rose to a minimum of 0.1% compared to July.
The largest increase in prices in August 2008 occurred in the leather and shoes processing sector (2.8%), especially bags and belts with 4.6% and the production of shoes with a 2.5% monthly increase.
The high price level of plastics and chemicals has caused a significant monthly increase (1.6%) in the product and chemicals sector.

The prices of paper production, editorial and typographical activities have not changed.
In the other sectors of the processing industry, prices increased between 0.2 and 0.9%.
In the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sector, prices rose by 0.3% in August in industrial domestic sales, primarily as a result of the dominant effect of the rise in the price of gas carried out by the authorities since 1 July.
Compared to 12 months, considering the domestic sales of the processing industries, the largest increases were in the processing of petroleum products (32.4%).
In the manufacturing sector of products derived from the processing of metals, the increase in prices was 13.2%, of 11% in the production of food, beverages and tobacco representing a decisive weight.
There was a drop in prices in the textile sector (2.5%) and in the production of electric tools and machinery (0.3%).
In other sectors of the manufacturing industry, the rate of price increase varied from 0.6% to 9.1%.
In total in the manufacturing industry last year prices rose by 10.2%.

In August 2008, compared to the same month last year, the largest increase in prices was observed in the energy and subsequent use sector (16.8%).
In the sectors producing consumer goods, the increase was 6.8%, for investment goods a decrease of 1.4% was measured.
The prices of industrial export sales calculated in florals increased by 1.1% in August compared to the previous month, compared to 12 months, decreased by 3.9%.
The Hungarian florin in one month weakened against the euro by 1.7%, against the dollar by 7.1%, compared with August 2007 by 7.5% against the euro and by 15.9% against the dollar.
Next year in the United States without a visa?
Kinga Göncz sees the possibility that around January 12 the U.S.-Hungarian visa-free agreement could come into effect - the Foreign Minister spoke about this in Chicago with the Hungarian representatives of the place.
“Now it all depends on the fact that overseas is built in time the electronic system of entry and control.”
However, he drew attention to the fact that in the new system there will no longer be an entry permit, however before departure tourists will have to register.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy will continue negotiations in Washington from today.
He will meet with Foreign Minister Condoleeza Rice, to whom he will hand over the medal of the Cross of the Order of the Hungarian Republic with the Star and will initiate talks with foreign policy advisers of Democratic candidate Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Barack Obama and John McCain also voted in favour of the bailout plan
Barack Obama and John McCain, candidates for the presidency of the two major American parties, on Sunday guaranteed their support for the $700 billion government plan to save banks, but there are politicians who claim the resignation of the Treasury Secretary.
Representatives of Congress and the administration after the marathon negotiations lasted for days, Sunday night announced that they had reached a principle agreement on the bailout plan for banks.
The Wall Street crisis and the financial package of freezing the frozen credit market have become the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain want to prove themselves more fit than their rivals to get the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the latest polls with putting economic issues at the forefront, Obama has again regained a bit of an advantage, while McCain’s advantage, obtained after the Republican convention with the appointment of Sarah Palin as vice president, has disappeared.
In a speech in Detroit, Obama expressed hope that Congress would quickly pass the $700 billion plan.
He stressed that the proposal contains those steps to protect consumers that he also supported.
“Now we have to act responsibly ... the danger threatens your work, your savings, all industries, complete economic stability,” he said in front of a crowd of 35,000 people.
He did not fail to define the economic ideas of McCain as outdated.
McCain explained in an interview with ABC that "all those who will be sent down with difficulty this situation ... but doing nothing is not a pathway."
The Republican senator reported that the proposal included the creation of a committee of control of the Minister of Finance and the limitation of the good exits of top managers, things on which he insisted.
Obama told CBS that McCain did not have a merit role in the agreements, instead he was in daily contact with the minister.
President Nancy Pelosi reported on Sunday that the House of Representatives is likely to vote on the bill by Monday.
Press review of the German-speaking world
The right-wing pole is intact, only within the pole the voters have become more self-aware - so Der Spiegel analyzes the weak result of the CSU in Bavaria.
Haider’s party is ready to rule Austria to prevent the red-black coalition.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
Franz Walter, in the online edition of the German magazine on the left, in the article The Bavarian Revolution devours his parents analyzes the causes of the dramatic defeat of the CSU.
According to the well-known political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber couple took office.
The Christian-Socialists have re-modernized Bavaria for decades and right now these modern citizens are moving away from them.
Age change is at the same time a problem of all Christian democracy, as well as of Angela Merker.
The defeat was not a big surprise for the CSU, but Sunday ended a process that exactly ten years ago had been feasible: the undisputed hegemony of a party-state ended.
Already 10 years ago, in 1998, the CSU had fallen to 47.7%, for the first time below the 50% threshold since the 1950s.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 Bundestag elections again in the period of the so-called Stoiber.
The reason for this is the consequent modernization carried out in the region, which devours the parents.
Sociologists predicted it 40 years ago, but they were wrong about the time, but the secularization, the results of education, the settlement of the East and North Germans in the developed Bavarian region could not remain without consequences on the fidelity of the voters to the CSU.
Modernisation goes hand in hand with increasing possibilities and the political consequences are evident.
The pole of the right is intact, only within the pole the voters have become more self-aware, critical, stubborn.
It is also surprising that in recent weeks the classic bourgeois groups have moved away from the CSU: freelancers, craftsmen, graduates and graduates.
Support for the CSU has fallen below 40%.
The press (diepresse.com)
The Viennese conservative newspaper "Who with whom?" in the article "The presidents of the parties are stuck in coalition issues" deals with the confusing Austrian domestic political situation created following the elections.
The SP<0xC3><0x96> intends to deal with the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
The <0xC3><0x96>VP prohibits SP<0xC3><0x96>’s intervention in its internal affairs.
The BZ<0xC3><0x96> is open to negotiations in all directions, the Greens still do not want to discuss coalition.
Elections have been made, now it revolves all around the coalition; in the discussion broadcast on public television, party leaders have just shown the cards.
Werner Faymann, president of the SP<0xC3><0x96>, has confirmed that he wants to negotiate with the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
The SP<0xC3><0x96> wants to show that cooperation between the two parties, in some regions and in the social partnership, is already possible.
Faymann has left open the question of whether he can imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, current <0xC3><0x96>VP president, as vice chancellor.
As he stated, the Schüssel-Molterer course was rejected anyway.
The repetition of this direction is not considered.
Molterer has reacted cautiously to red offers.
As he said, the collaboration will certainly not succeed if Faymann tries to interfere in the internal affairs of the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
If his party chooses the opposition or joins the coalition is still an open matter in the party, the issues need to be discussed in any case within the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
BZ<0xC3><0x96> leader Jörg Haider reiterated his openness in all directions.
“To prevent the Red-Black coalition, we are ready to assume the responsibility to govern,” Haider said.
J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka: We must break the vicious cycle of poverty and segregation
Today in Paris, the European Summit for Equal Opportunities, organized this year by France, with the European Union’s turn presidency.
L<0xC3><0xAD>via J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka, a member of the European People's Party Fidesz in her message to the plenary as the main rapporteur of the congress, drew attention to school segregation because it is the most serious legal violation affecting Roma children and, by the way, the most serious obstacle to their assertion.
Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs, on behalf of the French Presidency, and the European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities, Vladim<0xC3><0xAD>r <0xC5><0xA0>pidla, opened the conference at the highest level.
Invited to the conference were governments, European social partners and representatives of major European civil and rights organisations in the field of equal opportunities.
J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka, according to the press office of the Fidesz EP parliamentary group, reminded, in addition to discrimination in employment, that Roma are expelled from the labour market primarily because of their low schooling.
"Most young Roma do not have a middle-level degree, and as a result of poor-quality elementary education only a ridiculous number of them can achieve a higher degree."
J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka also stressed, as a fundamental human right, the key role of education in upholding human rights.
Investing in the education of Roma children can mean strengthening the economy of the Member States of the European Union.
In her view, it is necessary to make these links more widely known between the Roma and non-Roma.
In fact, the sooner a Roma school starts, the greater its chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market; through taxes paid for income and consumption contribute to the nation’s budget.
"The right of European citizenship of Roma must guarantee their right to quality education and the elimination of low-level and segregated schools," stressed L<0xC3><0xAD>via J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka.
In her view, it is necessary to unite the purpose and action of the European Union in order to speed up the processes of decentralisation of schools, and for this reason it is essential that the existing and planned anti-discrimination directives be properly respected.
"The vicious cycle of poverty, segregation and unemployment must be stopped, Roma children must be given the opportunities afforded by the democratic space so that they can contribute as citizens fully to the future of Europe," J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka said.
As part of the "European Year of Equal Opportunities" to be guaranteed for all, the aim of the European Summit on Equal Opportunities organised every year, since last year's meeting in Berlin, is to ensure a single forum to promote the anti-discrimination objectives and equal opportunities set at the state and European level.
CSU: mercy for a transitional period
At the end of October, the fate of the impassioned couple Huber-Beckstein will be decided.
Despite the bad election defeat, the headlines have not yet fallen, the discussion of personal issues has been postponed at the top of the Bavarian CSU for the time being.
Party president Erwin Huber and regional governor Günther Beckstein are still in their seats, the question is how long the mercy lasts.
The fate of the tandem, which suffered a catastrophic 17% loss of votes, will be decided by the party’s extraordinary congress on the last weekend of October.
The two highly criticised politicians have made it clear in any case that they are not being attached to the chair with all their strength.
They so tried to soften the angry entrants of the parliamentary group and the base that one day after the "Bavarian tsunami" claimed the personal consequences for the loss of the absolute majority.
5 years ago, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber then at the height of his career, the Christian-Social Union got 60.7%, but now after the coup against Stoiber fell to 43.4%.
For 46 years, the CSU has been an “absolute monarch” in Bavaria, which accounts for 18% of German GDP.
However, the conservatives in the southern region are always important to the Hungarian economy, in the future they will be forced to coalition.
As the first sign of the reorganization within the party, the Vice President and Federal Minister of Agriculture Horst Seehofer, considered a possible heir to Huber, gains a place in the narrow exploratory group that will begin negotiations with the Liberals of the FDP and with the Free Voters exposing right-wing values for a possible coalition government.
For a strange joke of fate on the list of Free Voters, Gabriele Pauli enters the legislature whose attitude against Stoiber had been exploited as an opportunity for a coup by the Huber-Beckstein couple to then treat the woman with great ambitions without regard.
The CSU leaders are now concentrating all their forces to stabilize Beckstein in some way.
In the meantime, he will also play an active role in Stoiber, who so far was plotting in the shadows.The former regional governor and former president of the CSU called 28 September the bitterest day of his political career.
On Monday, Huber issued some statements of loyalty to the CSU, according to which they deserved more support from the brother party.
Other CSU politicians have interpreted defeat as a warning to the CDU and Angela Merkel.
Merkel cannot be chancellor after the September 2009 Bundestag elections unless the CSU, which played a decisive role in the 2005 national victory, is re-established.
According to Merkel, who does not hide the disappointment of the fiasco, the CSU’s land loss will not have a negative impact on the great Berlin coalition.
What is certainly relative: it will not be easy to manage the injured CSU, but the crisis of the Social Democrats is still going on.
The SPD achieved its lowest result since 1946 in Bavaria with 18.6%.
Lukashenko-opposition: 110-0
Not a single representative of the opposition has entered the Belarusian parliament after Sunday's elections.
According to Russian observers, it is the sign of the well-being and stability assured in the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) instead it is explained by the blunders committed in the counting of votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the elections.
Although the legislation of 110 people of a country of 10 million inhabitants is devoid of opposition for more than a decade, before yesterday's elections the opposition gathered under the name United Democratic Forces (ODS) was seriously hoping that Lukashenko, with his presidential mandate renewed in 2006, represented himself in Parliament.
The ODS has thus renounced a previously assessed boycott.
Behind the expectations of the opposition was that Belarus, increasingly economically dependent on Russia, who asked for a credit to reduce the import of increasingly expensive Russian natural gas and agreed to give the Russians the gas pipelines in possession of the Beltransgaz situation they can consider other politicians who cross the country to be considered anti-EU policy, and intended to improve the relationship.
It referred to a dissent that the OSCE, when assessing the election campaign, focused on positive movements and not on shortcomings, such as the ban on running for a third of the opposition candidates.
However, the OSCE’s quick report on Monday also criticized the campaign, during which opposition candidates could not appear in the press in practice, and in particular that the opposition could not be present at the vote count.
Despite this, according to the opposition there is a noticeable improvement in the political climate: political prisoners were released, Minsk is also willing to a small confrontation with Moscow continuing to deny the recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia from Georgia, even if it considers a federal from Russia, with which the Belarus form a card.
We have taken two steps forward and one back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun - he told our newspaper Aleksandr Milinkevich.
According to the presidential candidate of the opposition in the 2006 elections, it is desirable that it remain despite the fact that "the power was afraid to have even one opponent enter a parliament without weight".
The opposition does not provide protest actions for the results, but rather tries to get voters the message of the need for economic reforms.
Of course we have many problems, we have to print the newspapers of the opposition in Russia, for the distribution of local authorities raise difficulties, but also so I see that more and more people support the change, even among the elderly - said Milinkevich, referring to the fact that his reimento reimento considered the social, even the main adequacy helped.
Due to the country’s debt and the increase in the economic deficit, it is only a matter of time before the social security “disaggregation that recalls the funeral silence” – Milinkevich believes.
Unlike the opposition politician, Russian observers have judged the elections democratic.
Sergei Lebedev, president of the Commonwealth of Independent States, told Russian news agency RIA Novosti: “Men believe not in words but in facts,” so the lack of opposition is nothing more than proof of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on, breakfast before work"
It never happened in the history of Palazzo Chigi that there were rotating doors for the entrance and exit of employees.
But from now on, this new measure starts against the furbates, against those who stamp and then goes to a coffee at the bar during working hours.
The anti-fannulloni novelty was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and the Secretary General of the Presidency of the Council, Mauro Masi.
"Turning doors - says Brunetta - are a tool to work better, with more productivity, more presence and more services," the minister said.
“Now a new season of responsibility and transparency is opening up.
This is reformism,” Brunetta said.
With Palazzo Chigi the installation is completed in all the palaces of the Presidency of the Council.
For Masi "the choice of swivel doors is also important from a symbolic point of view".
There was no resistance from the employees, the secretary-general assures: "It was a process shared by the workers and there was the collaboration of everyone."
In short, no more breakfast in working hours; no more coffee and cornetto.
Brunetta's word, which suggests, smiling, "a nice cappuccino at 7 in the morning is a holy hand".
In the course of a conference at the Higher School of Public Administration
In Rome, the minister further notes that "in three months the absences of public employees due to illness have decreased by 50%, i.e. 60,000 more people to work in a year".
And he adds that it is necessary to make the Public Administration more efficient
Italy, “whose wage dynamics have doubled in the last 8-10 years compared to the private sector and well above inflation rates.”
Meanwhile, thousands of public employees have come together to challenge the rules of the Brunetta decree adhering to the appeal supported by the Codacons.
"While the Minister of Public Service today sniffs out numbers about the least absenteeism at work due to illness - writes the consumer association - the people of 'operating puppets' is constantly growing.
In fact, there are thousands of correct and productive public administration employees in Italy who have come together to declare war on the illegitimate rules contained in the decree.
In particular, the Tar will challenge the exclusion of additional economic treatments for illness dependent on the cause of service; the extension of the hours of availability of the sick worker, within which the inspection visits are carried out, and other aspects contained in the new provisions wanted by the Minister.
Work accidents, Napolitano: "Critical prevention"
Every day, 2,500 accidents occur at work in Italy, 3 people die and 27 remain permanently invalid.
For 2007, Inail data in fact confirm that the white deaths were about 1,200.
Figures that testify to the severity of a phenomenon that remains one of the leading causes of death and causes nearly twice as many deaths as murders.
To draw the attention of institutions, social forces and the media to this dramatic issue, today Anmil celebrates in all the provinces of Italy the 58th National Day for the Victims of Work Accidents, institutionalized on the second Sunday of October.
“The worrying data disseminated by Anmil and the same tragic chronicles of these days confirm how crucial the issue of prevention at work is,” says the President of the Republic Giorgio Napolitano, in a message sent to the president of Anmil, the National Association of Mutilated and Invalid Workers, Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses his "living appreciation for the constant associative commitment to prevention in the workplace, the protection of injured workers, the assistance of victims' families and the raising of public awareness".
"Of course, an outraged 'enough', sincerely shared, has arisen in the face of tragedies that, by their size, arouse the cry of the media and the involvement of public opinion but the daily reality offers us dramatic cases, even repetitive in their dynamics."
Napolitano does not hide that "there is undoubtedly also a problem of resources: it is crucial to invest in training and information.
The numerous initiatives promoted in the field of education are of particular importance for a more direct awareness by young people who are facing the world of work.
It is necessary to keep alive the attention to the phenomenon, not to linger in the alarm about its social gravity, to apply and improve the legislative rules.
For his part, the President of the Chamber Gianfranco Fini stressed "how the phenomenon of white deaths constitutes an absolute social emergency, which offends the conscience of each of us and imposes a firm commitment to end it urgently."
“The data on work injuries seem to signal a slight positive trend, but that doesn’t mean that the number of white deaths is impressive anyway,” said Anmil president Pietro Mercandelli.
In fact, we would not want this “downward trend” to be translated into less attention, because it is precisely when attention is loosened that tragedy explodes.
“We believe that at the general level, there is still too little done to counter the phenomenon of injuries and the contrast can be exercised through multiple actions.
In our opinion, more checks and inspections are needed, but also a stronger intervention on the training of workers, and this from the world of school."
"There needs to be a further effort - he added - in terms of communication and raising public awareness.
But it needs, above all, a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers towards a phenomenon that represents a social emergency."
Mercandelli then denounced "the progressive deterioration of the levels of compensation protection for victims of work" and the "assistance derivative to which the system is pushing in recent years".
"The goal is therefore to return to the worker the insurance guarantee - he added - because the fate of those who are injured should not depend on spontaneousism or emancipation from time to time arranged by the legislator."
Mp3 Players Under Accusation, Put Hearing at Risk
Listening to high-volume music for an extended period of time using portable music devices such as Mp3 players can cause permanent hearing loss.
This is what the European Commission reports, which in a communiqué circulated in Brussels quotes the opinion of the EU Scientific Committee on Emerging and Recently Identified Health Risks (Csrseri) published today.
"From this scientific opinion - read the note - it turns out that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music with portable musical devices for more than an hour a day holding the device high volume risk a permanent loss of hearing ability."
“I am concerned that such a large number of young people who frequently use portable music devices and high-sounding cell phones can unconsciously damage their hearing irreparably,” says Meglena Kuneva.
"From the scientific findings, a clear risk emerges, and we need to react quickly.
What matters most is that we need to raise awareness among consumers and make this information public.
We also need to review existing control systems, in the light of this scientific opinion, to ensure that they are fully effective and keep up with the new technology.”
Brussels had asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, given the large use of portable musical instruments and the increase in the number of young people exposed to the noise caused by them.
"Scientists confirm that there is cause for concern and the European Commission will now examine, together with Member States and stakeholders, what measures could possibly be taken to better protect children and adolescents from exposure to noise from portable musical instruments and appliances."
At present, there is already a European safety standard limiting the noise level of portable musical equipment to 100 dB, but concerns are growing about hearing damage that may result from excessive exposure to such sources of noise.
You can limit these damage greatly by using solutions such as reducing noise levels and exposure duration.
In its opinion, the EU Scientific Committee points out that users of portable musical equipment if they listen to high-volume music (more than 89 decibels) for just 5 hours per week exceed the currently applicable limits for maximum noise allowed in the workplace.
Those who listen to music in these conditions for longer periods of time are at risk of permanent hearing loss after a period of 5 years.
This would apply to 5-10% of users of such devices and their number can be quantified between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Alemanno gives way to the Commission for the future of the capital
Today it starts, in March it closes, in June the sums will be drawn.
This is the calendar set by the Capitol for the work of the "Commission for the Future of Rome Capital", which settled this morning in its new headquarters behind the Terme di Caracalla.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will develop the guidelines for Rome.
Once the strikes are closed in March, the Junta and the City Council will evaluate analyses and projects, so that they can present in June the Strategic Plan for Rome with the "official bullino" of the Capitol and its mayor Gianni Alemanno.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and represents all political, social and cultural ideas," Alemanno points out, "It will have to provide proposals for an idea of the development of Rome, which political decision-makers, who remain the Junta and the City Council, will then be able to use.
There is no overlap of roles but only the will to have a place to develop a great project for Rome.
In March he will finish his work and then he will dissolve, because this experience must have a precise time frame.
In June we will present the strategic plan using the work done by the Commission for the future of Rome Capital".
To those who accuse the Commission of uselessness, since its opinions will not be binding, Alemanno replies: "It all depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do and the quality of its proposals.
If there will be quality, as well as in France with the Attali Commission and as I am sure also in Rome, its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often politics crushes on the management of the daily life and on the emergencies that happen from time to time.
We, on the contrary, want to look longer and farther, in a deeper perspective, working seriously on the development of Rome and its future.”
In addition, the mayor of Rome points out that "this Commission is neither a useless entity nor a carousel: it is absolutely free, it will not cost one euro to the Roman citizens and will serve to reason and involve the best intelligences expressed by the Capital".
For Alemanno, in fact, "it is necessary to have a strategic reference design, neither closed nor immobile, to allow our city to make an authentic level jump, which it absolutely needs, thinking with a united spirit about its future".
A future that, according to the mayor of Rome "will not be limited to the current municipal borders but will look far beyond" not only in view of the future metropolitan city and its legal status as Capital but also "in view of the role that Rome can and must play as the Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama? The first anti-American president. That's why
He wrote a well-known American politician who keeps us going for independence: “Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who with his decisions decimated the U.S. economy and had relations (as he does today as a private citizen) with the enemy of Islam.
Attacks on Obama are increasing as the election date approaches.
A Miami lady wrote in a web post: “This person is full of ambition.
Obama has a big toasty face: he believes he will win the highest office in a nation that has had two governors and five black senators!”
They are actually attacks that don’t say much; they are clearly racist attacks and don’t answer the voters’ question: will he be a good president? Then there are the polls; they all say Obama will win and with a good detachment.
Even in this case, there are those who speak with the heart but not with the brain.
A newspaper in Mississippi, in the southern United States, wrote an editorial: Once in the cab to vote, we know who will give their vote to the American patriot.
There comes out a side of the American mentality kept covered up to the last.
“Tell us what you want, then we’ll think about where to put the crucifix, whether on Obama or McCain.”
There are people who swear that if Obama wins, we will leave America.
Things never said before now, which almost certainly appears to be the success of the black candidate.
However, despite all this reasoning, the winning weapon for Democrats is George Bush.
They asked 1,500 people: What were the mistakes Bush made during his tenure? 89 percent answered: Iraq.
It's changing America.
In Vietnam this nation lost 50,000 soldiers and was sent home to kick in the seat.
In Iraq there are 4,500 soldiers who lost their lives and the Americans were not forced to pack their bags.
Yet, Iraq for the majority was Bush’s weakness.
Whoever takes the place of George W will have a huge task to do.
In the United States, the economic downturn is also felt by journalists: in the newspapers it is time to cut. And many blame the internet, the "killer" of the printed paper.
Five hundred American journalists have been questioned by the PEW Research Center about the state of their profession and mind control regarding the future.
Well, journalists today are almost all pessimistic about their future.
However, the newsmen have not openly stated that they are less concerned about credibility.
They don't feel isolated like they used to.
The problem for American journalists is money, the money.
The crisis of 2008 for these journalists is a crisis of destroyed economic model.
In addition, the cuts made in the newsroom, in the room where the editors work to put the newspapers together, is a big problem.
It is a problem that must be solved, according to the journalists interviewed, if you do not want the traditional journalism as the general public intends to shrink substantially.
A clear but complex pessimism pervades the American journalist today.
Six out of ten newspapermen and senior executives are convinced that national journalism is on the wrong track.
In the local field, the executive group is 65%.
Printed against broadcast.
It is not difficult for journalists to see where the web is going.
The major publishing houses are opening up a quest to the internet, for many seen as the "killer" of the printed paper.
The “economic pressure” that journalists are warning has increased to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed admitted that they are embracing the technology in the hope of “doing something good” for their journalism.
The biggest gap in American journalism today is between those who run the newsrooms — that is, the directors — and the reporters who work for them.
56% of executives at the national level are confident that their reporters share their values, while at the local level the percentage drops to 23%.
For some, this has to do with “safety at work.”
Executives who think they will lose their jobs within 3 years are at 47% nationally.
For staff reporters, it goes to 30%.
That of "safe work" at the staff level (our editors, etc.) in America is always on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work with a contract.
In a huge nation like the U.S., with 300 million residents and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV and internet employers often offer what they want and thus becomes a matter of "take it or leave it", take it or leave it.
Directors almost always receive large salaries, while the editor can earn as much as $10,000 a month, in addition to pensions and insurance payments.
For the holidays, then, the reasoning becomes complicated: every day after the first year, all after the third to reach 15 days overall after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, for their admission, "smell" often during the year.
It's all a matter of climate.
UNIPOL: TRIBUNALE ROMA, DANILO COPPOLA REST TO GROTTAFERRATA
The president of the second criminal section of the court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the request of real estate agent Danilo Coppola who had requested to be able to move from his city, Grottaferrata, to a home in the city of Rome.
Coppola is being investigated for bankruptcy in the context of the Unipol-Bnl escalation counter-patch investigation.
In the course of the process under his charge, last week, he obtained the discharge from the homeowners turned into an obligation of residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked that the real estate agent could travel from the provincial town to a residence in the capital.
According to the court, however, these moves (to which the prime minister gave the contrary opinion) would allow him to influence his company and access the evidence that accuses him.
The Elites in Danger
The phenomenon had already manifested a few days ago with the House vote against the $700 billion bailout plan launched by the White House: a significant part of Americans was, and is, more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
This is confirmed by the New York Times yesterday informing us that the current crisis is tearing apart the Republican Party, increasingly divided between its old East Coast soul, moderate, favorable to federal institutions and the business community, and its new soul, instead, strong, conservative, hostile to "the Center of the States" and to the world of finance.
The soul, by the way, which has become overwhelmingly alive with the vote I said at the beginning.
But this is just an example of the changes, of the great changes, which the ongoing economic earthquake perhaps foreshadows or already lets us see: not only in the United States but throughout the West and perhaps not even here alone.
Both in the U.S. and Europe, the crisis seems to work as an accelerator of long-time incubation phenomena that in the new climate are solidifying and finally come to light.
The first of these phenomena is the re-actualization, the extraordinary revival, of the double category of State-sovereignty in relation to a sort of renationalization of the economy.
The crisis, in fact, is a crisis of banking-financial institutions that, yes, have close ties with abroad, but first of all see the budgets of people and families living in one country, in one state.
Which immediately creates a political problem for those who govern it: that is, how to respond to the difficulties and protests of those people and families who, among other things, are also an electorate.
In short, the crisis appears economically global but politically it is almost exclusively national.
Political internationalism seems to be essentially out of the question or to have little to say: the shining proof is given by the European Union, which as usual is divided between the different interests and between the different state strategies is unable to decide any common policy line.
And so it is from the government of each individual state that everyone expects interventions, rescue and relaunch plans, new rules, and above all the dispensing of funds: since when it comes to the tights it is only the states that have the economic resources, the mass of financial resources that can try to put things back in place.
And they also have the necessary means and the legitimacy to use them: two resources of immeasurable value, in certain circumstances, of which probably no market and no international organization can ever have to the same extent.
This new emphasis that the crisis places on the state-national element is, moreover, in perfect harmony with the increasing importance that recent economic developments tend to attribute to a factor very closely linked to that element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, in fact, while we were convinced that we had already entered the realm of the network, of the increasingly sophisticated technology, of the intangible, while we were convinced that globalized finance was now destined to dominate the world, we realized from a point of view that our future, unfortunately, will have to take account of me.
All things that, look a little bit, can certainly be transported from one place to another on earth, but are nevertheless absolutely connected to a circumscribed space, to a territory.
So whoever finds himself to be sovereign, certainly has several more cards than those who are not, to those who have the misfortune of living in a place without crops, without oil and without water.
I come to the second novelty that presages a fracture.
Those who say Territory, State, Government, inevitably say Politics, and therefore Leadership.
In this respect, the economic crisis appears to produce two convergent phenomena.
On the one hand, the awareness of the objective need for authoritative leadership, the demand of someone who knows how to handle the situation.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit for existing leaderships, especially economic ones, proved so inadequate and full of shadows.
And together, something even deeper and in a certain sense disturbing: a discredit, an intolerance, an image of inadequacy, a sense of distance, which tends to involve the entire ruling class in a growing number of Western countries.
That is to say, it seems to be becoming increasingly clearer, in vast sections of the population, that before their actions are the same ideas of the social elites at the moment in the rise, their way of feeling and being, their culture in the general sense of the term, to have made their own time and to be more and more strangers to the outside world.
The demand for leadership, in short, subterraneanly fuels a branched but powerful movement of delegitimization of the ruling classes and the traditional political set-ups, which manifests itself in the sudden "revolts" of the elections or in the sudden turns of the collective humour of the latter, also with the crocodiles in the last and most recent times.
It has the impression that the traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rituals, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their formats would say someone, make it more and more difficult to understand, and therefore to represent, what it can represent, what is not economically taking shape in the deep layers of societies.
In the face of all this, talking about a “mass rebellion” on the agenda would be frankly exaggerated.
But keeping your eyes open is certainly not for nothing.
The super glue to walk on the walls
Defeat the laws of gravity thanks to a super glue and in the future walk on the walls like Spiderman.
It is the target of several American research centers and now a team of four institutes has gone very close to us.
With an adhesive of only 2.5 square centimeters, the researchers were able to hold a 100 kilogram body on a vertical wall.
The American journal Science has published the findings of researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the team of scientists is an evolution of existing ones that use a particular carbon structure, called carbon nanotubes.
“The glue principle can be imagined as a series of pipes arranged like a pile of spaghetti,” explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists have been inspired by the legs of geeks, covered with microscopic hairs that ensure perfect adherence to the animal.
Tests conducted on different materials, such as glass, Teflon and glass paper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the legs of these reptiles and at the same time "easily breaks off the wall," explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the University of Dayton's Faculty of Engineering.
"This material could be useful as a transitional adhesive," adds Liming Dai.
Perhaps to walk on the walls just like Spiderman? Perhaps yes, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use such as the connection between electronic devices, because carbon nanotubes are conductors of heat and electric current.
Other applications may be related to aerospace engineering.
Not a superhero at the moment.
OTHER RESEARCH – The University of Berkeley, California, is also looking for a new sticker.
In an article in the American Chemical Society magazine, Californian scientists presented an adhesive made of microfibers as hair that self-cleans itself of dust during movement on a surface to always maintain a perfect adhesion.
Pharmaceuticals: Never with fruit juices
Pay attention to grapefruit juice, orange juice and apple juice.
These drinks, consumed especially in the summer because they are disinfectant and rich in vitamins, if taken simultaneously with some life-saving drugs, alter their absorption by amplifying or decreasing their effectiveness, depending on the case, with even serious consequences for health.
Reaffirming the risks of fresh and packaged fruit juices, David Bailey, professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, who from the 236th national meeting of the American Chemical Society is re-evaluating the health benefits of fresh fruit juices in Philadelphia, re-launches a new alarm and a new alarm.
Grapefruit juice had already ended up being charged because it was thought to be responsible for increasing the effects of certain anti-arrhythmic, antibiotic, anxiolytic, antihistamine and neurological drugs to levels considered toxic.
PHARMACEUTICAL RISK - The same Italian Agency of the drug reported in a newsletter two years ago warning doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger arising from this mix and to pay attention to what you drink in case you take drugs such as Diazepam or Metadone.
NOT ONLY POMPELMO - According to experts, orange juice and apple juice also contain substances that inhibit drugs.
Along the list of active ingredients inhibited by grapefruit and other juices.
Michele Carruba, director of the Department of Pharmacology at the Universit<0xC3><0xA0> Statale di Milano, said: "These findings are usually immediately reported to the various international and national drug agencies that eventually change the informational notes of the drugs.
So always read the leaflets of the medicines that are taken and if there is something that is not clear to us, do not impress us but ask the doctor or pharmacist for clarification,” the expert told the agency Ansa.
The Nobel Prize in Economics for Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize in Economics was awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his studies of business models and the localization of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a Neo-Keynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is a well-known New York Times editor.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush administration’s economic and foreign policy choices.
A few months after the September 2001 attacks, in the days when Enron failed, Krugman had predicted in an editorial published in the New York Times that the second event would be more decisive than the first, in terms of consequences on U.S. history.
A prediction that sparked not a few controversy and that for years was rebuffed to the economist, but that now turned out to be accurate.
“I’m surprised and also a bit shocked at how quickly the memory of scandals like the collapse of Enron or Worldcom has disappeared from the public’s attention,” Krugman said in a statement.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a “great-value economist”, but also a proponent with a “very aggressive, particularly critical style against the excesses of liberalism of the Bush administration.”
Open Office, here is the third edition of the "anti-Microsoft" package
It is the day of the release of OpenOffice.org 3.0, the open source suite of personal productivity that aims to reach more and more users, from home to office, from professionals to public administration, as a free alternative to the best-known Microsoft Office.
After almost a year of work by volunteer developers, behind which SUN Microsystem monitors, the new Open Office is shown to the general public with different novelties: to the welcome screen and to the revised and less sparse interface, more substantial ones are added to the ISO version 1'.
Attention also paid to interoperability with the Office 2007 suite, Open Office is able to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting some specific features of some modules such as the one that allows you to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, useful for example for sending them via email, or the ability to import PDF files into the graphical processing form, while retaining the original appearance of the page.
On this front you can create "hybrid PDF" documents, which combine the typical graphics of the Adobe format with the elements of a spreadsheet or a word processor.
Collaboration is an element that has received several improvements within applications: in the spreadsheet you can intervene with multiple hands between different users, avoiding conflicts over changes, in the text editor, each collaborator is assigned a color in the comments for better recognizability during the review.
Some companies are also working to bring some OpenOffice features to the web (on the cloud, on the cloud), and in the coming weeks they are expected to release the final result.
The English version can be downloaded at http://en.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and has been added to the English version that was on the mirrors since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, as usual, the suite is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request, the installation CD can also be sent to your home or workplace.
And if the theme of gratuitousness can be a drag for the spread in the homes, it is precisely in the business area that Open Office the suite tries the big bet, already being able to count on several projects made in the public administration and in schools.
And there are also realities that offer an ideal training, consulting and assistance service for small and medium-sized businesses, which could open up business prospects.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for the corresponding videowriting of Word; Calc, is the spreadsheet that aims to replace Excel; Impress, for PowerPoint emulsion presentations; Dbase, as in the case of the most famous Access is the program that allows you to work on databases; Draw, is finally the graphical module.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that today we are almost 3 million and 600,000, with the release of the new version it is likely that you can also exceed the expected figure.
Kohl is also positive is the fourth case of doping
New case of positivity at the last Tour de France: it is the Austrian Bernhard Kohl, the Gerolsteiner team, third place and winner of the best climber shirt.
The news is on the website of the newspaper L'Equipe.
The 26-year-old Kohl is the fourth positive runner at Cera, the third generation Epo, after the Italians Riccardo Ricco and Leonardo Piepoli and the German Stefan Schumacher, also he of the Gerolsteiner.
The analyses of Kohl’s blood samples are among those carried out in recent weeks by the laboratories of Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the checks confirm the positiveness in Cera, the Austrian will lose third place in the Tour and will face the two years of canonical disqualification.
The head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, told the Associated Press that he had notified the Austrian authorities of Kohl’s positivity.
The 26-year-old Austrian placed himself on the final podium behind Spanish Carlos Sastre and American Cadel Evans, also earning him the best climber.
IMMIGRATED: NEW YORK TIMES IS CHIED, IS ITALY RAZZISTA?
Italy "from the country of emigrants has only recently become a privileged destination for immigrants" welcomed with reluctance.
This is what the New York Times asks in a long article that has devoted a long article to the debate on racism in Italy starting from the case of the young Abdul William Guibre from Burkina Faso killed last month in Milan for stealing a box of biscuits.
This case highlights what the Nyt calls the “paradox of the north”: the northern regions are at the same time those where there is “more integration and more work” but also the “highest anti-immigrant sentiment in the country and the highest support to the Northern League”.
Confirming the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the Nyt also cited the episodes of intolerance in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not only that.
The new legislation wanted by the League that tightens the brakes on immigration and facilitates the expulsion of illegal immigrants is also cited as a paradigm of climate change in Italy.
The Pope and the President of the Republic emphasized this tendency: “Giorgio Napolitano, meeting Benedict XVI at the Quirinal, asked that the State and the Church work together to defeat racism.”
Student victims of car-rent up to 900 euros for a room
The housing market for college students is not in crisis.
According to the latest Sunia survey, the tenant union, taking a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has now taken on very serious characters to the point of excluding whole bands of young people from the right to study for the very high overall costs that families of origin should bear - explains the head of the study office of Sunia, Laura Mariani - also reside in these cities".
In most cases, the rental offers then contain a series of violations: contracts of the free type, not registered, no fee limit, connected sub-rents.
Extraordinary interventions are needed for Sunia, which, through the revision of the taxation, can calm prices.
Looking at the details of the survey, we see that in Milan, for a bed in Brianza area, it takes about 450 euros; for a single room you go from a minimum of 650 (zone Bande Nere) to an average value of 800 (zone Lambiate, Udine and Fiera) to a maximum of 900 (zone Vitttoria).
In Florence, a bed costs an average of 350/400 euros, a room about 700.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in the areas close to the University, 250/280 euros are required for a double bed, from 370 to 500 euros for a single bed.
In Rome in areas close to the central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna) about 600 euros are asked for a single room, 450 for a bed in a double.
Values only slightly lower (550 euros for a single room) in areas close to other Universities (Ostiense and Cinecitt<0xC3><0xA0>).
It saves only if you move to peripheral areas: 300 euros for one bed and 450 a single in Prenestina, Centocelle and the like.
In Naples you need 300/450 euros for a bed, for a room you spend from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei zones.
In Bari you need 250/350 euros for a bed, at least 350 euros for a single one.
In smaller cities prices are lower in absolute terms, but have a greater weight in the city economy.
In the cities where the phenomenon of renting to non-EU students is more frequent, as in Perugia, there is a further anomaly: the increase of about 25-30% of the fee applied to foreign students compared to that applied to Italians.
Farewell old cinema Paradise, cities erase historic halls
The historic cinemas close in favor of the multiplexes.
“A city without cinemas is a blind city, it’s like a face without eyes.”
The image offered by the director Giuseppe Tornatore effectively photographs what is happening in the great Italian urban centers but also in the cities of the province.
The process of marginalization of cinemas, with the birth in the periphery of the large multi-rooms and the consequent death by consuming the mono-rooms in the central areas of the cities, is one of those events that seem inevitable and incontrovertible but also has all the characteristics of a real cultural crime.
To disappear are often historical places and loads of memory,"it is as if a friend, a acquaintance with whom we have shared a piece of the road and many emotions", observes the director of Nuovo cinema Paradiso, the film that twenty years ago he gave to Tornatore the Oscar award and the Grand Prix of the Jury.
The figures provided by the Anec, the main association of performers, speak clearly: in the last five years have closed the beating 316 cinemas of the traditional type, and paying the biggest price are mainly the halls in the main cities: 10 less in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Tor in Rome, 6 less in Rome.
Among the regions most affected by the closures is Emilia-Romagna with 82 cinemas lost, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
And to demonstrate that the first responsible for their disappearance is the advent of the multiplex, these are the three Italian regions that have recorded the most number of new multi-sale cinemas: 195 more screens in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 in both Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna.
“The Italian exercise has developed irrationally,” observes Paolo Protti, president of Anec, “it is useful that new structures are being built but the survival of existing ones should be guaranteed, because when a city hall closes, not all its visitors are willing to move to the multiplexes.
Not to mention the lack of appropriation for the fund in favour of the executors: the debt of the state is about 10 million euros.
It is shameful, from an ethical and moral point of view, that the government does not respect existing laws.
It would require between 16 and 18 million euros a year to support the sector.”
Interestingly, the case of Bologna, the first Italian city that, worried about the closures, decided to run for repairs with the signing of a protocol between the Municipality and Anec, the first of its kind in Italy, to protect and promote monosale cinemas both in the historic center and in the outskirts.
The rules include tax facilitation measures in favour of operators and benefits for the public in terms of mobility: spectators will be able to enter the restricted traffic area and will have special rates for the stop and in some parking lots.
“It’s an initiative that I like,” observes Giuseppe Tornatore, “and I hope that other cities follow the example of Bologna by setting up other measures.
It is true, however, that to counteract the overpowering of multiplexes, traditional rooms must also improve the quality of sound and image, because the audience today is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a theme that has always been important to me: the closure of the Bagheria Supercinema, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to do "New Cinema Paradise", which I had been thinking about for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass in front of the Rialto or the Quirinale of Via Nazionale now closed, where I have lived so many shared emotions, so as not to see the dusty posters I turn on the other side.
Relationship between politics and 'drangheta arrested mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to unify the choices of the Municipality to the interests of the Piromalli hull."
The accusations are heavy that the magistrates of the Anti-Mafia Directorate of Calabria turn to the mayor and deputy of Gioia Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for outside competition in a mafia association.
Gioacchino Piromalli, the senior mediator between the clan and public administrations, and his grandson lawyer, the same name as the boss, already convicted of association for criminals of mafia form, convicted of compensation 10 million euros.
"In contempt of any legal and moral norms, as well as common sense," the prosecutors write, the two local administrations had expressed their willingness to pay advice to lawyer Piromalli.
"It would thus have been granted to the hull - write the judges - to officially enter the municipalities by facilitating the already large possibilities of control and address of the public administration."
The president of the regional junta of Calabria Agazio Loiero does not hide that "collusions between local authorities and organized malavata are several" in his region: "There are areas where mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where collusion is almost inevitable.
But there are so many local politicians who resist the pressures of the 'drangheta, heroes who keep themselves clean.'
The arrests this morning follow those of July last year, with which the police announced that they had decapitated the Piromalli hull.
Since the end of April last year, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro was dissolved but already in 1991, and always due to alleged conditions between organized crime and local administration, local politicians had been lifted from the task of administering the Municipality.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, mayor of the Udc at the time of the dissolution, had been elected head of a centre-right coalition, after the May 2006 vote.
He screamed at the scandal when the Prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
He called in the case the then Deputy Minister of the Interior Marco Minniti, accusing him of having designed the whole for a political issue, but the judges, in the arrest order signed this morning, explain that the Piromalli hull had even come to request a change in the A3 project.
From the environmental interceptions ordered against Dal Torrione, write the PM, emerged "the willingness to meet the needs of an entrepreneur, representative of a larger group notoriously close to the Piromalli, uniforming the choices of the public administration to the interests of the hull".
When energy arises from the waves now come down into the field the big
It is an inexhaustible field, which occupies over 70% of the planet’s surface and is now being discovered by the world’s major energy companies.
Waves, currents, tides are the new renewable sources on which they have set their eyes, and now they are trying to put their hands, colossal like the Chevron.
The possibility of obtaining energy from the movements of the sea has been studied for a hundred years now and in the 1970s, in conjunction with the first oil crisis, research intensified.
When the price of oil fell, around 1980, the idea of exploiting marine energy was put aside, but now environmentalist instances and the new rise in oil give the sector a boost.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimated in 2007 that 15 percent of the world’s electricity needs could be covered by offshore wave-moving plants.
That would be twice the amount currently produced by nuclear power plants.
In addition, there would be currents and tides.
Colossians at the attack.
The first company to bet on marine energy was Enersis, which in 2005 signed an agreement to build a plant in the north of Portugal.
When the agreement was announced, it seemed like a revolutionary step.
Two years away, we are betting on marine energy more and more and among these companies have always voted for traditional energy.
“Chevron is studying technologies on ocean energy,” a spokesperson for a U.S. oil giant company told the Wall Street Journal, “and is considering cooperating with us.”
The cooperation in question concerns obtaining permission from the U.S. Energy Commission, which is necessary to launch a project to exploit marine energy in Alaska.
It’s a not-so-significant signal, especially if you consider that it is in Alaska that the U.S. continues to extract oil, and President Bush recently launched a plan for new drilling.
In addition to Chevron, there are New York’s Verdant Power Inc. and New Jersey’s Ocean Power to walk the path of energy coming from the sea and the sums invested so far, although not known in detail, according to the observers, indicate an interest in the rise.
Technology to be put in place.
Experts are talking about a technology still at dawn, also because marine energy does not escape all doubts about the environmental impact.
For now, plants such as the Portuguese one or some in Scotland are small and do not seem to create major problems for the ecosystem.
In order to produce energy on a large scale, however, technologies with greater environmental impact must be used.
And the choices are different: the Ocean Power, for example, uses a boe system connected to each other.
The thrust of the waves, which causes the boobs to move up and down, is converted into hydraulic pressure by pistons and cylinders inside the floats.
The pressure causes a turbine to rotate, which in turn feeds a generator.
Electricity is sent to shore through submarine cables.
For now, there are four such plants under construction, waiting only for federal approval and some of the energy could be used for a military installation.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, already produces energy for a shopping mall and parking using six underwater turbines in the East River in New York.
The movement of water when there are tides causes the blades of the turbines to rotate, creating a rotational movement that powers a generator.
Verdant said it has a long list of customers waiting for the necessary permissions to use the energy.
After the waves, the tides.
A particular interest, they tell the Institute for Electricity Research, deserves the potential of the tides right now.
Although it is an intermittent phenomenon, the tide is more predictable than wind, sun or waves and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
It is precisely on the energy of the tides that were like that of New York, Maine and Alaska, along with others that overlook the coast, have already invested 7 and a half million dollars in 2008 and expected investments up to 35 million by 2009.
