Gutach: Even more safety for pedestrians
They are not 100 meters apart: on Tuesday in Gutach, the new B 33 pedestrian barrier at the village parking lot was put into operation - in view of the older city hall.
Two plants so close to each other: intention or burglary strike?
This question was clearly answered by Gutach's mayor yesterday.
"The town hall temple was installed at the time because it secures the way to school," Eckert explained yesterday.
The Kluser-Ampel ensures safety for both cyclists and bus passengers as well as the Bergle residents.
The facility, which was officially put into operation yesterday, is important for the Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße intersection.
We have the museum, two churches, spa park, the bus stop, a doctor and a bank as well as the traffic flow from the residential area <0xE2><0x80><0xBA>Grub<0xE2><0x80><0xB9>.
"In the high traffic and pedestrian traffic, another traffic light had to come up for their safety," Eckert said.
This is also confirmed by Peter Arnold of the Landratsamt Offenburg.
“According to current measurements, around 12,000 vehicles pass through the municipality of Gutach on the B 33 daily, of which about ten percent are heavy-duty traffic,” Arnold emphasizes.
Therefore, the construction of another lighthouse is more than necessary: "Safety is just going through this," says Arnold.
A total of four traffic shows were carried out, a circular traffic was also planned, but due to the narrow intersection Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße was again rejected.
According to Arnold, when choosing the location of the lighthouses, everything was previously tested: "By means of an extra transporter loaded for us with particularly long wooden trunks, we have tested whether these vehicles can travel from the Sulzbach road to the B 33 without flipping the lighthouses".
The around 15,000-euro light bulb itself is “the most modern thing on the market at the moment,” Arnold explained.
The system is equipped with colored LEDs, which illuminate so strongly that the lights of the drivers can be easily detected even in the deep sun.
And it is also economical: the older lighting systems consume about 100 watts, the new ones just eight watts.
There are three lighting systems per direction of travel.
Arnold explained the technique of the new plant: it is equipped with two radar sensors.
When the pedestrian presses the traffic light button, the upper radar sensor tests the traffic position.
If the road is free, immediately comes green for the pedestrian, if not, it takes about 15 seconds.
Another radar sensor checks whether the green phase can be completed for the pedestrian.
“If a group or people with a disability go over the road, the green phase will be extended, so everyone will surely come over the road,” Arnold said.
Of course, the driver has to think together as a partner and observe the road.
This was not the case yesterday: barely showed the traffic lights green for pedestrians, a top-class vehicle went through - with bright red.
Josef Winkler has been writing about the needs of his childhood and youth from the soul for more than 30 years.
The disasters of his Catholic village childhood – the languagelessness, the hang of crude violence and dull sexuality, the narrowness and joylessness – have been described many times by the Carinthian poet.
The Büchner Prize winner is best known as a prose author, theatre texts are rare in his work.
For his performance "Weather lights on the tip of the tongue", which can now be seen in Garage X at Petersplatz, Gerhard Fresacher presents a collage of prosa texts.
For example, the theatre maker combines elements from the autobiographically shaped novel "Der Leibige" (1987) with prosiminiatures from "Leichnam, seine Familie bedauernd" (2003).
On the largely empty stage - an important requisite: a cranky sofa, on which it is supposedly copied and masturbated - the eight-headed ensemble hangs itself through the text material.
Director Fresacher seems to have little confidence in the text.
The 70-minute performance overwhelms the presentation with a wealth of directorial incidents, known from the repertoire of post-dramatic forms of play.
Especially the actresses come across the sometimes somewhat questionable scenic performances.
They are touched hard, immersed in water with their heads, tacked on the wall with their evening bells.
Forced into cellophane or mieder, they stumbled upon dangerously high stakes through the staging, either monologizing loudly or lying completely muted on the stage floor.
However, the text hardly communicates in this stressed manner.
The best moments have the evening when sung - the bandwidth ranges from Deep Purple to folk tune.
It is only towards the end that the overturned performance comes to rest, and Winkler’s absurd humor is flashing.
A black box in the car?
U.S. road planners are looking for a source of money to repair the decaying highway system, and believe they have found the solution in a small black box that fits into every car’s dashboard.
The devices that record every mile driven and report the information to the authorities are at the heart of a controversial attempt by Washington and the federal planning agencies to revise the outdated system to finance U.S. roads.
The usually rather boring area of road planning has suddenly sparked an intense debate with colorful alliances.
Libertarians have allied themselves with environmental groups and are in favour of the government using the small boxes to record the mileage traveled – and possibly also where they were driven – and then using the information to calculate tax breaks.
The tea party is outraged.
The American Civil Rights Association (ACLU) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of privacy concerns.
But while one cannot agree on a move in Congress, several states are no longer waiting.
They are currently looking at how to switch over the next ten years to a system where drivers pay per mile driven.
Thousands of drivers have already tested the drivers, some of them equipped with GPS monitoring.
This is really a must for our country.
“There’s nothing we’re just likely to use,” said Hasan Ikhrata, managing director of the Southern California Assn. of Governments, which plans to record the mileage of all California drivers in the state from 2025.
The way we pay these taxes is going to change.
The technology for that is there.
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund, which is funded from the taxes that Americans pay at the zapfsäule, is pledging.
In America, however, not as much is being tanked as before.
Cars consume less gasoline.
The state mineral oil tax of 18.4 cents per gallon (less than 4 eurocents per liter) has not risen in 20 years.
Politicians do not dare to raise the tax by a single cent at high spray prices.
“The gasoline tax is simply not future-proof,” said Lee Munnich, an expert on traffic law at the University of Minnesota.
Its state has recently equipped 500 cars with pens to test a mile-based payment system.
“This is the most meaningful alternative in the long term,” he said.
Bureaucrats call it a mile-based user fee.
It is not surprising that the idea is appealing to urban liberals, because, for example, the tax could be used to influence driving behaviour in such a way as to reduce pollution and climate-damaging exhaust gases.
California’s planners rely on the system to devise strategies to achieve the state’s ambitious, legally enshrined climate change goals.
But Republican Bill Shuster of Pennsylvania, chairman of the House Transportation Committee, has also stated that he sees it as the most common long-term alternative.
The free marketers of the Reason Foundation are also motivated by the idea of allowing drivers to pay on a backward track.
“This is not a tax that disappears in a black hole,” explains Adrian Moore, Vice President of Policy at Reason.
People pay directly for what they get.
The movement is also supported by two former U.S. transport ministers who, in a 2011 report, had urged Congress to move toward mileage-based billing.
The U.S. Senate approved last year a $90 million expensive pilot project that would have included 10,000 cars.
But the majority in the House of Representatives prevented the push and thus responded to the concerns of deputies from rural areas, who represent people who often have to lay many miles on their way to work or to the city in everyday life.
Nevertheless, several states and major cities are moving in this direction on their own initiative.
The most dedicated is Oregon, which currently hires 5,000 drivers for the country’s largest experiment.
These drivers will soon pay the mileage fees to the state instead of the mineral oil tax.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City is considering one as well.
Illinois is testing it to a limited extent with trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes the transport ministries of 17 states on the East Coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is currently investigating how the change could be introduced.
The concept is not a universal hit.
In Nevada, where 50 volunteers were recently equipped with the equipment, motorists were skeptical that the government could track any of their movements.
“Concerning Big Brother and things like that was a big problem,” said Alauddin Khan, head of strategy and earnings management at the Nevada Department of Transportation.
People didn't want it.
When the test arrived, the ACLU of Nevada warned on its website: “It would be relatively easy to turn the drive recorders into adult surveillance devices.”
There is no need to build a gigantic, bulky technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used to capture data on the daily movements of individuals.
Nevada is one of a number of states that are now looking for affordable technology that allows the state to track the mileage, but not exactly when and where.
So, according to Khan, the public would also be more relaxed.
Hunting for this technology has led some authorities to a small startup company called True Mileage in California.
The company did not initially act to help states with taxing motorists.
Rather, it was its goal to take a foothold in an emerging market for car insurance, where drivers are expected to pay based on the miles driven.
However, the devices tested by her are also interesting for road planners, because they do not work with GPS and only provide limited information that is regularly uploaded via modem.
“People are more willing to participate if their speed and locations aren’t recorded,” said Ryan Morrison, CEO of True Mileage.
In some of these public pilot programs, big mistakes have been made.
There are significantly cheaper and less intrusive ways to implement this.
In Oregon, the planners are experimenting with giving drivers a range of choices.
You can opt for a device with or without GPS.
Or they don’t choose a device at all and instead pay a flat-rate fee based on the average mileage driven by all the residents of the state.
Other agencies hope to be able to sell the concept of a distrustful public by equipping the devices with more functions than with fewer.
In New York City, traffic officials want to develop a taxation device that also allows parking fees to be paid, insurance to be paid only for driven miles, and speed data from other vehicles to be collected in real time, allowing drivers to avoid traffic jams.
“Drivers would be motivated to participate because of the added value of the benefits the system offers,” the city said in a planning document.
However, some traffic planners wonder if the whole talk about paying per mile isn’t just a huge distraction.
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the San Francisco Bay Area, officials said Congress could solve the problem of the failed Highway Trust Fund simply by raising fuel taxes.
An additional one-off fee or an annual fee could be imposed on drivers with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that consume little gasoline, so that they also pay a fair share.
“There’s no reason for an operation if an aspirin is enough,” explains Randy Rentschler, the Commission’s Head of Legislation and Public Affairs.
If we do, hundreds of millions of motorists are worried about their privacy and numerous other things.
Königsfeld: Small team is waking up
The Volunteer Fire Brigade successfully managed their autumn test despite a lack of personnel.
Only 11 men took part in the exercise.
Division Commander Hans Kammerer had chosen the property of Feder in Burgberger Straße in his practice acceptance.
There should have been a short circuit during sawing.
Two people were injured due to the resulting fire and the development of smoking, but one of them was able to send an emergency call.
After the first inspection of the situation by Hans Kammerer, two Wehr air guards were ready to enter the building.
After a short time, it was possible to find the first person and lead them to the open.
The second person had to be worn.
This was not so easy, as there was also a narrow staircase to overcome.
The building, a workshop with integrated stables for two horses, was not easy to secure.
It stored a lot of wood and also straw balls in it.
There were also electric machines for woodworking.
The first detachment operation took place via the tank in the vehicle.
A further line was made via an overflow hydrant at a distance of about 100 meters.
Now three deletion attacks could be designed.
A hollow beam tube was also used in the building.
Hans Kammerer also went to show during the exercise what needs to be achieved with little available staff.
In the case of serious cases, support is provided via the Königsfeld day-to-day deployment group.
The commander was satisfied with the course of the exercise.
Networking of universities and companies is important
During his visit to the district of Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald, the President of the Landtag Guido Wolf also made it possible to clarify in Titisee-Neustadt where the workers of tomorrow come from.
In the Förderzentrum Hochschwarzwald, he discussed this important issue together with the managing directors of the vocational schools as well as of the Kreisgymnasium and the chairman of the parental advisory board.
"Education is an important location factor," said Claudia Stelle, director of the Hans-Thomas School, which presented the networked school project Bildungszentrum Hochschwarzwald.
Wolf was impressed by the model projects for the training.
Since 2011, there has been a successful cooperation between the Förderzentrum, Kreisgymnasium and Berufsschulzentrum in Walderstadt.
He also praised the family kindness in the county.
"It is important to not only keep an eye on the family phase, but also the phase around caring for relatives due to demographic change," Wolf explained.
In addition, he said that more and more employees were taking care of their family members.
"Without the support of the employers, the resulting burden on the employees can lead to an end to the working relationship," Wolf said.
But no one could afford to lose qualified workers, he continued.
Another, particularly important factor is the networking of universities and companies.
"For those who have already learned the advantages of the region during their studies, with their acquired knowledge and skills, often remain in the regional economy, which contributes to the strengthening of the region," said the country's president convinced.
Because only if sufficient training places were offered, the need for specialists could also be covered.
In his opinion, the location advantage of the district is its advantageous location in the southwest of Germany, in close proximity to France and Switzerland.
On his train journey from Titisee-Neustadt to Freiburg, he also experienced the efforts already made for the expansion of public transport.
"Stay persistent and make sure that public transport is getting better," he said to the address of the local politicians present.
Experience an entertaining afternoon with music
For 15 years, the Kaul family has been inviting the Dieting seniors to coffee, cake and then to a Vesper.
Previously, the older compatriots were hired in the resting place.
In the meantime, this afternoon takes place at the nursing home of St. Josef.
The locals looked forward to the delicious cakes and cakes.
Later there was Wurstsalat.
Silvia Kimmich-Bantle and her father Karl Kimmich were entertained with popular melodies.
The more than 100-year-old natural stone wall as the front delimitation of the old schoolhouse to Kirchstraße, which is about to be renovated, is to be added to the renovation cost plan of the city of Braunlingen.
In the days before Kilbig, during the first work of the renovation of the front school, a small angular wall was installed, for stabilization and static relief of the more than a hundred years old natural stone wall with balustrade.
The next step, according to Alexander Misok of the Stadtbauamt Braunling, is to include the Landsdenkmalat in the plans and to create a renovation concept for the old wall.
After that, a cost calculation will be carried out by professionals, which will then be put on the table to the municipal council for decision and determination of the further procedure.
A decision on this is expected to be made by next year.
After the renovation, plastering and tree planting of the old schoolyard within the two side wings of the school, built in 1912, as a follow-up measure, the renovation-needed limiting wall must be refurbished from scratch and put on new construction.
The historic one-hundred-year-old boundary wall of the old schoolyard to the Kirchstraße is mainly due to water and frost damage, as there is no drainage, in need of renovation and has a bow tendency forward.
Deep cracks in individual stones attest to weathering damage, however, the wall is not currently at risk of collapse.
A refractory wall is a prerequisite for a schoolyard used by students, which is carried out through the current fortification works.
Originally, the schoolyard renovation was already planned in 2008/2009, but high unplanned expenditures brought a shift.
An important word in the historic school wall refurbishment, which has even been used for filming, will appeal to the National Memorial Office.
If regulations come from this side, then the town of Bräunlingen hopes for grants from the monumental patrons.
The students of the Braunling primary school, who are now being taught again in a well-renovated old school building with a new hall, can soon use the old schoolyard.
<0xC3><0x96>zdemir to receive jazz training in Stuttgart
Cem <0xC3><0x96>zdemir, Federal President of the Greens, has now become involved in the ongoing discussions about the future of the music universities in Baden-Württemberg.
"I think it's wrong to give up holistic education at the Musikhochschule Stuttgart," <0xC3><0x96>zdemir told the Stuttgarter Nachrichten.
Jazz and classics belong together at the jazz venue Stuttgart.
Thus, <0xC3><0x96>zdemir, who is considered in Stuttgart as a favourite for a direct mandate in the Bundestag election on September 22, opposes the Green-Red State Government.
This requires, on the basis of an expert study, a reorganization of the five music universities in Baden-Württemberg.
After that, the study programme Jazz and Pop will be transferred from the Musikhochschule Stuttgart to the Musikhochschule Mannheim.
U.S. border: "Super-Tunnel" to drug smuggling discovered
On the border between Mexico and the United States, investigators have discovered and shut down a “super tunnel” for drug smuggling.
As U.S. customs authorities announced, the more than 500-metre-long pipe between Tijuana and San Diego was equipped with electricity, railroads and an ventilation system.
Three suspects were arrested, eight tons of marijuana and nearly 150 kilograms of cocaine seized.
The tunnel had not yet been put into use, according to reports.
“These cartels are stupid if they think they could dig themselves under the radar,” Southern California District Attorney General Laura Duffy said at a press conference in front of a warehouse in San Diego, where an end of the tunnel had been discovered.
Duffy assured the drug gangs: “If you continue to build such tunnels and try to use them, we are determined to make that a huge waste of your dirty money.”
Both the U.S. authorities and the Mexican security forces are in a permanent fight against the drug cartel.
Since 2006, more than 77,000 people have been killed in Mexico in connection with drug crime.
Designed by Experts
Due to the intricate equipment of the tunnel, the investigators assume that it was constructed by architects and engineers and that the construction took about a year.
The rail system was equipped so that electric cars could be used there.
On the Mexican side, the entrance is located in a building that is 80 meters from the border.
According to authorities, a conductor leads 20 meters deep to the actual tunnel entrance.
The tunnel has a cross-section of 1.20 meters high and 90 centimeters wide.
It would also have been appropriate to promote illegal immigration towards the United States.
Two of the suspects were arrested in connection with the cocaine fund.
The third, a Mexican, was arrested for confiscating marijuana.
All three are threatened as the maximum sentence of life-long deprivation of liberty, officials said.
Since 2006, eight such tunnels have been discovered, it continued at a press conference in San Diego.
This is the first time that cocaine has been found in such a tunnel.
Usually, cocaine is smuggled in smaller amounts and not through tunnels.
This shows the “desperation” of drug gangs whose traditional routes have now been cut off, said Bill Sherman of the DEA in San Diego.
They would do anything to get to the United States.
No details were disclosed to the detainees, at least one of whom was Mexican, it said.
You will have to face up to ten years of imprisonment.
2014 will be a festive year
The anniversary of the city of Geisingen on the occasion of 1250.
The repetition of the first documentary mention is getting closer and closer.
If the year ends in just eight weeks, the jubilee year is approaching.
Geisingen and church houses were mentioned together for the first time in 794.
In churches, a document was produced in which both places are mentioned.
On March 15, there is to be an official start to the anniversary year, and since Geisingen does not currently have a hall, this start-up event takes place at the place where both were first mentioned 1250 years ago, in Church Houses.
As part of the anniversary, several events are planned both in Geisingen and in church houses.
Church Houses will be 1250 in July on a holiday weekend from 18 to 20 July.
Celebrate the return.
On Fridays with a festival, on Saturdays and Sundays with a festival around the Kirchtalhalle.
On this holiday weekend, there is also the Church-House Church Festival.
City Music Director Rudolf Barth has written for the city on the occasion of the anniversary of an order composition, which is listed on three dates.
On June 21st, together with the Sunday celebration of the Black Forest Club, on July 12th in the arena with fireworks and on December 13th as the first concert of the city music in the new festival hall.
This will be completed in the anniversary year and inaugurated, the official date is on the last weekend of September, on September 27 and 28.
On the occasion of the Geisinger city jubilee, a new chronicle is also released.
"But it should be a chronicle not only of Geisingen itself, but a printed work about today's Geisingen, which consists of Geisingen, Church Houses, Leipferdingen, Aulfingen and Gutmadingen," says Mayor Walter Hengstler.
And also the violining of today celebrates 2014 birthday, 1974 the present space with the communities was completed.
The new chronicle will then be presented on 21 or 22 November in the new festival hall in Geisingen.
2014 is also a year with many anniversaries.
The Strohglonki Madness begins on February 8th with an evening of wear on the occasion of its 60th anniversary, the Harmonie Gutmadingen will be 90 years old and will have the festive banquet on March 29th and then celebrate the district music festival from May 1st to 4th.
The Altenwerk Leipzigerdingen will be 40 years old, the Geisinger Schule has been at the new site for 50 years and celebrates this on May 10, the music club Polyhymnia Leipzigerdingen will be 150 years old and celebrates this as part of the fountain festival from 4 to 7 July.
The town of Geisingen was first mentioned in a donation document, which is owned by the monastery of St. Gallen, in 764.
The document was made in churches (houses), which was then a courthouse.
Both municipalities are, therefore, mentioned in the same document.
The reason to celebrate this 1250-year anniversary in 2014 is that the municipal reform is also 40 years old.
Council takes aim at sliding systems
Should the railway crossing "Am Hirschen" be extensively reconstructed in order to increase traffic safety?
Yes, the municipal councils have decided.
Schiltach will have to pay 220,000 euros.
Deutsche Bahn is planning to improve the Kinzigtal railway line next year.
In particular, the safety of rail crossings is to be increased - there are frequent collisions between trains and other vehicles throughout the country.
If the municipalities agree to the conversion measures, they must participate with one third of the costs, the rest are shared by the railways and the federation.
Schiltachs Stadtbaumeister Roland Grießhaber explained to the municipal council the peculiarities of the railway transition "Am Hirschen".
There, the city plans to build an excavation at the height of the tunnel mouth west of the railway line.
There, too, larger vehicles, such as those that carry longwood, could stand in opposite traffic without having to block the track.
Grießhaber therefore proposed to construct a necessary support wall so that the city could widen the adjacent road at a given time in order to ensure a smooth flow of traffic.
This was controversial in the municipal council, as some councils questioned the need for a road widening: Thomas Kipp put the mood of critics on the spot with his statement: "Do we have to take so much money for so few vehicles?"
Mayor Thomas Haas objected: The railway crossing "Hirschen" is regularly used for longwood transports.
Even wood from the "Kuhbach" area will be transported partly over this route, because the vehicles up to 20 meters long could not use the route at the Häberlesbrücke, because they could not turn into the main road there.
In addition, the route serves as a redirect for those vehicles that are not allowed to use the tunnel when the main road is blocked, Haas argued.
Since the Kirchberg and Schlossberg tunnels need to be reconstructed and refurbished, as is currently the case in Wolfach, the railway crossing "Am "Hirschen" could also have an important transport significance for a longer period.
The councils agreed to investigate what costs the planned expansion of the road would cause.
Nevertheless, the reconstruction of the railway crossing was agreed by a majority, with the view that the necessary support wall is built so that the city can expand the road to the subsequent direction "Bahnstraße" if necessary for encounter traffic to around 5.5 meters.
On the other hand, the conversion of the railway crossing at the grape wine brewery could lead to a completely different problem, which concerns access to the rapidly rising "Geroltzhäuser Weg".
The administration had examined the redevelopment plans of the railway from the engineering office of Brainlinger, as it had doubts as to whether the planned connection of the Geroltzhauser Wegs would then be possible without further ado.
The investigation came to the conclusion that it could not be ruled out that the inclination of the road could lead to longer vehicles sitting.
The responsibility for this, in turn, lies with the city as a street builder.
Reconstruction could therefore lead to liability disputes.
Since both the wood removal and the deflection worked in the current expansion state, one should not agree to the conversion of the railway crossing, Haas argued.
Also at this point, the risk of a collision of the train with a vehicle standing on the transition is significantly lower than at the other rail crossings, because it is located directly next to the central stop to which there is a good visual connection.
Even trains from the main station had to be slowed down at this point so that there was no danger of a collision.
Mostly, the conversion of this railway crossing was refused approval, since the city of Schiltach would have to "exploit" the problem with on-board vehicles, according to the councils, since the railway could withdraw from responsibility after completion of the construction works.
The Board considers that the changes to the "Vor Heubach" and "Vor Kuhbach" railway crossings, for which crossover agreements have already been made with the railway, are unproblematic.
Esa decides on large space missions: missions for billions
Remote planets, gravitational waves or black holes - European space agency experts now have to agree on two major projects they want to launch in the coming years.
There were 30 proposals to choose from, five are still in the race.
Faraway worlds.
Astronomers have already found more than 1,000 planets on other stars.
Whether there is life on at least some of it, no one knows.
The choice is difficult: Should you look for gravitational waves?
Or would you rather explore the origin of the cosmos?
Or are they going to Earth-like planets and perhaps discover extraterrestrial life?
These are the questions posed by the European Space Agency (ESA).
For their “Cosmic Vision” program, they are looking for ideas for two large space projects that are designed to drive research decisively.
The budget for such "L-Missions" is about one billion euros each.
The launch is expected to be 2028 and 2034.
At the beginning of September, the elite of European space research met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions.
30 ideas were debated, five of which have now come to the narrower election.
Numerous committees are considering the proposals, and the researchers are looking into them.
In the coming days, a final decision will be taken by the Scientific Programme Committee.
In total, Esa has selected four major questions to which the missions of the Cosmic Vision programme, initiated in 2007, should be answered.
What are the conditions for the formation of planets and life?
The exact processes in the formation of stars from large gas clouds - and thus also the formation of planets that surround these stars - are still in the literal darkness.
A large infrared telescope in space could penetrate this darkness.
And if a star has a planet, under what circumstances can life arise there?
To address this question, the 2017 Space Telescope "Cheops" is to launch, with which 500 already known planetary systems in our immediate vicinity will be studied in more detail.
However, the possibilities are limited, Cheops is a small mission with a budget of 150 million euros.
With larger instruments, astronomers could image Earth-like planets and even analyze the composition of their atmospheres and thus look for "biomarkers": gases that are considered to be an indication of biological activity.
How does the solar system work?
In the end, this question should also give an indication of what conditions exist for the creation of life.
An important role is played by the magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field as well as the particle radiation from it with the planetary system.
In our solar system, these processes can be investigated exemplaryly.
With the "Solar Orbiter", the Esa has already approved an M-Class mission (there the budget is about half a billion euros) for this question.
The probe is set to launch in 2017 and closely observe the surface and activity of the sun.
Jupiter and its moons are also of great interest to researchers.
They want to find out what role the giant planet played in the development of the solar system.
The Esa is the first of three L missions in the Cosmic Vision program.
The probe "Juice" (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer) is expected to begin its journey in 2022.
Eight years later, she reaches Jupiter and is to study the atmosphere of the planet as well as the icy moons Europa, Kallisto and Ganymed.
What are the basic physical laws of the universe?
The universe offers many possibilities to study matter under extreme conditions and thus to examine whether the laws of nature we know are still valid there.
Perhaps there are also deviations that could point physicists the way to a new theory, under whose roof all known laws of nature can be united.
How did the universe come into being and where does it come from?
13.7 billion years ago, our cosmos was created by the Urknall.
In addition to the matter that is common to us, of the stars, planets and living beings as we are, there is Dark Matter, whose gravitational pull of galaxies and galaxy clusters together, and Dark Energy, through whose action the expansion of the universe accelerates.
So far, the researchers do not know which physical laws were valid in the first fractions of the primordial nucleus, nor what dark matter and dark energy are made of.
With Euclid, the Esa has already approved an M mission, which is scheduled to launch in 2020.
With a special telescope, the probe is intended to investigate the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time across the entire sky, allowing conclusions on the nature of dark matter and dark energy.
Who could make the race
Of the 30 proposals, only two will remain at the end of the selection process.
In the opinion of many experts, "E-Lisa" has the best chance of obtaining a permit as an L-Mission, a sophisticated concept for detecting gravitational waves.
Physicists understand changes in the structure of spacetime that Albert Einstein predicted almost 100 years ago.
They have not been proven to this day.
Elisa could do that, hopefully the scientists behind the project.
The mission includes a detector consisting of two or three probes, which is stationed in the space.
Unlike plants on Earth, it could also detect gravitational waves that originated during the Urknall, thus providing new insights into the origin of the cosmos.
Four more proposals are still competing for the second L-mission: a large X-ray telescope called "Athena", which will explore black holes, among other things, "Icy Planets", another mission to the outer planets of the solar system, "Prism", a mission to probe the outer planets of the solar system, "Under-planet" and "Exoplanet", a mission to measure the cosmic background.
Proposals for the return of samples from Mars, for the exploration of the moon, Venus and asteroids, as well as for solar physics, have already been excluded.
Snowden is ready to “cooperate” with Germany on U.S. surveillance
Edward Snowden, the whistleblower of the U.S. intelligence service, has said he is ready to travel to Berlin and declare before the German Bundestag if the U.S. National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander do not give any answers about their activities.
German MP Hans-Christian Ströbele met Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he received asylum to discuss the statement in Germany.
In a letter from Snowden, which was presented to the media in Berlin on Friday by Ströbele, he writes: “Although the result of my efforts was proven to be positive, my government continues to treat a divergent opinion as a breach of loyalty and tries to commit political opinion with a criminal threat.”
But telling the truth is not a crime.
In the letter, Snowden writes that he is convinced that the support of the international community could convince the U.S. government to drop the charge against him.
The lawsuit filed by the U.S. Department of Justice includes espionage and theft of state property.
German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich told Time Online: “If Mr. Snowden is ready to talk to German representatives, then we will find ways to make that possible.”
Relations between the U.S. and Germany have been strained by allegations that the NSA has intercepted the phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Thomas Oppermann, the MP who heads the parliamentary committee responsible for the intelligence service, said the opportunity should be taken to listen to Snowden as a witness if this is possible “without jeopardizing him and completely ruining relations with the United States.”
Ströbele, a Green MP, posted a picture of himself and Snowden in his Twitter feed.
He was accompanied by two German journalists during his visit to Russia.
Ströbele said that according to the lawyer of former NSA employee Snowden, he would not be able to return to Russia if he left the country.
If Snowden says in Germany, then he needs a reassurance that he is “safe” there, according to the MP.
In his letter, Snowden declares that he is exposed to a "serious and ongoing" persecution campaign that has driven him out of his homeland.
However, he is touched by the global reaction to “my act of political expression.”
Citizens around the world as well as high-ranking politicians – including in the United States – have called the revelations about an uncontrolled system of comprehensive surveillance a merit to the general public.
In his letter, Snowden makes an offer to the German authorities to cooperate “when the difficulties surrounding the humanitarian situation have been resolved”.
Frontier Airlines raises charges for hand luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to claim up to $100 from passengers who want to store hand luggage on their flight.
Frontier Airlines intends to charge up to $100 for one piece of hand luggage and $2 for coffee or lemonade, even though the announcement on Wednesday read that passengers were allowed to keep the entire can.
The new fee applies to hand luggage in the luggage compartment above the seat, small bags under the seat are still free.
Frontier stated that it will charge $25 if the fee is paid in advance, and $100 for travelers who only paid at the flight deck.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said the $100 fee is aimed at moving travelers to take care of the payment in advance.
“We don’t want to calculate that amount,” she said.
Airlines began charging charges for the first and second pieces of baggage in 2008.
Passengers who tried to circumvent it have therefore packed as much as possible into their hand luggage, resulting in the luggage compartments over the seat frequently being overcrowded.
Fees are a way to move passengers to take less with them on board.
O’Malley said the new fee isn’t really about making money.
These are Frontier’s most loyal customers who would have clearly stated that it is becoming increasingly difficult to find space in the compartment above the seat.
Passengers who purchase your tickets on the airline’s website do not have to pay.
This means that a passenger on Frontier’s flight ladder may be allowed to carry a piece of luggage free of charge, but the next person will have to pay $100 for a comparable piece of luggage.
O’Malley said Frontier’s website and check-in procedures would be changed so that passengers would be informed of the fee before they arrive at the flight deck.
Frontier’s new hand luggage fee only comes into effect in the summer, there is no exact date yet.
Passengers often skimp on baggage allowances and other charges, but airlines like to resort to them.
They argue that the transportation of luggage costs money and passengers should pay for this service if they wish.
Many on Wall Street see the new baggage charges as a sign that airlines are taking enough money to cover the cost of flying after years of losses.
However, so far, most leave their fingers of fees for hand luggage.
Spirit Airlines Inc. demanded first charges for hand luggage three years ago, and later followed Allegiant Air, also a low-cost airliner.
The only other airline with such a fee is Hungarian Wizz Air, said airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely monitors the additional fees.
He estimated in a December 2011 report that the Spirit hand luggage charge would make $50 million a year.
Sorensen, who had previously held a leadership position at Midwest Airlines, recently flew with Spirit and was curious about what to expect at the flight deck if passengers were confronted with the company’s unusual toll on hand luggage.
“The boarding process was one of the smoothest I’ve ever experienced in my career in aviation,” he said.
I expected to see tooth decay and hand-held discussions at the flight deck.
“The plane was full,” he explained, “and the boarding was running like lubricated.”
Frontier also follows Spirit with the 2 dollars required for coffee, tea, lemonade or juice.
The company stated that passengers who bought lemonade or juice should keep the whole can and refill coffee for free.
Water is still free.
US Airways had briefly tried to claim money for refreshments in 2008, but rescinded it seven months later after passengers complained and no other major company had relocated.
Frontier’s move to collect charges for hand luggage if passengers do not buy directly from the airline is the latest initiative to steer customers to their own website.
Airlines pay online travel agencies like Orbitz $10 to $25 per ticket sold.
This provides an incentive for all airlines to move passengers for direct purchase with them rather than through an online travel agency.
Frontier, however, has gone the farthest in this area.
In September, the company started granting half as many airline miles when booking via an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, the miles were once again reduced to 25 percent of the flight route.
A flight booked with a third-party carrier with Frontier over 1000 miles therefore only brings customers 250 miles.
Passengers can also reserve seats exclusively for direct purchases on the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base at its Denver headquarters, but the business shrinks and the company loses money.
Revenue fell by 9 percent and flight capacity shrunk by just under 13 percent in the first quarter, according to the financial report released on Wednesday by the parent company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic has tried to get Frontier’s finances under control as part of the company’s sale.
Proverbs come from the Bible
More than 40 women attended the last women’s breakfast this year in the Evangelical church community of Bisingen.
The theme of the day in the church house was "Spokeswords from the Bible" and "Medieval Speeches".
Zita Köhler, the chairman of the church council, went into the biblical proverbs after breakfast.
"Speaking words contain vitals, regulations, or warnings," she said.
She compared several proverbs with the corresponding biblical passages and explained the meaning.
She called proverbs like, "Wooden eyewitnesses, be vigilant, like scabs falling from the eyes, throwing an eye on someone, the Lord gives hiss in sleep, washing his hands in innocence."
On several occasions, the speaker also let her listeners guess what the proverb was about.
Christel Dehner, a church councilor, said: “All good things are three, making blue, making things a little blurry.
She explained the meaning and origin of the phrases she called "bridges to the past".
Finally, a tombola was released.
The prizes were covered on a table and were humorously described before being handed over to the winners.
Among the visitors of the breakfast round was the mayoral candidate Roman Waizenegger.
Learning instead of workless: pilot project for uneducated people in tourism
A pilot project for the tourism industry was launched at the Mecklenburg Lake Plate.
Under the leadership of the Federal Labor Agency, 49 women and men who already work as uneducated in the industry will be qualified as specialists for hotels and inns over three winters.
“What’s new is that the six-month courses end with graduations,” said Carmen Wiechert of the Neubrandenburg employment agency.
The benefits are diverse: the participants would not be unemployed, the companies would receive trained professionals, which were increasingly lacking in hotels and inns, and the Agency would not have to finance unemployment.
The Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Neubrandenburg and the German Hotel and Hospitality Association (Dehoga) Mecklenburg-Vorpommern are also involved in the project.
NSA Says It’s an “Internal Error” and Not a Hacker’s Guilty of Website Crash
The shadowy National Security Agency said late Friday that an error had smashed its public website for several hours and not hackers, as claimed online.
“NSA.gov was not accessible for several hours tonight, as an internal error occurred during a planned update,” the spy agency said in an emailed statement.
The problem will be resolved this evening.
The claim that the failure was caused by a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack is not true.
In the early evenings, online server trackers noticed that the NSA website was not accessible for at least six hours, and this is still not the case for some users.
Earlier, an NSA spokesperson told ABC News that the agency’s sensitive internal network was “in no way compromised.”
Secret information is not in jeopardy, the spokesperson said.
At least one group of hackers claimed to have framed the NSA website with a DDoS attack.
In such attacks, the target website is flooded with page views until the servers are overloaded and the website collapses.
The cyber tactics are relatively simple and the attacks do not serve to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
The former super-secret NSA, whose nickname was once No Search Agency (No such agency), is now in the light of the public and looks at itself after the revelations made in the last few months about its extended surveillance program, and the results of the NSA’s work have been revealed in the home and abroad.
The growing controversy over the intelligence service fueled initial speculation that the incident today was the result of a targeted Cyprus operation.
The number of people without jobs dropped slightly in October by 22 to 1,307.
Although the ratio was 3.1 percent better than last year and also better than in September, "but we would have hoped for more", says Monika Felder-Bauer, deputy chief executive officer of the agency for work in Sonthofen.
Because so far, many companies have reacted to attitudes.
One reason for this is, according to Felder-Bauer: "We hardly have specialists in crafts, healthcare and elderly care".
Due to seasonal conditions, job offers for staff in the hotel and catering industry have also been launched since September.
In mid-December, the winter season begins.
The full background report can be found in the Allgäuer Bulletin of October 31, 2013 (page 33).
Bombardier's profits after drop in delivery numbers and orders
Canadian aircraft and railroad manufacturer Bombardier Inc reported a 15 percent drop in net profit on Thursday after it was hit by declining orders and deliveries for aircraft in the third quarter as well as contract problems in the rail sector.
Montreal-based Bombardier also did not release flight test data for its brand-new CSeries aircraft and did not provide any new information on whether the aircraft could go into commercial use in accordance with the ambitious schedule next September.
On the maiden flight of the test aircraft a month and a half ago, only three more launches so far, which makes it seem questionable whether the test phase is going as planned.
The results stayed behind the forecasts and led to a price crash of more than eight percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at National Bank Financial, lowered his valuation from “outperform” to “sector performance” on Thursday in view of the stock’s limited price potential over the next one to two quarters.
“Although weaker deliveries were widely expected for aircraft, we are clearly disappointed by the marginal development in the transport sector,” Doerksen said in a customer letter.
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries as the test program for the aircraft progresses.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, then we expect the market to become more skeptical of the program.
Bombardier hopes the CSeries aircraft series can catapult the company into the lower market segment currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was introduced to the public in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delays.
However, so far, binding orders for the CSeries have been moderate with 177, as potential buyers want to wait for the results of the flight tests and see if the company’s claims regarding fuel efficiency and cost-saving potential of the new jet aircraft are true.
Currently, there are a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies.
Chairman of the Board Pierre Beaudoin is confident that Bombardier will achieve its goal of 300 binding orders at the start of commercial use of the jet.
On Thursday, the management also assured analysts and media that the program was on schedule.
“The test aircraft has not remained on the ground longer than expected,” Beaudoin said at a conference call, adding that ground tests and software updates had been put in place during the aircraft’s stand-by time.
Every manufacturer has a different plan.
We have decided to take a first flight and then attach a revision period, which we have also done.
This is done throughout the entire flight program.
The second of five test aircraft is expected to launch in the coming weeks, the rest shortly thereafter, the company said.
Still, analysts remain skeptical whether the first customer can take on a CSeries aircraft twelve months after the maiden flight.
Bombardier said it is reviewing the commissioning planning (EIS) and will update it in the coming months.
“The slow progress of the flight test – although obviously consistent with Bombardier’s internal planning – reinforces our view that commissioning is moving to the first quarter of 2015,” Doerksen said.
In the third quarter ending September 30, Bombardier’s net profit fell to $147 million or 8 cents per share of $172 million or 9 cents per share in the previous year.
The adjusted profit per share is unchanged at 9 cents.
Revenue declined slightly from 4.2 to 4.1 billion dollars.
Analysts had expected a profit of 10 cents per share and a turnover of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world’s fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer says it delivered 45 aircraft in this quarter, down from 57 last year.
Net orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26.
The order inventory in the aerospace sector amounted to $32.9 billion on September 30 and was thus unchanged from December 31.
“In the aerospace sector, the results were within the scope of our specifications, but the low order intake and overall market conditions were disappointing,” said Beaudoin.
Revenue in the aerospace sector fell by 13 percent to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world’s largest railroad manufacturer, announced that sales in this segment have increased by almost 11 percent to $2.1 billion.
Orders in the transport sector amounted to $32.6 billion on September 30 and were slightly increased compared to December 31.
The profit margin in the transport sector has been impaired by settlement problems in some large contracts.
According to the company management, there will be new requirements for the fourth quarter.
In the afternoon trading on Thursday, the Bombardier stock declined by 8.5 percent and stood at 4.83 Canadian dollars, also after it was announced that Google Chief Financial Officer Patrick Pichette would move to the board.
Brazil’s Embraer SA, the world’s third-largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and Bombardier’s closest rival, reported a 10 percent decline in quarterly earnings on Thursday.
USA: Shots at Los Angeles Airport
An unknown person fired shots at LAX airport on Friday morning (local time).
While the airport management told Twitter that the shooter was in custody, the Los Angeles Times reported that the man was dead.
A security guard was also killed.
The media also reported a number of injuries.
U.S. President Barack Obama will be continuously informed of the situation, White House spokesman Jay Carney said.
The incident occurred in Terminal 3, eyewitnesses said they saw a gunman with a gun in one of the exit halls, several media reported.
A traveller told CNN that many people had sought shelter in panic.
Travellers would scream and cry children.
Panic broke out among those waiting, many had been hiding behind chairs out of fear.
He heard two shots, a traveller told the Los Angeles Times.
An employee of the TSA security agency suffered a gunshot wound to the foot.
The scene was “like in a movie.”
After that, he himself was taken to a security area, the man reported.
The shots are said to have fallen near a security checkpoint.
Airport Building Evacuated
TV footage showed how many ambulances and police cars were driving in front of a terminal.
Hundreds of people were evacuated from the building.
Users posted photos on Twitter of a Special Operations Command and a gun lying on the ground.
The incident began at 9:30 a.m. (local time), the airport management said on Twitter.
The access roads were blocked, resulting in a long recession, according to CNN.
Until landings, air traffic had been temporarily halted, it said.
However, there were also several pilots to watch on CNN at the start.
Terminal 3 is mainly served by smaller U.S. airlines.
Los Angeles LAX Airport is one of the largest airports in the United States.
Cocaine-dependent lawyer, who warned drug boss of police investigation, must go to jail
Basharat Ditta, 42, gave information to Underworld Size Neil Scarborough
The lawyer was afraid that his secret drug addiction could come to light
He was sentenced by the Liverpool Crown Court to three years in prison.
A well-known criminal defender who warned a drug baron before a major police investigation because he was afraid his secret drug addiction might be discovered was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, provided underworld-sized Neil Scarborough with sensitive information about investigations into his drug-trafficking activities after being compromised by his own cocaine addiction.
The lawyer, acclaimed by criminals as “first-class” with the nickname “Bash,” was arrested in his home in 2011 after police had monitored Scarborough, whom he had represented in a previous drug trial.
Officials watched Scarborough (32) deliver three bags of cocaine at the lawyer’s house in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was with colleagues at a bar dinner.
The investigations revealed that Ditta regularly consumed Class A drugs after tests found traces of cocaine in his hair, on his wallet and on credit cards.
Over an eight-month period between January and August 2011, he attempted to illegally obtain information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his partners.
All four suspects were then monitored by police as part of a major investigation into the trafficking of heroin and cocaine in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
Together with 32 other people, they were later arrested after police secured <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million worth of heroin and cocaine and <0xC2><0xA3>200,000 in cash during a series of house searches.
Ditta, 42, gave information to the criminals because he feared his drug addiction could become public.
Today, Ditta, who works for Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn, was found guilty and convicted at Liverpool Crown Court after a three-week trial in two counts of obstruction of justice.
In an earlier interview, he admitted to the possession of cocaine.
The lawyer was transferred after police found out during their investigations into Scarborough that he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigators followed the suspect and saw him go to Ditta’s house and put the drugs in a black golf glove with a purity of 60 percent under the lawyer’s trash can.
Shortly after delivering the drugs, Scarborough regularly telephoned Ditta, who was at dinner at the Blackburn Rovers football stadium in Ewood Park.
The lawyer returned home, recovered the drugs and then nine communications were exchanged between the two.
It was reported in court that Ditta was a "regular consumer" of cocaine after tests of Class A drugs were discovered in his hair, wallet, and on his credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested, but disputed to take cocaine and said he had spoken to the alleged dealer because he was his client, and claimed her discussion was subject to the “lawyer secret.”
During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards, but they were secured and a hair sample was taken from him.
During the police interrogation, he stated that he operated an office under his private address as well as at the workplace and clients would call him home for legal matters.
In court, it was revealed that he had called important drug dealers, some of whom he had previously represented, for significant arrests and informed investigators of what they knew about them.
As Anne Whyte said, “A criminal attorney should know better than anyone else that you don’t break the law.”
Ditta is accused of misusing his position as a criminal defender because he has been too involved with certain clients.
The relationship in question is not just that of a drug dealer, but of a drug dealer who supplies his lawyer with drugs.
Some of his communications were no doubt legitimate, because he was the lawyer of these persons.
However, this went far beyond the boundaries of a normal relationship between a lawyer and a client.
He acted against the police investigations as far as possible, so that they could continue to pursue their criminal activities.
Mr Ditta thus brought his professional status to a halt.
He was too close to certain clients, especially Scarborough, and he allowed his independence to be compromised.
“If I were a corrupt lawyer who I am not and wanted to pass on information to Scarborough, I wouldn’t wait 15 hours, I would do it immediately.”
But after the hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstead of the Lancashire Police said, “Mr Ditta took the step from a criminal defenseman to a criminal the moment he started acquiring drugs from organized criminals.”
His dependence on cocaine led to a hopeless compromise and made him receptive to the motives of leading members of organized crime who commissioned him to obtain valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and ensure trust and confidence in the public.
Ditta has lost that trust and tried to hide behind the facade of his profession.
Lancashire’s Serious and Organized Crime Unit led the investigations against Ditta, which also led to a conviction in three cases for possession of cocaine and judicial impediment, which underscores our determination to bring criminals to court.
This case should be a warning to criminals and show that no one can escape the arm of the law.
We'll find you and bring you to court.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after pleading guilty to the conspiracy to trade heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty-five others involved in the drug trade were sentenced to a total of 153 years for drug offences.
On his website, Ditta published an area of questions and answers about himself in which he claimed his dream job was to represent as a lawyer client in the death cell in America, his ultimate guest at dinner was Mohammed Ali, and inequality of opportunity was the motivation for his work.
The Revolutionary Work of Church Music
At the end of the celebrations on the occasion of his 160th anniversary, the Dunninger Liederkranz will frame two services with the "Deutsche Messe" by Franz Schubert.
After the great success of the musical "Rock my Life", which delighted the viewers in the spring of this year, the song circle will enrich two services at the end of the anniversary year with the performance of the Deutsche Messe by Franz Schubert.
On Saturday, October 26, this extraordinary Mass will be heard from 19 during the evening Mass in the St. Martinus Church Dunningen and on Sunday, October 27, from 10.15 at the service at the St. John Baptist Church in Lackendorf.
The so-called Deutsche Messe, with the original title "Songs to Celebrate the Holy Sacrifice of Mass", D 872, is a spiritual musical work of the composer Franz Schubert from 1826 and was considered almost revolutionary at the time of its emergence.
The Mass is presented as part of the services, as the client Johann Philipp Neumann had in mind.
Under the direction of Hermann Schneider, the choir is accompanied by the brass band of the music club Frohsinn Tennenbronn and Noemi Lokodi at the organ.
Haslach: Skepsis wanes confidence in view
With the elections to the parish council in 2015, for example, the basics will change in the soul care unit Haslach (SE).
There is only one parish council for all six parishes.
In a joint meeting on Saturday, the committees from Haslach, Hofstetten, Mühlenbach, Fischerbach, Steinach and Welschensteinach prepared for the changes.
For the basic decisions of the diocese have nothing to change and it is up to the parish councils to implement them as satisfactorily as possible.
Over the course of the day, it became particularly clear: the skepticism about the new fades with hesitation but with confidence.
From the ideas and expectations of the innovations in 2015 to concrete proposals on the future composition and size of the parish council, the highly constructive discussions of the six bodies with the chief officials of the soul care team ranged.
Regional Dean Georg Schmitt explained, by means of a presentation, the newly drafted guidelines for soul care units in the Archdiocese of Freiburg.
In the future, SE Haslach as a church community will form a body of public law, which will enter into the rights and obligations of the so far six individual church communities.
There will only be a common parish council and a founding council, in which the parish power of the office is represented.
At least two elected members shall be represented from each parish, in which six parishes so-called community teams are formed locally.
Their task will be to promote church life in the future.
When it came to the question of the finances of the individual parishes, there was a considerable need for discussion.
The innovations provide that the accumulated funds in the parishes will remain obligatory.
On the other hand, the liabilities are transferred to the community as a whole.
Especially with regard to the large planned investments, the commitment of which then meets all parishes, there were great concerns.
"In the past, too, only projects have been invested that could be managed by the individual parishes alone," relative haslachs parish council chairman Bruno Prinzbach.
Practical experience with a joint board of five parishes illustrated Barbar Ritter, the chairman of the board in the soul care unit Schutterwald-Neuried.
They had made themselves the task in 2006, “Become one, stay five” and had to realize that it wasn’t that easy.
The committees of the Haslacher Soil Care Unit then decided to answer the questions about the future composition and size of the common parish council as well as the practical work of the community teams.
The elaborations will be concretised at further meetings and decided at a further joint meeting of all six bodies next spring.
In the end, the parish council of Michael Schöner from Steinach presented the new logo of the Soul Care Unit, which was approved by a clear majority.
In Pfullendorf, electricity becomes more expensive
The citizens of Pfullendorf have to adjust to higher electricity costs.
As confirmed by the Managing Director of the City Works, Jörg-Arne Bias, compared to the SÜDKURIER, an additional cost of 70 to 90 euros per year applies to a four-person Pfullendorfer family.
A major reason for the upcoming price increase is the increase in the so-called EEG conversion from 5,277 cents per kilowatt-hour to 6.3 cents per kilowatt-hour.
This relocation is re-established each year in October by the four operators of the major power lines.
These quantify the additional costs arising from the energy transition, which they can raise by relocation above the electricity price.
The Stadtwerke Pfullendorf form the last link in this chain.
The Supervisory Board of the energy company had even assumed a higher turnaround in its forecasts, as Jörg-Arne Bias reported.
Now, the concrete figures need to be calculated before the city halls could inform their customers next week about the exact price increase.
"We assume an increase of 1 cent plus x," says Bias, with the number likely to be close to 2 cents.
Ampel on permanent red: Watch out for waiting time
Sometimes a light bulb just doesn't turn green.
The contact loop in the street does not respond, or the light sign is defective.
What to do - driving in red?
If an affected person has waited long enough at a red light and the crossing is free, he can continue, explains Stuttgart lawyer Ralf Becker in the magazine "Motorcycle".
However, the waiting time must be “appropriate”, which can be interpreted differently from case to case.
Becker advises to hold on for at least five minutes before starting a malfunction of the lights.
However, whoever continues the journey despite the red light must be aware that he is fully to blame for an accident caused by it.
Those who are patient for less than five minutes may not wait long enough, Becker warns and refers to a decision of the Oberlandesgericht Hamm.
In the case negotiated, after about three minutes of continuous redness, a driver had ignored the lights and had to be responsible for a negligent red light failure.
The light bulb was not defective, but switched to green a little later.
A driving ban was spared him because of the special situation - but the fine was not.
The City Council is pleased with a solid budget
Whenever it comes to budgeting in municipal meetings, Mayor Ralph Gerster has a good laugh.
The municipal sack in Herdwangen-Schönach is well filled and the administration has not been aware of debt since 2005.
In this sense, the financial year 2012 can also be booked as a full success.
This was evident in the presentation of the annual accounts for 2012.
As Andrea Rothmund explained, the administrative budget with around 7.6 million euros was over one million euros higher than planned.
The surplus from the administrative budget is also about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.8 million above the approach.
The surplus is mainly due to higher income tax revenues and the share of the municipality in the income tax.
The asset budget was also clearly above the planned values.
Instead of the planned 1.5 million euros, it was 2.5 million euros last year.
"This is essentially due to the higher allocation from the administrative budget," says Rothmund.
As fewer investments have been made than planned in the 2012 financial year, the return on investment has also fallen higher.
In total, the overall deposit could be increased by around 2.1 million euros to now a total of 4.9 million euros.
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and her team for the good work.
"You don't just shake a work like that out of your sleeve," Gerster praised with a look at the annual report.
He and the council members were obviously happy about the good numbers.
It may sound paradoxical, but it is these good figures that could soon cost the citizens.
Due to the good financial situation, the municipality in the past was able to refrain from high holdings.
As a result, however, according to Gerster, subsidies have been cut off by the country more often.
There are prerequisites for these grants from various balancing posts.
Among other things, the cities and municipalities applying for grants must have certain holdings.
"We need to look at the issue of leverage, as in the coming years there will be investments for which we would like to have grants," Gerster announced in this regard.
Nagold: Hugo Wermter for 60 years in the choir
With 60 years as a singer, Hubert Wermter’s history at the men’s singing club Cäcilia is almost twice as long as that of the autumn festival, in the context of which he was solemnly honored.
Hubert Wermter stood, as usual, in the colours of his men's singing club on stage.
Even after 60 years he still enjoys singing with the now perhaps more than lovingly won choir.
Wermter was also active in the club, including for 28 years as a member of the committee.
For his commitment and loyalty to the association, he received several awards: Jörg Kohr, pastoral referent on behalf of the Cäcilienverband Rottenburg-Stuttgart, presented him - since the choir is also a church choir - with a document of the association and one of Bishop Gebhard Prinzen.
His fellow singers handed him the document of the German choir association as well as an engraved zinn counter.
In addition to the honor, the 31st Autumn Festival took place in the usual stages: with the MGV Betra, the Liederkranz Salzstetten, the Singer Department Baisingen and the local music club, the Fullmaringers had loaded a colorful mix of different choirs and singing styles, which entertained the around 400 visitors.
The MGV Vollmaringen opened with moody songs such as "Im Weinparadies" and "Lustig, her brothers".
To her honorary singer Hubert Wermter, they prepared a small stand - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's "Bundeslied".
The men's singing association Betra also sang classical choral songs such as "Jagderwerbungen" by Julius Wengert, "Wide, far away" by Hubert Goisern as well as the folk song "When you pass through the valley".
With his mixed choir and his women's group - the "impulse choir" - the song Kranz Salzstetten provided the women's quota of the festival.
The mixed choir kidnapped with the Neapolitan folklore "Santa Lucia" and "Eviva Espana" by Antos Gus into foreign countries, while the "impulse choir" also resorted to foreign languages: "Liberatio" and "Hey Jew" were part of their program.
The singing department of the Baisinger Sportverein came back with "What's the swob?" by Hans Süssmuth and Robert Papiert's "Bierlied" to native fields, where the Vollmaringer Musikverein offered the crowning musical ending.
For the children there was a small side program - "Oma Hanne" alias Hannelore Stollsteimer ran a casperle theatre and read a few stories that the children spent well over lunch.
Children's dreams come true
The kindergartens and kindergartens in Zollernalbkreis receive mail these days.
The Schwarzwalder Bote, in cooperation with Bauhaus and the Zollernalb Savings Bank, wants to support the facilities in the realization of their construction and decoration requests.
Does the kindergarten need a new sandbox?
All kindergartens, kindergartens and kindergartens from the entire Zollernalbkreis can participate in the action.
If you have a construction or decoration request for your furnishing, you can apply for it at the Black Forest Ambassador.
Be creative with your children and surprise the jury of the Action Kindergarten-Baustelle.
A jury, consisting of representatives of Schwarzwälder Bote, Bauhaus and Sparkasse Zollernalb, selects three wishes from all submissions.
What are the prerequisites for participation?
The wish should be realized with building material in the value of a maximum of 2000 euros and on a (action) day.
In addition, the winner himself has to take care of many hardworking builders.
What does it have to do with the day of the action and the helpers?
Bauhaus provides the material with the support of the savings bank Zollernalb.
It will be delivered to the kindergarten on the agreed day and will then be processed directly by the helpers.
Helpers can be parents, grandparents, friends, associations and of course the educators and children themselves.
Kenyan Press Announces Controversial Media Law
“We are in a frightening situation and one may ask: what prevents Parliament from simply abolishing judicial independence tomorrow?” read in the newspaper, which considers the draft law to be unconstitutional.
“The law is draconian and very punishing and we reject it,” said Cyrus Kamau, CEO of Capital Group, which also includes CapitalFM, one of Kenya’s most respected independent radio stations and news websites.
He said the new media tribunal “will always be biased because it is an extended arm of government,” and restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya’s position in the global economy.
"I hope the president will listen to us and we appeal to him to reject this bill and send it back to parliament," he said.
According to the newspaper The Star, the government, through the new law, “takes the media effectively into a whim,” but writes The Standard, democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya had suffered “a severe blow” and titled the draft as “draconian.”
The passage of the law is part of a series of measures aimed at strengthening national security in the wake of the attacks by armed Islamists on the Westgate shopping mall in September.
Kenyan media attracted the authorities’ anger for publishing footage of security cameras showing how the units sent to the scene allegedly looted the luxury shopping mall.
Chief of Police David Kimaiyo responded by hiring two journalists and a leading media representative to interrogate him, even though the charge was withdrawn after a media outcry.
According to the new law, media houses with a fine of up to 20 million Kenyan shilling can be occupied and individual journalists with up to one million as well as the further risk of losing their professional recognition or being excluded from official press accreditation.
The Tribunal also has the right to confiscate the property of the persons concerned if a penalty is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, "even a single penalty can push most radio stations into bankruptcy".
In addition, the newspaper is of the opinion that these measures could have a devastating effect on their description of Kenya's "living blogosphere".
If they silence the media, politicians could do whatever they want without punishment.
“No one will ever know,” wrote Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist at the nation who described the Kenyan media as a critical control factor in public life.
“If politicians are left to themselves, they are leading the country into bankruptcy and us back to the time of hunters and collectors,” he said.
The Kenyan legislatures have already taken on public trouble in the past.
In May, they voted to reverse the cuts ordered by the National Compensation Commission and put their deferred salaries of about 532,000 shillings a month tax-free back into effect – they are among the highest in the world.
Bad-Dürrheim: A dream come true for FC
Despite the cold weather and the rain, the official inauguration ceremony for the Kunstrasensportplatz was of no use to the city and the football club.
Everyone had wished for a more pleasant party last Saturday, but Peter did not want to participate.
So all those who came without a umbrella or could not hold such one for any reason had the watch.
This was the case for the musicians who framed the festival, as well as for some speakers.
That’s why FC chairman Albrecht Schlenker, who spoke about the fulfillment of a dream, became wet.
His thanks were above all expressed by Mayor Walter Klumpp, who was very committed to the implementation of the project, the municipal council, the companies involved and the members of the association who came in.
Lothar Held, Paul Weizenegger, Heiner Gail and Peter Graf.
The cozy pensioners moved 400 square meters of tile stones for the new roads.
This remarkable voluntary commitment was also appreciated by the Member of the Landtag Karl Rombach.
Further greetings were given to the City Sports Committee Hubert Baier, the district chairman of the South Baden Football Association, Kuno Kayan, and Friedrich Knorr from the Planning Office, who announced a donation for the club’s youth department.
Mayor Klumpp recalled that recurring weather-related influences in the spring and autumn added to the original lawn so that it could not be played.
Already 15 years ago there were the first reflections on the solution of the problem, when it was thought to build a third place on the grounds of the football club or at the Realschule am Salinensee.
Both were rejected again.
Six years ago, ideas came up for the construction of an artificial grass sports pitch, which was generally considered the ultimate solution.
Concrete plans were put in place two years ago when FC took over the sabelstube in Erbpacht, pledged a cost contribution of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100,000 for the construction of the site and approved the country’s funding of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>104,000.
In October 2012, the municipal council decided to take over the remaining 356 000 euros at the total cost of 560,000 euros.
The construction of the 68-metre-long 108-metre Kunstrasenplatz took place on 4 June.
During the over three-month construction phase, 3000 cubic meters of land were mined, half of which was used for the construction of a dirt bike track.
The Union and the SPD have continued their coalition negotiations on the issues of home affairs and justice.
To this end, the working group met in Berlin this morning.
These include direct democracy, deputies’ restraint and the federal police.
In the morning, the Working Group on Migration and Integration also wanted to continue its discussions.
Among other things, the issue of dual citizenship is likely to be the subject of conflicting views on both sides.
The SPD wants to end the compulsion for immigrant children born in Germany to opt for one - the Union rejects a double passport.
On the subject of traffic, which is not on the agenda this Friday, the SPD supported its rejection of a car toll requested by the CSU.
A vignette is a “flat rate for multi-tasking and thus ecologically counterproductive,” SPD negotiator on the subject of traffic, Florian Pronold, said in a letter to his group.
There was a threat of evacuation on highways, which were already a major cause of accidents.
The introduction of a toll for all cars would also be a first step from Pronold’s point of view.
"There is a risk that compensation for Germans will be cancelled at a later date," he said.
Dieter Thomas Kuhn in Stuttgart: The Singing Föhn Wave on the Outdoor Stage
Stuttgart - "When's it going to be summer again?" wasn't really the question on Friday night on the open air stage of Killesberg.
It was truly a tropical night in Stuttgart.
So the best conditions for Schlagerstar Dieter Thomas Kuhn and his band.
Click through the image gallery to trim the "singing föhn wave".
Drivers seriously injured in accidents
In an accident on Thursday night, a 37-year-old car driver from Aachen was seriously injured.
According to police, a 41-year-old man from Münch was on his way to Grefrath by 9:15 p.m. with her car on the Kempener outer ring.
When she wanted to turn left onto St. Töniser Street, she ignored the 37-year-old’s car.
The vehicles collided.
The Aachener suffered serious injuries and had to be taken to the hospital for treatment.
Constance: Lockdown after accident on the railing
According to police, the accident occurred when a 51-year-old driver of a Swiss Seat Ibiza was driving on the left lane of the two-lane Reichenaustraße out of town on Thursday night, around 8pm.
Shortly before the roundabout at Schänzle, he noticed that he was on the left-hand lane towards Stromeyersdorfstraße and switched to the right lane.
It was a collision with the BMW of a 23-year-old Konstanzer driving there.
The 19-year-old’s VW Passat behind the BMW was also damaged.
A total of 15,000 cases of damage were reported, police said.
The road had to be closed during the accident, it continued.
Vienna's airport is taking out passenger calls
Mr. Max Maier, please come to Gate 24.
In the future there will be no more such statements at Vienna-Schwechat Airport.
A large part of the loudspeaker predictions thus fall away - the noise level should be so significantly reduced.
Creating a more relaxed atmosphere is the goal of this innovation.
As Airport spokesperson Peter Kleemann announced to Radio Wien, the airport is following an international trend with the introduction of statements concerning individuals.
For example, airports in Copenhagen, Frankfurt or Dubai already refrain from noisy calls.
By eliminating these statements - an average of around 200 personal calls made by the speakers on a day - it is expected to be quieter at the airport in the future.
"It has also been shown in experience that these individual statements have been perceived relatively little, but at the same time all other information about altered flight paths or departure times is a bit subsided here," Kleemann said in conversation with the radio station.
Highlander Games on the Kaltenhof
In addition to the braking with tractors, there is a second competition at the agricultural autumn festival on the Kaltenhof from 6 to 8 September.
On Saturday, September 7, the Highlander Games will start at 1.30 p.m.
Although they have a Scottish tradition, they are swayed on the Kaltenhof.
Teams and individual fighters measure each other in the disciplines of tree trunk throws, hoof throws and water bucket throws.
Four and a half meters long and 25 to 30 kilograms heavy.
"It's not up to the pitch," organizer Peter Saile explains.
The stem must be thrown perpendicularly, should overlap once and then just come to lie down.
This is evaluated with the most points.
When throwing hufeisen, it depends on the target accuracy.
From a distance of eight meters, it is thrown on a pile.
Skill and strength must be demonstrated by the participants when carrying water buckets above 50 meters.
Time and amount of water in a bottle are measured at the end.
Two from each "clan" or team are then allowed to participate in the individual competition.
The winners of the team and individual competition receive prizes.
Training can be done from 10 a.m.
Appropriate clothing is desired, for example, the competitors can compete in the scottish skirt.
However, Swabian wear is also allowed.
For "outfit" the jury will award a few more bonus points.
You can register up to one hour before the start of the competition.
With the Scottish-Swiss Highlander Games and the tractor pulling, which starts half an hour earlier, a lot of action is already in store on the mainland on Saturday.
In the evening, the music lovers come at their expense.
At 7 p.m., the birabohemian blast music from Schömberg will form the great entertainment evening.
The chapel plays fleet polkas and marshes.
But their repertoire also includes sensitive rollers and a saturating big band sound.
Heinz Koch, known as the singing host and black sausage baron, will be among the runners.
In Dornhan, he has already performed at the Christmas market and at the Maddenzunft.
On Sundays, the music club Leinstetten will entertain for breakfast, from 2 p.m. the Bauernkapelle Böffingen will be a guest, and the "Oldies" will then let the party start.
Starting Friday is the Stoppelacker party with DJ Ralf.
Other programme points include the oldtimer and smuggler meetings on Saturday and Sunday, exhibitions by companies on the topic of agriculture and forestry.
Other attractions on Sunday are the Maislabyrinth, the craft market and the sheep shearing.
Specially for children there is a string zoo, straw jumping castle, tractor driving (under instruction) and tractor surfing.
The organizers are the Förderverein Mehrzweckhalle, the Ski Club and the tractor friends "Zündkäpsele".
Milk and egg alternatives at a glance
Vegan diets require plant alternatives to eggs, milk, and dairy products.
Purified tofu with vegetable vinegar is, for example, a quartz set.
The Vegetarierbund calls the World Vegetarian Day on 1 November.
On the occasion of the World Vegan Day on November 1, the German Vegetarian Federation proposes a number of vegan alternatives:
Pure plant margarine is a good alternative to butter, let yogurt be replaced by soy yogurt.
Instead of milk, soy, oat, almond or rice milk can be used.
Removable plant saws replace conventional impact saws.
There are also plant-based alternatives to eggs.
For example, a half crushed, ripe banana can replace an egg as a binder in a cake.
Also 50 grams of apple cider vinegar or a tablespoon of ground linen seeds plus three tablespoons of water are suitable for this.
Loose dough instead of egg, for example, with a mixture of a teaspoon of baking powder, one tablespoon of food strength and three tablespoons of mineral water.
But even 50 grams of soy yogurt or silk tofu can fulfill this purpose.
According to Vebu, around 800,000 people in Germany are currently eating vegan, i.e. purely plant-based.
Sleepless in New York
On the way to their host families in Weymouth, Massachusetts, the students of Black Forest High School got to know the American city of New York.
After an eight-hour flight, we headed straight to the Brooklyn Bridge, which reached the heart of the city, Manhattan, on foot.
A fascinating view of the world-famous skyline was already offered here, which is a special attraction in the evening light.
Due to the time shift, the students were on their feet for almost 24 hours, but the day was decided at Times Square, following the motto "The City Doesn't Sleep".
Despite shutdown, on the second day, the Statue of Liberty could be reached by ferry and climbed on foot.
Then it was over the financial center around Wall Street to the 9/11 memorial.
On the third day, students were able to gain an overview of the fascinating large city from the 373-metre-high viewing platform of the Empire State Building, while enjoying the views.
After that, through the hectic hustle and bustle of the New York streets, the Rockefeller Center led to Central Park, which offered an ideal opportunity for a short stay in the autumn sun.
After a short flight from New York to Boston, the students have now arrived in their host families and experience the school day at Weymouth High School.
Also this year, on the day of the name of Saint Hubertus, a Hubertus Mass is celebrated in the parish church of St. Marien on Hülsbergstraße.
St. Hubertus was the sage after a rather ruthless hunter, who was converted by a vision and was later appointed bishop of Lutetia.
The hunting horn blower group of the Westphalia hunters, led by Brigitte Kluth, plays on parforce horns (natural horns in the mood Es) according to old, originally French melodies.
The blowers wear horse-drawn clothing because they mainly accompany riders, horses and dogs on tow hunts musically.
The festive fair will take place on Sunday, November 3, at 11.30.
The newly designed upholstery shines with a new cafe.
One that invites you to stay and come back.
One that wants to make the name the program.
Déj<0xC3><0xA0> Vu is a psychological phenomenon that expresses itself in the sense that a new situation has already been experienced or seen.
In case of a visit to the cafe of the same name at the stop in the district town of Kleve in view to the Rhein-Waal University, it does not have to stay with the pure Déj<0xC3><0xA0> Vu feeling.
Finally, the café with the beautiful name has exactly that goal: to make an actual stay not only thoughtful, but hand-festively recurring experienceable.
Because it's just fun and it's just beautiful.
A glimpse into the interior of the cradle 8 gives the viewer a good feeling of excitement.
The state-of-the-art but not cool café ambience looks like a place to feel good.
Here, the team with the founders Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel Büttner at the top pampers the guest with a variety of coffee or cocktail variants.
In addition, there are delicious cakes or individually coated fresh baguettes.
The owners, both 33 years old, have already made a name for themselves as gastronomists before the opening of the jewellery café at the top: in Kranenburg they conducted the "Art Lounge".
From the move to Kleve to the stopover, the friendly café-lovers expect more audience.
Last but not least, from the university.
“We don’t have a specific target group,” says Daniel Büttner.
Rather, the two young students here want to address as much as seniors and all ages in between.
Speaking of coffee-lovers.
The friendly couple is behind the coffee-pleasure.
Enjoy the scented hot brew in a variety of variations yourself.
Expressofan
Daniel Büttner is the expresso fan and Mirjam van der Stelt the cappuccino drinker.
"A baguette for that - that's my thing," she tells the NRZ.
There were also two events in the bright cafe.
Better to say one thing.
Because the port party was more likely to take place outside - the Café Déj<0xC3><0xA0> Vu did not take advantage of it.
But there was also the ringing evening.
"Beautiful, successful and funny," the two 33-year-olds found.
But not everyone's business.
Maybe Daniel Büttner is also not a big fan of event evenings: "You can't do it all right."
And with an event, I always speak only to those who are also interested in the special event.
Therefore, events will be the exception with us.
"We want to disrupt the very normal operation as little as possible".
It should be noted that Déj<0xC3><0xA0> Vu also stands for reliability.
In terms of the quality of the products offered here, as well as the team and the beautiful surroundings at the top in Kleve.
The road that is becoming more and more a gastronomic mile.
To the delight of many klavers, the guests from near and far and the students who discover the gastromeile and thus also the Café Déj<0xC3><0xA0> Vu for themselves.

A Day of Thanksgiving at the MGV in Dinker
It was the 165th foundation festival to which the MGV "Friedrich Wilhelm Dinker" had invited this year and 52 guests, active singers and their wives, were happy to come.
In the club room of the restaurant "Witteborg" in Dinker, everyone enjoyed the harmonious coexistence in the spirit of music.
Traditionally, the foundation festival is also always the appropriate festivity to perform honors.
This time writer Rolf Wagener was delighted with the special award "Singer of the Year".
"You have not only written a lot for us, but you have also filmed so many rounds for us, our heartfelt thanks for that," said Erich Schlotmann, chairman of the choir.
The awards for participation in the performances and choral rehearsals by means of activity trousers went to the choral conductor Dieter Schulze this year with 44 participants, followed by the honorary chairman Horst Pier-Ribbert, the chairman himself, and the last year's "singer of the winter" with Fried.
Place five occupied Notenwart Artur Brückner.
A special thank you was addressed by the board to the team of club owner Ange Pier-Ribbert, who had once again enchanted a menu of the extra class and to Gerda Pier-Ribbert for the table decoration.
The MGV "Friedrich-Wilhelm" meets for its regular choral rehearsals every Tuesday at 7.45 pm in the club premises.
“New vocal voices are welcome to us at all times,” said Schlotmann.
UN Announces New Goals to Combat Poverty
The United Nations will now begin the development of a number of new targets to replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) announced 12 years ago to combat poverty.
In the run-up to the UN Sustainable Development Summit, which began in Rio de Janeiro in the evening, Australian diplomats played a key role in advancing “sustainable development goals” to replace the millennium goals that expire in 2015.
They were included in the final draft of the document, which will be adopted by world political leaders, including Ms Gillard, at the summit.
U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said on the evening of the summit that it was time to “think beyond national interests.”
“I am pleased that the Member States have agreed to initiate a process with which to agree on universal, sustainable development goals,” he said.
“These goals will build on our progress from the Millennium Development Goals and form an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will not hesitate to implement this mandate given to me by the Member States in order to achieve our vision of the Sustainable Development Goals based on the success of the Millennium Development Goals."
Even though SG Achim/Baden has been without a win for four days, the handball league champions are still in a good mood.
Coach Tomasz Malmon has no doubt about that.
Everyone is still fully motivated on the matter.
I hope we finally win again, though.
"Because I don't know how such a victory tastes anymore," Malmon expects a success experience from his team at VfL Fredenbeck II.
Even though the Third League reserve from Fredenbeck has not yet ripped out trees, Malmon raises his index finger in advance.
I have trained a lot of players in my youth.
Therefore, you will certainly be particularly motivated against your ex-coach.
“In addition, it is important to wait for reinforcement from the first one,” explains the SG-Coach.
In order to finally return to the track of success, the Malmon team must definitely increase in comparison to the previous performances.
Above all things in the cover work and in the switching game, it was huge.
Opportunities also need to be improved.
Therefore, I hope that my players have finally got their head free during the short break.
Security concerns in Mozambique are growing in the face of clashes between influential personalities
Thousands of people gathered in the center of Maputos under the watchful eyes of the statue of Samora Machel, the state founder and first president of Mozambique, to approve calls for peace in a rare public demonstration.
“We want peace again, we want stability,” said Vanessa de Sousa, managing director of an investment company.
Afraid of the future of the country, she exchanged her business clothes for a T-shirt with the inscription “We demand security” in Portuguese and joined the crowd on Thursday at the Independence Square in the capital.
For two weeks, there have been reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo, which are among the worst fighting since the peace agreement more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement that was initially supported by white-ruled Rhodesia and later by South Africa's apartheid government in an effort to destabilize the country's independent government.
After the peace treaty of 1992, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe it is unlikely that the country will return to a mature conflict, but recent events have alarmed foreign investors and locals.
Much is at stake for the fast-growing economy, as the discovery of huge gas deposits off the coast and coal deposits in the northwest could bring more than $50 billion in investments from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the United States in the coming years.
The ruling Frelimo party, the dominant force since 1975, and Renamo blame each other for the tensions.
Renamo claims that the government has provoked the recent clashes by attacking its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional high castle of Renamos, on October 17.
The attacks on the former rebels escalated as government troops attacked Renamo bases and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the group’s leader, a spokesman for the Financial Times said.
The government blames Renamo for the clashes and accuses the organization of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has tried to raise concerns about instability.
He told AFP, the French news agency, on Wednesday that Dhlakama sees himself as a “loser” who “will use all his remaining forces to prove that he can impose his decisions on the government.”
Both Frelimo and Renamo emphasize that they want to avoid a war.
But concerns have increased since Mazanga was quoted as saying that Renamo has abandoned the 1992 peace agreement.
In relation to FT, he stated that he meant that Frelimo no longer complied with the agreement.
“Our vision is to start negotiations again and seriously,” Mazanga said.
Earlier talks between the parties have contributed little to resolving the tensions that have been fuelled by a series of clashes this year.
“We have two adult men here (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who hit their heads,” says Joseph Hanlon, a professor at Open University and a Mozambique expert.
None of them are good at negotiating and none are willing to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, who is pushing for electoral reforms, has already said it will boycott the municipal elections in November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of violence as the attempt of a harassing movement to obtain concessions and financial benefits from the government.
Renamo's election success has been shrinking since 1992, while a newer party, founded by a former Renamo member, Movimento Democr<0xC3><0xA1>tico de Mo<0xC3><0xA7>ambique (MDM), is likely to improve in the elections.
Mazanga claims that Guebuza – whose resignation is due to end his second term next year – wants to destroy the country’s democracy.
“He doesn’t want multi-party democracy, he doesn’t want transparent elections, he doesn’t want peace because he doesn’t want to give up the presidency,” Mazanga said.
It is unclear what capacity Renamo has, but it has carried out unrest-causing attacks on police stations and vehicles on a major north-south connection.
Most fighting took place in the province of Sofala, a few hundred kilometers north of Maputo, but in which Beira is located, the port, which mining companies such as Rio Tinto and Vale use to export coal.
In June, Rio interrupted the use of the railway for a month after Renamo announced an attack on the route.
Mazanga answered the question of whether Renamo would repeat this threat.
Renamo wanted to “warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique,” Mazanga said.
Instability has heightened frustration over the government, says Fernando Lima, head of Mediacoop, an independent media company, as many people were already worried about corruption, slowing development progress and a recent wave of kidnapping.
“People think the government and the president are responsible for the future of the country and he should be the one who finds solutions to the problems,” he explains.
Omar Sultane, a protester, said people simply wanted stability.
“No one is interested in Renamo and Frelimo, they just want peace and usable roads,” he said.
Children should be taught myths and legends as “examples for life,” one author believes.
Thor’s stories showed that “brutal force has no chance against clever tricks,” and the Arthurian legend demonstrates how important it is to have a dream.
However, many of the myths were “too wild, too offensive, and in some cases too dirty to be taught in schools,” which is why Crossley-Holland advocated a “careful selection” of age-appropriate works.
“I find it wonderful that in America myths and folklore are already part of education,” he said.
I have been proposing this as a plan for 20 years.
He added that for authors and teachers who are “excessively didactic” children would be “completely turned off” because in entertaining stories the messages would be “understated”.
Crossley-Holland, who has translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon and is the author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myths and the British Folk Tales, explained: "One can pursue certain intentions, but one should keep them in the background as much as possible."
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult author who writes for adults and an author who writes for children is the need to convey hope.
Not everything needs to be simplified or lead to a happy ending, but there is an immanent sense of good and evil.
This must be sublimely represented, revealed through history and not explained.
This is the old story of showing instead of telling.
Hansjakob moves to Freihof again
100 years ago, Heinrich Hansjakob moved to his retirement home in Haslach, on Sunday his last years were lived in the "Freihof".
The many spectators were thrilled by the extremely short-lived scenery.
From his arrival to the awarding of honorary citizenship until his death, screenwriter and Hansjakob actor Alois Kraftzcyk had designed an entertaining piece, which received much support under the direction of Cornelia Volk.
Marcus Zagermann took the audience as a speaker through the ten different scenes, explained relationships and bridged time jumps from youth to imminent retirement.
On October 22, 1913, Hansjakob returns home to his children's heaven, to his Freihof.
And then the play began, in which Alois Krafczyk once again shined in his parade role as the great son of the city.
With the two-spanner and "Schwarzwalder Fuchsen" by Erich Becherer from Mühlenbach, he went on a stylistically.
He was not only received by the audience with much applause, his sister Philippine also welcomed him.
Billy Sum-Hermann understood it incredibly well to take on the role of the sister and gave her an immeasurable life in mimicry and gesture.
Between the individual playing scenes, the Mühlenbacher Bauernkapelle played appropriately selected pieces of music and thus completed the performance.
Heinz Winkler, the mayor of Haslach, gave himself the honor, who, in representation of the then mayor Hättich, together with a part of the city council, waited for him.
Their waiting was then made by the three-king singers, who prompted Hansjakob to call out: "Ah, how beautiful, then youthful memories of my own three-king period will come to life again".
With their song "O Jesulein" they delighted the public in the open air as well as the Storchentagskinder with their song "Heraus, Heraus".
His criticism of the official church at the time had been expressed by Hansjakob as well as his concerns about the decline in agriculture, the consequences of industrialization or the effects of the war.
In the homeland, behind his tomb chapel on the fire at Hofstetten, he found his resting place.
“A restless spirit had finally found its peace and had gone home forever,” he said at the end of the play.
There was a lot of applause and a lot of praise from the audience for the performance.
Basketball: The hope of the Neckar giants is growing
The chances of remaining in the league of the sportingly retired Ludwigsburger Bundesliga basketball players have increased.
Because if there is a wildcard procedure, then there is now one less competitor for the Neckar giants.
The basketball project Hamburg Towers is waiving an application for a possible place behind.
“We will not participate in the Wildcard process,” said former national player Pascal Roller, who has been creating the concept for a professional club in Hanseatic City since 2012.
A first breath was not to be heard from Ludwigsburg.
"We didn't deal with the Wildcard procedure until it is determined that Düsseldorf is not licensed," Neckar-Riesen-Boss Alexander Reil told the newspaper.
Until May 23, Aufsteiger Düsseldorf Baskets can still file documents with the arbitration court and prove his economic fitness of the Bundesliga.
So far, however, the Rhinelanders have been denied the license twice.
The arbitral tribunal is the last instance.
Haigerloch: Evening meal church is in the spotlight
As the city’s contribution to the 150th anniversary of the Evangelical Church in Haigerloch, the city’s cultural and tourism office will dedicate the last of its public theme tours on Sunday, October 27, to the Evening Meal Church.
After the visit to the Atomic Cellar Museum, the Hagerloch is to be considered after 1850, when the Hagerloch came under Prussian rule.
The crowning end point is a visit to the Evening Meal Church.
There, the leaders get the story told about the construction of the church and gain insights into the development of the evangelical community in a through and through Catholic area.
Last but not least, the church also overlooks the evening paintings created by Friedrich Schüz with the support of Walter Kröll and Georg Halbritter.
It is an original faithful reproduction of the famous Milanese model by Leonardo da Vinci.
Meeting point for the second half-hour tour is at 3 pm at the Atom Keller-Museum.
Cards are available at the box office of the Atomic Cellar Museum.
For questions and information, the tourist office of the city of Haigerloch is available.
Snowden may also speak in Russia
Former U.S. intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in the U.S. spy case in his Russian asylum.
Representatives of the Federal Attorney General’s Office could either ask questions in writing or meet the 30-year-old in person in Russia.
This was reported by the Interfax agency, citing unnamed circles familiar with the situation.
Such a question could be clarified intergovernmentally, he said.
An exit Snowdens from Russia is practically excluded.
"In this case, he loses his refugee status," the agency quoted its source as saying.
Because Germany is an ally of the U.S., Snowden threatens extradition there.
Longer breath pays off
Six men's teams competed at the club's tennis tournament to win the title.
In the end, the endurance of the team Maier/Bronner decided the last match.
A dreamer had received the tennis department of Sportfreunde Rohrdorf for the tournament of local clubs and friends.
The fun of playing tennis was at the forefront of the tournament.
There were five games per team on the plan, each playing against each other.
Played in double mode with a long set of up to nine points or a maximum duration of 45 minutes.
Anja Schlichter leads the tournament
The tournament management was in the proven hands of Anja Schlichter, supported by Carmen Müller and Inga Kronemeyer.
After the first three games and a lunch break with pasta, the tournament went to the decisive phase.
Favourite Andre Maier/Matthias Bronner were exactly the same with Michael Klippel and Sadmin Osmicic (both teams of the SG Rohrweiler), so the last two matches had to make the decision.
In the winning round, Carmen Müller was finally able to hand over the Wanderpokal to Andre Maier/Matthias Bronner, who had the longest breath on the finish line.
In second place was the double Michael Klippel/Sadmin Osmicic.
The bronze ladder reached Rainer and Bernd Maier of the team Asphaltriecher.
In the late afternoon sun and coffee and cake, the successful matching of the tournament took place.
On the last weekend of August, the Schwarzwalder Freilichtmuseum Vogtsbauernhof in Gutach near Hornberg is again firmly in the hands of children.
Traditionally, the museum welcomes visitors on Saturdays and Sundays, August 24th and 25th, as part of the summer holiday program, to a colorful children’s and family celebration with numerous participations and events.
"Big and small can learn different old crafts on both days," the press release says.
Whether making soap, turning candles, felting or making ropes, for every age the right thing is there.
The children are assisted by regional craftsmen from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.
There is also work in the museum workshop.
Young guests can demonstrate their craftsmanship in the construction of cockpit pipes, waterwheels or circulars.
Plenty of fun also promises the many old games, such as pushchair racing or stalls running.
Speed and coordination are required here.
For all small detectives, the open-air museum offers a puzzle tour through the museum on Saturdays and Sundays at 12 and 2 p.m., respectively.
On a road trip, the children have to guess which stories are true or are lying.
In addition, visitors have the special opportunity to get to know the open-air museum during a ride with Black Forest Fuchsen.
Not only horses, but also many other animals such as sheep, goats, cows and chickens can be found and admired on the terrain.
In addition, all children can look forward to the Clown Otsch on Sunday, who runs his shabernack with the museum guests from 11am onwards.
In the meantime, Hermann Büttner is cozy and fairytale.
The storyteller takes the little guests into the wonderful world of fairy tales at 11, 13 and 3 p.m.
In addition, the children’s attraction dance group from Gutach performs traditional dances at 11.30 am.
In addition, on both days of the event from 11 to 5 p.m., numerous craftsmen such as the Besenbinder, the Closer, the Spinner, the Weber and the Baker can look over the shoulder during their traditional work.
Until the end of the summer holidays in Baden-Württemberg, visitors to the open-air museum are waiting for a varied holiday programme.
In a small New Zealand town, Burt Muro is considered a lovable caucus because he intended to take part in a race in America with his motorcycle, built in 1920.
Despite a heart failure, Burt is unable to get away from his dream.
With his savings, a few donations and a mortgage on his old workshop sheds, he transfers to Los Angeles by ship.
After the film there is coffee, tea and cake.
Schrilles Piepsen disturbs residents
Rhenus Midgard has also invested heavily in land.
They distribute the charcoal coming from the ships to the halde.
The company has several irons on fire at the site.
In addition to coal imports, Rhenus Midgard relies, among other things, on wind turbine logistics.
Black shimmers the coal in the storage area in front of the pond.
Two huge blue racking and recharging devices distribute or load the coal here as needed.
With each movement of the impactor gears, a loud warning noise echoes over the terrain.
“The signals serve security and are legally prescribed,” says Matthias Schrell, Managing Director of Rhenus Midgard in Wilhelmshaven.
Unfortunately, when the wind is unfavourable, this can be heard widely - and so there have already been some complaints from people from the town hall.
He takes the complaints very seriously and has therefore made contact with those affected, says the 40-year-old.
In close consultation with the authorities, we are now in the process of keeping the warning signals quieter with technical measures.
In the future, he will continue to engage in open dialogue with his neighbours.
Because Matthias Schrell still has a lot ahead of him.
With the expansion of the Lower Saxony Bridge, Rhenus Midgard continues to rely on coal imports for power plants and is one of the largest in Europe in this sector.
Thanks to the 18.5-metre-deep deck in front of the terminal, Capesize bulk carriers can also be manufactured here for a long time.
"This year we want to crack the 3 million-ton mark on the envelope," Schrell said.
In addition to the on-site Eon power plant, the imported coal goes to domestic power plants.
If the GDF-Suez power plant goes to the grid, well over 5 million tons of coal imports per year would be realistic.
The three ship unloaders on the bridge as well as the second conveyor belt could create up to 10 million.
Bayern's basketball player optimistic despite first defeat
Even the first defeat in the Euroleague did not diminish the huge optimism of the FC Bayern Munich basketball players.
"No one can forbid us to believe that even against the best team in Europe of the past two years to win," Bayern coach Svetislav Pesic said after the unfortunate 83:88 (39:47) on Thursday night at Olympiakos defender Piraeus.
We have sent the message: Basketball also exists in Munich!
At their first appearance in the European royal class, the Munichers sold out very well for a long time, but were simply not clear enough in the crucial phases.
At first, the guests managed to turn the piece of art into a 15-point standback 13 minutes before finishing in a guided tour before Piraeus again turned the game.
"We fought back incredibly against the two-time Euroleague champion, but then made a light-hearted mistake again," said Bayern professional Yassin Idbihi.
We are proud of our performance, but we want to win every game.
Malcolm Delaney and Nihad Djedovic were Munich’s most successful pitchers, who had won in the first two games against Italian series champion Montepaschi Siena and Polish titleholder Zielona G<0xC3><0xB3>ra.
Ben Greenman: Ten Years of New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
One might say that New York City is the birthplace of stand-up comedy in America: almost a hundred years ago, the variety artist Frank Fay, who worked as a lecturer at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, started telling the crowd jokes directly in the form of a conversation.
Over the years, Fays Innovation was expanded, as was the latest at the New York Comedy Festival.
Founded and led by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the stand-up institution Carolines, this year the festival celebrates its ten-year anniversary with over sixty shows in small clubs and large theaters.
“Most of these headliners started with Carolines and then became more and more successful until they were known for performing in a club at some point,” Hirsch said.
We have designed this festival so that we can continue to work with them.
This year’s event features performances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher as well as Stand Up for Heroes, an annual music and comedy charity event for Army veterans at Madison Square Garden, featuring Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Roger Waters.
With the festival, the world of comedy has also grown.
A number of comedians who are participating in the festival this year have become known through rather unconventional ways, such as broadcasts on smaller television channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll became known with a sitcom on cable television (the ironically-slip fantasy football series “The League” on FXX) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate has been a part of both "Saturday Night Live" and "Parks and Recreation", although she is best known for her viral video series "Marcel the Shell with Shoes On".
Both Kroll and Slate and other young comedians with characteristic voices (the surreal pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic, racially focused W. Kaumau Bell) are products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the biggest visitor magnets of the festival is an interview: David Steinberg talks to Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian, but has evolved into a respected television and film director as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007 he co-hosted a television program titled Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg at TV Land.
The meeting will take place in the Town Hall in the middle of Manhattan.
“The city is definitely in the comedy DNA of Larry’s entire work,” Steinberg said.
He told me that when he’s here, he sometimes walks through the alley between two buildings and thinks, “Hey, if I lose all my money, then maybe I live here.”
Iran Satisfies with Nuclear Negotiations Process
Iran is pleased with the negotiation process a week before the next nuclear meeting with the five UN veto powers and Germany.
“After years, we now have an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency to clear up the differences of recent years,” Foreign Minister Mohammed Dshawad Sarif wrote on his Facebook page.
It would still be a long way from now, but the nuclear fund trader is satisfied with the negotiation process and optimistic that both sides will come to a solution in the end.
Drama in Uruguay: Boys Kill Game Comrades with Machete
Two children have confessed to the murder of an 11-year-old boy in Uruguay.
The two 14 and 12-year-old boys had invited their victims to go bird hunting with them.
Armed with machetes and knives, they stabbed the 11-year-old on Tuesday and threw the body into a well, the newspaper "El Pa<0xC3><0xAD>s" reported on Thursday.
Later, they would have played football in front of their apartments in a working-class neighborhood.
The body was discovered the following night in the village of Cerro Pelado, 15 kilometers north of the exclusive beach resort of Punta del Este.
As an alibi, a five-year-old half-sister of the boy she had taken with her was supposed to have been sexually assaulted by the boy.
However, when the girl described the incident in front of the police without mentioning an attack on her, the two boys admitted to the deliberate killing of the 11-year-old.
As a reason, the elder named among other things a rivalry in the football game.
He was transferred to a psychiatric youth hospital.
Detainees must go to jail
For exploitative human trafficking, bribery, threats, harassment and dangerous bodily harm, the Landgericht Konstanz has sentenced a 33-year-old man from St. Georgen to three and a half years in prison.
The former Federal Army soldier, who worked as a doorkeeper after two operations in Afghanistan, made a confession in the course of a trial speech.
According to him, he met women in five cases via internet or telephone contacts, which he sent after a few weeks against their will.
Resistance he used to break with violence and threats.
He retained the income of the women who had been buying for him for some years.
By confiscating mobile phones and SIM cards, he made contacts between women and the outside world.
Together with a colleague who mediated the women, he took them to various brothels in the southwest.
There, he had them partially monitored to control their income.
In court, the defendant initially claimed he was suffering from severe trauma after colleagues in Afghanistan next to him were killed in an explosion.
After a psychiatric expert had high doubts about the mental impairment and thus about a limited capacity for guilt, the 33-year-old filed a comprehensive confession.
The court did not have to hear any more of the injured women.
According to a Kripo official, at least four more cases of exploitative human trafficking could be identified by means of telephone surveillance after a first ad.
The conversations that were heard were marked by high levels of aggression.
In later interrogations, the victims would have confirmed their martyrdom.
Another witness in which one of the women had discovered blue spots all over the body, made no statement until today.
It is a “completely broken personality” that violence and exploitation in this scoundrel is considered normal.
The defendant regretted his behavior yesterday.
"He has freed himself from these circles and wants to lead a very normal life after detention," he said.
Oil price continues to rise to $96 per barrel
The oil price continued to fall on Friday after concerns about a high supply overshaded a report that said China’s energy-hungry manufacturing sector was growing.
In the late morning in Europe, the reference raw material for deliveries on the New York Mercantile Exchange fell by 14 cents to $96.24 per barrel.
The contract fell by 39 cents on Thursday, which meant a 5.8 percent drop in October.
The large supply of crude oil has burdened prices in recent weeks.
The U.S. Department of Energy said on Wednesday the U.S. supply had increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over the course of five weeks, the supply had increased by 25 million barrels.
But on Friday, there were indications of increased demand due to two reports of an increase in activity in Chinese manufacturing.
This indicates a continued recovery in China’s economy, which grew to 7.8 percent in the third quarter after reaching its lowest level in two decades in the previous quarter.
Crude oil from the Brent variety, a benchmark for international crude oil, also used by U.S. refineries, fell by 26 cents to 108.58 USD per barrel at the ICE Exchange in London.
Court Blocks Decision on NYPD’s Stop-and-Frisk Directive
A U.S. federal appeals court on Thursday blocked a judge’s order demanding changes to the New York Police Department’s stop and search program, and dismissed the judge from the case.
The 2nd U.S. Court of Appeals ruled that Judge Shira Scheindlin’s decisions would be suspended until the city’s appeal was decided.
The judge had judged in August that the city violated the constitution in the manner in which the program for the detention and interrogation of persons was implemented.
The city appealed against its assessment and ordered remedial measures, including the decision to set up a monitoring body to assist the police in changing their policy and the relevant training programme.
On Tuesday, the Court of Appeal heard the arguments for the suspension.
The appeals report stated that the judge had to be dismissed from the case because she had violated the Code of Conduct for U.S. judges by stipulating that a judge should avoid the appearance of bias; this was partially responded to the public with a series of media interviews and public statements.
The judge had judged that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people for inappropriately targeting black and Latin American men with the Stop-and-Frisk program.
It appointed an external body to monitor the implementation of major changes, including policy reforms, training and service supervision, and assigned a pilot program with body-carried cameras to neighborhoods where most checks were carried out.
In August, the city of New York declared itself ready to end the practice of storing the names and addresses of people who were released after a check by the police.
An oral hearing on the appeal of the city is planned after March 14, 2014.
The stop-and-frisk tactic has been criticized by a number of civil rights defenders.
Checks of this type have been in various forms for decades, but the number of checks recorded during the term of the partyless mayor Michael Bloomberg rose to an all-time high of 684,330 in 2011, most of them black and Latino men.
In 2004, a lawsuit was filed by four men belonging to all minorities, which resulted in a collective lawsuit.
Proponents of changes to the NYPD’s stop-and-frisk program say the changes will end unfair practices and create a more reliable and effective police force, as well as influence the way other police bureaus use the regulation.
Opponents are of the view that the changes would dampen the morale of the police, but not the crime; also would waste money and not solve the broader problem of a police force that has been under pressure since the disappearance of thousands of jobs in the last decade.
The judge pointed out that she did not end the stop-and-frisk practice, which is constitutional, but only reformed the way the NYPD implements controls.
From the Happiness of the Dreaming Camels
Happiness is an oasis that can only be reached by dreaming camels
With this Bedouin wisdom, the first chairman Wolfgang Henne described the history and fascination of the association "Helfende Hände".
On Saturday afternoon, the tenth birthday of the club was celebrated, which can already have considerable successes.
The first chairman, Henne, reported in detail on the work of the association.
In 2004, he was in Mauritania at the Cheijk Zajed Hospital in Nouakchott for the first time.
As a result, a further cooperation developed, and the gynaecologist Henne performed numerous operations on several trips on the spot.
During the speeches, images of the inserts on a large canvas were shown, so that guests of the anniversary event could take a picture of the mentioned actions.
The club's desert vehicle was also shown.
It is a former Federal Border Protection Vehicle.
Rainer Prewo, the former OB of Nagold, had proposed to equip this vehicle with a photovoltaic system and now plans, according to Henne, to become a consultant at the club.
In 2008, the Zimmerei Schleeh from Baiersbronn set up the hospital in Socogim, an unfortunate district on the outskirts of the capital, in a record time of just under a week - on a voluntary basis.
Henne also mentioned a new mother-child hospital in Nouakchott
Particularly interesting in times when in Nagold the birth clinic is to be rationalized away.
You learn a lot in Africa as a doctor, says Henne, for example, acceleration against burn-out.
Due to the political unrest in the country, it was not possible to make as many trips as planned, but many doctors came to Germany to accommodate here in different areas.
In addition, containers with material are sent regularly to Africa, so in March this year medical devices, medications, composite materials, hospital beds and glasses.
Mitinitiator Hans-Joachim Fuchtel himself provided ample local colours by telling the stories of Mercedes vehicles converted from Mauritania to a mobile goat stable, and portraying the experiences of the native musicians who traditionally support the club on their Mauritanian journey.
As his personal reasons, he named his work in the field of auditing as a young MP.
When he realized how much money was lost along the way, he decided to help the Africans control a budget by the people.
Fuchtel also stressed that the global economy also demands global human love.
It should also not be forgotten that Africa is closer than some might think.
It is not far from Gran Canaria to Africa.
Coulson used phone hacking to check a tip
Former News of the Word editor Andy Coulson allegedly used “telephone hacking, surveillance, and confrontation” in an attempt to confirm a false tip about an affair by then Home Secretary Charles Clarke.
Attorney Andrew Edi's QC told the court in Old Bailey, News of the World had heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with his "attractive special counsel" Hannah Pawby.
The newspaper commissioned private detective Glenn Mulcaire to hack Pawby's voicemails, and pursued her, but Coulson also called her and left messages as the court learned.
“In the opinion of the prosecutor’s office, Coulson, who is now the editor of the emergency room, is no one who stands in front of people’s apartment and hopes to catch them on a fresh act, but one who likes to confront people with a story to see their reaction,” said Edis.
He said NotW uses three methods to investigate stories investigatively: phone hacking, surveillance, and confrontation.
The publisher is personally involved in the third method.
Obviously he knows of the second, the surveillance, otherwise it can't be.
What about the first one?
Does he know about the phone hacking?
He argues it, but we say, “And if he knew about it.”
Rumors of a Clarkes affair were first picked up by NotW's feature editorial when a source who was sexually interested in Pawby was told, "Don't waste your time, she's with Charles."
A tape of voicemails from her phone on at least three occasions was secured in Mulcaire’s apartment in August 2006.
The investigators also found entries on the detective's computer, on which Pawby and her sister were stored as "projects".
At the time of the investigation, Pawby’s grandparents received anonymous calls asking for information about her, Edis explained.
Meanwhile, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup oversaw Pawby's movements.
On June 18, 2005, Coulson left her a voicemail with the following content: "I have a story we want to bring out tomorrow that I'd like to talk to Charles about."
Edis explained that Coulson's activities in this story followed the same pattern as other important personalities, such as former Interior Minister David Blunkett.
The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson Blunkett had been confronted by an affair with a married woman when he was lying to fellow defendant Rebekah Brooks, who had been married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks argue that they have conspired with others to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have admitted the phone hacking.
In protest against the planned tax, the French football will actually go through the first strike since 1972.
A conciliation meeting ends without results.
In the conflict over the Reichssteuer, the government and professional football in France maneuvered into a dead end after a failed conciliation meeting.
President Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande received representatives of the associations and associations at the <0xC3><0x89>lysée-Palast in Paris on Thursday and also heard their complaints.
But he refused to spare the football from the planned 75 percent tax on income of more than one million euros per year, which all companies in the country are expected to pay for two years from 2014.
The opposite side was also hard.
The strike announced for the end of November will now be completed, said the head of the Association of Professional Clubs (UCPF), Jean-Pierre Louvel.
The days between November 29 and December 2 in the Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 are therefore outstanding.
Proceedings: No absolute protection possible
"We want to involve the residents early in the planning," Mayor Jens Haussler opened the Citizens' Information Event on the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
Around 80 participants had come to the community hall to explain the planned measures, to ask questions, to express concerns and to bring in ideas.
Haussler made it clear: "The final decisions are made by the members of the municipal council".
The flood that hit Gechingen unprepared on May 15, 2009, was an intermittent event that raised the question of safeguards for the future, Häußler said.
A river area survey had been commissioned with the neighbouring municipality of Aidlingen, which is now the basis for the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
“Protection of as many built land as possible is the goal,” Häußler said.
According to the German Weather Service, the planning of protection against floods is statistically expected every 100 years.
Climate change is taken into account by a 15 percent surcharge.
In professional circles, this is referred to as "HQ 100aKlima".
The water masses that caused significant damage in Gechingen in 2009 corresponded to a 1,000-year-old flood.
“There is no absolute protection, but we can achieve a relative improvement,” Häußler said.
To achieve the protection of HQ 100aKlima, around four million euros must be invested in Gechingen, with the municipality being able to expect national subsidies of around 70 percent.
Haussler pointed out, however, that there will only be support if an overall concept is implemented.
For this, the community is dependent on the participation of the citizens.
A complex planning and approval procedure has to be completed.
At best, 2016 could start with implementation.
Among other things, the protection concept, which was already presented last week in the municipal council (we reported) envisages local measures in the inflow of the river Irm from the Stammheimer valley.
Following the presentation of the flood protection concept, the participants took the opportunity to introduce their concerns.
Among other things, it was questioned why no more dams and reservoirs were planned to protect the place.
Gregor Kühn, specialist planner of the commissioned engineering office Wald and Corbe from Hügelsheim, who presented the concept, stressed that it required the interaction of all the measures presented in order to achieve the desired goal in the sum.
In addition, one is bound to find the most economical solution, according to Joachim Wald von Wald and Corbe.
Resentment prevailed in the slopes of the altar, which, even in normal stormy rains, have to suffer again and again from an overload of the canal network.
The problem is known in the administration and first steps have already been taken.
Haussler pointed out, however, that the guidelines for sewerage systems are different than for flood protection and should not be mixed.
The municipality is obliged to interpret the canal network in such a way that two- to three-year rainfall events could be prevented.
To scale the sewage ducts larger would swallow millions.
Seriously injured after a collision
In the early hours of Friday afternoon, two motorists were seriously injured on Landesstraße 44 near Revensdorf in a frontal collision.
The police immediately blocked the road completely, but could not say much about the accident at first.
However, there are several testimonials that should be evaluated first.
It is clear that the 19-year-old driver of a VW Golf was driving towards Revensdorf and the 38-year-old man from Gettorf met her with his Hyundai.
The two vehicles bounced, with the woman clinging so hard that it took the firefighter almost half an hour to get her out of the vehicle wreckage.
The actual cause of the accident was at first unexplained.
Both of the victims came to nearby hospitals.
The route was closed for about two hours.
It could be called the Dostoevsky of the United States.
Philip K. Dick was a seeker of God, a metaphysicist, his novels and stories also have something serious.
Stunning the relationship on the outside: the stinging eyes, the beard, the high forehead.
And as Fyodor M. Dostoevsky is to be understood with his massive oeuvre as the founder and apologist of the Russian soul, one reads Philip K. Dick as an American prophet, who is well known in his own country.
Some titles have been published in Heyne Verlag, the Haffmans cassette with the 118 stories is distributed in the second millennium.
Dick declares America - the realm of breathtaking technical progress, coupled with paranoia, security, and the belief of being chosen.
Dick had divine experiences, his late books read like a mixture of the Revelation of John and a computer manual.
Maybe he was crazy, drugs had been added to his brain.
He's learned, early on, that the computers are divinities.
He wrote a theology of the computer and asked what distinguishes a person from a machine, the creator from his creation.
This is the "Blade Runner" problem.
The killing.
A Master of Science Fiction.
He's a fantastic writer.
His stories have inspired film directors such as Ridley Scott, Paul Verhoeven and Steven Spielberg.
This story is now particularly significant.
The "Minorities Report" dates back to 1956, and it sheds the scent of the Cold War and the McCarthy Tribunal.
Here the principle of "pre-crime" is being developed, "pre-crime", that is, what is now more or less the official doctrine of the White House.
In Dick's world, which is terrifyingly similar to ours, mutants look to the future - and the police are attacking.
"We are recording individuals who have not violated any law," the head of the authority said.
"We'll catch them before they can commit a violent crime."
And, "There are no serious criminals in our society, for that we have a camp full of criminals."
They assume that bad things happen, and prevent the criminal thought from being put into action.
Dick’s narrative acts like the blueprint for the NSA’s anti-terror laws and interrogation noise.
Anticipation of the attack: This is how Obama’s drone philosophy and practice works.
But Dick’s story is not over.
The chief of police complains that there is no more division of power, the military controls everyday life – and what is left of the state.
Then the supervisor himself is monitored and transferred to a future crime.
The system is spinning through.
It's perfect, but it's a lie.
It invents its own prerequisites.
Takes mistakes and sacrifices not only in buying, but builds on it.
The system creates the danger that it fights.
Reading Philip K. Dick means getting closer to the truth.
Talking about Merkel in Russia's case
Former U.S. intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in the U.S. spy case about Chancellor Angela Merkel in his Russian asylum.
Representatives of the German Federal Prosecutor’s Office could either ask questions in writing or meet the 30-year-old in person in Russia, the agency Interfax reported.
Hans-Christian Ströbele, a member of the Greens’ parliament, was the first German politician to meet Snowden in Moscow yesterday to talk to him about the affair.
NSA Disclosures Increasing Corporate Paranoia Due to State Surveillance
On a mild day at the end of August, a German police helicopter flew deep over the US consulate in Frankfurt am Main, the financial capital of Germany.
On instructions from the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection and Counter-Terrorism (BVT), the German Interior Service, he should photograph the roof of the U.S. Post Office, which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Federal Bank.
According to German media, the BVT wanted to prove the presence of surveillance antennas and the action led to an exchange of words between the US and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, U.S. Director of National Intelligence, reiterated in September that the U.S. did not use options for foreign espionage “to steal the operating secrets of foreign companies on behalf of U.S. companies so that they could expand their international competitiveness or profit.”
But since Edward Snowden, a former whistleblower employee, began publishing his whistleblower horn to U.S. surveillance secrets, European governments and business leaders are no longer sure if they can take the director to the floor.
Reports that the U.S. National Security Agency is spying on Brazilian oil company Petrobas and has acquired data from U.S. cloud providers including Google and Yahoo have brought the company’s paranoia to a new level due to state surveillance.
The leak revealed that Chancellor Angela Merkel’s phone had been hooked, possibly for ten years.
If the most powerful person in Europe can reach the target, then corporate executives are certainly also potential targets.
Snowden has made the intensive collaboration between U.S. intelligence agencies and companies transparent.
I believe it is conceivable that this data will be used for mutual benefit.
“Germany needs to wake up,” explains Oliver Grün, president of BITMI, which represents small and medium-sized IT firms in Germany.
German companies believe the U.S. now posed almost as much risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, according to a survey published in July by consulting firm EY.
However, there has been no evidence in Snowden’s documents so far that the US has passed on the operating secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians have expressed their concern that the EU lacks certain IT and Internet opportunities and should reduce its dependence on the US.
Companies are sceptical in this regard.
In the Bundestag it was proposed that we should build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again.
“This is not how it works,” says Hasso Plattner, chairman of German software manufacturer SAP.
If you wanted a strong European IT industry, you shouldn’t have let it die out 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidized, from coal to cars to agriculture.
Everything, except for the IT industry.
Nevertheless, the reach and technical refinement of the US espionage authorities uncovered by Snowden’s revelations have shocked companies that had previously seen the biggest espionage risk in China.
A major shift in cloud computing is taking place because European business leaders are now more aware that data stored in the US is subject to the jurisdiction there and is therefore potentially at risk.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, a trading institution, after the revelations about U.S. data mining activities with prism, about ten percent of non-U.S. members rejected plans to use an American provider.
Jim Snape, SAP’s deputy managing director, says, “We see a new question from customers that didn’t exist a year ago – it’s where my data is stored and can you guarantee that it stays in that jurisdiction physically?”
Many German business leaders are of the opinion that the most recent reports simply confirm what they already knew, namely that powerful states want to steal their most precious secrets and therefore must be guarded at all costs.
The fact that economic espionage is taking place is no surprise.
That's always been the case.
“It has been an issue for many years and has not changed fundamentally by the current discussion,” says Kurt Bock, chairman of the chemical company BASF.
The Americans are spying on us on a commercial and industrial level, just as we are, because it is in the national interest to defend our companies.
Business management usually doesn’t brag about the countermeasures you’ve taken, because that gives attackers benefits.
In large companies, employees have long been told that taking a free USB stick to a trade fair or unattended lying on a laptop in the hotel room is not advisable.
Ulrich Hackenberk, member of the board of directors at carmaker Audi, says that it has been standard practice for years to collect the phones before a board meeting so that they cannot be used as hearing aids.
The German BVT advises executives to use simple prepaid handsets when traveling abroad because smartphones may be compromised.
The prepaid handsets will be discarded afterwards.
There is, however, concern that small and medium-sized enterprises remain vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.
In Germany, many of these companies are world leaders in their respective niches.
“Small and medium-sized enterprises often lack the experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect business secrets from unauthorized access,” the BVT said in a report.
The US warns its own companies against espionage by other countries.
According to the Washington Post, in the US National Intelligence Estimate in February, France, Russia and Israel ranked behind China as two of the countries that used to procure economic data from the hacking.
A board member of a German blue chip company agreed that when it comes to economic espionage, “the French are the worst.”
Bernard Squarcini, a former head of the French Interior Service (DCRL), was quoted in an interview this month as saying: “The intelligence services know very well that all countries, even if they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, are spying on their allies.”
Hechingen: Messe responds to wedding questions
“Marriage is the most important journey of discovery that man can make,” said the philosopher Sören Kierkegaard.
Tips on how at least the wedding party succeeds, now gave a special fair in the domain in Hechingen.
Representatives were important providers around a wedding.
One trend: the retro look has kept intact again.
It starts with wedding dresses, for example.
White is must, best covered or in cream.
At the front, the often decorated and embroidered dresses are closed, often with a veil, while at the back they go down their backs and often end up in a drawer.
However, as Stefanie Koch emphasizes from the fashion house Kleidermüller, the spirits split up.
With men, the suit dominates with vest and plaster, but it is also possible to choose cream or brown combinations.
The choice of the location is important, it was explained.
Jewelry-free adjoining rooms are not optimal, the ambience should be special.
Here the domain drew attention to its own offer in the remise.
If you want to go ahead with the couch, Uwe Link has an offer for it.
“Cutting is also popular for boys’ goodbyes,” he says.
Romance is also in demand for invitation cards, flower arrangements and also for wedding pictures.
The "after-wedding-photo" - that is, shooting series in special places, preferably waterfalls, a few days after the party, but in wedding clothes, explains Elisabeth Keidel.
Many more details of a successful wedding were presented in the domain on Sunday.
Flower arrangement, rings, wedding board, cake and also a wizard, such as Marko Ripperger, who can entertain guests in style.
Not to forget the right cosmetics and nail care.
All for a memorable party.
Dog Friends Successfully
For the repeated time, the athletes of the dog friends Bitz were successful in a Rally Obedience tournament.
Achim Scherrenbacher started in Candel with two dogs; with his puppy Sandy he scored 94 points in the beginner class and secured fifth place, and with the 15-month-old Marley he put it in place with 87 points 12.
Susi Höpp with her Woody in Class 1 presented herself with the critical views of the performance judge.
The parents of a Georgian teenager who died in a tragic accident believe in murder
The parents of the teenager, whose body was found in a rolled-up ring mat in his high school gymnasium, are convinced that her son was murdered, the family's lawyer said on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson of Valdosta in the U.S. state of Georgia was found on January 11 in a standing mat that stood behind the podium in the school gymnasium.
Investigators at Lowndes County’s Sheriff’s Office concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident, but the 17-year-old’s family is in doubt.
“They are convinced that their son was murdered,” Benjamin Crump, the lawyer for Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, told FoxNews.com.
They would never have believed he had died the way the sheriff had concluded.
“They are of the view that it avoids any logic that violates the laws of physics as well as the common sense of man,” Crump said.
Rather, they are convinced that the truth will be obscured to protect the person or persons responsible for the death of their son.
“Your son went to school to study and came back in his body bag,” he comments.
U.S. Attorney Michael Moore said on Thursday there would be a formal investigation into Johnson’s death as a number of important questions remain unresolved.
What was the cause of death?
Is his death due to a crime?
This was stated by Moore at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I follow the facts in which direction they lead.
My goal is to find out the truth.
“I am of the opinion that there is a sufficient basis for a formal investigation,” he said.
Moore told reporters the initial autopsy indicated that Johnson died as a result of a “position-related suffocation.”
A second autopsy, however, has resulted in a different cause of death, according to Moore.
“There are a number of questions that need to be answered or confirmed,” he said.
Moore added that if there is sufficient evidence for a criminal or civil investigation into Johnson’s death, he will commission the FBI to carry out the investigations.
A representative of the County Sheriff’s Office was not immediately ready to comment on our request on Thursday.
A court in southern Georgia on Wednesday ordered authorities to release all surveillance videos that the investigators have verified.
The teenager’s parents said they hoped the video recordings contained clues to how he died.
CDC Releases Allergy Guidelines for Schools
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a series of guidelines for dealing with food allergies from children to schools.
These are the first such guidelines issued by the U.S. government as the number of school-age children with food allergies increases.
One in 20 children in the United States now have a food allergy.
According to the CDC, the prevalence of food allergies among children increased by 18 percent between 1997 and 2007.
The guidelines contain information for schools that should raise awareness of food allergies in teachers and staff, and how to deal with children who show allergic reactions.
It is also recommended that schools have epinephrine in stock – the auto-injection of the brand EpiPen is most commonly used – in order to cope with a potentially fatal hypersensitivity reaction.
Legislators in the states have recently amended the regulations to make it easier for schools to keep epinephrine in stock.
The report also includes a list of typical symptoms that are referred to by children who have an allergic reaction.
Children may say, “It feels like something is pressing on my tongue,” “My tongue feels like a hair is on it,” or “My tongue is crawling.”
Parents of intersex children can choose “gender indefinitely”
Germany is the first European nation to recognize a third gender for children born with unambiguous genitalia.
Newborns are no longer assigned rigidly male or female.
Under the new law, parents no longer have to declare gender for such children, but can indicate “unspecified” or “unspecified” on the birth certificate.
The purpose of the law is to take pressure from parents so that they do not have to make hasty decisions regarding operations for gender allocation in newborns, and to combat discrimination against intersex people.
An intersex person said years later, “I am neither a man nor a woman.”
I remain the flicker created by doctors, stumped and full of scars.
An estimated one in 2,000 children are born each year neither as boys nor as girls.
They belong to the intersexes, a group that falls under the diagnosis of “sexual differentiation disorder” (DSD), a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, glands (ovaries or testicles), or unusually developed genitalia.
Wallis Simpson may have been intersex.
The understanding of gender identification is still not very well developed, but most experts in the U.S. recommend that you use the best available information on gender allocation if a determination is not possible, and not on the child’s psychological and physical development, wait for an opera before you decide.
New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in the issue of gender identification, said the new German law “sounds like a good thing.”
Intersex children are an ethical dilemma.
“Some people have life-threatening diseases that require surgery, but most children don’t,” he said.
You can make a sex assignment without surgery and then wait for how the identity develops.
The scientific data on how a child develops his or her sexual identity is not very accurate.
Nobody knows why it's happening.
It's like the secret why people are gay.
A 2011 report to the European Commission states that intersex people are to be distinguished from transgender or transgender persons, because their status is not gender-related, but is conditioned by their biological constitution, which is not exclusively male or female, but is typically not defined as one or both at the same time.
These characteristics were shown in inferior sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hairstyle, breasts and stature, priority sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals, or in chromosome structures and hormones.
The report also provides an overview of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender people in professional life, as well as the extent of harassment, violence and prejudice.
Boys who do not match the gender picture now have a special camp.
In Australia and Nepal, it is now possible for adults to indicate male, female or “third sex” on official documents.
In June, Australian Norrie May-Welby (52) was recognized as the world's first "sexless" person after a court granted lifelong maintenance of an "undefined" gender status.
In addition to M and W, German passports will have a third allocation, X for intersex, according to the Ministry of the Interior.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to a news report on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of French lawmakers from the strictly Catholic country signed a petition to remove the “gender theory” from school books.
The U.S. website Catholic Online has also spoken out against the German law, arguing: "If the world is torn into a new state where sex is a decision but not sexual activity, then we are twisting two more pillars of civilization."
The mother of a newborn from Maryland explained to Baby Zone that she felt better if babies were assigned a gender at birth.
“The parenting is already stressful enough, even without further restrictions, especially if you don’t know the gender of your own child,” she told the parent’s website.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children born with both male and female genders were referred to as Hermaphrodites, after the attractive Greek god who had both sexes.
Even ten years ago, medicine regarded sex as something that could be erased and then rebuilt.
But in the meantime, the ethical foundations of an operation are being questioned, after it is now known how complex the gender identity is, and that doctors can also be wrong because they do not know how the child feels when growing up with the sex assigned to them.
“In the middle of the 20th century, it was called a ‘psychiatric emergency’,” Drescher said.
When such a child was born, they did not call the psychiatrist, but the surgeon.
The prevailing theory about the treatment of children with ambiguous genitalia goes back to Dr. John Money of Johns Hopkins University, who argued that sex is formable.
He coined the term “gender identity” and argued that social and environmental biases – such as how parents raise a child – interacted with a child’s genes and hormones and shaped whether a person considered himself to be male or female.
However, in a 1966 case known as John/Joan, his theories became controversial.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been cut off during a perverted circumcision, to castration the child entirely and also to remove his testicles and then raise him as a girl.
“Money presented this case as a successful example of a transformation, but it wasn’t,” Drescher said.
When the boy was about 15, he moved back to the male sex and married a woman.
At 38, he committed suicide.
According to Drescher, there are still doctors who would practice this model.
However, in the 1990s, with the introduction of the Internet, survivors of these sex operations went public, who are “not happy with the result”.
For example, Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old author from Montana who was born with XY male chromosomes but has ambiguous genitalia.
The doctors were not clear about whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never lead a “satisfactory life” as a man.
So his external organ and testicles were surgically removed shortly after birth in 1976 and he was raised as a girl.
At the age of 12, he received female hormones.
“I knew I wasn’t a girl,” he told ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he should receive a vaginal plastic.
But since he was depressed and knew something was wrong, he demanded his medical records.
What he found out was shocking.
I was sterilized at birth – and no one ever told me that.
Bruce was born with a DSD through which his body could not produce enough testosterone to develop the genitals.
After learning the truth, he switched back to male identity, received testosterone injections, and had his breasts removed.
By the operation, he became infertile.
Today, he is fighting for others in an organization called the Interface Project for intersex people to be perceived as normal.
However, Anne Tamar-Mattis, managing director of California-based law group Advocates for Informed Choice, is concerned that the German law could “encourage stamping and stigmatizing”.
“Many activists are concerned that the German decision could encourage parents to make quick decisions and assign the child an ‘undefined’ one,” she said.
We are afraid that this will encourage intervention.
We think it would be better to assign the male or female sex and then wait.
But we still don’t know how the law will affect, so we can only speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said her organization supports Australian law because “it allows adults to be recognized as a third gender.”
“Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal gender,” she said.
The German law is about the assignment at birth.
This is not a struggle to force young children at this time.
When they are adults, they can decide for themselves about their body.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a Pittsburgh-based breast radiologist who has a daughter with a sexual differentiation disorder and supports hundreds of others in a self-help group, says German law “enables” both parents and children.
Katie, the daughter of Baratz, was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSD called complete androgen resistance.
Because of the receptor defect of the target cells for testosterone, Katie developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus and no ovaries.
Today, Katie is 29 and married; she works at the University of Pennsylvania as a child psychiatrist.
Although she is infertile, she hopes to have a child through adoption or a surrogate mother.
“The law gives parents space so that they don’t have to make decisions overwhelmingly,” Baratz said.
It gives them time to do various tests and clarify things, giving them time before they write “male” or “female”.
This way everything is fine – you pull the child up and love it.
You have a wonderful baby and enjoy the happiness of your parents.
And you don't have to do an operation that can't be reversed.
“This includes the children in the decision and eliminates the fear that parents drive around because they think they would not do the right thing,” she explained.
Ultimately, the child decides on the sex that best suits him – and that’s wonderful.
This will enable children to make the decision themselves.
Unknown injured girl by shooting from car
Unknown people have injured a 12-year-old man in Saxony-Anhalt.
The perpetrators allegedly fired a group of children in Genthin on Thursday night with an air-pressure weapon.
This was reported by the police in Burg.
The girl was slightly injured on the left wade.
Rescuers took the girl to the hospital.
The shot came from a small car that had passed a group of six children and had suddenly stopped.
Witnesses saw two people sitting in the car.
The perpetrators also shot at a bus stop.
A disc broke down.
Then they drove away.
The criminal police are investigating, it said on Friday.
Until now, the Kempten Police Inspectorate can look back on a quiet Halloween night.
Officials were called only twice to lay eggs, who threw them against house facades.
Since the homeowners recognized this in time and removed the remains of the eggs immediately, no material damage should have occurred either.
In addition, some Sylvesterböller were burned in the city area, but no material damage was done here either.
A resident of the Bischof-Frundorfer-Weg reported that his car had been wrapped in clover paper and his wheel blinds had been discarded.
Until the arrival of the police, however, the man found all his bicycle blinds in the immediate vicinity, which is why the police did not have to continue to operate.
Living with a Future Perspective
In fact, Waltraud Ries lives dreamy.
Your house is located in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with lots of greenery, an old tree population, nice neighbors and also not too much traffic.
The city is only a few minutes away by public transport.
"Hopefully you're not afraid of spiders?" asks Waltraud Ries, pointing to a fat spider at the door frame.
I have been looking for a new apartment for my husband and me for some time now.
But you know how difficult it is in Stuttgart.
The reason, however, is not spider phobia, but the concern of being unable to cope with the many staircases to the house and in the apartment at age, she explains.
In addition, since a meniscus operation, the mid-fifties woman has had to experience on her own body what it means to move from floor to floor with a disability.
Recently, a book of hers has appeared on the topic 'Living happily in age - Which form of living is best for me?'.
“Our apartment is the best example of what doesn’t happen in old age,” she begins to tell.
When she moved into the Maisonette apartment with her husband more than 20 years ago, it was just a nice apartment in the middle of the greenery.
Today at the age of 50, Waltraud Ries thinks differently about it.
But she also knows that she is one of the few people who deal with the topic of 'living in old age'.
Most of them push it away as long as it takes.
The old will always be the others," she says sniffingly.
Only when the pressure is really high do you think about it.
"But it may be too late," Ries said.
In her book, the interior designer presents 17 living models for a self-determined living in old age.
“Whatever form of housing you choose is always an individual decision,” she explains.
There is no solution for age.
Even those who can afford the retirement seat in Tuscany or Brittany should always consider that they can also get sick.
And: 'Without good knowledge of the national language one also unites in the Dolce Vita,' the author of the specialty book says willing to settle down.
Among their models are classic care models, alternative forms of housing or the often cited pensioner-WG.
At age, everyone has their ticks and macks.
'But for me such a community would be nothing,' she means with a twinkle of an eye.
Not at all like in a student-WG with a shared bathroom and a kitchen.
'In old age, you just need your retreat rooms,' says Ries.
The author does not want to rule out the fact that a senior housing community can still work.
But this would have to be different than in the classic student-WG.
“Sometimes you just want to calm down,” she says.
With this view, she is not alone in the country’s capital.
'Most old people in Stuttgart want to stay in their own apartment as long as possible,' is also the experience of Theresa Rütten, the head of the civil service life in the age of the state capital.
Their department advises people on the topic of 'ageing'.
Therefore, especially older people would often also buy inconveniences and restrictions, only to be able to stay in their usual environment, that is also the experience of the Foundation Warentest.
Today, there are many ways to make the house or apartment accessible.
Ries recommends anyone who is concerned with the age-appropriate reconstruction of their house or apartment, first to thoroughly inform themselves and not to hire the first best craftsmen.
Today, there are also specialists for age-appropriate conversion.
Even in the rental apartment one or the other can be realized, and if it is only the toilet seat increase, the interior designer clarifies.
But not always the existing apartment can be remodeled according to age and thus accessible, even if it is still so beautiful.
Waltraud Ries had to make this experience.
Although one could install a stair lift inside the apartment, which would also be a paved path to the apartment door, but that would be a much bigger obstacle.
She will continue to search until she has found the ideal object for herself and her husband.
Before the move, it grays her more than before the spider at her apartment door.
U.S. wants to continue to prosecute Snowden
The U.S. has not changed its stance on former U.S. intelligence officer Edward Snowden.
He will continue to be accused of unauthorised disclosure of classified information.
Therefore, he has to face criminal proceedings in the United States, said U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jennifer Psaki in Washington.
Even Snowden’s recent remarks would not change that.
Earlier, German Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele had appealed to the United States to stop threatening him with punishment after a meeting with Snowden in Moscow.
Psaki stressed that Ströbel’s statements are those of a parliamentarian and not those of a German government member.
Intelligence detective Edward Snowden is basically ready for a conversation with German authorities.
First, however, he wants to know his situation clearly.
This was clarified by the former NSA employee sought by the United States in an unaddressed letter published by Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele on Friday after a meeting with Snowden and forwarded to the Federal Government, the Bundestag and the Federal Attorney General.
According to a translation published by Ströbele, the letter reads as follows:
To the Competent
I was asked to write to you about your investigation into mass surveillance.
My name is Edward Joseph Snowden and was previously contracted or employed as a direct technical expert at the National Security Agency (NSA), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) of the United States.
In the course of my employment in these institutions, I became witnesses of systematic violations of the laws of my government, which provoked me to act out of moral obligation.
As a result of the publication of these concerns, I saw myself exposed to a serious and persistent heat that forced me to leave my family and my homeland.
I am currently living in exile and enjoying temporary asylum granted to me by the Russian Federation under international law.
I am encouraged by the response to my political actions, both in the United States and elsewhere.
Citizens around the world and also high-ranking officials — including the United States — have judged the revelations to be a system of all-encompassing surveillance that is not accountable to anyone as a service to the public.
These espionage disclosures drew many proposals for new laws and directives aimed at the previously concealed misuse of public trust.
The benefits to society from these findings are becoming increasingly clear; at the same time, the risks taken into consideration have been visibly reduced.
Although the result of my efforts was proven to be positive, my government continues to treat dissens as a breach of allegiance and strives to criminalize and prosecute political expression.
Yet, speaking the truth is not a crime.
I am confident that the Government of the United States, with the support of the international community, will adopt this reprehensible position.
I hope that, when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are settled, I will be able to adequately and lawfully comply with the responsible clarification of the facts regarding the statements made in the media, in particular with regard to the truth and authenticity of the reports.
I look forward to having a conversation with you in your country as soon as the situation is resolved and thank you for your efforts to uphold international law that protects us all.
Edward Snowden by Hans-Christian Ströbele
Kindergarten has found a private buyer
"The building is in good hands," says Winterlingen Mayor Michael Maier.
The former kindergarten in the garden street has been sold by the municipality to a private person.
The sale was approved by the municipal council at its most recent meeting in the non-public part.
The building changed its owner at an "appropriate" price.
"The community is satisfied," Maier emphasizes.
The budget was set at <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100,000.
It is not yet clear how the new owner intends to use the former kindergarten.
It is right for the mayor that Winterlingen has handed over the responsibility for the building before the winter to someone else and therefore no longer has to come up for the entertainment of the house, such as to heat up, to look after the garden and to clear the walkway.
“This effort is now gone,” Maier rejoices.
Space concert at high summer temperatures
The music club Hammereisenbach gives a place concert on the terrace of the guest house Hammer.
When conductor Bianca Willmann raises the clockstock at 7.30 pm, the thermometer still shows 25 degrees.
About 50 listeners enjoy the sounds of the Hammrich musicians.
President Manuela Honeck explains the music.
In this context, Honeck thanked everyone who had helped successfully cope with the first musician hockey.
Report: Obama's campaign considered replacing Biden with Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama’s closest advisers have secretly considered replacing Vice President Joe Biden in the 2012 election campaign with Hillary Clinton, according to the New York Times.
The revelation is the most notable surprise of Mark Halperin and John Heilemann’s long-awaited work on the 2012 election campaign, “Double Down: Game Change 2012”.
The Times is in front of a copy of the forthcoming book, and it reported on Thursday night that the president’s top advisers had conducted “extensive group meetings and polls at the end of 2011” to find out if it would be better for Obama’s waning hope of re-election if he did.
According to Jonathan Martin, National Policy Correspondent of the Times, the book thoroughly records the history of the efforts of leading campaign and White House employees, namely former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, to measure the effect it has on the polling scores that ex-Climate Foreign Ministers have.
The potential change was a strictly guarded secret within the Chicago campaign infrastructure and the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen of the president’s closest advisers — including Daley, former Obama campaign leader Jim Messina, and former White House senior advisers David Axelrod and David Plouffe — were aware of the planned change.
In "Double Down", Daley claims to have been at the forefront of efforts to exchange Biden despite her "close, personal relationship" before finally deciding against such a chess move after the data showed that Clinton's candidacy "wouldn't spare Obama's chances."
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the government had actually considered replacing Biden with Clinton.
“I said a lot of things to consider, and that was one of them,” Daley told the magazine.
One has to remember that the president at the time had terrible polling values, so we thought, “For God’s sake, what do we do?”
While Daley described the investigations as “provided care,” Martin told CNN’s Anderson Cooper that during the campaign for re-election, considerable effort had been made to find out whether such a move would pay off in terms of election hours.
“Campaigns don’t spend as much money on surveys and focus groups if you don’t think seriously about something,” Martin told AC360.
It is not clear, however, whether Obama knew that his team was thinking about an exchange.
Martin told CNN he had asked Daley if his then-boss had known about the potential change.
While Daley said he did not believe the president was “conscious” of the possible change, the former chief of staff admitted it was “possible” that Obama was aware of it.
Martin added that "Double Down" did not provide a definitive answer to the question of whether the political probes had reached Obama's desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought Obama had no knowledge of the investigations into whether to drop Biden in the election.
“Possibly,” Martin replied.
What happens to my e-mail on the go?
E-mail is actually an electronic letter.
In the design of the Internet service, was e-mail technically implemented in the same way as in the conventional mail?
In the design of early Internet services, communication was at the forefront.
Therefore, the basic technical protocols did not take care to create a solid foundation for a safe exchange of letters.
Therefore, a conventional email corresponds to an open postcard rather than a sealed letter.
If the user "Anna" sends an email to "Benni", are the computers of the two then connected directly?
Anna’s email program or browser sends the email to the mail server of her service provider in the first step.
For example, if you have a Gmail account, it would be Google.
This mail server sends the content to the provider that Benni uses.
On the route, the mail can run over several other servers on the Internet.
Bennie can then call his provider for the content.
Will traditional emails be read along the way through the web?
Most emails are read multiple times by software robots on the go.
The sender’s provider usually checks whether the mail carries a malicious program as an attachment.
A virus check is also performed on the receiver systems.
In addition, the providers check whether it is a annoying and unwanted spam email that is deleted immediately or sorted away into a spam folder at least.
Do the robots have another task?
For systems like GMail, the robot also determines the information Google needs to place contextual advertising.
When Anna and Benni communicate via GMail about their upcoming holiday trip, Google may display relevant holiday offers links.
Do unfamiliar people also read the emails?
The likelihood that unauthorized people will be reading an email is extremely low.
Theoretically, this is possible.
In companies, administrators often have the opportunity to read e-mail.
The law enforcement agencies and intelligence services also have legal means of intercepting or taking note of emails.
In addition, there may be illegal expulsion actions.
Is it possible to protect emails from co-reading?
By encrypting according to the OpenPGP standard, an email can be effectively encrypted against co-reading.
With high technical effort, it is also possible to hide the metadata of an e-mail communication, so that it is not even possible to recognize without further ado who has communicated with whom.
How important are Yahoo and Google in the email market in Germany?
In the mostly privately used mailboxes, Yahoo and Google play only a subordinate role, according to an August 2013 survey by Convios Consulting.
While the shares of Yahoo mail had fallen last, Google’s GMail was able to significantly increase.
Mother in the woods tightened and pensioned
When his late mother died, a man from Wolfsburg forged a plan.
He buried the dead in a forest - and continued to collect their pension and care.
In order to continue to collect pensions and care, a 67-year-old Wolfsburger buried his dead mother in the forest after police investigations.
At first, he bludgeoned the death of the 89-year-old, then spent more than a year and a half on the money.
Now the 67-year-old has to be held accountable for fraud, a spokesman said on Friday.
The man allegedly hid the woman in a forest near Helmstedt.
The man was already suspected in May: At the time, he noticed that the mother in need of care was no longer needed medication.
Investigators told the pensioner that his mother had traveled to Spain.
Because it seemed strange to the officials, they went on to find out.
It turned out that the two had lived in a shared apartment for more than 15 years and he had last cared for them.
The 67-year-old finally confessed to his mother's death.
According to police, an autopsy did not provide any indications of a capital offence.
Looking for ice cream that shines in the dark?
A British entrepreneur has developed the first ice that glows in the dark – with the help of quails.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of sea animals and created a luminous treat.
The idea came to him after he had read a research paper on quails and was able to convince Chinese scientists to artificially produce the luminous protein.
The ice cream reacts when eaten with the tongue, which raises the pH value in the protein and triggers fluorescence.
Chris explains that the ice cream reacts to the heat in the mouth and glows – so the more you lick, the brighter it becomes.
Charlie, founder of the ice cream company “Lick Me I’m Delicious”, says: “The product is incredible, but still in a very early production phase, and so you get two grams of it for 200 pounds.”
The protein used in the ice cream reacts with the tongue at a neutral pH.
When the mouth heats the protein, the pH rises and the ice glows.
We’ve tested it in the last few months and it seemed ideal to bring it to the market on Halloween because it has this wonderful lighting effect.
It’s probably the most expensive ice cream I’ve ever made, because the pea fluorescent is four times more expensive than gold.
Each bullet costs me about 140 pounds.
But that's what it tastes like.
Charlie’s experimental company based in Bristol is famous for its unusual flavors, including beer, cheese, beef and leafy gold.
But his latest creation is to be even more ambitious.
He says, “I would like to develop an invisible ice cream.”
This is in and of itself impossible because of the breakage of light caused by the ice crystals that make up ice cream; but I suspect we will find a way to make it.
The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a quail artificially produced by Chinese scientists
The TSV Morsum is still without any points in the handball league after six days of play.
Calculated now, it will be for the team of Ingo Ehlers tomorrow to derby against TSV Daverden, who last weekend celebrated his first victory.
With this game, the season starts anew for us.
“I hope we finally have our heads free,” Ehler’s behavior is optimistic.
At last, with the exception of the permanently injured Hendrik Blohme, he has his entire squad at his disposal.
Daverden is also betting on pace games, as we are.
Therefore, we need to keep our error rate low.
In the first place, however, it is important to increase the coverage, which has left everything but a safe impression.
Daverden's coach Thomas Panitz is much more relaxed after his first season victory against Nordhorn.
The game was, of course, a house number.
But that’s why we’re not the favorite for a long time, because in derby anything can happen.
However, Panitz now wants to move to Morsum to start a series.
Jan-Malte Jodat will be missing.
For this, the A-Jugend Joost Windsuß, who is active with double-playing rights with the A-Jugend Bundesligist HC Bremen, celebrates his season debut.
Anyone who is not hot in such a game should stay at home.
Halloween 2013: in numbers
When I was little, Halloween had something magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, stay late and dress for the neighborhood.
Today, I’ve become more of a Halloween muffle.
In the last two years, I have not declared myself willing to distribute from my apartment of sweets, and I will probably not do it this year either.
But according to statistics, I'm a black sheep when it comes to Halloween.
The majority of Americans – 158 million to be exact – are celebrating Halloween this year, spending a total of $6.9 billion on sweets, costumes and decorations, according to the American Association of Retailers (NRF).
One thing I look forward to every Halloween is the trend values.
The costumes will account for about 1.2 billion of the $6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.
This year, exciting inanimate objects are the last scream.
Women don’t have to hide in sexy clothes anymore, they can now also embody seductive foods such as pizza, hamburgers or carrots.
As for men, I expect a lot of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead, and I bet the Daft punk world dreamers will make it into the Instagram feeds this year.
According to Google, the most popular costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I don't think there's anything wrong with tradition.
We dressed our dogs last year and were not alone to my surprise.
In fact, Americans spend $330 million this year on costumes for their pets, according to the NRF.
That’s a lot of hot dogs.
When it comes to sweets, we’re not lazy.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion this year, according to The Nielsen Company.
That’s about 270 million kilograms of chocolate bars, chips, candy and rubber berries.
So good news for the U.S. Department of Commerce is 41 million people who go through the neighborhoods with the phrase “sweet or sour.”
In fact, we’re going to buy over 40 million kilos of chocolate for Halloween and – let’s not pretend – eat.
The only thing we don’t want to consume is the sweet candy corn; yet 15 million kilograms of it are sold on Halloween, according to the National Association of Sweets Manufacturers.
That's about nine billion corn grains.
It's a mystery I haven't been able to solve yet.
There’s nothing more to Halloween than the houses where it shines.
They have great names such as "Terror Behind the Walls" (which by the way is in a real prison), "Howl-O-Scream" and "The House of Shock".
In fact, there are 1,200 officially recognized spookies in the United States that make $500 million in revenue, according to America Haunts, and that includes the wonderful photos on which you just pinch a comment and then put the friends on a facebook, where you don’t leave them.
But we finally get to the pumpkins.
Charlie Brown made us familiar with the Big Pumpkin when we were kids, and cutting a pumpkin lantern is like decorating the Christmas tree – something we’ve done since we were little.
Fortunately, the “baby in the pumpkin” trend only started last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us have grown up with the idea of trimming the pumpkin and not sitting in it.
This year, Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
The pumpkin lantern, which slowly rots in the foreground, probably comes from Illinois, where 245 million kilograms of pumpkins were harvested this year.
If you want to score correctly, then call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California and cut some pretty from their 921-pound pumpkin.
Home Fire in Helmbrechts: Rescuers mountain cooled corpse
The firefighters had to rush out in Helmbrechts late Thursday night.
A three-family house in the district of Hof catches fire on Friday night.
The rescuers retrieve a cooled body from the house.
Rescuers have found a cool body in a three-family home in a fire in Helmbrechts.
Whether it was a resident is still unclear, a spokesman for the Bayreuth police said.
Late Thursday night it had burned down on the ground floor of the house.
When the firefighters arrived, the flames were already beating out of a window.
The police went into the apartment and found the body in a room.
This room and one other room burned out completely.
The entire ground floor was damaged.
All the other residents were not at home during the fire, the police spokesperson said.
The building was no longer habitable.
The exact cause of the fire was not clear at first.
Germany’s largest national church has launched an offensive to promote the pastor’s profession.
Background is a possible shortage of pastors: The Evangelisch-Lutherische Landeskirche Hannover expects that the number of its currently around 1,800 pastors will halve according to the current situation by 2030.
For young people today, the profession is very attractive and offers good prospects, said Pastor Mathis Burfien (43) in a conversation with the Evangelical Press Service.
It is attractive to be able to determine the work and day-to-day process yourself.
With Burfien, the church has appointed a full-time pastor for the first time to inspire young people to study theology.
At present, fewer and fewer young people choose to study theology after graduation.
Burfien traces this to the process of desecration: "The voice of God is silent, the world is loud".
The profession is characterised by great freedom and diversity.
I am the master of my schedule and can put my focus where it matters to me.
Pastors could be very close to the people as a soul caregiver.
They earned as much as teachers and could live well on it.
Certainly, in the free economy, more will be paid, but theologians would have a safe employer for that.
This is what happens to the young people of today, who are not just about careers, but about a sin-filled job.
According to the state church, which comprises three quarters of Lower Saxony, about 60 pastors retire each year.
At the same time, about 40 graduates of a theology degree begin their vicariate.
In thinly populated areas such as the Harz, Emsland or the Wendland, it may be difficult to occupy jobs in the future.
Among other things, Burfien wants to organize study days for young people and also invite celebrities who have studied theology.
The study of theology offers a wide range of training.
You can even become a federal president.
Land Rover Rally Series Announced
In the interior you will find racing seats and six-point belts as well as a free speech system.
The options range from reinforced brakes, a service package with the support of bowler-works mechanics and logistical support to vehicle storage between events.
Drew Bowler, Managing Director of Bowler Motorsport, said: “The Rally customers who come to Bowler have changed.”
They are not all experienced racers, but people who are looking for excitement and adventure as well as an accessible way to world-class events.
We are excited to be able to open this path in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA and believe that the format opens up new opportunities to experience the different Rally disciplines in the UK and abroad and prepare newcomers for the hardships and reality of Rally Raid.
We had a lot of fun developing the Defender Challenge car – it’s going to be a fun championship.
In addition, the Defender Challenge has a training and test day in February and the option to participate in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
Firefighter called to rescue a chick who was trapped 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous rock jump in a quarry
Cockerspaniel bitch Ruby had run away after a minor car accident
Three days later, she was discovered by a walker in a quarry in her miserable position.
Firefighters roped themselves to the rock wall and saved the dog from safe death
The firefighters managed to secure a puppy that was stuck on a 15-meter-high protrusion in a rock wall.
The nine-month-old Cockerspaniel dog Ruby had run into it after a car accident on Sunday afternoon and survived for three days alone before being rescued from a quarry on Wednesday.
Scott Alderson, 25, and his friend Becky Hall, 20, to whom the dog belongs, came to the Flappit quarry in Denholme, West Yorkshire to welcome Ruby back and thank the firefighters of the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They had desperately searched for their missing dog and posted helplines on social networks when she ran into the quarry after the small traffic accident.
About 2:15 p.m. on Wednesday, a walker carrying his dog saw the beached ruby on the 15-metre-high heel in the quarry.
The Cleckheaton Fire Station technical rescue team rushed to the scene and sailed off to rescue Rubys, who were then transported up in a dog box.
Andy Clayton, a specialist on the technical rescue team, said: “She was in a dangerous situation.
It was located in the middle of the rock wall – 15 meters from the top and the ground.
She didn’t move a muscle during her rescue – she was like frozen.
But now she's fine.
She then ate a couple of dog cakes.
That was a rather unusual use.
The fact that the dog was discovered is unbelievable.
Peter Lau, a specialist on the technical rescue team, said: “Ruby had a huge accident.”
There was a possibility that she was seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to the veterinarian for examination, but he found nothing but exhaustion and dehydration.
Becky Hall of Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: “Watching the rescue was scary.”
I couldn’t believe she was really up there.
It was wonderful to hold her back in her arms.
The veterinarian explained that if the exhaustion had become too great and it had collapsed, it would probably have collapsed.
The firefighters did a great job.
It was really brave what they did.
We are just so grateful and each of them was absolutely incredible.
Scott Alderson of Keighley added, “We were afraid she would fall down, but she stayed up.”
The firefighters were great.
I can't believe where she was.
Mick Jagger says he never played Katy Perry when she was 18.
In an interview with an Australian radio station this week, the pop star said she had worked as a background singer on Jagger's 2004 song "Old Habits Die Hard".
Perry explained that she had dinner with the altrocker, and that "he was bugging me when I was 18.
She added: “It’s been a long time and he was very nice to me.”
In a statement, a representative of Jaggers, 70, said on Thursday that he “categorically denies that he has ever made attempts to approach Katy Perry.”
The spokesperson added: “Maybe she confused him with someone else.”
Perry was one of the singers who had a guest appearance on this year’s Rolling Stones tour.
Their new album "Prism" reached <0x23>1 this week.
George Kerevan: European detachment gives Scotland the choice
A new day, a new horror story about independence.
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland is required to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership.
This provides the keyword for stories about passport controls in Berwick and a barbed wire-backed border along the Hadrian’s Wall.
In fact, the Strathclyde template pointed to the potential economic benefits that would entail more freedom of travel in the rest of Europe, but this, as expected, did not play a role in the headlines.
Nor has anyone mentioned that EU Member States often align themselves with their strict rules when it is more favourable to them.
Since Scotland is not currently part of the Schengen area, the continued disregard for Brussels would be only a small concession in return for what you really want from the Scots.
So not really a story.
And one that has come so far in the years that it already resembles a fossil: The first time I heard the “independence means passport checks” thing at least 40 years ago.
An interesting point is lost in the constant repetition of this ancient story.
Why should an independent Scotland be expected to dance in line with the European Pipeline?
Why exchange the London yoke for that of Brussels, especially now?
This is the real European news: the great post-war plan for the unification of Europe has collapsed.
With the Euro crisis, the project Europe has officially died.
Everywhere in the EU, parties are gaining ground that is hostile to the EU or wants to throw the euro overboard as a community currency.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Alternative for Germany party – founded only this year – was able to garner almost five million votes in the September Bundestag election and thus effectively expel the Free Democrats (the equivalent of the British Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag.
There has always been domestic resistance to the plan to create a federalist Europe.
However, the current economic crisis turns out to be a turning point.
Due to the stringent austerity policy imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, coupled with the coercive jacket in which the respective national economy is forced by holding on to the common currency, many people believe that the Europe project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments causing excessive budget deficits – that was the case only in Greece.
Instead, the Eurosystem has fixed its members on exchange rates that are advantageous for German exporters – and German politicians would like to do so.
Without the possibility of devaluation of the local currency, southern Europe is again with a built-in productivity disadvantage compared to Germany.
The only way is to cut wages and public spending – driven by Berlin.
Behind the current budgetary and monetary problems lies a deeper European productivity problem.
As a result of the “green” energy directives, which were laid down in Brussels – a code for subsidising French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers – the European industry is paying twice as much for electricity and four times more for gas than the United States.
This is a debilitating cost disadvantage, as we have already seen in Grangemouth.
All of the world’s wage fixations do not protect the European petrochemical industry from being pushed into the corner by cheap American shale gas.
The result is a revolt, especially in France, the former EU cheerleader.
After the war, the political elite of France saw the EU as a vehicle with which to keep Germany in check and to lift Paris up with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a gateway to political legitimacy, and Europe has imposed its own economic policy, with which the affected French economy has to struggle.
The result: Marine Le Pen’s right-wing, EU-enemy Front National has just won a decisive by-election and so the ruling Socialists have placed third.
The Front National is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the vote – a timely warning to the British Labour Party that it cannot assume a split in the right spectrum would automatically mean benefits for the left.
What does Le Pen do with its newly gained popularity among the white French of the working class?
She wants to use the EU elections next year to forge an anti-EU, anti-Community currency block in the European Parliament.
If the anti-EU parties do well in these elections – and that is very well possible – then for the first time such a bloc could dominate the European Parliament.
This is the point I want to go further: in the not too distant future, the growing resentment against the EU and the common currency will come together for the abolition of the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will become more like the “Europe of (sovereign) nations” that General de Gaulle favored.
Germany and some of its satellite economies may hold on to the euro, but France and southern Europe will return to their own currencies.
I expect the UK to distance itself from this project in the hope of meddling with the US.
Washington’s growing interest in the Pacific, however, suggests that Britain will stand alone in the Atlantic rain.
Where does Scotland stay with all of this?
We can choose to be a region of (lastly) small England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – which includes saying Berlin and Brussels what they can hide behind.
I suspect that Scotland could do very well in a looser European Union if we keep our own currency.
Cooperation with other similarly thinking countries is easier in a non-federated Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should consider doing the same with Norway and maintaining our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is – remarkably – the most successful political movement against austerity policy in Europe and has won a spectacular majority in 2011 due to the rejection of the proposed (and made) cuts that Labour Finance Minister Alistair Darling and the subsequent Dery-Li responded to.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to opt for independence now, only to get a policy of austerity imposed on Berlin and Brussels.
Early Puberty: Growing Up Faster
African American and Hispanic girls are more likely to reach puberty than their white peers, studies show.
Physical changes do not directly mean puberty.
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts Believe Epidemic Obesity Is a Trigger of Early Puberty
The trend towards early puberty is less pronounced in boys
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist who specializes in child health and family issues.
Should a mother be worried when her daughter grows breasts and shambles at the age of seven or eight?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics in Orlando, Florida this week, pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz stated that these early physical changes were relatively normal among American girls and represented a new norm.
“I spend a lot of time reassuring parents – usually that’s not a sign that puberty is coming fast,” Kaplowitz said.
Obvious signs of development, such as growing breasts, sham and armpit hair, as well as body odor, appear earlier in girls.
Nevertheless, there has only been a slight shift in the age of the menarche (the appearance of the first rule bleeding) in the last 40 years.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, slightly less than 12.75 in 1970.
“When breast development begins, it still takes at least two to three years to menarche,” said Kaplowitz, also author of the book Early Puberty in Girls: The Essential Adviser to Dealing With This Common Problem.
Time is the most accurate test of how puberty progresses.
It is controversial, which is actually the beginning of puberty, but it is considered "early ripe" if breast enlargement is accompanied by a growth spurt before the age of eight.
In most cases, the process slows down or stagnates – something a pediatrician can closely monitor.
With faster progression, tests could be indicated by an endicronologist so that serious problems such as tumors or cysts can be ruled out.
There are treatment methods for delaying an early menstruation and preventing another consequence: premature aging of the bones, which can ultimately lead to growth inhibition and thus small body growth in adults.
The recommendations for medication or hormonal therapy are based on the child’s age, developmental speed, growth rate, and emotional maturity.
Psychological aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is reluctant about medication, but he admits: “Oppressing puberty can alleviate behavioral problems and feelings of girls, unlike being their peers.”
The other big problem is understandable: parents just don’t want their very young daughters to have the period.
“They worry about the risk of pregnancy or how they handle the hygienic side,” Kaplowitz said.
“It was a shock,” recalls a woman whose daughter was given her ten days.
Even though there were first signs and we had talked about menstruation, she was emotionally unprepared.
She came home scared and excited from school because she was the first in her circle of friends.
There are many widely published theories about the causes of early puberty.
But there is no conclusive evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment, or sexual messages in the media are causing them.
Boys, like girls, go into puberty earlier.
Kaplowitz is of the opinion that the most convincing premise is the epidemic of obesity.
He supported conducting a 2001 study on girls between the ages of six and nine, which created a link between body fat and entering puberty.
Other studies support this conclusion, but there are many other factors that played a role.
In this country, African American and Hispanic girls are more likely to reach puberty than their white peers.
There are different explanations for this.
Globally, early puberty seems to be influenced by all sorts of things, from economic conditions to climate to genes.
Another mystery: Although boys’ facial and shambles hair growth earlier, the trend toward a full-fledged earlier puberty is not as pronounced as it is in girls.
Other doctors at the AAP conference stressed the complexity of the topic.
The appearance of acne and shady hair is common even in babies and toddlers.
“We need to be careful how we identify the true beginning of puberty,” said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at Goryeb Children’s Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to get advice from their pediatrician as to how to talk to their child.
“This can mean that you have to have a conversation sooner than expected,” Kaplowitz advised.
If you stay calm, the child usually reacts well.
Girls who bloom early need the insurance that the process is a normal part of life, even if it enters sooner than expected.
Jumbo manufacturers argue over seat width in the face of large orders
Among the leading aircraft manufacturers, there has been a discussion about the width of seats in the tourist class on long-haul flights, indicating the tone for a bitter collision at the Dubai Airshow this month.
The dispute revolves around the seating width that is offered to passengers on long-haul flights in the tourist class – not always the ones that airlines strive for the most, but this proven space is the key to the claims of efficiency in the latest aircraft from Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
Airbus called for an industry standard this week that prescribes a seating width of at least 46 cm (18 in) in the tourist class, but U.S. rival Boeing says the airlines should decide.
The fight comes at a time when aircraft manufacturers are competing to sell even larger versions of their two-engine long-haul jets and expect record-breaking orders at the event from 17 to 21 November.
How the rear of the aircraft is designed – especially whether there are nine or ten rows of seats – is crucial for the stated economic results that the new “mini-jumbo” design is expected to deliver.
Boeing claims its upgraded 777X seats 406 people in the tourist class, which is over 17 inches wide, allowing ten per row.
Airbus explains that the competing version of the A350 will transport 350 people in 18-inch wide seats in the tourist class, with nine per row.
Aircraft giants often distribute Hiebe over technical details by advertising in the trade press.
Airbus is now appealing to the public at the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X is expected to make the race with over 100 orders.
Recently, the company presented an ad that could be the start of a new ad war and showed donors a picture of three people sitting squeezed together in a restaurant, and the title: “Would you accept that?”
“Boeing is proposing long-haul flights in seats that are narrower than regional turboprops,” said John Leahy, chief sales officer of Airbus.
In the face of changing dietary habits, people are getting thicker, but aircraft seats have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 defined modern long-haul travel, and the end of the century, the weight of the male average American has increased by ten percent between the ages of 40 and 49, according to data from the U.S. Department of Health.
The waist circumference of the average male American in the 21st century is 100.8 cm, according to U.S. health statistics.
Airbus says its rival adhered to a seating concept from the 1950s when the average body circumference of the freshly dipped “Jet Set” was narrower.
According to Airbus, studies have shown that an additional inch (2.54 cm) per seat improves sleep quality by 53 percent.
Boeing contests Airbus’s figures on seating and says it is not in the manufacturers’ discretion to decide how airlines shape the balance between airfares and facilities.
The company also explains that according to investigations, the experience on the plane depends on more than the seat width.
“It’s really beyond giving airlines the flexibility to do what they think they need to do to be successful,” explains Boeing’s flight cabin expert Kent Craver.
They don’t want us to dictate to them what makes them profitable.
You know your business better than anyone else.
For passengers, it is about more elbow-freedom, but for manufacturers, it is increasingly becoming a topic that can affect sales.
Behind the dispute is a race for aircraft orders with an estimated volume of at least $700 billion at list prices in the coming decades, which could have a lasting impact on the export balance of the US or Europe.
As Reuters first reported in July, the seat layout is the driving force behind the fight over the new jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim 20 percent more efficiency per seat in their latest two-engine long-haul designs than the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 77-300ER.
Boeing’s statements about the results depend in part on the 777X being compared with the original nine-seat design in the 777 with its ten seats per row.
The increased cost per unit is still lower than that of machines currently in use with ten seats per row.
“Boeing is therefore squeezing more seats into its aircraft to make it more competitive with our products,” says Kevin Keniston, Head of Passenger Comfort at European Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts say full cabins with ten seats per row at existing 777s indicated that many passengers opted for the narrower arrangement, which could be accompanied by cheaper airfares.
“Eighteen inches of seating width would be great for passengers, but the reality is: from an economic point of view, the Airbus offering is controlled by the threat of the 777,” said Mary Kirby, expert in cabin equipment, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not offer seats, but a catalogue of suppliers from which the airlines can choose.
The world-travelling jet sellers even carry band size to measure the facility in competition.
Even if they offer comfort, all manufacturers also offer jets with high-density design for low-cost airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers an A350 with ten-seat rows, but has not yet sold one, according to its own statement.
Until recently, Airbus has emphasized the importance of more adaptability of the cabins and offered wide seats on the corridors for some jets.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets, experts say that the reputation will likely be flattened by a new industry standard, but could distract from the wave of 777X sales.
New Anti-Nicotine Vaccine Could Make Smoking Pleasure the Garage
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could spoil the fun of smoking.
A single dose of the vaccine could protect mice from nicotine addiction for a lifetime.
Before human tests, further trials are needed, which may take a few years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of the Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the first results were good.
“We are very hopeful that this type of vaccination strategy can once again help millions of smokers who have tried to quit and have tried all the methods available on the market, but had to experience that their nicotine addiction is stronger than these approaches,” Cornell said.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified to contain the genetic information for the production of nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then produce a constant stream of antibodies.
The antibodies hunt the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain, making a smoker not experiencing a nicotine high.
In experiments, vaccinated mice who were given nicotine maintained their normal level of activity.
Mice without vaccination, on the other hand, would have taken a “time off,” the researchers explained, a sign that the nicotine had reached their brains.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Former tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
Vaccines had to be given so often to maintain antibody levels that they were expensive and impractical.
However, the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be significantly lower, as it transforms liver cells into antibody factories.
As Professor Crystal said, a future vaccine for humans could, if it is absolutely certain, be given to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette and thus prevent nicotine addiction.
More likely, however, smokers would use it to stop.
“They know then that when they start smoking again, they don’t feel any more pleasure because of the nicotine vaccine, and that helps them quit the habit,” he explains.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but at the same time warned that further research was needed.
Tripodi disputed to have been influenced by Obeid
Former Labor Party minister Joe Tripodi from New South Wales is launching an investigation by the state corruption watchdog.
The former NSW minister disputed that he had changed the rules on maritime leases at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who owned covert holdings on three properties on state-controlled land.
On Friday, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) expanded its investigations on whether Obeid had influenced different ministers of state in this respect, leases on Circular Quay, where Obeids operated two restaurants and a café, without having to bid on them in August 2005.
Now it is being investigated on the charge that Tripodi was aware of Obeid’s covert interest in the plot after Tripodi’s former deputy chief of staff Lynne Ashpole said on Thursday.
In years of talks that began in 2005, the government had pushed for public tenders for the leases.
The tenants were against it and also wanted longer runtimes.
In 2009, the leases were extended for the Circular Quay companies, which earned the Obeids $2.5 million annually, without a public tender.
Tripodi, who was Minister of Ports from February 2006 to November 2009, had originally voted for public tenders.
But he refuses to have made the changes at the request of Obeid, who, as Tripodi confirmed, had pushed for a redesign of the government’s lease regulations.
A telephone record submitted by the ICAC showed August-September 2007 conversations between Obeid, Tripodi, and Steve Dunn, a senior official who had switched to the port ministry after working under Obeid at the Fisheries Authority.
“Was the issue discussed in these telephone conversations the drafting of commercial leasing arrangements?” asked Deputy Commissioner Anthony Whealy Tripodi.
“No,” Tripodi replied.
I can’t remember what was discussed, but it definitely wasn’t.
Definitely not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israeli fighter jets attack target in Syria, official sources say
Israeli fighter jets attacked a target in the Syrian port of Latakia on Thursday night, a senior government official told Fox News.
The official did not explain what the target was, but said it was at least one.
According to the Associated Press, the target was Russian SA-125 missiles.
At least twice this year, Israel has carried out airstrikes on missile deliveries to Syria.
Foreign workers with 457 visas could be subjected to “authenticity test”
The government is considering an “authenticity test” for foreign workers with a 457 visa as part of extended measures.
If the test is to be introduced, use a criterion to prevent the 457 from being used as a back door for the relocation of family and friends to Australia.
A government proposal for discussion was released today after former Labor Party MP Maxine McKew condemned the government’s comments regarding foreign workers because they could be seen as insulting by Australia’s neighbors.
“Speaking statements like ‘foreigners should stand behind’ and ‘Australians first’ are a very unpleasant relapse in times when trade unions have called for a protected labour market,” she told the Australia India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that white labor should be protected – and if some in the region were to draw an echo of this historic artifact, I wouldn’t be surprised.
The proposal outlines twelve measures that were once devised by former immigration minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who attended talks on smuggling in Sri Lanka yesterday, has implemented five of the proposed amendments, the others are still being considered.
If the “authenticity criterion” is adopted, then someone applying for a visa could be examined as to whether “the application is genuine in cases where the applicant is related to the owner or a relevant person of the supporting undertaking or in person.”
Firms could also be required to account for the number of 457 visa holders after in the past companies that initially wanted to support only a small number of workers eventually hired hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan refugee was believed to have died of a heart attack after arriving this week on a refugee boat on Christmas Island.
The disturbed nine-year-old son of the man who had come with him to Australia has been cared for by an adult cousin who was also on the boat since his father died on Wednesday.
Australian authorities took the man to Christmas Island Hospital, where he died.
The UK government has announced a study aimed at increasing the benefits of the HS2 rail project for Scotland.
In the work of HS2 Ltd, it is proposed to implement high-speed connections between Scotland and the north of England as early as Phase 1 in 2026.
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said the project "will bring Britain closer together".
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was very pleased to work with the British government on this plan.
Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed rail connection between London and the West Midlands.
After completion of Phase 2 there will be connections to Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government corrected the estimated cost of building the high-speed road between London and Northern England from <0xC2><0xA3>32.7 billion to <0xC2><0xA3>42.6 billion.
The UK government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, has commissioned HS2 Ltd to look for further route capacity and travel time improvements for Northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of a travel time of three hours or less from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
Baroness Kramer said: “Our goal for HS2 is a truly national route network that brings the UK and its cities closer together.”
We are moving forward with HS2 because it brings enormous benefits.
Without it, we are facing a capacity crisis in our rail network.
But it is also about the connection between 18 British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which is improved thanks to HS2.
Scottish Secretary of State Alistair Carmichael commented: “Today’s announcement is good news for Scotland.”
On behalf of the Scottish government, Keith Brown called on Carmichael to “undoubtedly” support Scottish integration into the HS2 network.
Brown said: “High-speed rail provides the potential for enormous economic benefits for Scotland, but at the same time provides Scotland’s economic strength with an argument for fast rail connections across the UK.”
That is why we are pleased to be working as a partner of the UK Government and to explore the options for a high-speed rail connection in Scotland that benefits everyone and complements the Glasgow-Edinburgh connection that the Scottish Government is already planning.
I look forward to reviewing the investigative report with the British ministers next year and to taking the next steps together.
Regulations on electronic devices in aircraft remain in force in Australia for the first time
Australian air passengers continue to have to turn off tablets and smartphones when they start and land, despite efforts in the US to loosen regulations for such devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) allows U.S. airlines to change their specifications so that passengers can read e-books, watch videos, or play videos on their devices during critical flight phases when they are in flight mode.
During most of the flight, passengers are already allowed to do this, but many people find it annoying that they are not allowed to read their e-books at the start and landing.
Australian airlines observe the decision that U.S. airlines will have to do a lot of work to implement, but do not pursue direct plans to change their regulations.
The aviation safety authority CASA also stated that the announcement would be considered, but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical flight phases in Australia continue to apply.
“The CASA currently has no specific regulations regarding the use of electronic devices in the aircraft,” it said.
The subject matter is subject to provisions that require airlines to maintain safety at all times and passengers to follow the safety instructions given by cabin crew.
Virgin has already conducted talks with CASA about expanding the use of its Wi-Fi entertainment system on flights and has declared that one is open to change, but these need to be initiated by the legislature.
“We would welcome a review of CASA’s approval of electronic devices, because we are convinced that this would improve the customer experience after we now offer (wireless entertainment) during the flight,” a spokesperson said.
Qantas said they will remain with the current regulations until further notice.
“Our current policies provide that electronic devices are not to be used when starting and landing, and we currently have no plans to change that,” the company said.
The FAA regulations apply to U.S. airlines.
However, we are always interested in developments in regulations that passengers can benefit from, and we will certainly look closely at the FAA decision and the reasons behind it.
The decision affects U.S. companies differently depending on the age of the fleet.
They need to prove that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference from mobile devices, and change manuals, training materials, hand luggage programs, and customer instruction.
“After an airline has confirmed the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use portable, lighter electronic devices such as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones at any height,” the FAA said in a statement.
In rare cases of poor vision, the crew will instruct the passengers to turn off the devices during landing.
The group also recommended storing heavier devices safely under the seat or in the compartments above the seats when starting and landing.
Before the Revierderby against Schalke, fellow-travelled BVB fans had provided light rockets for ugly scenes in the Veltins Arena.
Borussia Dortmund then announced tough consequences.
Before the Friday match of the Bundesliga against VfB Stuttgart, the Ultras responded with a silence - at first.
It was an unusual, almost fanciful acoustic that was offered to the viewer until shortly before the start of the Bundesliga match between the German vice-chairman Borussia Dortmund and the VfB Stuttgart in the signal Iduna Park.
To be heard were mostly the guests fans with their songs.
The South Tribune, on the other hand, where the most loyal - and loudest - BVB fans stand, presented itself at first exceptionally silently: no chants, no battle calls.
The podest of the Capo, which would otherwise coordinate the joint firing, remained unoccupied.
And right in front of the podium was a large flag with the inscription "Section stadium ban".
Only as goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller, as always, was the first BVB player to enter the place, a short-lived cheer came up.
When his teammates followed, there was loud singing and roaring scarves - but not everywhere for a long time.
Nothing happened in the central blocks 12 and 13 of the South Tribune.
Also that stadium spokesman Norbert Dickel once again listed the positive experiences of the last days - derby victory, victory over Arsenal, contract extension by coach Jürgen Klopp - did not cause celebration.
Just five minutes before the anpfiff, his podest came around the capo - and the tension that had been gripped by the hands until then escaped in a loud scream, as Dicken asked the mood on the ranks in the stadium as usual.
Lastly, as always, the South Tribune was in line – and finally, as usual, the loudest place in the stadium was again.
And at the latest when with Anpfiff from the South Tribune the loud call "Derbysieger stands up" came, everything was again as always.
The silence before was probably a reaction to the events of the past few days.
Just before Revierderby at FC Schalke 04, some of the BVB trailers had fired light rockets into the spectator rings and onto the square - and almost met goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller.
The game was delayed due to the chaotic scenes.
BVB boss Hans-Joachim Watzke had then received the tips of the Dortmunder Ultras in his office - and if you believe Watzke's words, this was a rather unpleasant appointment for the fans.
"There will be massive cuts for the entire ultra-movement," the BVB boss announced on Thursday night at a panel discussion in Frankfurt.
As an immediate measure, Watzke forbade the Ultras a choreography for the home game against VfB Stuttgart.
“I forbade that,” he said.
We cannot give up the zero-tolerance policy on pyrotechnics.
In addition, the ultras were shown various options for punishment - by Tuesday, they now have time to opt for one.
Otherwise, according to Watzke, the BVB will impose a sanction by the end of next week.
"It's going to be cute," Watzke assured.
One can be curious as to how the reactions on the South Tribune then turn out.
Farmhouses are booming in Singapore as the crisis has arrived in the middle class
Janani Amirthalinga exchanges a golden bracelet, a ring, and a pair of earrings in a pendant house in Singapore’s Bendemeer shopping mall to pay for their daughters’ school fees.
“My husband and I just bought a house, there’s all my money in it,” says Amirthalinga.
Although she earns 3,000 Singapore dollars each month (about 1,730 euros) as a administrative employee and her husband also works, the monthly family income is not enough, she explains.
In fact, demand in parts of Southeast Asia – where household debt is on the rise – is so high that ValueMax, where it made its exchange, became the third real estate listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
Obtaining jewelry is not only a quick way to get money – $1,300 in the case of Janani Amirthalinga – but also almost as cheap as an unsecured bank loan.
Typically, real estate in Singapore demands an effective annual interest rate of 17 percent, which is just over the 15.4 percent that the United Overseas Bank demands, a local lender with a branch in the same mall.
However, real estate houses offer the advantage that no credit check or proof of income is required here, which is why loans are possible faster than with banks.
That’s why millions of people in the region turn to landlords after families feel the pressure due to rising cost of living and increasing household and consumer debt.
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap loans due to a looser fiscal policy in the developed economies, families with lower and middle incomes are looking for condominiums to make up for the difference in a staggering economy.
This week, the rating agency Standard & Poor's growing domestic debt, mainly due to rising mortgages, described as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
According to the agency, Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest household debt in Asia in relation to gross domestic product.
Malaysia is at the top of the list with 80 percent of GDP, an increase of 60 percent in 2008.
Economists are also worried about the high consumer debt in Thailand, which has barely come out of a technical recession this week.
On Thursday, the data showed a continued weakness in exports and a slowdown in consumer demand.
“In the end, this means that, given rising costs, people in the middle to lower segment (the income scale) will try to supplement their income wherever possible,” says Song Seng Wun, an economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historical peaks in gold prices over the past two years have intensified the trend of buying personal items as people take advantage of the opportunity to turn the family’s jewelry into cash.
In Singapore, about 70 percent of the pledged items in the city’s 200 landlords are gold.
People say to themselves, “The gold price looks good, let’s pledge Grandma’s gold chain and get back next month.”
Thailand’s largest real estate operator, EasyMoney, has seen a 20 percent customer growth in its branches in recent months.
Growth in the real estate business is so strong that ValueMax, operator of the branch in Bendemeer and 15 others in Singapore, wants to expand not only to neighboring Malaysia – where the company operates four houses – but also outside Asia, according to Yea Lee Ching, Managing Director of ValueMax.
The company is funding that with 60 percent of the 66 million Singapore dollars it took up this week with the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some lenders have fallen into the crossfire due to high interest rates, Yeah explains that real estate not only offered cheaper interest than other lenders, but also did not directly increase debt.
“Customers incur items they already own, and the liquidity of personal valuables does not increase budget training,” she explains.
The stakeholder business is increasingly accepted socially as short-term, secured financing.
Also, not all people who use peanut butter are in financial difficulties.
Rich people from Singapore also come to ValueMax’s stores to buy gold bars and Rolex watches, for which they receive up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash.
Customers from all walks of life come to us.
“These include wealthy people who borrow something for a business or an investment in the short term, or small businesses who need to bridge cash flow bottlenecks,” says Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
NSA sucks data from Google and Yahoo - Snowden wants to help
Edward Snowden has a fundamental interest in helping Germany clear up the ever-increasing NSA spying incidents.
According to Hans-Christian Ströbele, a member of the Greens’ parliament, at his surprise meeting with Snowden in Russia, it was about what conditions the ex-secretary would say at a German prosecutor’s office or before an investigative committee.
Snowden referred to his complicated legal situation, Ströbele told ARD magazine "Panorama".
More than 325 million Australian dollars in rescue package for Tasmanian health care
The Australian government insists on the harsh conditions associated with the bailout package of over 325 million Australian dollars for Tasmanian health care to ensure that the state government cannot waste the money.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth will take "immediate measures" to avert a crisis caused by an aging population of the island state, a higher rate of chronic diseases and systemic restrictions.
Funding for a period of four years was decided after government consultations with independent Tasmanian MP Andrew Wilkie.
“The government has drafted an emergency relief package that, in our view, addresses the unique challenges facing the federal state,” Plibersek said.
The $325 million package includes $31 million in emergency aid for election benefits.
A further 2,600 surgeries, including orthopaedic procedures and treatments for gray stars, are expected to remove residues.
In addition, there is funding for day care clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better aftercare after hospital stays, specialist training, mental health services, and the introduction of a system for electronic recording health data in local hospitals.
“These investments are in line with the ideas that affected clinic staff told me they were the best way to improve the Tasmanian health system,” said Tanya Plibersek.
The minister insisted on a strict reporting and accountability obligation of the Tasmanian government.
The state must maintain the current level of funding in order to receive money from the Commonwealth and report monthly on where the additional funds were spent.
A three-member commission will be set up to ensure that the state provides health services as efficiently and efficiently as possible.
As Wilkie explained today, the $325 million would be of little use if “they are not accompanied by real reforms that will bring the Tasmanian public health system to a more sustainable course.”
Despite this, he praised the government for responding to his request for urgent help, which he first expressed to the Prime Minister in early May.
“I am confident that the federal aid will make a major contribution to taking the state’s public health system off the list of concerns,” Wilkie said.
According to the government of the state, these electoral services will largely outweigh the recent cuts.
But the federal-level health policy spokesman for the opposition, Peter Dutton, believes today’s announcement is just a “pattern solution”.
“We’re in a position today because the lab state government has withdrawn $430 million from the health care system,” he told ABC TV.
It can’t be that a state government pulls nearly half a billion dollars out of the system and injects 300 million into the Commonwealth and then pretends to be the good news.
Dutton called on Plibersek to guarantee that not a single dollar of the bailout would be spent on additional bureaucracy.
Guillaume Nicloux's adaptation of Denis Diderot's novel convinces with extraordinary production equipment and contemporary details, however, it is also more difficult to eat than necessary.
The action in France of the 1760s tells the gripping story of Suzanne, a young nobleman sent by her family to the monastery.
When she rebels, she is confronted with the extreme cruelty of an extremely sadistic superior and becomes the object of erotic fascination of another.
The film never slips into lustiness or sensational lust – and that’s where his problem lies.
The solemn seriousness with which the film is told also makes it a tormenting t-shirt for the audience.
Syria has destroyed its ability to manufacture chemical weapons, according to a monitoring group
Syria has destroyed key chemical weapons and poison gas munitions facilities, the global chemical weapons monitoring group said on Thursday, while there were severe clashes in the north of the country near one of the sites where toxic substances are allegedly stored.
Also on Thursday, a Syrian activist group announced that more than 120,000 people had been killed three years ago since the start of the civil war.
The announcement by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) came one day before the date of the
On 1 November, the Hague-based organization set up Damascus to destroy or “inoperable” all facilities for the manufacture of chemical weapons, including all machinery for mixing chemicals into poison gas and filling ammunition.
The completion of this process, which is basically the first stage of destruction, is an important milestone in an ambitious schedule aimed at the destruction of all Syria’s chemical weapons by mid-2014.
The destruction of the facilities means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
Damascus, however, has yet to begin to destroy the existing weapons and supplies.
It is estimated that there are about 1,000 tons of chemicals and weapons in the country, including mustard gas and the nerve gas sarin.
The announcement came at a time when fighting took place in the city of Safira on Thursday, by experts saying that there is a production facility for chemical weapons and storage facilities here, as reported by the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.
The activist group, which tracks the death toll across a network of activists in Syria, said on Thursday that 120.296 people had died.
Of these, 61,067 were civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the government side, 29,954 of them belonged to the army of President Bashar Assad, 18,678 were government-friendly fighters and 187 Lebanese Hezbollah militias.
Also among the dead were 2,202 deserted army soldiers and 5,375 opposition fighters, many of them foreigners.
On July 25, the United Nations estimated the death toll in the conflict since March 2011 at 100,000.
This number has not been updated yet.
The conflict has forced about two million people to flee the country.
Assad’s troops have been fighting for weeks in Safira against the rebels, many of whom have links to al-Qaeda groups.
The observatory said there were losses on both sides on Thursday, but did not give details.
The fighting underscores the danger facing chemical weapons inspectors, as their mission to liberate Syria from its toxic arsenal of weapons is a race against time amidst an impending civil war.
According to the OPCW, which works closely with the United Nations, the team “is now convinced that it has seen all the important production and mixing/filling facilities mentioned by Syria and witnessed their destruction.”
Therefore, “no further inspection activities are currently planned.”
Earlier this week, the inspectors had declared that they had completed the first round of inspections and visited 21 of the 23 sites indicated by Damascus.
Due to security concerns, the visit of two facilities was not possible, the inspectors said.
On Thursday, the OPWC stated that the two sites had been “decommissioned ... and that the chemical weapons program facilities there had been moved to other facilities listed that had been inspected.”
It was not immediately clear whether the site in Safira was one of two facilities that OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has submitted a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which must be approved next month by the OPWC Executive Committee.
“I draw the hat from the courage and courage that you all have shown in fulfilling the most challenging mission ever carried out by this organization,” Ahmed Uzumcu, the Director-General of the Monitoring Organization, said in a comment released by OPCW.
For three years now, the mainly Sunni Muslim rebels in this civil war have been fighting against Assad’s government and its security forces, many of the members of the Alawis, for the detachment of Shia Islam.
With regard to further developments, the head of the observation group, Rami Abdurrahman, said there was a strong explosion on Wednesday in an air defense facility in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion is unknown, he said.
Anger over verdict for Bali bombers
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people who had died in the 2002 bombing in Bali reacted outraged over the verdict for the last of the instigators, which was brought before court, as Umar Patek was supposed to be shot in a stand-alone manner.
Patek, who has been on the run for almost ten years as one of Southeast Asia’s most wanted people, was sentenced to 20 years in prison yesterday for his role in building explosives for the bombing.
He could be sacked after 15 years.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of the mass murder for the attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, where 202 people died, including 88 Australians, and many others were injured.
A charge was also made in a number of terrorism-related charges, including a wave of explosives attacks on churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
The prosecutor’s office had demanded a life sentence, even if it could have applied for the death penalty for the man, who, because of his reputation as a master bomber, also called “Demolition Man”.
The decision has evoked painful memories of June Corteen, a mother from Perth who has lost her 39-year-old twin sister Jane and Jenny in the devastation committed by Patek and his co-conspirators almost ten years ago.
Fighting with tears, she said Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really mean, he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys.
“You should put him in front of a firing squad,” Corteen told AAP.
I have to live every day so that I will not have another grandson and I will never see my daughters again.
The Sari Club was likened to the ground when on October 12, 2002, shortly after 11 p.m., a huge bomb exploded in a small truck that was parked in front of the nightclub.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's Bar, where just 20 seconds earlier a suicide bomber had an explosive-filled backpack exploded.
He fell into a coma for a month after the attack and “died” three times while hanging on to a life support system.
Hughes said Patek deserved the same fate as the three other members of the Jemaah Islamiah terror cell – Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra – who were responsible for the bloodbath and were executed four years ago.
Actually, this guy should get the death penalty above all others.
To let him live – no, there is no reason to let him live.
Getting 20 years after he killed 202 people and injured many hundreds is not much.
Patek is the last Bali bomber to stand trial.
He abducted nearly a decade of detention, but was eventually captured in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad in January 2011, where U.S. forces killed former al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden almost four months later.
During the hearing, an FBI agent said intelligence reports had indicated that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden with the goal of rebuilding the connection between Southeast Asian terror groups and al Qaeda.
“He’s not standing up,” Corteen said.
Until recently, he has shown no remorse for how much suffering he has inflicted on other people.
The verdict came before the 10th anniversary of the attack this year, which is being celebrated with commemorations in Bali and Australia.
“There will be a lot of tears this year,” Corteen said.
Patek can appeal against his judgment.
FAA: Passengers can now use electronic devices in airplanes (but not make phone calls)
Air travellers can now use their electronic devices to read, work, play, listen to music and watch movies from departure to landing, but not to make phone calls with their phones, according to the new guidelines released by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the United States on Thursday.
However, passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately.
How quickly they would be implemented depends on the respective airline, FAA employee Michael Huerta said at a press conference.
The airlines must demonstrate to the FAA that aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they have updated the flight personnel training manuals as well as the rules for storing the equipment in accordance with the new regulations.
The FAA said it had already received plans from some airlines that wanted to expand the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft.
Among these airlines were Delta and JetBlue.
“Depending on the status of the plan, we could approve the extended use of electronic devices very soon,” the FAA said in a statement.
Passengers are currently required to turn off smartphones, tablets and other devices when the aircraft doors are closed.
They are only allowed to restart when the aircraft has reached a height of three kilometers and gives the captain green light.
Upon entry into the landing flight, passengers must turn them off again and must not start again until the plane has landed.
Under the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are insured against electronic disruption could allow their passengers to use the aircraft even when they take off, land, and roll out, the FAA said.
Most new transport aircraft and other aircraft that have been re-equipped for the use of Wi-Fi at higher altitudes should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, President of the Professional Flight Companion Association, welcomed the changes.
“If the new regulation is implemented safely – and we are working closely with the airline in this regard – both sides will benefit from it,” Glading said.
We are honestly sorry to have to feel like a caretaker on this issue.
However, Internet connections for surfing, exchanging emails, texting or downloading data less than three kilometers remained prohibited, the agency said.
Passengers are asked to put smartphones, tablets and other devices into flight mode.
So there’s still no “Words With Friends,” the Scrabble-like online game that actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011 when he had to leave an American Airlines jet in public because he refused to turn off the device while the plane was parked on the flight deck.
And heavier devices like laptops still need to be stored, as there is a risk of injury here if they fly through the cabin.
Mobile phone calls during the flight are also banned as well.
The regulatory competence for telephone calls lies with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), not the FAA.
The FAA may lift ban on certain electronic devices on take-off and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, a safety expert on national traffic issues, told CBS News that phones would still be considered a risk.
“Handys are really a problem, not only because they could potentially cause disruption to navigation devices, but because we know from the FCC that transmission from the air can also interfere with transmission masts,” Rosenker said.
An industry advisory committee set up by the FAA to investigate this issue recommended last month that the government allow a wider use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, the pressure on the FAA to loosen restrictions on its use has increased.
Critics such as Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri believe there are no valid security reasons for the ban.
The restrictions are also increasingly difficult to enforce because the use of the devices has become ubiquitous.
In some studies, it is said that up to a third of passengers forget or ignore turning off the device.
The FAA began restricting the use of electronic devices by air travelers in 1966 after reports of disruptions of navigation and communication devices by passenger-driven FM radios, which at the time represented the latest technology trend, became known.
New aircraft are much more reliant on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by the FAA so that electronic interference does not matter to them.
Airlines have been offering passengers Wi-Fi for several years when the flight altitude has been reached.
The pilots adapted to Wi-Fi systems are also more insensitive to interference.
The vast majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for the stronger use of electronic devices according to the new guidelines, Huerta said.
Today’s electronic devices generally emit significantly less radio radiation than previous generations.
E-readers, for example, only emit minimal radiation when scrolling.
However, when downloading or sending data, the transmission values are stronger.
Among the advocates of loosening restrictions on the use of devices by passengers is Amazon.com.
In 2011, company employees loaded a passenger plane full of Kindle E-Readers and made a test flight to detect problems, but could not detect them.
Members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings about the risk involved in the use of equipment.
Douglas Kidd, of the National Association of Airline Passengers, said he believed the interference with the devices was real, even if the risk was minimal.
Other committee members said that there are only individual reports of pilots arguing for aircraft systems to be disrupted by the devices, and most of them are very old.
However, the Committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to order the deactivation of the devices by passengers when instrument landing under poor visibility conditions.
A grouping from the travel industry welcomed the changes and called them a reasonable adjustment for travelers who would be equipped with technology today.
“We are delighted that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not at odds with safety,” said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.
Bird rescued by air rescue service from North Sea-Bohrinsel is released again
A bird flown by air rescue service to the coast, which had been found exhausted on a North Sea boreal island, was released back into the wild.
The water roll was flown last month by helicopter to Aberdeen, where it was picked up by the Scottish animal welfare organization SPCA at their rescue center in Alloa.
Colin Seddon, the head of the center, said: “This water roll was probably a winter train bird from northern Europe, which was stopped by the strong winds over the North Sea.”
Apparently, the exhausted bird was looking for shelter on the island.
He added: “He couldn’t fly on anymore, which is why we were contacted with the request for help.”
When she was released, the water roller was fit and healthy again.
Is Europe’s elite ready to do business with the UK?
Business for Britain was launched in April with the intention of bringing the economy to the table and defining what those who provide prosperity and work in the UK want to change in our relations with the EU.
To this end, we have commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey of UK economic leaders and asked them what they think about Britain, the economy and the EU.
YouGov surveyed more than 1,000 executives from the industry, representing around the UK’s corporate sizes, sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will surprise many.
We have found that the vast majority of companies now export outside of Europe and focus on countries that are modernising and growing while the countries in the EU are stagnating.
They want new trade links with countries such as China, India and Brazil to be favoured by the government, rather than halting the long and strenuous process of reforming the obscure EU institutions.
Asked for their opinion on certain statutory issues – from cartel law to product legislation – the majority of economists believe that control over these key competencies should be regained to Westminster.
There was widespread dissatisfaction with the internal market, as the companies said the costs of the Brussels rules would now outweigh the benefits of being part of Europe’s trade area – even 40 percent of the big companies agreed with the ones that are traditionally the most European-friendly.
Finally, and this is probably the most said, our survey of economic leaders revealed that a clear majority of the UK wants a course towards changing the agreement and a relationship with the EU based on trade, not on politics.
This knowledge, which is found in companies of all sizes and leading corporations, shows that the economy is pushing for a “meaningful change” that brings the heft of action back to the UK.
There is a lot going on – an amendment to the agreement and better conditions for the UK would lead to a 16 percent change of opinion in favor of staying in the EU in a referendum.
The prime minister should have no doubt: this survey shows that the British economy is behind his plan to renegotiate the British conditions for EU membership.
It also shows that companies expect a significant shift in power relations back to the UK from a renegotiation.
A better deal for the British economy is possible and increasingly necessary as the eurozone is now moving towards a closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be jobs and growth in the UK, as the result of our survey shows, which means an increased focus for businesses on trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels approach to regulation.
Alexei Miller of Gazprom calls pipeline in Bulgaria the beginning of a new gas pipeline
The start of construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria is the start of one of Europe’s largest energy projects, the Gazprom Board of Directors said.
“Today’s event is a milestone: construction work on the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, has begun,” Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller said in a statement on Thursday.
The project is a key element for the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream aims to provide more diversity on Russia’s export routes through Europe.
A contract dispute between Gazprom and its counterparts in Ukraine, where most of Russia’s gas is stored for Europe, poses an increased risk on conventional routes, according to official sources.
Miller said the direct link to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are "forever" off.
Bulgarian consumers receive gas from South Stream at reduced rates when the entire project goes into operation in 2015.
According to Gazprom, construction works in other subordinate countries are scheduled to begin on the planned route by the end of the year.
The pipeline is designed to have an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic meters of natural gas.
For national and international investors, there is no way past the real estate location in Germany.
The economic framework data are correct, and the funding options are excellent.
This was the tenor of the 9th real estate day of the Börsen-Zeitung.
The German real estate markets benefit from the economic strength and the comparatively good economic conditions in the country in Europe.
Christian Ulbrich, CEO of Jones Lang LaSalle’s Europe, Middle East and Africa, pointed out this on the 9th property day of the Stock Exchange.
How sought-after German commercial real estate is, the look on the transaction volume, says Ulbrich.
In the first three quarters of this year, it increased by 31% compared to the previous year's quarter.
In the UK, the increase was only 6%, in France it was 19%.
“Real estate investments offer an attractive interest rate,” Ulbrich said.
The yield gap between real estate and federal bonds is at a historically high level.

Royal Commission hearing: Two YMCA employees charged with charges against Jonathan Lord for sexual offences
Two YMCA employees from New South Wales (NSW) were charged with child-related sexual offences before charges were filed against Caringbah-based Jonathan Lord in 2011, according to the Royal Commission for Sexual Abuse of Children.
However, in the opening statement before the Commission, the YMCA had stated that "there has never been an incident of child sexual abuse in the organization".
Managing Director Phillip Hare was questioned about a case in which a YMCA employee was accused of committing child pornography, and another in which a YMCA Caringbah Hall sports teacher was convicted of abuse of children entrusted to him in 1991.
Hare said Gail Furness, one of the Commission’s assistant attorneys, knew about the first case but did not know the second.
He admitted that the YMCA’s opening statement to the Commission was also inaccurate in the claim that “there have been external reviews of the YMCA in which the YMCA has been recognized as the front line in child safety.”
Rather, evidence before the Commission shows that the YMCA was informed that it received the second lowest rating of four possible in a quality audit by the Department of Education and Communities in August of this year.
Hare, who started at 21 at the YMCA, admitted that the management had “failed from me down” to hiring Lord and did not ensure employees were aware of their obligations to report violations of child safety guidelines.
Lord was convicted of sexual misconduct at the beginning of the year to twelve boys during his two-year career for the YMCA.
He was sentenced to at least six years in prison.
Hare argues, however, that the YMCA had a cultural problem that prevented employees from reporting Lord’s violations regarding the safety of children.
Employees said they had observed violations, including that Lord was alone with children, took care of her privately as a babysitter, had her sit on his lap, told one that he loved it, and had children play with his cell phone.
Danielle Ockwell, whose supervisor was Lord and who had asked for a child protection training because she was concerned about his behavior, said child care manager Jacqui Barnat, who was the boss of Lords at YMCA Caringbah, was "very intimidating and most of the time was very close".
The managing director stated that he would not accept statements from employees that they would not have trusted to return their notification to their supervisor.
Instead, he said, their friendship with the Lord had impaired their judgmental ability, which is why they had not reported him.
Hare stated that he had informed the board of the YMCA NSW of his view that the lesson the organization has to draw from the “Jonathan Lord incident” is “not reporting” by employees, and the board of directors agreed to it.
Hare said the decision to push employees to sign secrecy obligations shortly after the allegations surfaced had been made by YMCA’s managing director of children’s services, Liam Whitley.
He said this should prevent contamination of the evidence, which was “excessive” and poorly implemented.
The YMCA NSW was not a child-safe organization at the time when Jonathan Lord was employed there between 2009 and 2011, said Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University, an expert on child sexual abuse, the Commission.
He explained that there were "serious problems" in hiring, checking, hiring, training and supervising employees.
The hearing was postponed until 20 December.
Tony Blair said he would take the chance to return as British Prime Minister – but admits that a comeback is unlikely.
In an interview tonight on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his resignation from office, the 59-year-old announced his views on various domestic policy issues.
Since his resignation in June 2007, after a decade as head of state, Blair has largely avoided commenting on British politics, and his comments mostly limited to foreign policy and his role as an envoy of the Quartet of Peace Founders in the Middle East.
Asked if he would like to return to the prime minister’s office, Blair was quoted by the Evening Standard in London as saying, “Yes, sure, but it’s unlikely to happen, so...”
When the horse show experts set out in Cardiff to race the horse of the year, they were aware that there was a tough competition ahead.
But no one was prepared for the three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
The Knirps, who is not even in kindergarten and has only made his first steps a few months ago, and his Shetland Pony Toffee walked loosely through the three rounds and won the first prize – leaving 30 adult opponents behind.
The inseparable couple, both of the same size, were praised for their appearance, behavior and style at the annual competition held by the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff.
When he appeared in competition against men and women with elegant melons, he put his plate cap on in a freakish angle and led the two-year-old toffee through the ring.
Fenton was praised by the jurors for his natural abilities in dealing with the pony, which are far above his age.
And Toffee received best marks for his appearance and personality.
Fenton had received Toffee last March as a gift for his third birthday and has been practicing every day with the Shetland pony ever since.
His mother, Donna, 30, said, “Fenton and toffee are a great strain.”
They had to compete against the entire field of participants and left the pitch with Gold Cup and Rosette.
It was only the second time he had participated in a competition with Toffee, and we were all excited when he won.
Perfect strangers in the arena considered him so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
The little boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been leading horses for over ten years.
Howells said, “The whole audience was like electrified and everyone fired and clapped him.”
He ran on sand the entire length of the arena and although he looked so tiny, he did fantastic work.
Fenton is crazy about animals – he loves horses, tractors and farms and has two chickens to take care of.
As he started, it won’t be long before he’s on the “horse of the year” show – and I’m sure he’ll cut off well.
A spokesperson for the annual horse show said, “Fenton is only three, but he knows how to deal with his pony.”
Together they are a great team.
The jurors rated Fenton and Toffee based on how well they had beaten and presented themselves in the preliminary ring.
They paid attention to good cooperation between pony and leader – and there Fenton and Toffee were the best in the ring.
I’m sure Fenton’s cute outfit has contributed to her part, which really fits perfectly for the occasion.
Chinese newspaper to be “reformed” after call
A Chinese newspaper that had called for the release of a reporter who had been accused of defamation on the cover page was to be reformed, a news regulator said.
The Guangzhou-based New Express had printed a rare public call for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
However, Chen later admitted on television that he had accepted bribery money to falsify reports about a state-owned company.
Now the New Express is undergoing a “comprehensive rectification”, the regulator said.
The “retification order” came from the authority for press and publications, radio, film and television in Guangdong.
Preliminary investigations revealed that the Neue Express, which is part of the Yangcheng Evening News Group, had published several inappropriate reports about the listed company Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
“The editorial management of the Neue Express was disorderly,” the regulator said in a statement.
She said it had decided to "impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou and to revoke his reporter license."
In addition, the Yangcheng Evening News Group was instructed to conduct a full rectification of the New Express, and recommended that the relevant managers be identified at the New Express and that the management team of the New Express be checked immediately.
Chen had written several articles for the New Express in which he reported on alleged financial irregularities at a construction machinery manufacturer called Zoomlion.
After he was arrested, the newspaper published two calls for his release on the cover page and stood behind his journalistic work.
But then Chen appeared on state television and admitted that he had published false reports in exchange for payment.
“In this case, I have damaged Zoomlion as well as the entire news industry and their ability to win public trust,” he told state-run CCTV.
I did it primarily because I was out of money and fame.
It has become clear to me that I have done wrong.
Following Chen’s apology, the New Express published an apology on the headlines and stated that it had failed to properly review the reports.
Several known suspects have recently made confessions on television.
Experts say confessions are still routinely being forced, despite a law change early in the year that banned authorities from forcing someone to blame themselves.
Drug Tunnel Discovered with Own Railway Between U.S. and Mexico
One of the most refined tunnels for drug smuggling between the US and Mexico, which was fully equipped with lighting, ventilation and electric rail, has now been discovered.
U.S. authorities have described the 120x90cm tunnel as one of the most elaborate passages they have ever found.
The tunnel, which runs in a zigzag pattern over a length of almost six football fields, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, USA.
There are countless invisible warehouses in the area, making it easier to hide drug-laden trucks.
The tunnel had been closed before unrecognized drugs could be transported in it, authorities said.
When the tunnel was discovered, eight and a half tons of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine were secured, according to the court’s records.
Three men who were working as drivers, according to the authorities, were charged with possession and the intended sale of marijuana and cocaine.
You are facing life sentences ranging from ten years to life in a prison sentence.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers rely on an extensive underground network of drainage ducts.
The tunnel is the eighth major passage discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the biggest tunnels were discovered after the marijuana harvest in central Mexico in October, which challenges the drug cartels to how they can quickly bring their product to consumers.
In 2010, authorities found a nearly 640-metre-long passageway with rails that ran from a kitchen in a Tijuana apartment building to two warehouses in San Diego.
Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr still love each other
Actor Orlando Bloom and model Miranda Kerr want to go separate ways in the future.
In an interview, Bloom said he and Kerr still love each other.
Miranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom are parents of two-year-old Flynn.
Actor Orlando Bloom has spoken out about the separation of his wife, top model Miranda Kerr.
In an interview with U.S. journalist Katie Couric, who was due to air on Friday, Bloom said, “Life sometimes doesn’t go exactly as we plan or hope for.”
Kerr and he still loved each other, emphasized the 36-year-old.
"We will support each other and love each other as Flynn's parents".
Kerr and Bloom have been married since 2010, and their sons Flynn were born in 2011.
According to Lexicon, veganism is subject to vegetarianism, but differs in a very significant way from it.
Because while vegetarians allow themselves to eat cream cakes, ice cream or a strong lady, these slurries are not on the menu of a vegan.
Milk, cheese, egg, in addition to the abandonment of meat and fish, the vegan abandons all consumption of animal products - also honey is refused.
What remains, one may wonder, but with closer consideration, the vegan diet world is characterized by a considerable ingenuity.
"Bread spreads are very popular," explains Ute Henkelmann, the owner of the local reform house, which provides a variety of special products for vegans.
Reuben Proctor also likes to visit the shop in the Domgasse.
For 13 years the native New Zealander has been vegan, in Lampertheim he (almost) finds everything he needs to live. "In 1997 I changed my diet and became a vegetarian".
Around the turn of the century, the next step took place and I became a vegan.
“But the conviction came not just because of the diet, but because of the choice of shoes,” says Proctor, who prefers artificial leather to normal leather.
He realized that it is also possible in other everyday matters without animal products.
First and foremost, vegan is an ethics.
“I don’t want animals to die for me,” Proctor said of the vegan maxim, which extends to the entire consumer behavior.
Instead of mourning burgers, ruminants or gum bears, the vegan quickly discovered brand new products, the enthusiasm increased.
"It's a double bonus," says Proctor today, "actually being vegan is not a waiver, not an ascetic, it's an enrichment." The assumption that with dietary change, one reduces the choice of food options, Proctor is more likely to draw on the power of habit.
And it was these conditionings that caused some even so well-meaning attempts to fail.
“The addictive factor is a very crucial factor that causes many people to give up quickly, similar to smoking,” Proctor says in a comparison.
And it says, "Determined tastes are not to be determined by the animal."
Often it is the spices or the type of preparation that make up the taste.
“But you can also produce the same effect in other ways,” explains the vegan.
For example, Proctor brings aubergines, mushrooms and also a few vegan sausages to a barbecue party.
He pays attention to a balanced, varied diet, in which it should certainly taste delicious once in a while.
Of course, you want to have something between your teeth, which is legitimate.
“It’s supposed to taste, but that’s not just to reduce it to animal food,” Proctor said.
Damage to health up to eating disorders, another widespread assumption, he did not suffer.
For me, the change had a positive side.
I do not take in foreign cholesterol and have an increased vitamin content.
There are high-performance athletes who eat exclusively vegan.
"My blood levels are fine, I get checked often," Proctor tells.
In particular, many veganism critics warn of the lack of vitamin B12.
“As animals are fed with food, rather than grazing on the grass, it is questionable whether the proportion of vitamin B12 in the meat you buy in the refrigerator is high,” Proctor says.
For vegans, it is also possible to take the coenzyme in the form of tablets.
“My B12 values are fine,” he explains.
Proctor does not have to go far for food procurement.
After all, there are staples everywhere and every supermarket now has soy milk and other products.
Everything I need, I find on the spot.
Every now and then I buy something special.
"Many people overlook that it is only the finished products that are expensive, but this is what is known about "ordinary" finished products as well."
In any case, the preparation of vegan dishes is much cheaper and less time-consuming than generally assumed.
"In the home kitchen there is a lot to discover, with a few small cuts you can achieve good, if not partially better results," says Proctor.
Margarine instead of butter, a little more baking powder and carbonic acid instead of egg, with its vegan cheesecakes, Proctor was also able to amaze his parents-in-law.
Family celebrations give the vegan a new spice.
This has dynamics, when you cook together, it has a new meaning.
“The situations that can arise here are as different as the people themselves,” says Proctor.
But, of course, he was already faced with skepticism.
You don't like my food anymore?
"Should I feel bad now because I drink milk?" - on such questions one should act as a vegan with a sense of fingertips.
“I don’t reject the people, I’m part of this society,” Proctor said.
And more precisely, the everyday world doesn’t seem as vegan as expected – and the vegan isn’t as restricted in everyday life as it is commonly assumed.
Fast food is also allowed.
There are apples everywhere!
"Many Dönerläden offer fallafel, or even a vegetarian yufka," says Proctor.
In a pizzeria he stands out for pasta dishes, or just ordered a pizza without cheese, all a matter of habit.
The restaurants are so slow to do that.
"When I started to eat vegan 13 years ago, everything was much more difficult," the New Zealander can find out a development: "You have to talk to people, they have to pay attention to it."
"If there is enough demand, they may be inclined to supplement the menu," he said.
Vegan restaurants develop, such as the bus stop in Mannheim or the Café Vogelfrei.
Proctor wishes that other restaurants also have at least one vegan dish on the menu.
Basically, vegan dishes are there for everyone.
Anyone can eat them, so they are exactly the opposite of exclusive.
"Meat dishes, on the other hand, are exclusive, in the truest sense of the word, because they exclude others," Proctor notes.
“If you want to avoid food scandals, veganism is a safe way to make the most of it impossible from the outset,” Proctor says.
However, buying vegan products can be a bit difficult at first.
Especially when one learns to understand that even in peanuts can contain animal additives as a dye, one seems to quickly abandon courage by following the ethics of so many hurdles and falls.
That is not only why Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen have written a book: "Veganissimo - Animal Ingredients and Their Alternatives" explains the many ingredients that are included in food and cleaning products.
"After and after you develop a scanner look and know what signs and logos you have to pay attention to "It's sometimes better to do small steps than to stand or stumble," Proctor says.
Veganism, it is an important moral finger pointing to consciousness.
He may not be able to give up his habits at all, but at least he can teach consumers to critically question his habits.
The stock exchange operator Nasdaq OMX keeps its customers in breath.
Trading on the Nasdaq Options Market was interrupted on Friday afternoon German time.
In a statement, the operator was responsible for technical problems.
The other eleven U.S. option markets, including two of the Nasdaq OMX, continued their business unhindered.
The latest incident continues a whole series of smaller and larger pans with the stock exchange operator.
Only on Tuesday, the Nasdaq index had not been calculated for an hour due to errors in data transport.
In August of this year, there were only two pans in a week.
First, the U.S. investment bank Goldman Sachs had sent massively flawed purchase orders to the option markets due to technical problems.
After that, the stock exchange operators took almost a whole day to review and delete the orders.
Two days later, half of all U.S. stock trading fell due to a computer failure on the Nasdaq exchange for several hours.
In addition, Facebook’s stock market moves last year were noticed.
The Nasdaq systems had not grown due to the flood of purchase and sale orders, the SEC later established the stock market supervision and sentenced the company to a record fine of $10 million.
Konstanz: Radler drives around 63-year-olds
According to police, the accident occurred when a 26-year-old man was travelling on Thursday night, around 10 p.m., on a women’s bicycle improperly on the left footpath from the railway station to market place.
When suddenly a 63-year-old man stepped from a local walkway, the cyclist could no longer brake in time, according to police.
In the following collision, the pedestrian was pushed against the house wall, went to the ground in the further course and a square wound about 15 centimeters long on the head.
A rescue team brought the injured to the clinic for medical treatment.
British Police Announce Assange's Extradition Order
The British police today handed over an extradition order to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who sought asylum at the Ecuadorian embassy in London and applied for asylum.
Scotland Yard said the 40-year-old Australian had been given a “call to stand up” that asked him to appear in a police station, adding that if he did not comply, he would be threatened with arrest.
Assange has threatened extradition to Sweden on charges of sexual misconduct after his options have been exhausted under British law since the Supreme Court rejected his objection to extradition earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm would deliver him to the United States, he sought asylum at the Ecuadorian embassy in London on June 19 and asked the South American country for political asylum.
“Scotland Yard has given an invitation to a 40-year-old man to stand at a police station at a time we have chosen,” a spokesman said.
He continues to violate the terms of his release on bail.
The message did not comment on the delivery of the police request.
Assange fears he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States and charged with possible espionage charges there after he posted more than 250,000 diplomatic messages on WikiLeaks' disclosure website.
Driver who was smashed with 210 km/h and hot drink between his legs gets <0xC2><0xA3>1,000 fine
A driver was fined <0xC2><0xA3>1,000 for driving with up to 210 km/h and a hot drink between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, from Tiptree, Essex, was stopped on May 27 with his Mercedes Benz on the A120 at Braintree.
After the police stopped him, they discovered the drink cup between his legs.
In front of the Colchester District Court, Howie pleaded guilty without having driven the necessary care and attention.
He received seven points and a six-month driving ban.
Howie was also sentenced to pay <0xC2><0xA3>90 in costs as well as a <0xC2><0xA3>100 surcharge.
Tax for foreign property owners against London's speculative bubble
The Ministry of Finance has provisionally calculated the CGT measure, but is still waiting for the final decision of Treasury Chancellor George Osborne, who in the 2012 budget had imposed a stamp tax of 7% on apartments that cost over <0xC2><0xA3>2 million and do not hold annual fees for buyers and renters.
Already now, income from stamp duty on residential property in the districts of Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea, which in fiscal year 2012/13 amounted to <0xC2><0xA3>708 million, exceeds revenues for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the Northeast, Northwest, Yorkshire and the Humber region combined.
Cook said: “After the rise in stamp duty on high-priced apartments and the introduction of related legislation against circumvention, it can be difficult to claim that high-quality properties are too low-taxed, regardless of the effects of the outdated municipal tax system.”
“But this move could make some foreign investors more restrained when it comes to buying real estate in London, or stopping owners from selling it,” he added.
Top-notch real estate – the top five to ten percent of the housing market by price – in London’s prosperous Southwest Belt, stretching from Fulham to Wimbledon, has risen by a record 11.8 percent last year.
Prices in Central London had a steady annual growth of 5.6%, but were overshadowed by an emerging "domestic market", on which the southwestern part of the city, the north (7.4%) and the east (6.5%) experienced an upward trend, according to a survey by Savills.
Scientists were able to shed more light on the context in which a dog’s tailing is related to its mood.
Previous research had shown that happy dogs with their tail shifted more to the right (from the dog's point of view), while in nervous dogs it was the left side.
But now scientists say that other dogs can perceive these subtle differences and react to them.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trent, said: “It is well known in humans that the left and right halves of the brain react differently to stimuli that cause positive or negative emotions.”
Here we have tried to look at this with other species.
He also noted that in dogs, just as in humans, the right half of the brain is responsible for the movement of the left side and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played different roles in the emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to the lateral tailings of their peers, the researchers monitored the animals while watching these other dogs’ films.
They measured the heart rate of the four legs and analyzed the behavior.
We'll probably soon understand why the tail moves in one, in the other direction.
Professor Vallortigara said: “We showed the dogs movies with dogs – either a true-to-life version or a silhouette to eliminate distracting other aspects, and we were able to control the movement of the tail more to the left or right.”
When the animals saw an otherwise expressive dog moving their tail to the right (as seen from the dog’s wedging perspective), they remained completely relaxed.
But if the tail tends mainly to the left (again from the dog’s point of view), their heart rate rose and they looked restless.
According to Professor Vallortigara, the dogs do not intentionally communicate with each other through these movements.
Rather, he is convinced that the dogs would have learned from experience, what movements they should be worried about and when not.
He said: “If you have different encounters with other dogs and you’re more likely to be linked to friendly behavior with your tail and the right side is more likely to produce less friendly behavior, then you’re reacting based on those experiences.”
The researchers say the findings could help dog owners, veterinarians and trainers to better understand their pet’s emotions.
John Bradshaw, an expert on dog behavior and guest stipend at the University of Bristol’s Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, said this was not the first study to examine whether left and right are important for dogs.
Last year, a team at the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn their heads to the left when looking at an aggressive dog, and to the right when it comes to a satisfied dog.
In another research paper at the University of Victoria in Canada, the following was stated: “Dogs are more likely to approach a robot dog when his ‘tail’ turns left and not right, rather than getting restless – just unlike in the Italian study.”
According to him, the differences could therefore affect that the dogs in the different studies did not interpret the animals in the films or the robot dogs as dogs.
A study of how dogs react to real dogs could help, he explained.
“While there is considerable evidence for many different mammals that the two halves of the brain are used for different purposes, many of the details still need to be determined – and dogs are no exception,” Bradshaw said.
But since their behavior is easy to record, it probably won’t be long before we understand why the tail sometimes moves in one direction, sometimes in the other direction.
Arctic Monkeys postpone performance in Glasgow due to illness Alex Turners
The rock band Arctic Monkeys has postponed a performance in Glasgow after their lead singer became ill with sore throat.
The band from Sheffield is scheduled to play in the hydro on Friday.
However, due to the illness of lead singer Alex Turner, the concert must now be postponed.
The band's announcement came after they had previously had to postpone a performance at the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on their official website, Arctic Monkeys said: “After the decision to cancel the show at the LG Arena in Birmingham tonight, as well as on medical advice, the Arctic Monkeys must also cancel the show at the Hydro in Glasgow on Friday, November 1.
“Alex Turner was diagnosed with throat inflammation, which is why he unfortunately can’t appear.”
The show at the LG Arena in Birmingham will now take place on November 20, which was moved to November 21 at the Hydro in Glasgow.
All tickets are valid for these shows.
We apologize to all ticket holders for any inconvenience caused by this.
Please contact customer service at the point of sale where you purchased your ticket, if you need further support.
Pope Francis Appoints First Cardinals in February
Pope Francis will be summoned to new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time on February 22, as the Vatican announced on Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest-ranking clergymen in the Catholic Church after the pope, and they are also the ones who elect a pope, so that Francis will appoint the first group of men who will ultimately participate in the election of his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, a cardinal who has reached the age of 80 can no longer take part in the pope’s election – this includes a group of 120 “elected cardinals”.
In a statement announcing the message, Father Federico Lombardi, a spokesman for the Vatican, said a meeting of all cardinals would take place before the ceremony to appoint the new cardinals, also known as the Consistory, was held.
“Pope Francis has decided to announce his decision to convene the Consistory in February in advance so that other meetings that require the participation of cardinals from around the world can be planned,” Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said the number of cardinals eligible to vote would likely drop by February.
He explained that a pope usually appoints as many cardinals as necessary so that the number of eligible cardinals is again 120, and as many cardinals over 80 as he wishes.
The Consistory next year will be significant because it will be the first since the election of Francis in March of this year, Valero said.
At present there is a certain overlap on the European side, and especially on Italy.
“It will be interesting to see if the new pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance,” he said.
Forty percent of Catholics live in South America, but they have only a small number of cardinals.
The cardinals will also be the first to be called since the formation of the Council of Cardinals founded by Francis, a group of eight cardinals from around the world who are tasked with finding ways to reform the Church.
In the past, the Pope decided everything on his own.
“Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him,” Valero said.
He explained that it was "good possible" for Francis to ask the cardinals for advice.
But so far we haven’t been able to do that – that’s all new.
Valero said that typically the bishops would be called cardinals from large places, but Francis was “full of surprises – so we don’t know who he will appoint.”
GM recalls new pickup trucks in the U.S. to repair seat back
General Motors is recalling nearly 19,000 of its brand-new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks from 2014 to fix a problem with the manually adjustable seat back, according to a U.S. Vehicle Safety Regulatory Authority statement on Friday.
In some of the cars, there may be a defect in the mechanism for restoring the front seat.
For this reason, they do not comply with the Federal Vehicle Safety Directives for head restraints.
“If you get on the vehicle from behind, it is possible that the head restraint does not properly protect the occupants, so there is an increased risk of injury,” read the report on the website of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).
The recalled models were produced between 1 August and 10 September.
The delivery of the GM trucks began in June and represents the most important model launch of the leading U.S. car manufacturer since the insolvency-related restructuring in 2009.
GM informed the vehicle owners in the first half of October about the defect.
The NHTSA was unable to review the notification letter due to the 16-day government shutdown, which had a negative impact on car sales in October.
Sales of the Silverado and Sierra trucks, which were redeveloped for the 2014 model year, increased by 20 percent in the first ten months of the year, GM said on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado and 16,503 Sierra pickup trucks.
The GM stock rose 1.4 percent on the New York Stock Exchange to $37.47 on Friday afternoon.
The Desperation of an Obama Voter
I have elected President Obama twice in the hopes that change is possible.
He says Obama has made commendable efforts that have been thwarted by the blockade tactics of the Republicans
The blockade policy does not excuse the website problems of Obamacare, the drone attacks
Obama’s memoirs about the 2008 election campaign were a sad memory of what would have been possible.
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second-year student at Harvard Medical School.
I am currently reading a very sad book.
It is a book that I believed would warm me up during the sad second year of my medical studies and give me hope again.
It is called “The Audacity to Win” and depicts Barack Obama’s memoirs on the 2008 presidential election.
When I finish my patient transcripts in the evening and go to bed, the book takes me back to a time when politics inspired millions and a speech could rob the breath.
The election was held to a landslide victory and news speakers kept in mind the historical significance of this hour.
My classmates were crying for joy and my parents were collecting all the newspapers they could find.
A young team of visionaries was on their way to the White House and the nation was ready for change.
When Obama took office in 2008, he had a approval rating of 82%.
And then I close the book.
Switching back to the present is a bad awakening, as if being torn out of a dream.
It’s hard to remember these optimistic times – they seem to be a vague memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
In the years since I first cast my vote, something has actually changed.
But it's just nothing I could have imagined.
I recognize the great and versatile things that Obama has achieved, from the adoption of the Affordable Care Act for Health Insurance to the military withdrawal from Iraq, the end of the forced silence of homosexuality in the army, and the killing of Osama bin Laden.
I, too, believe that the political blockade tactics of the party have overstepped too many aspirations with which our nation should be moved forward: immigration reform, a public option for health insurance, and the closure of Guantanamo Bay, to name a few.
But after I have defended the Obama administration countless times against colleagues and acquaintances, I have come to the end with my attempts to explain.
I have reached a point of political desperation.
The Republican blockade policy cannot explain why you allow the interrogation of foreign heads of state or the killing of innocent children by drones overseas.
It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data on the privacy of Americans and why whistleblowers are being punished who disclose state misconduct.
It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki, a U.S. citizen, was murdered without trial, nor why public funding and spending limits are being circumvented during the presidential election.
It does not justify the results of a report that says the White House’s efforts to calm the media are the “most aggressive ... since the Nixon government.”
And most recently, it can’t excuse the inability to design a simple website in more than three years since the adoption of the Affordable Care Act.
I don't know if that's what I should have expected.
I should have understood at the age of 18 that government work could contradict her previous political campaigns.
Obviously, the Chamber of Deputies is not a foreseeable course, as an opposition party and random events such as the Newtown Massacre shape the public discussion.
But when I look at the above examples, they seem to be largely elected by the government itself.
And that bothers me the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney represented a confusing and unspecified alternative, he seemed unable to determine his direction and positions.
I had the impression that a second term for Obama, free from the pressure of future elections, would fulfill the hope of which we had heard so long ago.
But with the fall in approval values for Obama to below 45% this week, the return to 2008 by this book has become all the harder.
It awakens in me the longing for the many promises that have dissolved in air.
This week I read a section in the book describing how Obama had to inject a heavy loss against Clinton in the pre-election in Pennsylvania.
In a meeting with the electoral assistants after the decision, he told his employees that they would have to come back on course and follow the purpose of their case.
“I want us to find our magic again,” he said.
We need to remember who we are.
It's five years later, Mr. President, and I couldn't agree more.
The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer Claims Prime Minister Tony Abbott Has Conflict of Interest on Parental Leave
Billionaire and MP Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott was in a conflict of interest about his plans for parental leave because his daughters could get pregnant and therefore benefit from it.
The mining magnate, who is in a legal dispute over the payment of $6 million in CO2 tax, raised the claim when he wanted to wipe questions off the table whether he was in a conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which are important for deciding whether to abolish or cut CO2 and mining taxes.
But Palmer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest and Abbott's daughters would personally benefit from the laws.
“He’s in a big conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave, because if one of his daughters gets pregnant, he has a direct interest in whether she’s getting a vacation or not,” Palmer said.
Two months after the election, the Electoral Commission declared Palmer, with 53 votes, to be the winner of Fairfax’s Sunshine Coast seat.
Palmer called for a revision of the vote counting process to make it go away faster.
Tony Abbott's daughters Frances and Bridget.
Should these elections be decided two months after the end of the vote?
“We need a better system,” he said.
Why should we not have a system where you march in, enter the data into a computer, choose it immediately, and then at 6:30 p.m. the result?
Palmer also criticized the use of pencils when marking the ballot.
Do you use them because you can then eradicate the results if you do not like them?
Today, tuning with pencils is unbelievable.
The Electoral Commission has examined the options for an electronic election and recently published a joint bill with New Zealand.
Palmer, 59, said his policy included an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he would take his new position "very seriously".
In a public office, it is about the service to the public.
“We seek no reward except history, namely that we can serve in a critical time of this community,” he said.
RBS suspends two foreign exchange traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its foreign exchange department, so two people familiar with the situation; this is another indication that the global government’s investigation into alleged manipulations in the currency market is rapidly on the rise.
Some of the world’s largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are cooperating with authorities on investigations into the world’s largest financial market, on which $5.3 billion a day is exchanged.
The two dealers would be the first RBS employees to be suspended in the widening investigation that the scandal surrounding the Libor interbank business is drawing on.
The bank, which did not comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it had received requests for information from authorities.
“Our investigations on this issue continue and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and other regulators,” the bank said two weeks ago.
Last month, people close to the situation said that the RBS had forwarded the records of emails and instant messages sent by and to a former retailer to the UK’s regulatory authority, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This trader, Richard Usher, had left RBS in 2010 and is said to have been licensed from his current position as European head of forex spot trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of European spot trading at Citi, was on leave this week, and Matt Gardiner, former chief currency dealer at Barclays and UBS, was suspended this week at Standard Chartered.
None of these dealers were charged with any misconduct.
Usher’s Instant Message group included bankers at Barclays and the Citigroup, people close to the situation said.
UBS announced this week that it had taken steps against some of its employees after the Swiss regulator Finma said it was investigating a suspected manipulation of the foreign exchange market at a number of Swiss banks.
At least six authorities worldwide – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss competition authority Weko, the FCA, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are currently dealing with allegations that bankers have agreed on transactions in the currency market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also launched internal investigations or received information requests from authorities, people familiar with the situation said.
Banks are hacking instant messages and emails from several years in search of cases of misbehavior.
The news of these investigations has set traders in turmoil in an area that in recent years has been one of the most profitable trading units of investment banks, but this year was under pressure because low volatility in currencies limits the chances for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to downplay the affair and said that it is almost impossible to manipulate the extended and highly liquid foreign exchange market, but leading traders are of the opinion that this is not necessarily true.
A leading trader noted that despite the enormous daily volume in foreign exchange trading, the fragmentation of liquidity between the various trading platforms and the increasing use of their own internal platforms by banks leads to the fact that “you can already influence the market with very low ticket prices”.
The news came out the same day as Credit Suisse announced that it had this week terminated a trader of its London Exchange Traded Funds office after it caused a loss of just under $6 million at the end of last year.
The Bank shall promptly inform the competent authorities and cooperate with them.
“We are confident that the trader has acted alone and that the matter has been curtailed,” said Credit Suisse.
Painted the building on the Bechtle plot
A group of citizens' initiative "Swiss meadow" has beautified the building on the Bechtle plot on the Kurpromenade in Bad Herrenalb.
In addition, it cleaned and spread the footpath, it said in a press release.
The planned covering of the collapsed house in the back of the plot was not allowed for security reasons, because the terrain is in danger of slipping away.
Alfred Abel, who currently manages the property, had agreed to the decorating action with his colleague Reinhard Domke from the BI.
Prior to the BI's action, a transparent "We are for it" message had been attached.
However, this did not disturb the approximately 20 members of the Citizens’ Initiative in their actions.
Their motto on the big poster was "We are against Bauruins".
With this, she wanted to point out the danger of even greater ruins on the Swiss meadow - should the giant project one day fail.
In conversation with many passers-by, it became clear that some citizens believe that the implementation of the city project will be much better, although not a few have the same questions about the dimension of the proposed project as the BI.
But they are starting to resign because the city continues to push these responses forward, the BI said.
As was heard, the mayor’s public statements also have an impact.
In May, he said in the municipal council meeting that he feared the possibility of a thermal bath should the population vote against the plans for a bathing and wellness complex on the Swiss meadow in the city’s decision.
Some seem almost frightened because of this, others feel it as a “plump extortion attempt” on the population, the BI said in a press release.
The BI thanked the donors for the color and all the helpers.
Rangnick shields for Schiris: Mane no swan king
As satisfied as Ralf Rangnick is with the current high form of Bundesliga table leader Red Bull Salzburg, so disappointed was the sports director of the "bulls" from the referees.
"There is currently a dangerous tendency for Mane and Alan to be pushed into the category of gay kings," he took the two offensive whistleblowers in protection on Thursday at a press conference in Salzburg.
The latest occasion for Rangnick's criticism was Yellow for Mane in the 3:0 against Grödig last Sunday, in which Senegalese was hanged an alleged cast - which was obviously not as the TV footage showed.
"A crass mistaken decision," said Rangnick, who called referee Harkam "totally overwhelmed."
Harkam also contributed "his part" to the escalation between Salzburg coach Roger Schmidt and Grödig coach Adi Hütter after the match.
He defended his German landman deciduously: "Then I would have behaved the same in every single situation as Roger Schmidt".
Schmidt himself does not want to have had any contact with his colleague after the scarecrow with hutter.
I don't know why.
"Because I'm the one who was insulted," the 46-year-old said.
However, in view of the success, Rangnick agreed to a hymn of praise.
“There are only two words for that: really good,” he said.
There's not much to expound.
Above all, the way the team plays is impressive.
It's supposed to go on like this.
There will hardly be any changes in the winter transfer time.
There is no great reason to change anything.
"Except a player comes forward with the wish that he wants to leave the club," Rangnick said.
Supreme Court Confirms Obama's Health Law
It is a great victory for the Obama administration: The U.S. Supreme Court today decided that the health law closely linked to Barack Obama is constitutional.
With five to four votes, the judges ruled that the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act – it forces U.S. citizens to complete health insurance or pay a fine by 2014 – is constitutional within the framework of the state’s tax authority.
Supreme Judge John Roberts sided with the four more liberal members of the Chamber, while Judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito, and Kennedy ruled against it.
The court also endorsed the remaining sections of the 2700-page law and also represented the view that the provision of the Health Act, according to which states would either have to extend the access requirements for Medicaid or otherwise disprove all state Medicaid grants, would not be disputed.
The lawsuit against the law had been initiated by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The law had been voted down by all leading Republican presidential candidates, including final challenger Mitt Romney, in the 2012 pre-election campaign.
Norway: Norwegian place makes light with giant mirrors
With huge mirrors, the inhabitants of a Norwegian village have brought light into their dark valley.
Due to the low degree of sunshine, the Rjukan in the Vestfjord valley usually sinks in the shade of the surrounding mountains from autumn to spring.
With three gigantic reflectors at 45 meters altitude, a century dream came true on Wednesday.
"Finally!", cheered Mayor Steinar Bergsland at the start ceremony on TV2.
Some of the residents of the valley were sitting in sun chairs, while others were wearing sunglasses for safety reasons.
Previously, sun-hungry people had to ride a cable car to a nearby summit in the winter.
Ten years ago, the local artist Martin Andersen had presented the proposal to direct the rays with mirrors into the valley.
But this basic idea has existed since 1913.
After several years of debate, the city council finally approved the 5 million kroner (around 615,000 euros) expensive project.
A similar construction has been providing the Italian alpine town of Viganella with winter sunshine for several years.
Posts barely read on Sundays
"Many citizens will not have noticed that the red dots for the Sunday reading are still on different mailboxes of the city centre and the districts, but if you read the small print on the yellow containers of the Post AG, you will quickly find that the reading on Sundays and holidays is not going to take place.
A request from the FDP confirmed this.
On Sundays and public holidays, only in front of the post office building will be emptied in Ernst-Ludwig-Straße 36 and Jakob-Müller-Straße 1 in Hüttenfeld.
Whether the vacancy in Hofheim and Rosengarten will still be held on Sunday will not be answered in the response to the FDP’s request.
The FDP’s social and youth policy spokesman, Fritz Rohrenbeck, wants to echo here.
The Sunday delivery is an important postal service right at the time of appointment.
"This dilutes this undertaking radically and unduly despite the price increase for letters in January 2013".
Thomas Bittner, chairman of the Liberal Group and City Council, supports his group colleagues: "What annoys me is the fact that the learning times here are being changed or even deleted in secret".
The post office is miles away from the public.
"At least the mailboxes in the districts Neuschloss and Rosengarten need to be emptied again on Sundays," said Bittner and Rohrenbeck unisono.
The same was true for the core city, especially non-mobile citizens would also have to be able to reach a mailbox with Sunday storage on foot.
Rohrenbeck asked in the city parliament if the city administration was planning talks with the post about the matter.
Mayor Erich Maier replied that the post did not communicate with Lampertheim.
However, there is also a Sunday lunch in Hofheim.
His party has advocated privatization.
“Then decisions will be made elsewhere,” Maier said.
Frankfurt’s parking fees are expected to rise sharply
Parking in Frankfurt could soon become more sensitive.
The city’s magistrate advises this morning on a presentation by transport minister Stefan Majer (Green).
According to this, the parking fees are to be increased by 50 percent.
However, prices should not be increased, but the time interval of parking clocks and ticket machines should be reduced from 30 to 20 minutes.
In December, the City Council will have to decide.
The IHK Frankfurt Retail Committee considers this "not a good idea".
The possibility of parking directly in front of the store is "a non-underestimable advantage for smaller retailers".
The Transport Club Deutschland is of the opinion that an increase after two decades is "appropriate and actually long overdue".
Public transport is also becoming more expensive.
Freudenstadt: Quick Actions Overwhelming Hosts
With a narrow frame, the men I of the TSV Freudenstadt had to compete in the Schiller-Schulturnhalle in Reutlingen against the TG Gönningen from the Schwäbische Alb.
The Devils were on the other side of the net with an experienced team.
Soon, however, it turned out that they, also due to age, could not fully cope with the rapid actions of the City of Joy.
With the hard and placed ups, the Gönninger were extremely difficult.
Again and again, they missed the passes and attacks played by Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz cleanly over the network center and were not in place in the blockade defense.
The first two high sets of profits clearly expressed the superiority of the City of Joy in all interests.
In the face of this overwhelming and game-determining performance, the third set was then won a bit lazy and uneasy to the 3:0 final (25:13, 25:14, 25:22).
There will be a much stronger opponent on the field on November 2nd with the TV Baiersbronn, which was able to make its way through Nagold.
TSV Freudenstadt I: Dominik Bäuerle, Yannik Büchle, Sebastian Dölker, Felix Pälchen, Stefan Räller, Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz.
In the B-Class, the second teams from Baiersbronn and Freudenstadt faced each other in the Murgtalhalle in Baiersbronn.
They delivered a hard-fought two-hour match.
Nervousness on both sides caused errors and points; even with the passes, the accuracy was sometimes deficient, and in some critical game scenes, the override prevented the view for possible points gains.
In this very well-balanced meeting, however, Marcus Blasutto’s TSV team consistently agreed with the great physical commitment and a joyful commitment of both teams.
Care day at the little English hut
For the fifth care day in succession of the Natura 2000 project of Upper Hotzenwald, a group of dedicated participants met at the small English hut in Ibach.
On the basis of suggestions from the population, the area of the hut of the view into the valley should be freed on this day, Mayor Helmut Kaiser said.
Many hikers, according to Kaiser, described this area as the shimmer of the gorge, where the landscape offers the ideal setting for magnificent views.
He thanked the attendees for their willingness to cooperate and stressed that the day of care was an appropriate instrument to strengthen the connection of man and nature.
It gives every citizen the opportunity to put their own accents in nature.
At the same time with the tourism aspect, ecological consideration can also be found.
This ecological aspect was explained by Friederike Tribukait of the Nature Conservation Department of the Government Presidium of Freiburg following the welcome by Land Council Tilman Bollacher, who had taken over the umbrella and wished the action a good success.
According to Tribukait, the tourist destination of the landscape is covered with the aim of maintaining the now heavily grown old Allmendweidfeld with its specific protected habitat types by opening and connecting to the still-existing meadows.
Certain species, such as rare butterflies and grasshoppers, cannot overcome barriers in the form of forest surfaces.
You need these free compounds for species conservation.
Tribukait said she did not want to fail to break a lance for the planned biosphere area.
The current measure is not only seamlessly integrated into this planning.
A biosphere area also offers the opportunity for sustainable economic and ecological development on the basis of the internationally recognized Unesco status, and thus a continuous complement to the life project as well as the previous days of care achieved for the future.
After these different performances, district manager Christoph Wehle and life project manager Cornelia Bischoff divided the helpers into groups.
The larger trees had already been struck in advance, the forest tractor may be ready for pick-up.
A group of helpers should take care of the release of wacholder bushes and the maintenance of a dry stone bar.
The goal was the free view at the viewpoint.
Löffingen: Köpfler is still the only candidate
Information on the Internet: Although the town of Löffingen with its 7,514 inhabitants, an intact infrastructure, a forward-looking school, children, youth and seniors policy, as well as its own townships, has not yet registered a second mayoral candidate.
As the only candidate for the succession of the mayor Norbert Brugger, who no longer candidates for reasons of age, the 46-year-old banker and business owner Dieter Köpfler from Löffingen has so far been confirmed.
The application deadline expires on Monday, November 11, at 6 p.m.
Google, Samsung, Huawei sued for Nortel patents
The group, which owns thousands of earlier Nortel patents, filed lawsuits on Thursday over patent infringements against cell phone manufacturers, including Google, the company that was overrun by Nortel during the insolvency auction.
Rockstar, the consortium that bought the Nortel patents for $4.5 billion, sued Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringements before the U.S. District Court in Texas.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, BlackBerry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is being monitored in seven cases of patent infringement.
The patents refer to technology that matches search terms on the Internet with relevant advertising, so the complaint that meets the core of Google’s search engine business.
Representatives from Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not immediately reachable.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC are manufacturing phones that work with Google’s Android operating system, which is in fierce competition with Apple and Microsoft’s mobile products.
In 2011, Google made an initial bid of $900 million for the Nortel patents.
Google increased its supply several times and last offered $4.4 billion.
After it was overrun with Rockstar’s Nortel patents, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a business that was also motivated in part by Motorola’s library of patents.
“Although Google has failed in its attempt to acquire the patent at the auction, Google has infringed the patents and continues to do so,” the complaint said.
Rockstar is demanding a high compensation from Google as it claims Google’s patent infringement was intentional, the indictment said.
Egypt Condemns First Freely Elected President
Mohammed Mursi is resigning his office, but his day of triumph is not expected to mean the end of the political disputes in Egypt.
Islamist Mohammed Morsi promised a “new Egypt” when he was sworn in as the country’s first freely elected president, succeeding Husni Mubarak, who had been ousted 16 months earlier.
With his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Mursi became the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world and Egypt's fifth head of state since the fall of the monarchy about 60 years ago.
He took the oath before the 18 black-robed judges of the court, which has its seat on the Nile and is imitated by an ancient Egyptian temple.
“We are striving for a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic,” Mursi said at the ceremony, which was broadcast live on state television.
“Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom, a true democracy and stability,” said 60-year-old Mursi, a U.S.-trained engineer and member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that has been mostly reorganized by Vissarbo since its founding 84 years ago.
Hundreds of soldiers and police officers were guarding the building when Mursi arrived shortly after eleven o’clock local time in a small car convoy.
Only a few hundred supporters had gathered in front of the court to cheer the new president, and in contrast to the presidential prank from the Mubarak era, traffic was stopped only for a short time so that the car convoy could cross the normally bustling street with the suburban city centre.
As the brotherhood’s uncharismatic “replacement wheel,” his personal prestige has increased since his victory and a Friday speech, in which he presented himself not only as a candidate of the Islamists, but all of them, who bring the aspirations of the 2011 uprising against the authoritarian Mubarak to the spotlight.
“Egypt is today a civil, national, constitutional and modern state,” the white-collared Morsi told the judges in the wooden-tabled chamber in which he took office.
Later, Mursi went to the University of Cairo, where he was supposed to give his opening speech.
He was officially welcomed by an army chapel that played the national anthem, which he listened to in Habakkuk.
The military leader Feldmarschall Hussein Tantawi was present.
Upon his arrival, he was greeted by hundreds of attendees in the largest auditorium of the university with speech choruses of "The Army and the People Are One Hand".
Established in 1908 as a bastion of secular education, Cairo University has developed into a stronghold of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
On Friday, Mursi took a symbolic oath at Tahir Square, the birthplace of the uprising that led to the end of Mubarak’s authoritarian rule last year, and vowed to reclaim the presidential powers the military council has had from the head of state.
But by taking the official oath before the court and not as usual before the parliament, he bows to the will of the military, which indicates that the power struggle will continue.
Mursis’ speech on Tahir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.
Falkenberger Discothek provides two great evenings
The new season at the Falkenberger Discothek "Blue Velvet" has begun.
On Friday night it is called "Pump this party", on Saturday night it will continue with a Ü 25 party.
Fat beats and cool sounds are of course promised by the organizers on both days.
Workers crashed by leader: seriously injured
On Thursday, when changing a defective external sensor, a 51-year-old worker crashed into Eggelsberg from a conductor and was seriously injured.
The man from Lamprechtshausen wanted to replace a defective heating sensor on the exterior fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade of a guesthouse.
As he climbed onto the ladder facing the roof stream, it slipped away and the man fell to the concrete floor.
He suffered serious injuries and was taken with the rescue helicopter "Christophorus 6" to the Salzburg National Hospital.
Rape in South Africa: Two life sentences
Nine months after the brutal rape and mutilation of a 17-year-old girl in South Africa, the perpetrator has been sentenced to two life sentences on Friday.
This was reported by the broadcaster SABC.
The victim later died as a result of serious injuries.
John Kana was found guilty at the beginning of the week of the crime.
The act had sparked nationwide outrage.
The then 21-year-old had raped Anene Booysen in February in an industrial estate in Bredasdorp near Cape Town.
For 14 hours, the doctors fought for the victim’s survival, but in vain.
The young people’s eyes were so bleak that the nurses and nurses needed psychological help.
Kana had admitted to having been in a bar with Booysen on the night of the murder.
He also confessed to beating and raping her, but he denied being responsible for the girl's death.
The police had initially suspected several perpetrators, but released two suspects from custody because the evidence against them was insufficient.
The prosecutor’s office also stressed during the trial that it was convinced that Kana was alone at the time of the attack.
Rape is almost common in South Africa: every year, there are about 64,000 advertisements for sexual violence.
This is almost ten times as much as in Germany, but with 82 million people it has significantly more inhabitants than South Africa (50 million).
Police and women’s associations in South Africa estimate the dark figures for sexual violence to be 10- to 25-fold.
Jumbo visits the Black Forest Schinken
Jumbo in search of the "best ham in the world": for the TV show "Galileo" visited the Pro7 star Bonndorf.
The spokesperson makes it clear at the outset: the most important thing for the ham are the pork skewers, turbomast is not a good prerequisite.
So can hams that you get in every supermarket be a quality product?
As head of the large ham factory in the Black Forest, Jumbo explains the workings of the company "Adler" in Bonndorf.
"Germany's favorite ham", as Jumbo announces the Black Forest ham.
Only with hair protection and kittel does he get inside the factory.
Jumbo must first disinfect his hands before he can grab the microphone.
Jumbo to be reinforced at quicklimbiss in Waldshut
"Here I'm working huge amounts," the TV makers say, Black Forest hams as a mass product.
16,000 colognes per week speak for themselves.
Weight, fat content, color: Uli explains what quality is all about.
Most pigs are slaughtered at six months of age.
TV at a level?
Details such as the ph-value of the meat also play a role.
The darker the meat, the higher the ph value.
“I’m excited when you measure Roberto Blanco, what happens next,” Jumbo said.
Here the level of private television is presented in pure culture.
But the look is worth it anyway.
The viewer sees that the decomposition of the colognes continues to be handicrafts.
Because: Black Forest ham is traditionally found without bones on the shelf.
The secret of ham is the spice mixture with the salt.
Smoke tower and smoke control visually remind Jumbo of a "U-boat".
The trick: Tannin branches here in the smoke provide for the special taste of the Black Forest ham.
20 days in the smoke make the ham almost black.
"Now the disk disappears in the jumbo," he announces the test supply.
"It's really delicious," according to the conclusion of the TV star.
All those involved will be able to live.
You thought travel agencies belonged to the Internet of the past?
Flight Centre seems to oppose the trend.
The company has increased its year-round profit outlook and expects record revenues from holidaymakers in Australia and the UK.
The travel company now expects adjusted annual earnings before taxes between $325 and $340 million, compared to $305 to $315 million in its previous forecast.
If the current targets are reached, that means an increase of 12 to 17 percent compared to a record profit of $290.4 million in the period 2011/12.
As CEO Graham Turner announced, Flight Centre achieved an eight percent profit in the first half of the year and booked a strong start to the second half, especially in the Australian and British private business.
“Since the beginning of the year, our ten countries have been profitable, and some of them are well on track towards record year-on-year earnings before interest and taxes,” he said.
These include Australia and the United Kingdom, which are typically among our strongest earners.
In Australia, the leisure industry has recovered in the second half of the year, compensating for a slightly weaker market for business travel.
Similarly, it worked well for the leisure business of Flight Centre in the UK, while here, too, the business customers spent less.
The U.S. business recovered from the weaker first half of the season, with a profit expected for the third year in a row for the full year.
Flight Centre shares rose by 3 cents to $38.20 yesterday.
Schools are being held to a greater focus on mathematics, spelling and grammar
In English literature courses, students will have to deal with at least one piece of Shakespeare, a 19th-century novel, romantic poetry, and contemporary British novels from 1914 onwards.
The exam also includes "unseen texts" to encourage wider reading.
The combined course in English literature and language will be abolished.
Starting in 2015, students will have to take a stand-alone GCSE exam for language, with strong incentives to choose English literature as a separate qualification.
Tomorrow, the Ministry of Education will publish the new curriculum for English and Mathematics – the first subjects that have been radically redesigned.
Other core subjects will be changed next year.
In a separate initiative, Ofqual, the Audit Authority, will announce a reorganization of the GCSE structures, including a new notation system and less coursework.
In a speech last summer, Education Minister Michael Gove said that there is a “wide consensus that we need to reform our auditing system to restore public confidence,” stressing that the GCSEs would become “challenger, more ambitious and more stringent”.
Studies show that English schools spend less time on mathematics – 116 hours a year or three hours a week per school year – than most other countries.
On the other hand, Australian schools teach an average of 143 hours per year and students in Singapore receive 138 hours.
While there will be no formal requirement to provide more time for mathematics in the schedule, from coalition circles, the comprehensive math exam – combined with a stronger weighting of the subject in rankings – is likely to encourage schools to set up more hours.
The curriculum focuses more on "problems from the right life", including financial mathematics.
Beautiful animals and delicious cakes attract
The most beautiful rabbits of different breeds and colours present the circuit performance show this weekend in the town hall.
The reviews were already made on Thursday
Once again, the local club W514 is organising this large exhibition.
Breeders of the Soest-based associations show their best animals as well as young Wickeder hobbyists their rabbits here.
On Thursday, six judges took the evaluation of the numerous rabbits and were able to award outstanding animals.
Visitors to the show are best informed, as the assessment of all animals is appropriate to the cages.
The official opening of the exhibition will be held by Mayor Hermann Arndt on Saturday at 2.30 p.m.
The rabbit show is open to all visitors on Saturday from 10 a.m. and on Sunday from 10 a.m. to 3.30 p.m., which will be followed by the victories.
Guests are also invited to a tombola equipped with state-of-the-art prices and a deliciously equipped cafeteria.

Salem: Johanna Rahner at the Ecumenical Forum
At the next Ecumenical Conversation Forum on Monday, 21 October, in the New Museum of the Castle, the theme is "To Hell with Hell - Theological reflections on today's dealing with the last things".
The speaker is Professor Johanna Rahner.
The Ecumenical Conversation Forum is an initiative of the Salem Catholic and Evangelical Church communities, the Salem Castle and the Bodenseekreis Cultural Office.
Johanna Rahner wants to discuss in the forum the question of how people today classify the "last things" after death.
If people had known too much about it in the past centuries, relying on those images of heaven and hell “that still shape our ideas today,” the contemporary prophetic doctrine of hopes of completion is more characterized by a certain embarrassment or even languagelessness.
“The greater hope has been aroused by religious criticism to Christians and Christians,” she said.
She has provided us with so many question marks that we seem to have gotten rid of the exclamation marks.
Johanna Rahner goes on to say: “But the decisive challenge remains the annoyance of death.”
This is related to the question of that desire, "who dreams that everything will be good in the end".
Johanna Rahner, born in Baden-Baden in 1962, studied Catholic Theology and Biology at the Albert-Ludwigs-Universität Freiburg from 1982 to 1989.
She graduated in 1997 as Dr. theol., also in Freiburg.
The Habilitation for Fundamental Theology and Ecumenical Theology was followed in 2003 at the University of Westphalia Wilhelms.
Johanna Rahner has been teaching systematic theology at the Institute of Catholic Theology at the University of Kassel since 2010.
Geislingen: More than 100 young Catholics from Klein Heuberg confirm their faith in the firmament
In two services, 101 15- and 16-year-old youths of the Soul Care Unit Am Kleinen Heuberg have been confirmed.
The service was accompanied by the Laudato-Si group in the morning, the Youth Choir The Spirit in the afternoon.
With the reception of the firm sacrament, the young people said yes to their baptism and prayed for the power of the Holy Spirit.
In recent months, the members of the firm had prepared themselves, under the leadership of Deacon Reiner Dehner and with the help of numerous members of the municipality, for the big holiday.
In different projects, they got to know different tasks of Christian community life and together experienced the youth day in Untermachtal.
Illmensee: Second mountain bike race enthusiastic participants
When the weather was great, 214 cyclists came to Illmensee to complete the tour of the hills around the lake.
Ulrich Knobel of the sporting club Illmensee announces this.
Among the participants, especially at short distances over 15 kilometers and 300 meters of altitude, were also numerous cyclists who wanted to practice their hobby once in a competitive atmosphere.
Two junior drivers of the German top class were also at the start in this competition: Felix Bader from Bad Waldsee and Pascal Treubel from Aach-Linz came with the recommendation good places at the German Championships.
The two men were able to leave the field as expected.
As in the previous year, Felix Bader was able to save a small time jump to the goal and defended his title as the overall winner of the short-distance.
In second place again Pascal Treubel was able to place himself.
With the women it was Theresa Duelli from the team Albtraum who managed to reach the top of the winning staircase.
In second and third place came Anne Adel from Illmensee and Leonie Driver from Owingen.
An enjoyable development is the increasing number of drivers who live or work in the community.
Not only in terms of performance, the entire range of athletes was represented.
The age structure also ranged from ten years for the youngest to over 70 years for the oldest starters.
In the main race this year there were even more absolute top athletes at the start.
Four drivers were able to get away from the regional top drivers.
Among them is Philipp Pangerl, a mountain bike semi-professional from the Black Tusk Racing team.
Pangerl, together with a teammate, was already world champion twice in the 12-hour race.
This year he became European champion in this special discipline.
Roland Ballerstedt, who has already won two German championships in the duathlon.
After 45 kilometers and 900 meters of altitude, there was a wimper stroke final in the finish line in front of the Three Lakes Hall.
Pangerl was the first to cross the finish line.
Just a second later, Routine Ballerstedt secured second place in the overall ranking.
At the same time, Hermann and Warthmann came to the finish line as third in the overall score.
In the women's standings, Christiane Cohsmann was the fastest timer in the main race.
Arenane Blersch from Binzwangen secured the second place ahead of Natascha Werner from Stuttgart.
Athletes and helpers were very satisfied with the smooth and well-organized course of the event.

The winner will receive $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched his sick father repeatedly lose consciousness and travel to hospitals that did not have the means to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon, in 1981.
At first, he only had a broken arm, but then an inflammation was formed that spread to his brain and there caused a hematoma that was supposed to affect him for the rest of his life.
“There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon,” said Georges Bwelle.
We would have brought him out of Cameroon if we had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years accompanying his father to overcrowded clinics and hospitals to get the treatment they had to offer there.
“It’s not easy,” commented Bwelle.
You can leave the house at five in the morning and run to the hospital to be the first, and yet not the first.
There are a lot of patients.
Some people even die because they have to wait.
The situation has barely changed since Bwell’s father died in 2002.
There is only one doctor for every 5,000 people in Cameroon, according to the World Health Organization.
In contrast, the ratio in the United States is one doctor for 413 people.
But even if there was a doctor for them, most Cameroonians could not afford to visit.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line and nearly three-quarters of health spending in the country is private.
“The only problem they have is poverty,” says Bwelle.
Poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life.
To see his father and so many of his countrymen suffer, Bwelle matured the decision to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers conducted 700 free surgeries last year.
He became a doctor himself and worked as a vascular surgeon at the Central Hospital in Yaoundé.
In addition, he founded a non-profit organization called ASCOVIME, which travels on weekends in rural areas and offers free medical care there.
Since 2008, he and his volunteer group have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Nearly every Friday, he and up to 30 people drove into the villages in need of help with the cordoned medical equipment on the roof over unpaved terrain.
Everything does not always go smoothly.
More than once, they had to shove the vehicles through rivers and mud.
But when they arrive, they will be welcomed like heroes: a feast, singing and dancing and the best accommodation the place has to offer.
In these villages, free medical care is really a reason to celebrate and wave – with its wide smile and its limitless energy – is happy to attend the joyous celebration.
The next morning, the team begins to examine hundreds of patients.
“We treat 500 people per ride,” says Bwelle.
They come from a radius of 60 kilometers around the village – and that on foot.
Each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a number of areas.
Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others receive crutches, donated glasses or free birth certificates – a document that is required for school, but many poor families simply can’t afford.
In the evening, the team performs simple operations with local anesthesia.
Surgery usually takes place in a school, town hall, or apartment; after surgery, patients stand up and go to the recovery area to make room for the next.
The lighting for the surgery and disinfection equipment is fed by the generator of the group and so Bwelle and his volunteers work until the early hours of Sunday morning.
It’s an exhausting curriculum, but the village musicians usually help keep the team motivated.
“They drum all night so we can stay awake and continue our work,” says Bwelle.
On Sunday, the team returns to the city, tired but proud of the work they have done.
The group – a mix of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students – has performed 700 free surgeries over the past year and knows that it makes a huge difference to the people it helps with its work.
One man explained that the free operation of a rupture he received now allows him to work again.
“This will change the future of my family,” the man said.
In addition to the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon in the hospital, Bwelle also works at night in private clinics in Yaoundé.
With this second job he finances 60% of his non-profit activity, so Bwelle; the rest comes from private donations.
“I really don’t know when he’s sleeping,” says Katie O’Malley, who studies medicine in her second year at Drexel University in Philadelphia and volunteers in Bwelles Group.
He is always either in the hospital or trying to spend money for the organization so that he can go on these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students like O’Malley, who come from the U.S. and Europe and support Bwelle, this is an opportunity to gather practical experiences that they would never get at home.
“We can be in surgery where we help shed blood or hold the instruments for Dr. Bwelle,” O’Malley explains.
This would never be possible in America as a medical student in the second year.
Students usually pay for their trip to Cameroon themselves and often bring donated medical supplies.
However, once they are in Yaoundé, Bwelle takes over the accommodation, transportation and guidance.
“He’s definitely a hero,” O’Malley says.
He dedicates his life to this organization and his desire to help the Cameroonian people knows no boundaries.
For Bwelle, the almost constant work is not a burden.
Helping others to live a happier life, and thereby fulfilling a promise he made to his father, brings him great joy.
“I’m so happy when I do this job,” Bwelle says.
And I think of my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
I do it to bring people back to laughter and to relieve the pain.

Excellently mastered the fight
The role of Santiago, the old man in Hemingway's novel The Old Man and the Sea, is cut to the body by Horst Janson.
Janson himself is an old rabbit in his metier, the art of acting.
The old man Santiago can't do anything about fishing.
This is how the two complement each other wonderfully.
It is almost believed to be able to see the wrinkles in the neck of the old man, of which the young fisherman Manolo speaks.
When Santiago is tired of life bent on the chair, that’s real with Janson.
In addition, the role of the old fisherman is through and through a character role that Janson excels.
Hemingway told the story of a fighter, a brave man who does not give up and ultimately wins the fight against the fish by his knowledge and willpower.
Janson is widely seen as a solo artist on stage.
He manages to focus the attention of the audience on himself, so that his monologues are not bored for a moment.
His efforts to finally pull the fish to the surface of the water are so real that the spectators forget that the sea is only made up of blue-lighted water bottles.
Director Jens Hasselmann lets the old man act in the boat in front of the fishing village.
In the course of the performance, he highlights the active scene: the cottage of Santiago, the bar of the singer Marie-Luise Gunst, which, with her songs and her wonderful voice, infuses Cuba’s sense of life.
The four musicians play Cuba’s rhythm and are guests of the bar.
Tourism: Descending to the Romans
At about 120 meters in length, a sewage channel from the Roman period is preserved below Cologne.
Anyone who visits Cologne does not pass the cathedral.
At about 157 meters, the two towers rise to the sky and make it the second tallest church building in Europe.
However, few visitors who admire the two filigree church towers know that there is a lot to discover under the cathedral.
Rainer Schulze is an expert on Cologne Underworld.
The meeting point for its guided tours is the service center of Cologne-Tourism directly at the Cathedral.
The tour starts quite unspectacular: "We start in the underground garage," says Schulze.
In the 1970s, the city fathers wanted a self-righteous city, and so only what wasn’t too big was left of the remnants of the old city walls.
Most users of the car park rush past the Roman remains today and only park their car.
But if you look more closely, you will discover an archaeological site separated by metal grating rods in the park deck D2.
You can see about five-metre-high ruins of hand-teller-sized stones.
“There are remains of the Roman city walls that were built in the second half of the first century AD,” Schulze says.
Before returning to daylight, Schulze lets the participants take a look at a dark, 15-metre-deep hole on the upper level of the park.
This is the well of the old dome, which unfortunately is hardly noticed.
The next station of the tour is the praetorium, and here the participants go down again to the depths.
Here we see the seat of the once most powerful man north of the Alps, the precursor of the CCAA.
What CCAA means, a visitor would like to know.
"The abbreviation stands for "Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium", meaning in good German as much as "City of Roman law and city of Agrippa, founded under Emperor Claudius on the site of the altar for the imperial cult".
And the praetorium is the former state palace, the power center of the Roman Empire on the Rhine.
From the foreground of the exhibition, a tunnel access leads to the Roman sewage canal, which has been preserved here at a length of about 120 meters.
"You can relax a bit along the so-called Cloaca Maxima if you want," Schulze cheers the guests.
Schulze has a surprise.
After getting the key at the box office, he leads the group to a 16-metre-deep, walkable shaft.
“We are now in the Mikwe, a ritual Jewish bath,” he explains.
The Jewish community built their bath deep in the ground to get to the groundwater, which was indispensable for ritual washings.
To this day, at the lower end of the Mikwe, whose origins date back to the eighth century, different water levels can be read through varying levels of the Rhine.
The Mikwe will be part of an archaeological area on the Town Hall Square, for which construction work is due to begin soon.
However, a few more years will pass until completion.
Leg almost chopped off: Re-implementation of Rocker process
A bloody attack in the rocker environment is re-rolled after more than four years.
A trial for attempted murder, dangerous bodily injury and material damage against two 30-year-olds has begun before the Frankfurt (Oder) Landgericht.
It is accompanied by strict security measures.
The defendants were silent about the attack.
They are said to have been active in the rock scene and were part of the bandidos at the time.
In June 2009, the prosecutor’s office accused them of stabbed and stabbed three men in a car together with unknown accomplices in Finowfurt.
All the victims were seriously injured, a man almost lost his leg.
The victims are said to have belonged to the competing group Hells Angels.
One is said to have been a high-ranking member from Berlin.
Preceded was apparently a chase with several cars.
According to the charges, it was a riot and a power demonstration.
The two defendants were acquitted in a first trial at the beginning of 2012.
A court spokesperson said at the time that it could not have been proven that the men were actually involved in the bloody feud.
The perpetrators had been wearing masks and had not been identified.
The Federal Court upheld the judgment after revision of the Public Prosecutor’s Office and referred it back to the Landgericht for retrial.
One of the defendants is currently in open execution for another offence.
In the beginning, it was mainly about the reconstruction of the processes in the night of the act.
The commissioner who was investigating at the time was invited as a witness.
At the center were cell phone calls of the defendants and other persons who had been heard by the police.
It’s hard for Rockers to stick to a law almost always for them – and not to testify.
The same goes for the victims.
In the first trial, only one of the victims had unpacked.
Prosecutor Stefan Golfier of the Frankfurt Public Prosecutor’s Office (Oder) said on demand that new traces have emerged since the last trial.
Eleven further days of hearings are scheduled for the trial.
The disposable society does not think
The night was long, the music was loud and the mood was good, but at some point it went home.
Only: In the abdomen of the people on the passenger and back seat, the hunger becomes noticeable.
Of course, the one or the other cocktail or sect may be responsible for this!
What’s closer than going to the next drive-in for a little bit of fun?
I admit, I like to be there when it comes to going to the fast food store late at night or early in the morning.
A few apples, a cola, a burger - and then nothing like going home and into bed!
But on the way home, the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco fans become noticeable.
For what must one miss that one throws his fast food bags out of the car window with constant regularity?!
Especially on weekends, paper bags are thrown away on street edges and on parking lots.
"Why?" he asked.
Are people too deaf to take the bags home or to the next garbage can?
It’s not just that the paper is changing the landscape.
Bags have also already hidden transport facilities such as dashboards and thus triggered accidents.
What said “disposal society” is thinking about, but it probably doesn’t even know what that word actually means.
If you are traveling more often in the evening, only with several people in the car, you know what a back seat can look like after spent nights: clothes, bottles and other rubbish are there.
There would be a few bags more or less of nothing - as opposed to the street, where no one wants to crawl around on the food remains of others.
I can see the day is coming when the cities and communities are going to have to be stupid and the fast food chains have to ask for their bags.
Obama's Retreat in Health Policy
After fierce criticism, President Obama made a withdrawal yesterday in his often repeated, unequivocal promise: “If you like your health insurance, then you can keep it.”
After receiving hundreds of thousands of notices from their insurer, the Republicans have accused the president of misleading the American public in recent days.
Yesterday, Obama relativized his original promise.
“The vast majority of citizens who have a functioning health insurance can keep them,” he said in a speech in Boston.
In response to the numerous media reports about the terminations, Obama called on those Americans who have received such communications to look in the free market for a new insurance.
Most citizens could thus receive better, more comprehensive health insurance for the same price or cheaper than forecast.
“They’re coming up with a better offer,” he said.
The government described it as little surprising that the five percent of the population, who have completed insurance themselves, would have to look at a different rate, as their contract did not meet the new standards under the Affordable Care Act.
“I want to tell these Americans directly: they deserve better,” Sebelius said at a hearing before the House Energy and Trade Committee in Washington.
Sebelius, who is responsible for implementing the Affordable Care Act, said the launch of the online platform has been “miserable” since October.
“I’m just as frustrated and angry as everyone else,” she said.
I'm determined to regain your trust.
This statement by an aggrieved Sebelius to a consultant sitting behind her at yesterday’s House hearing was taken up after a dispute with Republican MP Billy Long from Missouri about whether she should be committed to taking part in Obamacare.
After more than three hours of hearing, Long Sebelius repeatedly pressed the question of why the “architect” of the Affordable Care Act did not voluntarily opt out of a state-sponsored insurance to complete a tariff on HealthCare.gov itself, which she now wants to sell to millions of Americans.
Government in Jerusalem does not confirm attack on Syrian air force base
A U.S. government official who wanted to remain anonymous said on Thursday that Israeli fighter jets had attacked an air force base in Syria’s Latakia.
The target was “missiles and related equipment” that the Israeli government feared were intended for Lebanese Hezbollah, it said, according to CNN.
Syrian and Lebanese media as well as Arab broadcaster Al-Arabiya had previously reported that the base in the port city of Latakia was shot down Wednesday night on Thursday, and the Israelis were held accountable.
The Israeli TV channel Channel 2 showed satellite images of the base in Latakia, on which were seen Russian S-125 Newa missiles as well as a battery of SA-3 missiles, which according to Channel 2 can have a range of 35 kilometers and explosives up to 70 kilograms.
Uncertain The government in Jerusalem has not officially confirmed the attack.
However, the Reuters news agency quoted an anonymous Israeli government official as saying he believed Israel carried out the attack, but was not sure.
A spokesman for the Israeli Defense Ministry said: “We are not commenting on these reports.”
Journalist Ron Ben-Yishai pointed out in the daily Yedioth Ahronoth that the Syrian regime had already tried, in part, to deliver ground-air missiles to Hezbollah earlier.
The Israeli government had repeatedly warned that any attempt by Syria to supply Hezbollah with chemical or other dangerous weapons would mean crossing a “red line” to which a military response would follow.
John Kerry says in an unparalleled confession that U.S. espionage has gone “unmeasurably too far”
With an unexpected admission, John Kerry pointed to a softening of the U.S. deterrent to its surveillance programs, saying that espionage in certain cases had gone “unreasonably too far.”
The Secretary of State also admitted that he cheated with Barack Obama the responsibility for switching to “autopilot” when the explosive revelations of whistleblower Edward Snowden about NSA espionage activities were made public.
Through the leaked information, the U.S. government has fallen into a diplomatic storm of disarming on the part of its allies.
Speaking at the Open Government Conference in London, Kerry said: “Without a doubt, the president and I and others in the government have learned some things that have been done almost by autopilot, simply because of the ability to do so naturally as well as on September 11, which was still on World War II.”
He later admitted as the first high-ranking member of the U.S. government that U.S. espionage had crossed a border, but also stressed that no rights had been abused.
He said, “In some cases, this has gone too far.”
The President is determined to create clarity, and is therefore conducting a thorough investigation so that no one needs to feel that abuse is taking place here.
I assure you that the rights of innocent persons in this process will not be impaired.
Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA was a force of good and that many lives had been saved through its surveillance operations.
He added: “We are dealing with a new world in which people are ready to blow themselves up.”
There is a radical extremism in the world that is obsessed with killing people, blowing up and attacking governments.
So what if you were able to catch it and stop it before it happens?
In fact, we have prevented plane crashes, attacks on buildings and the murder of people because we have learned in advance of such plans.
Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers will travel to Europe to dispel concerns about alleged American espionage and convince Europeans of the need to continue to work with the U.S. on anti-terrorism efforts, as the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he spoke to representatives of the European Parliament and other people this week and was concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti-terror organizations due to the National Security Agency’s frustration over surveillance.
“It is very important for the national security interests of the United States that the Europeans stay on board with us in view of our joint efforts against terrorism,” said Murphy, who sits in the Senate for the first time as a Democrat and chairs the Senate Sub-Committee on Foreign Relations in Washington.
In addition, I am going to Europe to make it clear there that we must continue to work together in the fight against terrorism, regardless of their anger over the NSA programs.
Media reports that the NSA has collected millions of phone data in Europe have strained relations with some U.S. allies, even though the head of the intelligence service this week declared the reports to be inaccurate and based on a misunderstanding of metadata disseminated by NATO allies.
Other revelations were cited from documents provided by Snowden, according to which the NSA monitored the phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 other heads of state worldwide.
The head of the national intelligence services, James Clapper, defended espionage among allies as necessary and declared this to be common on both sides.
In all the turmoil, Murphy said his authority was preparing the congressional trip to take place this year, and hoped the delegation would include members from both parties and chambers.
The names of the other participating Members will be published in the coming days.
He said the exact itinerary is still to be worked out.
While Murphy emphasized that the purpose of the trip was to improve relationships, he also said that there would be some "serious words".
He said European governments should be honest with their people about the kind of espionage programs they have been using for years.
“While we can change our surveillance programmes to better protect the rights of Europeans, they must also deal with the fact that we are not the only ones spying,” Murphy said.
Meanwhile, John Kerry is on a trip to the Middle East and Poland over the weekend to deal with the turmoil over U.S. strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as U.S. surveillance activities.
A persistent injury to the jump joint threatens to prevent the use of Nicolai Müller in the Bundesliga away game of FSV Mainz 05 at FC Augsburg.
Mainz advocated the use of Nicolai Müller.
Tomorrow he will try to train with the team.
So far, he has only been able to do so individually.
"We will decide on his deployment in the short term," coach Thomas Tuchel said.
The 40-year-old hopes to have his best goalkeepers with six hits.
Because the Mainzers already have to give up the injured performance holders Niki Zimling, Julian Baumgartlinger and Niko Bungert.
Australian woman appeals against prison sentence in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney, who was sentenced to 15 days in prison in Phuket for falsely claiming to have been raped by a taxi driver, appealed against the verdict and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially found guilty by a provincial court in Phuket on June 15 after making a false statement to the Thai police after she reported to a local taxi driver that she had been arrested during the early hours of Sunday, June 10th, while others were arrested.
Later, however, the footage of a video camera showed that she had safely arrived at her hotel after being separated from her Australian friend.
Police in Phuket interrogated Bamford for two days until they confessed to inventing the story.
Until the trial, she was in police custody on the spot.
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison sentence in a low-security facility on the outskirts of Phuket, rather than in a prison for adult women.
She is the daughter of Peter Tunks, a former player of the Australian Rubgy League who has turned to the Foreign Ministry in Canberra asking for help for his daughter.
Tunks told the Sunday Telegraph in Sydney that the whole family was "extremely concerned" about his daughter's well-being and wanted her back in Australia.
“We are of course very worried, but we hope that she will be home as soon as possible,” said Tunks.
Bamford has appealed against the verdict and is against a bail of 50,000 Baht.
In Australian reports it was read that in the meantime she is on holiday in the resort Krabi in South Thailand.
From outside the court, Bamford was heard to be represented by a local lawyer in Phuket and was warned that the appeal could also lead to a higher sentence of up to two years in an adult prison.
However, it is also possible that Thailand may have been trying to improve its attacked tourist image after the recent murder of travel saleswoman Michelle Smith in Phuket, and therefore comes to a release.
