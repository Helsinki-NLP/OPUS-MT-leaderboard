Please help me out.
They both smiled.
One of us has to do it.

I'm going home.

No one knew who did this.
What are you talking about?
How old are you?
We're going into the classroom.
Tom's apprehensive.
There are people who are easily influenced.
I don't understand why I shouldn't do that.
That's not a bad idea.
Which way are you going?

There's no evidence.
I think you're gonna let it go.

I grabbed Tom at his elbow.
I don't know where Tom's umbrella is.
This is the last straw.

Is there anything between you two?
Don't ask me why, just do it.
My dream is to be a teacher.
That's very kind of you.

It's cold.
Tom whispered Mary's name.
I acted like I didn't understand.
A good sense of humor helps in difficult situations.
You know?
I'll see you.
That'll be interesting.
They're gone?
I have black hair.
Yesterday was hot, but today is lighter.
We need to warn Tom.

He doesn't have many friends.
You're out of here?
Who hit Tom?
Tom and Mary answered at the same time.
Have you ever had a petanque?
There are also design socks.
I didn't realize that.
I can't follow your logic.
What would you like to do in the future?
Tom's safe.
We understand the target.
No one was there.
All my questions have been answered.
I knew you were gonna get in trouble.
Tominak has a guest.
I'm in deep chest pain.
I'm willing to take a chance.
How can you say that?
I don't want to go to bed.
I can't believe a word of it.
My birthday is in November.
Did you behave well today?
You're stupid!
I've been working hard last month.
Tom slept on two folded chairs.
Here's your beer.
Is that a problem for you?
Why did you buy this bike?
Who wrote this?
That's right.
I felt pretty lonely, you know.
I'm going to my friend.
Stop yelling at me.
The time will depend pretty quickly if you read something.

My dream is to be an artist.
I lost my suitcase.
I like to sleep.
The fruit is in the basket.
I love cheese pizza.

Have you ever eaten at the restaurant where Tom works?
I hope it works.
I'm here to take my dog.

The coffee's ready.
You just love me because of my black hair?
I must have heard that sound somewhere.
The doctor advised him to go to the hospital.
I'm breakfasting.
I'm not well paid.
Why are you yelling?
My family's not too big.
Please, move forward.
There are more cars on the road in the summer than there are in the winter.
I hope they're okay.
Tominak had to know this was going to happen.
Tomi's a little overweight.
My sister loves Tomit.
It's late.
Backstage!
Tom's not cheating.
We have to pay the tax.
Tom stared at the ground.
They're not reacting.
Keep doing what you've done.
Eat some.
We'll take care of it later.
I'm Israeli.
They went into the forest.
How the hell could you expect me to pay for it?
Tom asked Mary where John lived.
If it wasn't for the map, I'd be lost.
I think he's coming.
It's flower day tomorrow.
Is it left-handed?
Can you tell me exactly what you really want?
My wife left me.
We don't want anything from you.
You know where the problem comes from.
What were you looking at?
It's unlikely that Tom knows where Mari lives.
I need three ice creams.
Tom's in his pyjamas.
I've been waiting.
Tom nodded.
No one lives in this house.

Sponge on it!
You're not gonna die.
Is Tom fired?
My horse is white.
You got it.
We have to be serious.
Is the museum open today?
Tom doesn't want to stand on the edge of the cliff.
The wifi doesn't work for me.
I'll wash it again.
Do you teach English every day?
Good luck with the races.

No one can see my tears.
Mohamed was born in Mecca.
Tom and Maria are twins.
Write down the words you don’t understand.
Who is the smartest person you know?
I want everything to be all right by this time tomorrow.
The hot summer days have come to an end and have been replaced by the cold winter days.
Why me?
I never thought of that.
They didn't see anyone.
I'm the boss, right?
My son came to my room.
You don't seem happy to see us, Tomi.
Shortly after Tomi's death, his wife remarried.
Tom's the cave of the asses.
I didn't do what I should have done.
Does Tom have a tattoo?
I'm not going to apologize.
Please stay where you are.
I don't travel much.
He stayed in France for a while and then went to Italy.
He's always busy.
There is a certain probability that it will cost me my life.
Thomas loved his work.
Did you find anything?
Keep this shit away from me.
Why didn't Tom get on the bus?
The dress can be extended.
You can take a shower 10 times a day.
It's very white.
They left last night.
We've never had a concert in Boston.
Tom may not know why Mary's not here.
Don't worry.
Good-looking people look good, no matter what they wear.
You're comparing apples to circles.
Tom's on the table now.
It's dangerous here.
I can't stand that noise.
I'm so glad we met.
Tom doesn't trust anyone.
Tomi's rich, but Mari's not.
We're probably supposed to go.
I like the coffee.
Do you know who Tom is?
I'm willing to buy it for you.
We're reasonable.
Tomorrow will be a new day.
Give us a presentation, please.
The world is a lot of trouble.
Tom is at a loss.
They play baseball after school.
They both laughed.
You've done a perfect job.
He got used to the chair.
Tommy wants to buy some books.
There's milk in the sun.
What are they gonna do?
Tom led the attack.
Tom almost never eats cucumbers.
No, this isn't my house.
I live in New York.
Our coffee's gone.
Let's get drunk.
What would you do if your child was like that?
My kids don't lie to me.
I'm not proud of my daughter.
It never ends.
They're both laughing.
I wish you wouldn't do that now.
I was trying to help Tomin.
Your soul is doomed to hell.
I'm feverish and my head hurts, and I think I'm gonna get sick.
I'm starting to get up.
Shut that down.
He won his love.
He missed a class.
Can you give me that cup of tea?
In my opinion, Twitter is just a waste of time.
Come on, touch me.
Tom asked Mary the same thing that I did.
The moon's nobody's.
We were born for a reason in this world.
I helped Tominak decorate his Christmas tree.
I forgot to take flowers for Eva.
We didn't do it for Tom.
He could've kissed her bye, but he didn't, he just walked away.
We're not that poor.
He works for the pay, not because he enjoys it.
I know who got hurt.
I'm addicted.
In the evening, the shadow of the tree reached the wall.
He's a good friend.
He's made a serious scientific discovery.
On Tom's computer, the secret folder holds hundreds of gigabytes of hermelin videos.
Why are you so tired today?
My appetite's gone.
How many people do you think we should invite to the party?
Tominak doesn't have a lot of books.
I have doubts as to whether it will work.
Let's wash it!
He's not there for sports, like I am.
I've got a phone.
Tom went back to the hotel.
Do you have a TV?
What do I do with Tom?
Every day I feel better.
I feel like a fever.
What do the doctors say?
I forgot his last name.
Please, help me.
He didn't say anything.
Why are you apologizing?
Tom's afraid they're being tricked.
Did you know that Tom left the house?
He likes trains.
We're home today.
I saw Tom dancing with another girl.
There was no one in the room.
Tom threw his girlfriend's photos into the fire.
I'll go and tell everyone.
Move forward, move forward.
You're imaginative.
It reminds me of a girl I once knew.
I was on the list.
Give me back my book.
Although we have done everything we can, we know we will not win.
He was close to suicide.
That was my finger.
That's not what my mother said.
Tom didn't know his water heater was a hole until he got a huge water bill.
This will be our secret.
Why are you restless?
I'm sorry, but I didn't fully understand what you said.
There was a fire near us last night.
We better go, Tom.
It's likely that you'd all get some sleep.
I'm pretty sure Tom won't eat this.
It's just a matter of time before Tom gets in trouble again.
I got on the plane.
Are you home?
Clouds are surrounding the mountain.
That's my problem.
How can I understand you?
It's in the kitchen.
I should've done that with you.
I probably don't want to eat the same thing again today.
I suppose Tam<0xC3><0xA1>s was right.
Here's my membership card.
I'm the only one who got Thomas to help.
Tom was out there.

I don't eat lunch with Thomas often.
It's over, isn't it?
It's been raining since Tuesday.
I'll keep it up.
This sentence has not yet been translated.
Tom's waiting too long.
It's very exciting.
Man does not come from a monkey, except for a few.
We're fine.
Tom wants to learn how to surf.
I have a hard day today.
Here's your bag!
An intelligent person is someone who has discovered something more interesting than sex.
Tom was wearing a moose costume.
He loved them both, and they both loved him.
I can't stop laughing at him.
Try it with someone else.
Remember what you said.
Cut off your hair.
Thomas only drinks bottled water.
Personally, I find snoring more enjoyable than traditional sex.
That's unbelievable.
After a short wait, he began to make a fool of himself.
I need volunteers.
Tom and I know the truth.
That's a crime.
Tom's cooking.
Do you have an email address?
You got it, but you're not ready.
Tomi knew where Maria put her car down.
You should be asleep by now.
Tom and Mary don't live in the same state.
Hey, look.
Don't keep your bike in the closet.
Sometimes I go to the movies.
Thomas never lived in Boston.
Don't criticize me!
He was looking for something in the dark.
I'm not throwing Tom out.
Tom took a 20-dollar coin out of his pocket.
I didn't mean to tell you that.
I'm not going to Boston.
Tom should have gone home sooner.
Prices are going up.
Empty the trash.
I didn't buy the car.

Thank you for being me.
They have everything they need.
He's always on my side.
No one likes a hanger.
He lives comfortably.
It's all right, it's over.
The police have arrested the intruder.
I like things like that.
It's up to you whether we're going there or not.
Why did you become a lawyer?
I've decided.
You shouldn't have to wait long.
Tom seems to be enjoying the party.
Why doesn't Tom want to come with us?
What a mess!
It's so annoying.
Tom packed the boxes for each other by the wall.
He knew that the bear loved the honey.
We've won.
Don't get tired of getting up.
I'll see you soon.
Did you ask them to wait?

Where's the phone book?
I'm fine.
Cats will take the mouse.

What a wonderful place!
I wish we could do something for Tom.
I'll keep that in mind.

We are happy to accept your offer.
I went to talk.
It wasn't Tom.
Why don't we go out to dinner tonight?
The dreams have come true.
Don't sacrifice yourself.

Tommy, can you hear me?
I couldn't take the ring off my finger.
I just don't want to die today.
Tom's ready to go home.
He was like a father to me.
You'll regret it.
Help's on its way.
Do they speak French in Canada?
I wish I could do it.
Keep listening.
I hope you don't mind if I leave early.
Come on, just like you are.
I am counting on you to join us.

Climbing.
No one can stop you anymore.
Who did you see?

At night I like to follow the tradition of doing a walk by the lake.
What can we expect?
There's a splint in my finger.
Animals are afraid of fire.
It wasn't any week.
Don't go to college just because they expect you to.
The box is almost empty.
That's what's gonna happen.
It would have been better if we hadn't done it.
I gave Tom a key to my office.
I need an interpreter.
You understand women's language.
I think Tom's still out of work.
I need your attention.
I'm ready to help you anytime.
We'll figure it out.
The batteries are depleted.
He found a good seat for me.
Sooner or later we'll all die.
You didn't sleep well last night, did you?
Have you already packed?
Tom applied for the job.
He couldn't hide Tomi's disappointment.
We tried to warn you.
I found that their volap is very complicated, unlike the esperanto, which is very simple.
You'd better be careful.
Tom likes the kids.
There's a wash today.
That's so wrong.
Tomi touched my hand.
Who brought this?
The floor's full of glass slats.
These bananas are not ripe.
Let's fall behind the curtain.
But I don't have an iron.
I think you were right.
Where did the wedding take place?
I swim in the river.
It wasn’t the first time they had done this.
The water is cold.
It was a beautiful summer day.
Sometimes I feel like a fool.
It's a good hideout.
Do you have any questions?
It's sabotage.
Swallowing all night, sneezing in the morning.
When will the elections be held?
Tom is supportive.
Tom walked in.
I was sitting in a chair at the patent office in Bern when I had a sudden idea: if a man falls free, he does not feel his own weight. That shocked me. It led me to this theory of gravitation.
Speak louder so that everyone can hear you.
A new train system will be installed on the railway line.
We believe in God.
They've forgotten about you.
Where are we eating tonight?
Dressed in a men's shirt.
We should've bought three bottles of wine.
Can I borrow it?
I can't find Tim.
Stand up straight.
Thania's position is temporary.
I hope so.
That's not interesting.
You've always been like that.
The sun sank below the horizon and became darker.
Which side did you win?
Tom's home.
Tom cut a slice of meat and put it on his plate.
I'll try again.
You never know what's gonna happen.
If all goes well, he graduates from university in 2001.
The decision was stolen.
This has never happened to me.
Dani's got 3,000 flying hours.
He wiped his face with a handkerchief.
I don't understand what's so funny about this.
I'm gonna surprise Tom.
That's where Tom left it.
I was the only one who survived.
He advised her to quit smoking, but she didn't listen to him.
Take off your clothes.
Tom ate the rest.
Are you hungry at all?
My watch is cheaper than yours.

Why don't you come with us?
Tom saw someone.
She's a real witch!
I love math.
You're wrong.
Dani brushed his teeth with my toothbrush.
But yours isn't bad either.
If I were you, I'd ask him.
Do you know this man?
I have to work tonight.
Who do you think was watching TV in this room last night?
Tom wanted to keep the stolen money for himself.
I had half a grapefruit breakfast.
I don't think there's a god.
Tom doesn't know who to believe: John or Mary.
Aging does not mean that you should no longer use your imagination.
It was Thursday yesterday.
If I had money, I would travel around the world.
The political situation has changed.
You can go first.
Tom got tired of reading and wanted to go play.
I don't know what Tominak's car is.
It's Sunday today.
I should have stayed out of it.
Do you have feelings for Tom?
I hate that movie.
That was yesterday.
I'm gonna tie up my shoes.
Where did you get your gloves?
It's just disgusting.
The nearest town lies behind the hills.
What are you reading now?
There are musicians and actors who hire security guards to keep their overly enthusiastic fans away from them.
Shall we go to the movies now?
I know you can do that.
This is not known to Tom.
These were his last words.
Tom's favorite sport is baseball.
I'm very angry.
At first, I was disappointed.
I could have done it better if I had more time.
Why didn't you tell me there was a witness?
You can go when you have time.
Look ahead, please.
Get this snail!
Africa is the cradle of humanity.
Too bad Tomi's leaving.
Have you talked about this, Tominak?
Let's keep this between us for a while.
Do you have a lighter?
Tom's mom's still buying his clothes.
They're not expensive.
I knew Tom knew something.
Tom was apparently nervous.
The end of October.
Maybe he's still waiting at the station right now.
- Welcome to Boston.
They're always late.
Tom sat on the other side of the table.
Tom was nice, but Mary wasn't.
You're better than you think you are.
I've seen more than Tom knows.
If you don't behave well, Santa won't come.
You're too young to buy a cigarette.
It was a mistake to kiss Tom.
Tom seems uneasy.
This bottle of beer is almost bigger than you.
Do you accept some advice?
Well, that's what it's all about.
Zagreb is the capital of Croatia.
It's inevitable.
This guy's a vocalist, and he's not worth taking care of.
You two are arguing against me!
Oh, shit.
Tom needs to take better care of himself.
Why don't you take off your napkin?
Here you go.
Tom says the soup is too hot.
I know the secret.
The fire burned the occupant.
Who's gonna do it?
Tom should have done it sooner.
He's staying at a hotel.
I loved that show.
I'll stay, in the sleigh.
He told us a story about a boy, Tom Sawyer.
Tom can make it.
Whoever doesn't drink in a company is either a thief or a spy.
It's a scam.
This moment should never come to an end.
He was released on parole yesterday.
- Can I have a look at your ticket?
Please, pass on my best regards to him.
Tom couldn't open the safe.
Say it in Hungarian!
Entrance only for staff.
Tominak has already managed to make progress.
Where can we meet?
There's no right answer.
When I was a child, I only had a spiral notebook for the children of wealthy families.
The crystal clear water was at a very pleasant temperature.
There's nothing else to do.
We know an acceptable solution.
The new school failed to take into account the special needs of young people.
Lapozz, please.
Everything that happened between us was a lie?
That's a picture.
That's close enough.
Bring it up.
I'm glad you're here, Tom.
Say that to me, Tomi.
Tomi's power is like a bivalve, yet he's a rabbit.
We need to be careful.
He went out without a word.
I never said that!
I don't care.
I'm so old, too.
I'm hungry for the candy.
I snuck out the dishwasher.
I found Tom there.
Mr. Jones was down because I fell asleep a little on the clock.
Henry wants to see you.
Can we eat?
I have a meeting today.
We're not leaving.
Tom didn't try to cover up the truth.
I was happy yesterday.
Can I ask your name?
All claims are false.
It's my arm.
I'm sorry, but there was a lot of traffic.
Tom should have listened to Mari.
Tom apologized to Mary for the inconvenience she caused.
I'll apologise later.
I noticed he was wearing a new hat.
Hold it, please.
He left me without saying goodbye.
I need to see it.
Don't leave me alone.
It'd be nice to have some coffee.
There are a lot of flowers in the garden.
Tom laughed out loud.
The answer was simple.
He shouldn't have come so early.
He's always asking for your opinion.
- I'm going to put the TV down, let's do something else.
Collective responsibility is irresponsible.
Churches must learn humility, as they are taught.
I know who lives in this house.
Who's driving?

What's your wish?
It's all right.
Tom trusted his doctors.
They won't get caught up in it.
Tom rarely wins a fight.
Can you keep your eyes closed for a minute and a half?
Nakamatsu smiled bitterly at his own stupid question.
You can go on your own.
I'm glad Tom was able to change his name.
I know it's weird.
I sat on the ground.
He was not only yelling at me, but also at my dog.
Tom's careless.
I'm really sorry, I seem to have lost your umbrella.
It's a public beach.
Go and get Tom something to eat.
That's what Tomi understands.
It looks very strange.
Are you taking any medications?
That's a boring word.
When I give you instructions, start the machine.
Many parents believe that there is too much violence on television.
I've got my own problem!
Work on it.
You're just like me.
That's pretty fun.
Can I play in my room?
All mushrooms are edible, but there are only once.
That's very, very good.
A decision has not yet been made.
How much did we fall?
Behave according to your age.
The door is not closed.
This is Tony's book.
The trains arrived on time.
He cautioned me.
You know I can do it.
That's not enough.

I'm gonna sniff a little.
I got a nice butterfly.

This book is astonishing.
Do you remember who I am?
Come on, everybody, dance!

Can I help you, sir?
I want to know why women live longer than men.
I can't stay in this house.
I'll pay you well.
They're both in the garden.
I took my bags up to my room with the horde.
Is the snake alive or dead?
He might be the man I need.
I hate to say that, but Tom and Mary are right.
My pulse is irregular.
Tom was really sick.
When we got married, my parents gave me this house.
You'll never lose hope.
The lightning struck his house.
She wears makeup every morning.
Pour the eggs.
I'd like to thank you for everything you've done for me.
Tom advised me not to do it.
I'm not happy at all.
I'm sorry about last night.
It's time to say goodbye.
I'm not sure that's a good idea.
It's happened to me several times.
The trees are arguing.
Tom asked Mary to come in.
It works perfectly with your iPhone.
It could be a trap.
Remind him to come home early. I'm sorry.

We only have enough food and water for three days.
You have a good memory.
Why are you barking?
He returned home after a ten-month absence.
Tom came too late.
Tom's out.
Your comments are the only ones that should be translated on this site.
What is today's exchange rate?
I think he's going.
Let's take a break.
It's a shame to run, but it's useful.
You'll get used to the heat sooner or later.
I don't know.
They offered it to me.
That's unusual.
In capitalism, one is not forced to buy.
He was terrified of the horror of this horrible scene.
It's not up to me what's gonna happen.
I don't want to argue.
That bike's too small for you.
Tom gave everything to Mary.
Go on, try.
Cook an egg.

You're gonna lose.
Please, do whatever you think is necessary.
I'd like to marry a girl like that.
The land is thirsty.
Tom did a good job.
My waist's sniffing.
Tom always does that.
She showed him my picture.
It's not gonna work for me.
Don't open it!
- What are you doing tonight?
You just got it.
Pull up the dimmer, let a little light in.
I'll never love you.
Tom was talking.
He's got a lot of flaws, but I love him all the more.
What's your number?
Tom's probably gonna be happy.

Some sentences are too hard for me.
Do it today, don't wait for tomorrow.
It's hard to please everyone.

Tomorrow's departure depends on the weather.
I'm thirty.
We don't have an example of this.
Maybe I'm making a mistake.

That's what I've been through.
Let's not talk about that.
I'll stay home tomorrow.

No matter what happens, you just smile.
I was late for the meeting because of the plug.
