Members of the Assembly (AM) Welsh were worried when they ‘looked like doll muppets'.
There are concerns among several AMs over a suggestion that their designation should be changed to MWPs (Member of Welsh Parliament/Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This arose due to the existence of a plan to change the name of the Assembly into the Welsh Parliament.
AMs across the political spectrum are concerned if it could provoke outrage.
An AM worker party said that his group was concerned, "The call was Senate with Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside of Wales: In Welsh, Twp means crazy and Pwp means dirt.
A member of the assembly (AM) said that his group as one unit, felt "unhappy" and had proposed several alternatives.
A Welsh Conservative said his group was "open-minded" about the name change, but judged that this was a secession from MWP's abbreviation to Muppet.
In this context the letter w in Welsh is pronounced like the letter u in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting a law to introduce the name change, said: "The final decision on any explanation of the term for the AMs is of course a problem for the members themselves."
The decision of the Government of Wales 2017 empowered the Assembly of Wales to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public consultation on the known proposal gaining broad support to call the assembly the Welsh Parliament.
Regarding the issue of AM referencing, the Commission preferred WMPs (Welsh Parliament Members), but the MWP option gained the most support at public consultations.
The AM appears to be filing an alternative option, but the struggle to reach a consensus could ratify the chairman, Elin Jones, who is expected to submit the bill to the change within a few weeks.
The reform bill will include other changes to the way the assembly works, including disqualification rules for AMs and draft committee systems.
The AMs will get a final vote on the question of how they should be called when they discuss legislation.
Macedonians go to vote in a referendum on changing the country's name
Voters will decide whether their country's name will be changed to "Northern Republic of Macedonia."
The revered vote was held in an effort to resolve a decade-long dispute with Greece's neighbouring country, which also has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of the neighboring country to its north shows a recognition of its territory and has repeatedly rejected offers of EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ibanov, an opponent of the vote for a name change, has said that he will ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argued that the name change was a price to be paid to join the European Union and NATO.
St. Martin’s bells did not fade when the churches in Harlem were in trouble
"Historically, the old people I talked to said there used to be a bar and a church in every corner," Mr. Adam said.
“Today, there is none.”
He said the disappearance of all the bars could be cleared.
"People are socializing in other ways" now, he said.
"The bar is no longer a community living room around where people visit it on a regular basis."
As well as with the church, he was concerned that the proceeds of the sale of assets would not last as long as the leaders expected, "and sooner or later they would return again from the beginning."
The churches, he added, could have been replaced by an apartment building with a condominium filled with people who would not help keep the shrines left around.
"The majority of people who will buy condominiums in these buildings are white people," he said, "and therefore will speed up the day when these churches close at the same time because it is unlikely that people who move to those condominiums will be members of these churches."
The two churches were built by the white congregation before Harlem became a metropolis of black people – the Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved in the 1930s.
The black congregation who had worshiped in the surrounding area had taken over the building.
St. Martin was taken over by a black congregation under the leadership of Reverend John Howard, who led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, the main street to shop in Harlem, who refused to hire or promote black people.
A fire in 1939 caused the building to be heavily damaged, but when the parishioners of Reverend Johnson planned to rebuild, they built the tower bells.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Reverend Johnson and his successor in St. Martin proudly called the tower bell as the "poor people's bell"
An expert who sounded the bell tower in July gave him another nickname: "A cultural treasure" and "an indispensable historical instrument."
An expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan also noted that this was the first tower bell in the world played by black musician, Dionisio A. Lind who switched to ringing the larger tower bell at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin did not replace him.
What has happened in Santo Martin in the last few months is a complicated story of architecture and contractors, some carried by public church leaders, and others carried by the episcopal diocese.
The vestry - the governing body of the diocese, consisting of the leaders of the public - wrote a letter to the diocese in July with concern that the diocese would "try to charge" on the vestry's side, although the vestry was not involved in the recruitment of architects and contractors sent by me.
Some parishioners complained of a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark Injured 13-Year-Old Teenager in California Lobster Diving
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday when he dived to catch a lobster in California in a lobster season opening event, an official said.
The attack occurred before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with his friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard a boy begging for help and then rowing in groups to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was just a burst of joy after catching the lobster, but then he "realized" that the boy shouted, 'I was bitten!
I've been bitten!"
The whole bone cleared up cracks," Hammel said that he realized it when he had already caught the child.
"I yelled at everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!' Hammel added.
The boy was flown to Rady's Children's Hospital in San Diego where he was treated in critical condition.
The shark species responsible for the attack is unknown.
Coastal Rescue Captain Larry Giles said in a media conference that a shark had been seen in the area a week earlier, but it was categorized as a harmless shark species.
Giles added that the victim suffered severe injuries to the upper part of his body.
Officials closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours for the sake of investigation and security.
Giles realizes that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the region, but most of them are considered harmless.
Sainsbury's plan breaks British beauty market
Sainsbury took over the Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams with the tosserba-style beauty kiosks run by specialist assistants.
As part of a substantial boost to the <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion UK beauty market, which continues to grow as sales of fashion products and household appliances decline, larger beauty kiosks will be tested at 11 stores across the country and will develop into more stores next year if it gets busier.
Investments in the field of beauty became a hunting event for supermarkets to take advantage of the shelves that were once used as displays for TVs, microwaves, and household appliances.
Sainsbury said that it would double the size of the beauty offering to reach 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie,Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The current range of brands starting from L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will also get more space with branded areas as found in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket also relaunched its makeup line so that most of its products would be vegan-friendly – something young consumers are increasingly interested in.
In addition, fragrance retailer Fragrance Shop will test the concession at two Sainsbury stores, the first to open in Croydon. London south last week, while the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, late this year.
Shopping online and switching to the purchase of daily necessities in small amounts in local grocery stores means that supermarkets have to do something more to persuade people to visit.
Mike Coupe, Sainsbury's chief executive, has said that the stalls will increasingly look like Mall when supermarket chains try to fight back the repressions like Aldi and Lidl by providing more and more food-free services.
Sainsbury has put Argos stalls on hundreds of stores and has also introduced several Habitat stalls since they bought the two franchises two years ago, which he says has supported the sale of everyday foodstuffs and made more profitable acquisitions.
Previous supermarket attempts to renovate the beauty and pharmaceutical departments ended in failure.
Sainsbury tested a joint venture with Boots in early 2000, but the cooperation ended after there was controversy about how to divide the profits from the chemical store in the supermarket.
The new strategy emerged after Sainsbury sold 281 businesses of pharmacy stores to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy franchise, worth <0xC2><0xA3>125 million, three years ago.
It was reported that Lloyds would play a role in the plan, by adding various luxury skincare brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, said: "We have changed the look and feel of the beauty kiosks to improve the atmosphere for our visitors.
We also invest in trained colleagues who will be ready to offer advice.
Our brand network is designed to suit all needs, enticing environments and convenient locations that signal that we are currently a enticing destination that challenges the old ways of shopping."
Peter Jones 'crawls' after Holly Willoughby pulls out of <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal
Den's Dragons star, Peter Jones goes 'crazy' after TV host Holly Willoughby withdraws from <0xC2><0xA3>11million lifestyle business deal to focus more on his new contract with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby had no time to manage the brand of household appliances and their accessories, Truly.
The couple's business was matched to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old host of This Morning used her Instagram account to announce that she was out.
Holly Willoughby has made Dragons star" Den, Petes Jones angry by withdrawing at the last moments, from their profitable branded lifestyle business - to focus on her larger contract with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources state that Jones was so "crazy" when the TV's golden girl admitted during a tense meeting on Tuesday at her business government headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new deal - worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million - meant she no longer had enough time to devote herself to her homework.
Their business has been matched to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and is expected to double Willoughby's fortune by <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, used Instagram to announce that he was leaving Truly, Jones flew out of Britain to one of his vacation homes,
A source said: "Truely so far is Holly's most important priority.
It was going to be its long-term future, which will keep it going for decades to come.
His decision to step down made everyone involved really surprised.
No one can believe what happened on Tuesday, very close to the launch time.
There is a warehouse full of goods in Marlow's main office ready for sale"
Experts believe the departure of the show host This Morning, which is one of the UK's most expensive stars, could hurt the company up to millions of dollars due to large investments in the form of products, ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and home furnishings, as well as the potential for further launch delays.
And this can mean the end of a long-established friendship.
The mother of three children, Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have been very close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for 10 years.
Willoughby founded Truly along with Capp in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined as chairman in March.
The couple are on vacation together and Jones owns 40 percent of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will be the brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as the host of the ITV show I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night "We will not comment on this business relationship."
Seriously ‘and then we fall in love’
He joked about the criticism he would receive from the news media for making comments that were deemed by some to be "non-presidential" and have been very positive towards the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said it was his "news reader."
"I don't give up anything."
He learned that Kim was interested in meeting a second time after a previous meeting in Singapore in June, which Trump praised as a step forward for the denuclearization of North Korea.
But denuclearization negotiations have stopped.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, North Korean top diplomat Ri Yong Ho spoke to world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea did not see an "appropriate response" from the United States to the initial North Korean disarmament movement.
Instead, he noted, the United States continued sanctions aimed at keeping the pressure.
Trump is more optimistic in his speeches.
“We are doing our best with North Korea,” he said.
"If we are at war with North Korea.
Millions of people will be killed.
Now we have this wonderful relationship."
He said that his success in improving relations with Kim had brought positive results - stopping rocket experiments, helping to release hostages and returning the remaining American soldiers to their homes.
And he defended his unusual approach in talking about relationships with Kim.
"It's very easy to be president, but compared to having 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crowded arena, we'd better have about 200 people standing there," Trump said, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
Indonesia Tsunami and Earthquake Destroy an Island, Killing Hundreds of People
As a result of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population lost their homes, there was no national disaster statement, as a prerequisite for bringing in international aid.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it clear that they are not asking for international help, so this is somewhat challenging,” said Ms Sumbung.
While Save The Children is setting up a team to leave for Palu, it is still unclear whether foreign staff can work on the field.
Mr Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster relief agency, said Indonesian officials were reviewing the situation in Palu to see if foreign agencies were allowed to contribute to providing assistance.
In view of the ongoing earthquake in Indonesia, the country is still very unprepared to face the anger of nature.
While a tsunami shelter has been built in Aceh, it is not a common sight on the other coastlines.
The absence of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, although a warning of danger has already been announced, has most likely contributed to the deaths.
At its best, the journey between many Indonesian islands is very challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A floating hospital that has been placed in Lombok to care for earthquake victims is heading to Palu, but will take at least three days to reach a new disaster location.
President Joko Widodo has made damaged Indonesian infrastructure repairs as the core of the election campaign, and he has spent money on the construction of highways and railways.
But the lack of funds has disrupted Joko's government as he faces re-election next year.
Joko's father also faced pressure from sectarian tensions that are still ongoing in Indonesia, where the Muslim majority has embraced a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands fled their homes as a mob of Muslims and Christians fought in the streets, using parachutes, arrows and arrows, and other sharp weapons.
Watch: Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge scores against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a defeat against Chelsea in the Premier League by one score in the minute to 89 on Saturday at Stamford Bridge London.
Sturridge received a touchdown from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 yards away from Chelsea's goal when his team was 1-0 behind.
He placed the ball on his left side before kicking it towards the far pole.
The ball swells high above the goal when the ball swells to the upper right corner of the net.
The ball eventually fell past Kepa Arrizabalaga who jumped and fell into the net.
"It's just trying to get into that position, to control the ball, and players like Shaq always play it forward as much as possible, so I'm just trying to give myself as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante come and take one chance and don't think about it too much, and just do the kicks."
Chelsea lead with a 1-0 score in the first half after Belgian midfielder Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The Blue's striker gave feedback to Mateo Kovacic on the game, before turning near the midfield and running fast to the centre of Liverpool.
Kovacic quickly fed and ran in the middle line.
He then made the perfect kick, leading Hazard towards the goal.
Hazard managed to pass the opponent's defender and kicked the ball into the goal corner with a left foot kick, passing Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker.
Liverpool against Naples in the Champions League group stage at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3 p.m. Thursday in London.
Death toll from Indonesia tsunami rises to 832
The death toll from Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, the country's disaster agency said on Sunday morning.
Many people were reportedly trapped in the ruins of buildings destroyed by a 7.5-scale Richter earthquake that struck on Friday and triggered a 20-foot wave, said Sutopo Purwo, an agency spokesman at a press conference.
The city of Palu, which has a population of over 380,000, is filled with debris from collapsed buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death.
A murder investigation has been carried out after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
A 44-year-old woman was found in Grayson Mews, John Street, at 7:55 a.m. with several stab wounds, while a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have asked people around who see or hear something to come face to face.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is still in its early stages but I am asking everyone who is around John's street in Birkenhead to see or hear something suspicious to contact us.
I also appeal to everyone, especially the taxi drivers, who may have recorded something on the dash cam to contact us because they may have important information for our investigation.
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a local resident of Birkenhead and she was found in a building.
This afternoon, friends who feel confident that they know the woman have come to the scene to ask about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is still ongoing as police have said, they are in the process of informing the victim's closest relatives.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has just returned to his apartment, but is told by police that no one is allowed to enter or exit the building.
The man couldn’t say anything when he knew what was going on.
Currently the citizens are being informed that it will take several hours for them to be allowed back in.
A police officer was heard telling someone that all areas are now being enforced as the scene of the incident.
A woman appeared at the scene in a state of crying.
He always said, “It’s horrible.”
At 2 p.m. two police vans were in line and the others were outside.
A number of officers stood in line to monitor the apartment block.
Anyone with information is asked to send a direct message to <0x40>MerPolCc, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 by quoting log 247 on September 30.
The statue of Parliament Cromwell becomes the last memorial to be hit by ‘historic rewrites’
Its curfew would be poetic justice for the ala-Taliban's destruction of many British cultural and religious artifacts carried out by fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell community described Mr. Crick's advice as "stupid" and "attempted to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "This cannot be avoided in the current debate about the destruction of the statues, that the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminster palace would be the target.
The iconoclasm of the British civil war was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell descendants would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The remarkable representation of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is a proof of 19th-century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure that many people still believe deserves to be celebrated.
Mr Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was considered by many people, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case of course the government.
Whether it is a fully accurate representation remains the subject of sustained historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict in the mid-17th century had shaped the development of the next nation, and Cromwell was an individually recognizable figure who represented one side of the difference.
His success as Lord Protector is also worthy of celebration and remembrance."
Chinese Farmer's Killing Pigs to Death
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a southeastern Chinese market, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by his trademark name "Yuan", was found dead with arteries cut off, bloodstained near a pighouse in the Liupanshui area market of Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing to inject a vaccine to pigs on a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining province of Qinghai, China.
He reportedly left with his cousin from the neighbouring Yunnan province on Thursday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next day, his cousin finds him dead, and sees the nearby pork cage door has been opened.
He said that in the pig cage there was a large male pig with blood in its mouth.
Forensic research confirms that the male pig weighing 550 pounds has tortured the breeder to death, according to reports.
"My cousin's cousin was bleeding and destroyed," said the cousin known for his "Wu" brand, as quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4.40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig had already been locked up to prevent it from attacking others, while police gathered evidence at the scene.
The Yuan family and market authorities are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of swine attacks on humans have also been preceded.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts causing the man to be seriously injured.
10 years earlier, a pig weighing 650 pounds clamped a Welsh farmer to his tractor until his wife frightened and drove the animal out.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pig in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive but the smell of blood can act as a "trigger".
"They're just playing.
They're bites, very curious to know...they're not going out to hurt you.
You just have to give him enough respect," he said.
The remnants of the storm Rosa brought heavy rains spread to the southwest of the United States.
As estimated, Hurricane Rosa weakens as it moves over colder waters off the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will cause flooding throughout the northern and southwestern Mexican region of the United States in the coming days.
Rosa has wind speeds of 85 mph, Category 1 Storms, starting at 5 am. East Region Time Sunday, and is located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is likely to move north on Sundays.
Meanwhile, Palung begins to form over the Pacific Ocean and moves eastward, towards the U.S. West Coast. As Rosa approaches the peninsula of Baja California on Monday as a tropical storm and begins to push tropical humidity northwards to the southwest of the U.S.
Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Subsequently, the tropical humidity that interacts with the approaching hemisphere will create widespread heavy rainfall in the Southwest for the next few days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous flooding, streams of debris and possible landslides in the desert.
Low tropical humidity will cause rainfall rates to approach 2 to 3 inches per hour at some points, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
Approximately 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected to fall in some parts of the Southwest, especially in most of Arizona.
Flooding is likely to occur with conditions deteriorating rapidly due to the nature of scattered tropical rains.
It is not recommended to explore the desert on foot due to the threat of tropical rains.
Heavy rains can cause the gap to become violent rivers and storms will bring local strong winds and dusty.
The approaching hail will cause local heavy rains to part of the Southern California coastline.
Total rainfall of more than half an inch is quite feasible, which can cause small debris to flow and the highway to become slippery.
It will be the first rain in the region in their rainy season.
Some scattered tropical rains will begin approaching Arizona at the end of Sunday and Monday morning, before the rain becomes more widespread on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rains will spread to four corners on Tuesday and last until Wednesday.
In October there will be some great temperature changes across the U.S. as the Arctic gets colder, but the tropical areas remain quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic temperature changes in the short term.
There are exact examples of dramatic temperature differences throughout the U.S. mid-range region on Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of nearly 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
For the next few days, the remaining summer heat will form and re-disperse.
Most of the central and eastern U.S. regions are expected to start warm in October with a rate of spread as much as the 80s from the South Plains to parts of the Northeast.
New York City could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is estimated to be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast shows a high chance of temperatures above the average for the eastern U.S. by mid-October.
More than 20 million people have witnessed Brett Kavanaugh's trial.
More than 20 million people witnessed an interesting statement on Thursday by prospective Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of committing sexual violence that allegedly occurred in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the political stalemate continues, with broadcasters interrupting regular events to announce unexpected events at the last minute of Friday: A deal designed by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct an investigation for a week over the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that the woman was 100 percent sure if Kavanaugh stabbed her in a drunken state and tried to strip her of her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in his fiery testimony, said that he was 100 percent convinced that it did not happen.
There were likely more than 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen on Friday, having watched it.
The company calculated the average viewer on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Counting for other networks that broadcast this is not available quickly, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has a hard time counting the number of people watching him at the office.
To put this in perspective, it’s almost the same number of viewers as a football playoff game or Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose host opinion strongly supports Kavanaugh's appointment, outperformed all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the hearing throughout the day, Nielsen said.
ABC ranked second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS has 3.1 million, NBC has 2.94 million, MSNBC with a total of 2.89 million viewers and CNN with 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Fans remain high after the trial.
Flake was a key figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that he would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, he caught CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning being yelled at by protesters when he tried to lift up to a Justice Committee hearing.
He stood down for a few minutes when he was licked, broadcast live on CNN.
“I’m standing right in front of you,” said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
She was told, “You have power when there are many women who are helpless.”
Flake said that his office had issued a statement and said, before the lift closed, that there were many other things he needed to say in the committee hearing.
Cable TV and broadcast networks all covered live a few hours later, when the Justice Committee would vote to advance Kavanaugh's nomination to the entire Senate for the vote.
But Flake said he would only do so with the understanding that the FBI would examine the allegations against the candidate for the next week, as has been requested by the minority Democrats.
Flake has been convinced in part by a conversation with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with the Coons and some senators afterwards, Flake makes his decision.
Flake's choice had power, as it was clear that the Republican party would not have a vote to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into charges against Kavanaugh.
UK Prime Minister accuses critics of 'playing politics' over Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of "playing politics" with Britain's future and damaging national interests, over her plans to leave the European Union, in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives for the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, England, September 29, 2018.
In another interview, after one of the interviews that featured it on the front page of the newspaper, former foreign minister Boris Johnson stressed the attack on what he called the Chequers plan for Brexit, saying that the proposal about Britain and the EU that had to collect tariffs from each other was "completely unreasonable."
Wayde Sims Shooting: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson in the death of LSU player.
Police have arrested a suspect in a fatal shooting that resulted in the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and imprisoned on second-level murder charges, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials released a video of a confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police say Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found the eyeglasses at the scene and said that they found Simpson's DNA on the item, WAFB affiliate CBS reported.
After interrogating Simpson, police said that he claimed to have committed a fatal shooting at Wayde.
His contract has been set at $350,000, the lawyer reported.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's office released a preliminary report on Friday, saying the cause of the death was a gunshot wound to the head until it penetrated into the neck.
The department thanked the Louisiana State Police's fugitive task force, the state police criminal lab, Southern University police and surrounding citizens in assisting an investigation leading to the arrest.
LSU's athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the territorial law enforcement for "sustainability and the pursuit of justice."
Sims was 20 years old at the time.
With a height of 6.6 feet he lived in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and swelled up to 2.6 in last season's game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said his team felt "devastated" and "surprised" by Wayde's death.
“This is what you worry about all the time,” Wade said.
Volcano erupts ash in Mexico City
The ash coming out of the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern area around the capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after increased activity in the crater and registered 183 emissions of gas and ash in more than 24 hours.
The center monitored several times the tremors and vibrations.
Images on social media show a thin layer of ash sticking to the car's windscreen in the surroundings of Mexico City.
Geophysicists have noted an increase in activity on a volcano that is 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital since a 7.1-magnitude earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017.
This mountain is known as "Don Goyo" which has been active since 1994.
Police clashed with Catalan separatists ahead of the independence election celebration.
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with anti-revolutionary police, and when thousands of people joined rival demonstrations to mark the first celebration of Catalonia's polarized vote on self-separation.
A group of masked pro-separatists held by the anti-earth police scrambled them with eggs and threw powder paint, thus creating dark clouds of dust in the streets that would normally be filled by tourists.
The dispute also occurred later that day in the presence of policemen who used their sticks to control the dispute.
For several hours, pro-independence groups shouted "Don't forget, there's no forgiveness" in front of workers' union protesters who shouted, "Spanish life."
Fourteen people received treatment for minor injuries obtained in the protest, local media reported.
Tensions remain high in this independent-oriented region, a year after the October 1 referendum that Madrid considered illegal but was celebrated by Catalan separatists.
Voters prefer to be independent, although the number of voters is low with those opposed to self-separation and mostly boycotting the election.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting at TPS across the region in a violent clash.
Pro-independence groups have camped overnight on Friday to prevent demonstrations in order to support the national police.
The demonstrations continued but were forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended a separatist protest with his wife said he no longer hoped about Catalonia's prospect of gaining independence.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
I watched my parents cry with joy for being able to choose, but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Despite achieving vital victories despite little in the regional elections last December, Catalan pro-independence parties have struggled to maintain this year's momentum despite many of their well-known leaders, who are in exile or in detainees awaiting trial, for their role in organising a referendum and a unanimous vote.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded protests with his phone to support police, said the conflict had been triggered by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting tougher," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders jailed pre-trial since the end of last year, announced that he would run for European Parliament elections next year.
"Standing as a candidate for European elections is the best way to condemn a setback in the values of democracy and oppression that we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: How many men were arrested after a house hit by a car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after a car repeatedly hit a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 19:30 BST.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the damage happened to the gate and the building itself.
A crossbow may have also been shot towards the car at some point.
The goal scored by Menga has given Livingston a victory over the Rangers with a score of 1-0
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secures victory
Livingston's victory resulted in the Rangers fired Steven Gerrard from his position as manager of the Ibrox club, for his second defeat in 18 games.
Dolly Menga's attack has been proof of a difference when Gary Holt's side movement equals the Hibernian who is in second place.
Gerrard's side remained without a win in the Premiership this season and faced the Hearts leader who was eight points ahead of them, next Sunday.
Before that, the Rangers celebrated Rapid Vienna in the European League, on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, extended their undefeated record in the division to six games, while head coach Holt still scored defeats since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston lost a chance against a rogue guest team
Team Holt should have been ahead of them long before they scored, with their accuracy giving the Rangers a variety of difficulties.
Scott Robinson managed to break through but his efforts missed across the goal, then Alan Lithgow could only expand his efforts after sliding in and confronting Craig Halkett's slump from across the goal.
The hosts were pleased to let the Rangers play superior in the beginning, knowing that they could make it difficult for the incoming team for the ball to die.
And that’s how to score a very important goal.
The Rangers conceded a free kick and Livingston got the chance, Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined to help Menga, who got the turn and scored from the center of the field.
At that stage, the Rangers had dominated the dominance but realized that the host's defense could not be penetrated and goalkeeper Liam Kelly overall was uninterrupted,
The pattern continued until the second half, although Alfredo Morelos managed to catch a rescue from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was chased by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor's feet and Lithgow was far removed due to other Livingston game tactics.
Attacks continued to come to Livingston's goal and were constantly avoided, while two penalty claims - after Halkett's challenge to substitute Glenn Middleton, and one for handball - were rejected.
‘Phenomenal' from Livingston - analysis
BBC Scotland Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
Fantastic performance and results for Livingston.
For a man, they are amazing, continuing to exceed expectations on this ever-rising trajectory.
Their playing style and staff have hardly changed since they returned to the top, but great credit must be given to Holt for the way he has strengthened the team since his arrival.
He has so many guardians.
Captain Halkett was huge, leading a well-organized defense, while Menga made Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall continue to be vigilant during the game.
However, the Rangers lacked inspiration.
Whatever they were at the time under Gerrard, they failed to meet that standard.
Their last ball was less good – only once they could break the host side formation – and it was a warning to the Rangers, who realized their presence in the middle of the field.
Erdogan received a variety of welcome in Cologne.
There was a smile and a blue sky on Saturday (September 29) when Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany – which aims to improve relations between NATO allies.
They disagreed on issues including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's entry into the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to open a new grand mosque.
The city is home to the largest population of Turks outside Turkey.
Police mentioned security reasons to block a crowd of 25,000 people gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters moved around to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - many of them Kurds - also voted, denouncing both, Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
Resistance protests describe opposition over the existence of an immigrant who is welcomed as a hero by some of the German Turkish population and is spoken as a dictator by other residents.
Crash on Deptford highway: Biker killed in collision with car
A cyclist was killed in a collision involving a car in London.
The collision occurred near a third of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a crowded street in Deptford, southeast of the city, around 10:15 BST.
The driver had stopped and paramedics came, but the man died at the scene.
The collision occurred months after another cyclist died in a runway on Childers Street, about 1 mile away from Saturday's collision.
Metropolitan police said the officers were trying to identify the man and inform his family.
Roads were closed and bus lines were diverted and motorists were seized to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured in riots
Six gunmen were injured in a riot in a man's prison with strict custody, the lapas office said.
The chaos arose at HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire around 09:30 BST (GMT<0x2B>0100) on Sunday and is still ongoing.
Specialist officers "Tornado" have been deployed to deal with the robbery, which involved eight prisoners and occurred on one side of the building.
Officers were treated at the scene due to minor injuries to the face.
A prison spokesperson said: "Specially trained laps officers have been deployed to deal with the ongoing incident in HMP Long Lartin prison.
Six officers have already been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in this prison, and it is clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and may have to spend longer time behind bars."
The HMP Long Lartin prison houses more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous prisoners.
In June it was reported that the prison chief was hospitalized after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, anti-bullying officers were called to prison to deal with a serious sneeze in which a clerk was attacked with a billiard ball.
Pink Hurricane Threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with Floods (Arid Area May Be Profitable)
Tropical depressions that hit Arizona are rare, but that’s likely to happen early next week because of the remaining traces of Rosa energy passing through the southwest desert, raising the risk of flooding.
The National Weather Service has issued a flood warning on Monday and Tuesday for the western Arizona region to southern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to lead directly past Phoenix on Tuesday, to hit Monday night accompanied by rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix mentioned on Twitter that there are only "ten tropical storms capable of causing tropical storms or depressive status in 200 miles of Phoenix territory since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a storm within 40 miles of the AZ border region."
The latest Storm Center Tool is capable of predicting 2 to 4 inches of rainfall with an insulated amount of up to 6 inches at Mogollon Rim Arizona.
Other southwestern desert areas including the central Rockies and the Great Basin are likely to be affected 1 to 2 inches, with a possible amount of isolation reaching 4 inches.
For those in the flood-free region, the Rosa rain may be a blessing because the region is hit by drought.
Although flooding is a serious problem, some of these rains are likely to be beneficial because the southwestern region is currently suffering from drought.
According to the U.S. drought watchdog, only about 40 percent of Arizona's territory suffers from at least extreme droughts, the second highest category," weather.com reported.
First, the route through Hurricane Rosa leads to land across the Baja California peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, still at the strength of the storm on Sunday morning at a wind speed of 85 miles per hour, 385 miles north of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moving north at a speed of 12 miles per hour.
The storm met with the colder waters of the Pacific and therefore weakened its strength.
As a result, it is expected to land in Mexico with the strength of tropical storms on Monday afternoon or night.
Rainfall may be high in some parts of Mexico, causing high flood risk
"Total 3 to 6 inches of rainfall is expected to hit the Baja California region as far as southwestern Sonora, possibly up to 10 inches," weather.com reported.
Then Rosa would cross the northern part along Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border on Tuesday early in the day as a tropical depression, which would cross through Arizona and into southern Utah on Tuesday midnight.
"The main risk that may be due to the Rosa storm or its remnants is very high rainfall in Baja California, the northwestern region of Sonora, and the U.S. southwestern desert region of the U.S."
The rain is expected to cause a threat of flooding and debris of buildings flowing into the desert, and landslides occur in the mountainous region.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Arrest of four suspects in attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with a stab wound in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace Midsomer Norton area, around 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital where he was in “stable” condition.
A 17-year-old teenager, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock, Avon and Somerset areas, police said.
Officers have already asked anyone who may have video footage of the incident on their phone to come to report.
Trump says Kavanaugh 'accepts hatred and anger' from the Democratic Party
“One vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the cruel and shameful Democratic Party investigation,” Trump said in a campaign in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump says Kavanaugh "accepts hatred and anger" from the Democratic Party during the candidacy process
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, forcing and emotionally denying an accusation from Christine Blasey Ford that she committed sexual violence against her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the trial about his statement.
The president said on Saturday that "Americans saw the intelligence and quality and courage of Kavanaugh on that day.
"One vote of support for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to uphold someone who has the most perfect legal thought of our time, a jury with a record of true public servants," he told a crowd of West Virginia supporters.
The president implicitly referred to Kavanaugh's candidacy when talking about the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
“Five weeks before the election was one of the most important choices in our lives.
I wasn’t running, but I was really running,” he said.
“That’s why I went there to come, fighting for a great candidate.
Trump argues that Democrats are on a mission to "fight and block."
The first voting procedure at the Senate level in Kavanaugh's candidacy is expected to be carried out at the latest on Friday, an assistant senior GOP leader said on CNN.
Hundreds of people died in Indonesia earthquake, tsunami, with the number of victims increasing
At least 384 people were killed, many of whom were hovering as a giant wave hit the coast, when a horrific earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach party in the city of Palu on Friday when a six-metre (18-foot) wave destroyed the beach at twilight, causing a lot of deaths and destroying anything it passed through.
The tsunami was followed by an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5.
"When the tsunami threat rose yesterday, people were still doing their activities on the beach and did not immediately flee until they became victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Disaster Relief Agency (BNPB) said at a moment in time in Jakarta.
“The tsunami did not come alone, it dragged cars, wood, houses, hit everything on land,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had passed the ocean at 800 kph (497 mph) before hitting the coastline.
Some people climbed trees to save themselves from the tsunami and survived, he said.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 service centers in Palu.
Aerial photos released by the BNPB show many buildings and shops that were destroyed, bridges bent and collapsed, as well as a mosque surrounded by water.
A successive aftershock shook the city along the coast on Saturday.
Earthquakes are felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Agency for the Study and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy emitted at the massive earthquake on Friday was about 200 times stronger than the atomic bomb power dropped in Hiroshima in World War II.
The geographical location of the city, which is at the end of a long narrow bay, can enlarge the size of the tsunami, it can be said.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and stated that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels had been destroyed.
The bodies of several victims were found trapped under the ruins of the destroyed building, he said, adding that there were 540 victims injured and 29 people missing.
Nugroho said the casualties and damage could have been greater along the 300 km (190 miles) coastline north of Palu, a region called Donggala, which is closer to the center of the earthquake.
Communication is "completely disabled with no information from Donggala," Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that their members and volunteers were heading for the affected areas.
“It’s a tragedy, but it can get worse,” he said.
The related authorities on Saturday received much criticism for not informing that there was a tsunami that hit Palu, although authorities said that the wave had already hit at the time the warning was issued.
An amateur footage shared on social media showed a man on the floor of an audible building shouting a panic warning of an impending tsunami, towards the people on the streets below it.
Within minutes the water rolls hit the beach, blowing up buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately prove the authenticity of the recording.
Earthquakes and tsunami are the biggest cause of power outages that disrupt communications around Palu thus making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military has already started sending cargo planes containing aid from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but the refugees are still in dire need of food and other basic necessities.
The airport has been reopened only to conduct relief efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the evacuation center in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has risen above 800.
That's awful.
When World Vision officials from Donggala have made it to the city of Palu, where the officials sheltered in a tarpaulin tent built in their office yards, on their way they have passed through various pore-poor areas, Father Doseba said.
“They told me that they had seen a lot of houses destroyed,” he said.
That's awful.
Even as the aid groups began to move slowly to start disaster relief activities, some of the groups complained of the existence of avertment against foreign volunteers who had expertise, who were about to leave for Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, goods and energy assistance from abroad can only begin to be distributed if the disaster-affected area has been officially declared a national disaster area.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a provincial-level disaster," said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"At the time the Government said, OK, this is a national disaster," we could receive international aid, but there was no such status.
On the second night after the earthquake and tsunami in Palu, friends and family of the missing victims still hope that the people they love will be part of the miracle that will fix the plot of the natural disaster.
On Saturday, a boy was taken out of the goat.
On Sunday, the rescuer took out a woman who was stuck under the rubble for two days with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national paraglider team, has been the coach of two missing paraglider athletes, who were able to attend the Asian Games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Those still trapped in the Hotel Roa-Roa, along with Father Mandagi, are his disciples.
“As a senior in the parachute field, I have my own personal emotional burden,” he said.
Gendon recounted how after news of the wrecked Hotel Roa-Roa circulated around the paragliding community, in desperation he sent WhatsApp messages to the Palu competitors, who participated in the celebrations on the beach.
Nevertheless, all his messages, got only one mark of gray, rather than two-colored blue.
“I think that means the message wasn’t sent,” he said.
Robbers take $26,750 during ATM charging at Newport in Levee
The robber on Friday morning, stole $26,750 from a Brink officer who was refilling an ATM machine storage box in Newport, based on a report from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car has already emptied an ATM in the entertainment complex and is preparing to deliver more money, Det. Dennis McCarthy wrote in a news release.
While he was working, another man "runs from behind the Brink worker" and steals a bag containing the money that will be sent.
Eyewitnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, according to reports, but police did not mention the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information about their identity can contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changed his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
Announcing the name change via Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "What used to be formally known as Kanye West."
West, 41, already had the nickname Ye for some time and used that name as his eighth album title, which was released in June.
The change was made before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, when he was expected to release his new album, Yandhi.
She replaced singer Ariana Grande to perform on the show, which was canceled for "emotional reasons," the show's creator said.
As an abbreviation for his current professional name, West previously said that for him the word had a religious meaning.
"I believe 'ye' is a common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you,'" West said earlier this year, discussing the title of the album with the broadcaster Radio Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, that name is us.
The name was taken from Kanye, which means only one, to become Ye – as a mirror of our goodness, our evil, our confusion, all.
The album is more of a reflection of ourselves."
He was one of a number of rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs has in various ways been known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced his preference for the name Love and Brother Love.
Former West collaborator, JAY-Z also made it with or without a big ligand and letter.
Mexican President AMLO vows not to use the military in the face of civil society
President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civil society ahead of the 50th anniversary of bloody retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador pledged on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza to "never use military force to pressure Mexicans."
The force launched fire on peaceful demonstration activities in the plaza on October 2, 1968, killing 300 people at the time, when the left-wing student movement planted its roots throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has already guaranteed support for young Mexicans by providing monthly subsidies to those attending colleges and opening more free universities.
He said that unemployment and the lack of educational opportunities encourage young people to form criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double the A.I. funding.
Because China is more active in terms of artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount of funds it will use for research in the field, said investor and practitioner A2 Kai-Fu Lee, who has already worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments came after various parts of the U.S. government made an announcement about AI, even when the U.S. overall lacked a formal AI strategy.
China, meanwhile, unveiled its plan last year: aiming to become the number one in AI innovation by 2030.
“Changing AI research funds is a good start, given that all other countries tend to be far behind the U.S., and we are looking for the next breakthrough in the field of AI,” Lee said.
Replacing the funds could double the chances that the next big AI achievement would be made in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lea, the owner of the book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Sinovation Ventures, who has already invested in one of China's leading AI companies, Face<0x2B><0x2B>.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University he designed an AI system that beat the best American Othello players, and after that he served as an executive at Microsoft Research and president of Google's Chinese branch.
Lee acknowledged previous U.S. government technology competitions such as the Robotics Challenge for the Advanced Defense Research Project and asked when the next activity would be implemented, to help identify the next visionary.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to win prizes from the Government, Lee said.
“It’s not China that takes academic leadership; it’s a company,” Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have already hired figures from the university for AI research over the past few years.
Lee said that changes in immigration policies could also help the U.S. to support efforts around AI.
“I think green cards can be offered automatically to PHD degree holders in the field of AI,” he said.
The Chinese Council of State issued the Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
The Chinese Science Foundation provides funding for people in academic institutions just like the way the Science Foundation and other governmental organizations distribute money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic duties is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year in the U.S. Department of Defense developed a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which aims to involve industrial and academic partners, and the White House announced the formation of the Committee's Selection for Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA (Agency for Advanced Defense Research) announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for NSF, DARPA has recently invested more than $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation that called for the establishment of the National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence did not see any follow-up for months.
Macedonians hold ballots in order to change the country's name
Macedonians held a vote on Sunday to decide on a change of name to the "North Macedonian Republic," an act that would resolve a decade-long dispute with Greece that has denied its offer of membership to become part of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains the opinion that the name of the neighboring country to its north represents the recognition of ownership of its territory and has banned the country from joining NATO and the European Union.
The two sides reached an agreement in June on the basis of a new name proposed, but the nationalist opposition argued that the change would damage the identities of most of the ethnic Slavic Macedonian population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the general election and a boycott campaign had cast doubt on whether the election result could reach the minimum number of 50 percent needed for the election results to be declared valid.
The question on the ballot reads: "Do you approve NATO and EU membership by accepting the existence of an agreement with Greece."
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argued that it was a price worth paying in order to get permission to enter such bodies as the European Union and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries born from the destruction of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to give my vote for the future of the country, for the young generation of Macedonia so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union because it means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, there are quite a few MPs who say they will comply with the results of the vote to make a decision.
A change of name requires two-thirds of the vote in parliament.
The state election commission said there were no reports of violations until 1 p.m.
However, the voter turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 percent of registered voters gave their ballots.
"I came to give my vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko gave their ballots for elections in Macedonia in order to change the country's name that would pave the way for the country to join NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
In front of parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, had already prepared a small stage and pulled chairs in front of tents created by those who would boycott the vote.
"We agree to join NATO and the European Union, but we want to join with respect, not through the door of the server," Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to China and Russia and become part of the Euro-Asian integration.”
Zaev said NATO membership would bring more investment needed for Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe most of the population will agree because more than 80 percent of our society supports the European Union and NATO," Zaev said after giving his vote.
He said the result "yes" would be "confirmation of our future."
A poll results published by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research on Monday stated that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would take part in the vote - less than the number needed.
Another poll, conducted by the TV station Telma Macedonia, found that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
In order for the vote to be successful, it takes 50 percent plus 1 vote.
A failure in the vote will represent the first policy rejection against the pro-Western government since taking over in May last year.
Watch: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City scoured the entire defense of Brighton to score.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling were deployed as Brighton's defense on Manchester City's 2-0 win on Saturday at Etihad Stadium, Manchester, England.
Aguero made the win look very easy on his score in the 65th minute.
The Argentine attacker received an operan in the middle of the field at the start of the match.
He ran between three Brighton defenders, before the sniper entered the open field.
Aguero later found himself surrounded by four people in green trousers.
He turned past one defender before running ahead of several opponents again at the end of Brighton's goal.
Then he swung to his left, to Sterling.
The England forward took advantage of his first kick from the goal direction to kick the ball back to Aguero, who used his right foot to beat Brighton goalkeeper, Mathew Ryan with a kick to the right side of the goal.
"Aguero is struggling with some problems on his feet," City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We're talking about him playing for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're glad he scored a goal at the time."
However, it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues an early advantage in the Premier League match.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball, far inside the Brighton area on the game.
He operated the ball with a stunning long kick through the left wing to Leroy Sane.
Sane did a little bit of kicking before leading Sterling to the farthest post.
Sky Blue's front quarterback swirls the ball towards the goal just before the ball kicks out of the border.

Scherzer wants to sue spoiler versus Rockies
With the Nationals eliminated from the playoffs, there was no more reason to force another match.
But over-competitive Scherzer hopes to outperform the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if there are still playoff implications for the Rockies, who excel in one game over the Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West.
The Rockies have at least earned a place after winning in a wild-card game against the Nationals with a 5-2 score on Friday night, but are still trying to reach their first division title.
“Although we played without winning, at least we could know the atmosphere in Denver with a crowd of spectators and other teams who will be competing at the highest level of any point I’m likely to face this year.
How could I not want to compete in such a game?"
The Nationals have not announced the opening match for Sunday, but it is reported that in such circumstances, they tend to let Scherzer take part.
Scherzer, who will start the match for the 34th time, held a practice session on Thursday and started Sunday's game which is usually used to rest.
Washington's right-hand pitcher was an 18-7 scoring champion with an average run (ERA) of 2.53 and 300 strike-outs in 220 2/3 innings this session.
Trump campaigned in West Virginia.
The president impliedly referred to a situation involving his election-appointed Supreme Court Judge Brett Kavanaugh as he spoke about the importance of the Republican public's vote in the middle of the election.
“All the efforts we have made are at stake in November.
Five weeks before he made the most important election in our lives.
This is one of the big, big -- I don't really run that's why I'm fighting everywhere for an amazing candidate," he said.
Trump continued, “You see there is a very, very terrifying radical Democratic group, you can see it is happening right now.
And they decide to take back power in any way, you see their evil, their atrocities.
They don’t care who they hurt, who they have to be polite to get power and control, that’s what they want, that’s power and control, we won’t give it to them.”
Democrats, he said, are on a mission to "reject and block."
"And you've seen it for the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "gracious and evil and disgusting and unbelievable."
He referred to the Senate Dianne Feinstein who served on the Senate Judiciary Committee by naming her name, which was greeted with a harsh rebuke from her listeners.
"Do you remember the answer?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, uh, apa.
No, uh no, I'm waiting for it - it's a very bad body language - the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a place of public service.
Now be intolerable to anyone who puts his mind to it.
When Momentum activists at my local party gave me a voice to condemn myself, it wasn’t surprising.
After all, I am in the last order of the Member of Parliament, who was told that our presence was not expected - all because we expressed an opinion.
My colleague in parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated similarly because she firmly defended anti-Semitism.
In my case, the protest movement criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, in Europe, an issue ironically identical to that opposed by Jeremy Corbyn with the previous leader.
A notice for the East Nottingham workers' meeting on Friday stated that "we want the meeting to be inclusive and productive."
For almost eight years I was a member of the local Labour Parliament, the meeting of the General Committee on Friday Night was exactly that.
Unfortunately today, the nature of many meetings and promises about "better, more friendly" politics has not long been forgotten, if, indeed it ever began.
The differences in opinion in the working party are increasingly clearly intolerable and each opinion is judged by its merits by the party's authority.
It started as soon as Jeremy became the leader, as a colleague I once thought would be able to share the same political view, beginning to expect me to turn back and accept a position I would never before accept – both in national security and in the single market of the European Union.
Whenever I speak openly – and no matter what I say – then there will be a crackdown on social media that calls for the cancellation of the appointment, denounces central politics, tells me I shouldn’t be in the Labour party.
And it wasn’t just me who experienced it.
Of course, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments addressed to me tend to be political.
I admire the professionalism and limitations of my colleagues who face sexual harassment or racism every day but never shy away from it.
One of the most disappointing aspects in today’s political era is how much abuse has been considered reasonable.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour party should help develop a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer in a broader church and with every "non-confidence" motion or change the selection of party rules to be more limited.
I got a lot of advice over the last two years that encouraged me to keep my head down, not overvoking opinions, and then I would say "okay."
But I jumped into politics not to do that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago when I was still a school student, provoked by Thatcher's government negligence that resulted in my comprehensive school class literally falling apart, I have been trying to fight for better public services for those who desperately need it - both in men's local councillors and in local councillors.
I never hid my political action, including in the last election.
No one in East Nottingham will question my policy position and the things I do not agree with in the current leadership.
For those who are holding a motion on Friday, what I can say is that as the country moves quickly toward a split in sovereignty (Brexit), it will jeopardize our state business and public services, I don’t want to waste time and energy for loyalty to the leader of the Labour party.
But truly, one message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, it is for my constituency, as a member of the Labour Party or not. I am proud to serve you and I promise that there is no threat of dismissal or political policy that will prevent me from doing what I believe is in the best interest of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: The undefeated Ayr ascends to the top position
The last two attempts may have tricked the final result a bit, but without a doubt Ayr deserved to win a very entertaining Tennent's Premiership game today.
Now they are at the top, the only undefeated side out of ten.
In the end, their superior defense, and the ability to get the best chances, which made the host team and coach Peter Murchie get the right to feel happy.
"So far we've tested our game, and we're still undefeated so we're happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "Rewards for Ayr, they're better at taking chances than we do."
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, puts Ayr in front, but the yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, was given on the game by the Warriors, giving Melrose a chance to score the numbers and Jason Baggot a converging experiment.
Climo lengthened Ayr's lead with a penalty, before, right in the middle of the time, he scored then made a single attempt to make Ayr's score to 17-5 at the break.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's attempt was altered by Baggot, reducing the chances to five points.
Then there was a long pause because Ruairidh Knott suffered a serious injury, was pulled out, and since the start of the game again, Ayr went faster than Stafford McDowall's attempt, altered by Climo.
Captain Ayr Blair Macpherson was then hit by a yellow card and again, Melrose made a backup player pay with Bruce Colvine's unaltered attempt, at the end of the heavy pressure.
The host had returned to play, but, by the time Struan Hutchinson got the yellow card for bending Climo without the ball, from the penalty line, MacPherson arrived behind Ayr's advancing wounded.
Climo was replaced, as was the case again, almost since the start of the game, after Kyle Rowe made a goal kick and failed the fifth attempt of the oppressor Gregor Henry.
Star Still Game looks ready for its new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Kieran looks ready to move into the service industry after it was previously known that he was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The role of 56-year-old Jack Jarvis on the BBC popular show, which was directed and also starred him along with his longtime comedian colleague, Greg Hemphill.
The pair have already announced that the upcoming series to nine is the last episode, and apparently Kiernan is planning to direct the broadcast directly after Craiglang.
According to the official record list, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although a Scottish Sun narrator hinted that Kiernan was trying to get involved in "a thriving restaurant business in Glasgow.
“The sea is ours: Bolivia surrounded by the mainland hopes that the court will reopen the path to the Pacific.
The sailors patrolled at the infantry headquarters located in La Paz.
The public building raised a blue sea flag.
The Navy base from Titicaca to the Amazon was polished with the motto: "The sea is our legitimate property.
Resurrection is an obligation.”
Passing through Bolivia surrounded by land, the memory of the defeat of a coastline to Chile in a bloody 19th century conflict is still clear – as is the desire to once again cross the Pacific Ocean.
The hope is likely to peak in a few decades, as Bolivia awaits a court order on October 1 after five-year consultations.
"Bolivia has momentum, a spirit of unity and peace, and of course positive hopes about the outcome," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians who will watch the ICJ trial on widescreen across the country, hope that the court in The Hague will support Bolivia's claim that - after decades of tense negotiations it - Chile is obliged to negotiate Bolivia's guarantees of sovereignty over the ocean.
Evo Morales, a charismatic Bolivian indigenous president who faces a controversial war for next year's birthday elections - also has a lot of support at Monday's hearing.
"We are very close to the return of the Pacific," he swore at the end of August.
But some analysts are convinced that the court is unlikely to rule on Bolivia's wishes- and that will only change a little if it allows.
The Dutch-based UN agency does not have the power to hand over the Chilean territory, and has already stated that it will not decide the outcome of the possible negotiations.
That the ICJ’s ruling came just six months after the final argument had been heard, indicating the case was “uncomplicated,” said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean international lawyer.
And it is still far from continuing Bolivia’s demands, in the last four years it may just be a setback.
"The problem of access to the sea has been kidnapped by the Bolivian government now," he said.
Morales’ aggressive rhetoric has already weakened the goodwill of the remaining Chileans, he said.
Bolivia and Chile will remain in talks at some point, but it will be very difficult to stay in discussions after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former president Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, the Bolivian government's deputy in The Hague rejected the idea of quick decision-making.
Monday will give Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to open an era of relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "end 139 years of conflict of opinion with mutual gains," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales-still one of Latin American's most famous-used maritime issues as a political supporter.
Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The conference is an opportunity to see what we need to do in the past."
North Korea says the withdrawal of nuclear weapons will not happen unless they can trust the U.S.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his first country would never strip nuclear weapons if Korea could not trust Washington.
Ri made a statement on Saturday at the UN General Assembly.
He mentioned about the United States implementing the deal made at a meeting in Singapore between rival leaders.
His comments came as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was seen almost beginning a nuclear diplomacy that had been stalled for more than three months after a meeting with Kim Jong Un from North Korea.
Ri said it was only a "great dream" that by continuing U.S. sanctions and rejection of the declaration of the end of the Korean War, North Korea would give up.
Washington is careful to approve the declaration without Pyongyang making an attempt to restrict the armed forces first.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump wanted to hold a second meeting.
However, there is widespread doubt that Pyongyang is serious about the recognition of a weapons depot that is the only way for the country to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second meeting between Kim and Trump
The Paris fashion show shows a lot of the latest collection of head covers up to the main street near you
If you want to increase the collection of hats or really want to protect from the sunshine don’t look for another.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne released a series of large-sized headgear for their SS19 collection on the fashion show stage with the stunning style held at Paris Fashion Week.
The really impractical hat has already wiped out Instagram this summer and these designers have already shown eye-catching creations on stage.
What stands out from Valentino is a cream-coloured hat on which it is decorated with a wide edge of the fur bowl that covers the head of the model.
Large-sized accessories include a diamond-decorated octopus, a witch hat and even a pineapple, but are not made to heat the head.
Thom Browne also showed a bunch of weird-and-just ahead of Halloween.
Many masks of various colors whose lips have been sewn and resemble Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
A creation similar to scuba diving gear is equipped with snorkel and eyeglasses, while the rest looks like melted ice cream.
And if you continue to browse those akbar fashion collections – then you’re happy.
Fashion observers estimate that the large hat collection will be marketed to the main street near you.
Large-sized hats became a very lax trend in ‘La Bomba', a straw hat with a two-legged rim width seen worn by everyone including Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The label worship behind a very impractical hat the gleamingness of social media makes a huge creation in beach catwalks of hay that is almost the same size as swimwear - worn with a secluded model.
The burnt razor rafia bag, carved with rafia on the edge with a white leather strap, is a standout from Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity hairdresser Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I hope to see large hats and beach bags arrive on the main road for next summer - as designers have already made a big impact, it will be difficult to ignore the demand for such large accessories'
John Edward: Language skills are very important to global citizens
The Scottish private school maintains a record of academic excellence, and this was continued in 2018 with outstanding test results, which are increasingly amplified by each student and collective success in sports, arts, music as well as hard work.
With over 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Private School Council (SCIS) strive to provide the best service for students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for advanced and higher education, their chosen careers, and their role as world citizens.
As the education sector can design and implement school curricula as expected, we see modern language continue to be a popular and desirable subject of choice in many schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you talk to someone in a language he understands, your speech will get into his head.
If you speak to him in his language then your speech will enter into his heart."
This is a strong reminder that we can’t just rely on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From this year’s most recent test results, we can see that language is the top position of the league table with the highest graduation scores in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who learn a foreign language get an A Plus rating.
The data, collected from 74 SCIS member schools, showed that 72 percent of students scored A Plus in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who studied German, 69 percent of those who studied French and 63 percent of those who studied Spanish also scored A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign language as an important skill that will certainly be needed by children and adolescents in the future.
Today languages, as a choice of subjects, are held in the same standard as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in modern school curricula and elsewhere.
A survey conducted by the British Employment and Skills Service in 2014 found that for several reasons why employers should continue to struggle to fill in the enrollment, 17 percent of the reason was a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly encouraged to prepare teenagers for their careers in the future.
With more and more job opportunities that require language skills, these skills are important in the global world.
Whatever a person’s career choice, if they have already learned a second language, in the future they will feel a real benefit because they have this kind of lifelong skills.
Being able to communicate directly with residents of a foreign country will automatically make a multilingual superior in the competition.
According to a YouGov poll of more than 4,000 English adults in 2013, 75 percent of them do not speak a foreign language well enough to conduct conversations and French is the only language spoken in two digits percent, which is 15 percent.
This is why investing in language teaching for today’s children is an important thing for today.
Having multilingual skills, especially the languages of countries with developing economies, will provide children with better opportunities to find meaningful jobs.
In Scotland, each school will teach a different language.
Some schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered the most important in English for the next few years, namely 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s interest, there will always be a number of languages to choose from in a standalone school, with expert teaching staff in the field.
The Scottish Independent Schools are designed to provide a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills needed to succeed, whatever happens in the future.
It cannot be denied that today, in a global business environment, language will always be an important aspect in determining the future of the country, so this should be reflected in education.
In fact, modern language should be fully regarded as an "international communication skills."
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity, and excellence to Scottish teenagers.
We have to do it right.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Board of Independent Schools
LeBron will make his debut for the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The fans' waiting to see LeBron James begin his debut for the Los Angeles Lakers is almost over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday's pre-season opening against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, it is not yet determined how many minutes he will play.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James was likely to play just a few minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plan for the Lakers' six-game pre-season schedule.
“At the current stage of my career, I don’t have to do pre-season games to get ready,” he said.
Trump General Meeting Schedule in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump began a general meeting of the campaign tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is Trump’s first general meeting of five general meetings scheduled for next week, including a stop at some fun places that include Tennessee and Mississippi.
After it was confirmed that the vote was postponed so that he could vote for the Supreme Court’s office, Trump intends to build support for him for the upcoming midterm general election because the Republican Party risks losing control of Congress if the vote is held in November.
What time is Trump’s general meeting in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trump's general meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled at 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s general meeting in West Virginia online through a live stream on YouTube.
Trump will likely discuss this week's hearing for Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who is getting more tense after allegations of sexual misconduct and Senate vote estimates will be postponed to a week while the FBI investigates him.
But the main goal of this general meeting agenda is to help the Republicans get some momentum in the face of the November general election.
Therefore, in President Trump's campaign it was mentioned that the five general meetings next week were aimed at "encouraging volunteers and supporters because the Republican party is trying to protect and expand the majority they hold in the Senate and Parliament," according to Reuters.
“Congress control is so important to his agenda that the president will travel as much as possible to states as we face a busy campaign season,” a Trump campaign spokesman who declined to mention his name told Reuters.
Scheduled for the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, tonight's general meeting is expected to present supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania as well as draw coverage from the Pittsburgh media," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be Trump’s second visit to West Virginia in a month, the state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump tried to help Patrick Morrisey, the West Virginia Senate candidate from the Republican Party who was behind in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey so the president should come as an attempt to increase his earnings in polls," said Simon Haeder, a politician at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team demonstrates courage to defend its hopes in facing Sunday's singles game
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday afternoon's foursome session is what may be needed in this Ryder Cup.
The swing of the momentum wand is a sporting concept that is the result of a finding that is fully trusted by the players, and nothing exceeds that in a competition like this.
Where do you think the momentum is now?
"Before, they were six points ahead and now four, so I think we consider it a bit of a momentum," Spieth said.
Of course Europe has an advantage because it outperforms four points with twelve more games.
But the American team, as Spieth says, feels they have a little momentum and they have a lot of things that can be exciting, except for the Spieth and Justin Thomas formations who play together all day and each boast three out of four points.
Spieth has played lethally ranging from the tee area to the green area and led by example.
The celebration screams were getting louder when his turn came, making a putting blow important to making the series game as he and Thomas lost two opponents two.
A putting blow from him that won them on the 15th is greeted with a similar scream, a scream that tells you that he is sure America is not losing.
“You really have to try harder and worry about your own game,” Spieth said.
All of these players are gone now.
18 holes to be marked.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas over the past two days were Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undeniable story of the Ryder Cup.
The unique but attractive pair from Europe is four to four and can do without mistakes.
"Moliwood" was the only couple not to do a bogey stroke on Saturday afternoons, but they also avoided bogey on Saturday mornings, Friday afternoons and back nine on Friday mornings.
That run, and how their energy seemed to flow both into and out of this crowd convinced that they were players to be defeated on Sunday, and no more famous player than Fleetwood or Molinari would lock the potential for a European victory at sunset over Le Golf National.
It is better if at the same time both are placed in a different hole.
However, it’s still too early to talk about Europe’s victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson shorten the work of Sergio Garcia, a morning fourball hero, when he is paired with Alex Noren.
One bogey and two doubles on the front nine are like digging holes that will never be climbed by these Spanish and Swedish golfers.
Although, on Sundays, nothing can help you get out of the hole.
Fourball and foursome are great shows to look at due to interactions between couples, the advice they give, the advice they don’t give and how strategies can change instantly.
So far, Europe played better as a team and led quite a long way towards the final day, but the foursome also showed that the U.S. team had a keen time to compete even though doubted by some parties, especially in the United States.
Europe tops 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will take advantage of the Ryder Cup final day after rising from a fourball and foursome game on Saturday by leading 10-6 over the United States.
The inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led with two wins over the Tiger Woods who had to struggle to record their points so far at Le Golf National with four points.
The European team Thomas Bjorn, who wanted to retain the trophy that had not been won at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the American team that was wrongly targeted in the morning fourball, making the series a 3-1 result.
The United States gave more resistance in the foursome, winning two games, but they couldn't reduce the deficit.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points from Sunday's 12 singles games to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood was the first European debut to win four consecutive points, while he and Molinari, dubbed "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, only became the second pair to win four points out of their four opening games in Ryder Cup history.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourball they became very solid to defeat the soaking Woods and American debut Bryson Dechambeau more firmly 5&4.
Woods, who forced himself through two games on Saturday, occasionally performed brilliantly but he had already lost 19 of the 29 games in fourball and foursomes as well as seven in a row.
Justin Rose, rested on the morning fourball, then returned to pair with Henrik Stenson in the foursome and lost 2&1 to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - ranked first and third in the world.
Europe did not achieve it on its own even though the days were pleasant and windy in southwest Paris.
The top three-time winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a draw for America with two points on Saturday.
They got an exciting 2&1 win over Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter of Spain in the fourball then came back again to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the foursome after losing the first two holes.
It only happened twice in Ryder Cup history where a team returned from a four-point deficit into a single game, although as the defending team champion Furyk only needed series points to defend the trophy.
However, after being the second best for two days, Sunday's rebounds seem to go beyond them.
North Korea says 'impossible' to unilaterally disarm without confidence
On Saturday, North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations about sanctions that continually deepen their distrust of the United States and it is unlikely the country would unilaterally strip its nuclear weapons in such a situation.
Ri Yong Ho told the world body's annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "significant steps showing goodwill" last year, such as stopping nuclear and missile testing, dismantling nuclear testing sites, and vowing not to develop nuclear weapons as well as nuclear technology.
"However, we do not see any appropriate response from the United States," he said.
"Without trust in the United States there will be no confidence in our national security and in such a situation it is impossible for us to disarm our own weapons first unilaterally."
While Ri reiterated the same complaint from North Korea about Washington's resistance to a "stage" approach to denuclearization in which North Korea would be punished for taking a step-by-step step, a significant statement he delivered that they did not completely reject as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at a summit between U.S. presidents and North Korean leaders that was first held in Singapore on June 12, at which point Kim pledged to pursue a "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula" while Trump pledged security assurances.
North Korea had wanted an official end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States said that Pyongyang should stop its nuclear weapons first.
Washington also rejected calls for loosening international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States insisted on "denuclearization first" and increased pressure with the granting of semi-sanctions forcibly achieving their goals, and even rejected "the end of the war statement," Ri said.
“The perception that sanctions can make us kneel is an illusion of people who don’t know about us.
But, the problem is that such continuous sanctions will deepen our distrust."
Ri did not mention the plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leader highlighted at the United Nations earlier this week.
The minister instead highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: "If the parties involved in this denuclearization were South Korea and not the United States, denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not until such a bumpy road."
However, the tone of Ri’s speech was dramatically different from last year, when he spoke at the UN General Assembly that targeting North Korea’s rockets on the US mainland was inevitable after “Devil President” Trump called Kim “a rocket man” on a suicide mission.
This year at a U.N. meeting, Trump last year threatened to “destroy” North Korea altogether, pouring praise on Kim for his courage to take steps to sack, but the big work still has to be done and sanctions must remain in place until North Korea denuclearizes.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time limit for this, "If it takes two years, three years or five months - no problem," he said.
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should punish Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that: "The implementation of the Security Council sanctions must be continued firmly and should not fail until we know that denuclearization is complete, final and verified."
The Security Council unanimously increased sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to stop funding Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and said afterwards that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that there had actually been progress, only North Korea in a matter of hours insisted that he made "gangster-like demands."
North Korea pledged in a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle the missile location and also the nuclear complex if the United States takes "appropriate action."
He stated that Kim had instructed him to take "appropriate action" with his will was a security guarantee that Trump promised in Singapore and was moving towards normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on adequate rest.
A new course at Harvard University this year makes all S1 students there sleep more, in an effort to fight the macho culture in learning that is thriving through caffeine-powered 'man ghostbirds'.
One academic found that students at the world’s number one university often don’t know anything if they discuss very basic things about how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of medicine specializing in sleep problems at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the US.
He was inspired to start the course after giving lectures on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
"At last a girl came to me and said, 'Why was I just told now, in my final year?'
The girl said no one ever told me about the importance of sleep - which surprised me," she told The Telegraph.
The course, which was first launched this year, explains to students the essence of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic outcomes, as well as improve their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the university's executive director of health services, said the university decided to introduce this course after finding students who were severely sleep deprived throughout the week.
This one-hour course involves a series of interactive tasks.
In one session there is a picture of the bedroom, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, sports pants, and books to get an explanation of the effects of caffeine and lights, as well as how athletic outcomes are affected by sleep deprivation, and the importance of sleep time routines.
In another section, participants get an explanation of how long lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A campus map, with interactive icons, then encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
"We know this won't change the student's behavior instantly.
But we are confident that they have the right to know - just as you have the right to know the effect of choosing to smoke cigarettes on health," Professor Czeisler said.
A proud culture of 'sleeping' still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students that means lack of sleep is an ever-growing problem.
Ensuring you get enough sleep, with good quality, should be a 'secret weapon' to fight stress, fatigue, and anxiety, the trick is - even to avoid weight gain, because lack of sleep makes the brain activate hunger mode, causing a constant feeling of hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California resident studying chemistry and physical biology who helped Professor Czeisler design the course, had taken one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said that this course had opened his eyes and inspired him to organize courses for the entire campus.
The next step, she hopes that all graduate students will be instructed to complete a similar study program before joining a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students should consider setting up a sleeptime alarm, as well as an alarm wake-up call, and be aware of the effects of ‘blue light’ emitted by electronic displays and LED lights, which can shift your circadian rhythm out of its tune path thus causing sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Goals Menga mentally lowers Gerrard's team
Again, the Rangers felt the sadness of the day when Dolly Menga's attack delivered the losing Steven Gerrard team to a 1-0 loss at Livingston.
The Ibrox team tried to record their first win in their journey, since a 4-1 win in February at St Johnstone, but the Gary Holt team just gave Gerrard a second defeat in 18 games as manager, causing his team to miss eight points from Ladbrokes Premiership leader.
Menga attacked seven minutes before the first half was over and the outspoken Rangers players didn't seem to be balancing.
While the Rangers are now down to sixth, Livingston is up to third, leaving only a goal difference from the Hibernians.
And it could be that there will be further trouble at the Rangers' stronghold after line guard Calum Spence has to be treated for a head wound after an object is thrown from a distance.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that surpassed Ayr to the Betfred Cup semifinal.
Instead, Holt went with the same Livi 11 who took one point from the Hearts last week and he would be happy with the costume that impresses their opponents at every opportunity.
Rangers may dominate possession of the ball, but Livingston makes better use of the ball they have.
They should have recorded the score in just two minutes when Menga's first short streak was thrown by Scott Pittman through Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder drew the big chance too wide.
Keaghan Jacobs' deep free kick then meets captain Craig Halkett but his defense partner Alan Lithgow can only punch wide in the rear position.
The Rangers took control but there seemed to be more hope than confidence about their game in the third final.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that he should have gotten a penalty when he and Steven Lawless collided at the quarter-hour mark but referee Steven Thomson turned down this Colombian citizen's appeal.
The Rangers only managed to make two throws in the first half but Ibrox's previous goalkeeper, Liam Kelly, almost never had a problem with Lassana Coulibaly's header kick and Ovie Ejaria's easy-to-need attack.
Although Livi's opening goal in the 34th minute may be opposed to the game's course, no one can deny that they deserve it because of their own hard work.
Once again the Rangers failed to overcome Jacobs' deep dead ball tactics.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher put the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained calm choosing Menga for a simple end.
Gerrard acted during the break by replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the shift almost had a direct impact as the wingman put the ball on Morelos but Kelly who played impressed quickly out of the line to obstruct.
But Livingston continued to force the call team to play the exact game they enjoyed, with Lithgow and Halkett sweeping all the long balls.
Team Holt should have broadened their lead in the final stages but McGregor stood well to drive the Jacobs before Lithgow extended wide from the corner.
The Rangers' replacement, Glenn Middleton, claimed the penalty again when he quarreled with the Jacobs, but again Thomson turned his face.
Almanac: The Inventor of Geiger
And now from our "Sunday Morning" Almanac page: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago on this day, and MORE THAN EVER... the day when future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, it was an invention that eventually made the device known as the Geiger Detector.
Becoming a tool of science since then, the Geiger Breakthrough also became a pop culture breakthrough, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado," starring the less convincing cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: What's that thing?"
Rogers: "This is the Geiger Breaker, used to find the location of radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When using these earphones, you can actually hear the effect of the atoms released by the radioactivity in the minerals."
Evans: "Say, must be popping up now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But it was the discovery that kept his name alive.
New Cancer Vaccine Teaches the Immune System to ‘Recognize’ Evil Cells
New Cancer Vaccine Teaches the Immune System to ‘Recognize’ Evil Cells and Kill Them
Vaccines teach the immune system to recognize malignant cells as part of treatment
The method involves the process of extracting immune cells from the patient, changing them in the laboratory
They can then ‘recognize’ the proteins that are common in many cancers and then injected again
An experimental vaccine shows promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells, her ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
This method involves the process of extracting the patient's immune cells, changing them in the laboratory so that they can "recognize" the proteins commonly found in many cancers called HER2, and then re-injecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “The results show that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 "drives the growth of several types of cancer," including breast, ovarian, lung, and colorectal cancer, Prof Berzofsky explains.
The same approach as taking patients' immune cells and "teaching" them how to target cancer cells has been successful in treating one type of leukemia.
Kanye West Started a Pro-Trump Diatribe, Wearing a MAGA Hat, After His SNL Appearance.
It's not going well.
Kanye West was shot in the studio during Saturday Night Live after appearing in a chaos in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said that he would run for office in 2020.
After performing the third song that night, titled Ghost Town in which he wore a Make America Great hat, he challenged the Democratic party and reiterated his support for Trump.
“I often talk to white people and they say, ‘How can you like Trump, he’s racist?’
Yes, if I'm worried about racism, I've been out of America for a long time," he said.
SNL began the show with a voice starring Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star laughed at Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on allegations of sexual violence made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not broadcast, West's record was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock was trying to make fun of the West with the upload.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he was having trouble behind the scenes because of the hat he was wearing.
"They're protecting me behind the scenes.
They said, 'Don't go out wearing that hat.'
They're protecting me!
And then they say I'm drowning," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West went on: “You want to see a sinking place?” saying that he would wear Superman’s coat, because this means you can’t dictate what I should do. You want the world to go forward?
Try to love."
His comments resulted in a mockery at least twice from the audience and the SNL cast seemed embarrassed, Variety reported, with one person announcing: "The whole studio was silent."
West was brought in at the last moments as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, former girlfriend of rap singer Mac Miller who just died a few days ago.
West confused many people with the appearance of his song I Love it, dressed like a Perrier Bottle.
West received the support of TPUSA's conservative group chairman, Candace Turner, who wrote in a tweet: "For one of the most daring souls: THE TERMIUM OF ALL MEMBERSHIP."
But show host Karen Hunter wrote in a tweet that West was "just being herself and it's really very good."
"But I chose NOT to gift someone (by buying music or his shirt or supporting his 'art') whom I believe to embrace and discard an ideology that is dangerous to my community.
He's free.
So are we," he added.
Prior to the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he is now "a creature officially known as Kanye West."
He was not the first artist to change his name and follow in Diddy's footsteps, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
A fellow rap singer, Snoop Dogg got the name Snoop Lion and certainly died the music legend Prince, changing his name to a symbol and then the artist who was formerly known as Prince.
Accused of attempted murder over suspension at Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.

These charges will be reviewed by the Attorney General.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington criticises toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for swinging the sword in his role as Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy series from HBO Game of Thrones.
However, the actor, 31, rejects the stereotype of the macho hero, he says that the role on such screens makes teenage boys often feel that they should be strong to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he was convinced ‘there was something wrong’ and questioned how to deal with the bad masculinity issues in the <0x23>MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his opponent in Game of Thrones Rose Leslie, also 31, claimed she felt "strong enough" in discussing the issue.
'I feel personally, quite strong, right now - where are we wrong about this masculinity?' he said.
‘What do we teach men as they grow up, about the problems we see now?’
Kit believes television may be responsible for the emergence of poor masculinity with its highly masculine characters.
He continued: 'Mana who was the character from birth and what was he taught?
What is taught on TV, and on the street, that makes boys feel that they should have this particular side to become men?
I think that’s really one of the big questions these days – how do we change it?
“There’s something wrong with the young people.”
In the interview he also admitted that he would not play in a prequel or sequel to Game of Thrones as the series would end next summer, saying that he was ‘finished with battlefields and horses’.
Since November Kit will star in the return of Sam Shepard's True West, a story about the film's producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he considered meeting with his wife Rose to be the best reason to get out of Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife in this show, thus giving me a future family, and from here my life begins," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the love flower of Kit's character Jon Snow, in this Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on the land of Leslie's family residence in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in its population living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are infected in the country, health officials said.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The majority of new cases are transmitted through sex, marking a change from before.
Traditionally, HIV spreads rapidly through several parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people exposed to HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, from year to year the number of those living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased to 100,000 people.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is called increasingly violent.
Due to the country’s conservative values, the study estimates that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many transmissions of the disease stem from inadequate sexual protection in this relationship.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV treatment as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that staff has leaked GOP senator data, spreading 'dangerous lies' and 'conspiracy theory'
Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday denied that one of her staff members had sent the personal information of three United States Republican senators to the Wikipedia page of a member of parliament.
The Los Angeles Democratic Party asserted that the claim was moved by experts and the "ultra-right wing" website.
"Lies, lies, and many more disgusting lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
It was reported that the information released included the home address and phone number of the United States Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, and Mike Lee as well as Orrin Hatch, all from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, sent by an unknown person at Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against prospective Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak appeared shortly after three senators asked Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the shipment was connected to the Waters office and revealed information from one of Waters' staff members, Hill reported.
"This unfounded accusation is completely wrong and is an absolute lie," Waters continued.
“My staff members – whose identities, personal information, and security are threatened by false and false accusations – are not at all responsible for this information leak.
The accusation is not based on this is completely wrong and is an absolute lie."
Waters' statement quickly attracted online criticism, including from former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This anger means anger,” Fleischer wrote.
"This shows he's not fit to be a Congressman.
If someone is accused of doing something they don't, they can't be angry.
They can't deviate.
They cannot question the motives of the defendant.
They must be calm and peaceful.”
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters' reaction to Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, whom critics accused of appearing too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is trying to shift Waters in the part-time election, also voiced his thoughts on Twitter.
“Big if it’s true,” he wrote on Twitter.
In his statement, Water said his office had warned "the proper authorities and law enforcement entities about these wrong charges.
"We will ensure that the perpetrator will be revealed," he continued, "and they will be legally responsible for all their actions that are damaging and dangerous to one and all of my staff members."
Johnny English Strikes Again - Rowan Atkinson's less-than-good spy parody
Currently seeking the significance of Brexit in every new film with a British biased view is already a tradition and it seems to apply to the reappearance of Johnny English’s play-comedy parody franchise – which began in 2003 with Johnny English and came back to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will the sarcasm of sarcasm about how clearly bad we are becoming a new export opportunity for this country?
Anyway, Johnny English, who was eye-catching, rubber-faced, and incompetent that had renewed his license to confuse all things for a second time - his name gave more clues than anything that he was a broad comic creation designed for a non-English-speaking cinema region.
Of course he was a crazy secret agent who, despite his strange presumption, had little Clouseau character, a secuil Mr Bean character and a handful of travelers who contributed little note to the theme of Chariots of Fire at the 2012 London Olympics opening ceremony.
In fact, he is based on the international traveler and mysterious man Atkinson once played in the now forgotten Barclaycard TV commercial, leaving the chaos behind him.
There are one or two sweet moments on your recent journey.
I liked it when Johnny English approached the helicopter wearing a medieval jersey and rotor blades quickly sticking to his helmet.
Atkinson's award for physical comedy was featured, but his humor felt less energetic and too strange, especially when "serious" film brands such as 007 and Mission Impossible had been confident to include comedy as material.
His humour felt like it was aimed at children rather than adults, and for me a variety of Johnny English's bizarre non-significant nonsense and a focus on Atkinson's movie jokes in Bean's personality.
The premise that has been hot these years is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker has entered a super-secret British spy web network, revealing the identities of all British agents on the field, to disappoint the task force - unfortunately only a small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last chance for a proud and hostile prime minister, who has already destroyed her total political popularity: Emma Thompson plays a very good role with the quasi-Teresa-May character but not much can be done from her script.
His intelligent advisors provide information that since every active spy has been weakened, he must bring one out of retirement.
And that means Johnny English himself, now employed as head of the school in some luxury buildings, but gives a secret lesson on how to perform covert operations: there are some good jokes here, when English offers an academy of spy like the School of Rock.
English was returned to Whitehall for an emergency and reunited with a long-suffering old friend, Bough, played by Ben Miller again.
Bough is now married, stripping a submarine commander, a nasty upper-class female role in which Vicki Pepperdine is somewhat eliminated.
So Batman and Robin make a mistake on His Majesty's Secret Agent back in action, meeting the mysterious beautiful woman Ophelia Bulletova played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister worryingly falls into the influence of a millionaire charismatic technology who claims to be able to solve the British computer problem: the evil Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their ridiculous adventures: disguised as a waiter, they burn a quick French restaurant; they make a mess by smuggling themselves onto Volta's luxury ship; and English sparks anarchy when he tries to use the Virtual Reality headset to get used to the interior of Volta's house.
All stops are certainly drawn to the final sequence, but with such hospitality and hiccups, there are few children’s TV channels that contain about it all.
It's a pretty moderate thing.
And like the other Johnny English films, I can’t help but think: can’t the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that’s really suited to his talent?
Labour denies being planning a plan for British citizens to be able to work four days a week but paid five days
Jeremy Corbyn of the Labor Union considered a radical plan that wanted British citizens to work four days a week – but was paid five days.
The union reportedly wants the company’s owners to continue the savings through an artificial intelligence (AI) revolution for workers by giving them an extra day off.
He would let employees enjoy a three-day weekend – but still get the same pay.
Some sources say that the idea will 'pass' the party's economic agenda and plans encourage the state to support the workers.
The shift to four days a week has been approved by the British Trade Congress as a way for workers to feel the benefits of economic change.
A source, a senior from the Labor Union, told The Sunday Times: 'A review of this policy is expected to be announced before the end of this year.
"This is not going to happen overnight, but four working days a week is an aspiration that fits the party's approach to rebalancing the economy that supports the workers as well as the party's industry strategy as a whole."
The Labour Party was not the first to support the idea, as the Green Party had already promised four working days a week in the 2017 general election campaign.
However, these aspirations are currently not supported by the entire Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "Four working days a week is not the party's policy and is not being considered by the party."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour conference to perfect his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from “anonymous directors” and “cowards” at the utility company.
This shadow chancellor's plan also means, the current shareholders in the drinking water company may not get their entire shares back because the government of the Labour party can do the 'reduction' on the grounds of perceived violations.
He also secured his plan to put workers on the company’s board and create an Inclusive Ownership Fund that would give 10 percent of the company’s equity in the private sector to employees, who would earn annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy told "60 Minutes" whether the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could change their views
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his candidacy in the Supreme Court for at least a week, and raised the question of whether the bureau's findings could affect Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview aired on Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Senators of the Republican Party, John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham, if the FBI could find anything that could make them change their minds.
Kennedy seems to be more open than his counterparts from South Carolina.
“I mean, of course,” Kennedy said.
"I said I would attend the trial, I said, I have spoken with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this incident, the accusation came up, and said, ‘You did it?’
He's a strong, determined, determined man."
However, it seems that Graham’s voice would not be changed.
"My thoughts have set a decision on Brett Kavanaugh, and it needs a bigger charge to change that," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what's going on, but what I do know is: Brett denies it harshly," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And all the people he mentioned his name couldn't verify it.
He's 36 years old.
I don't see any new changes."
What does the Global Citizen Festival mean and has the event done something to reduce poverty?
On Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event featuring a very impressive line-up of stars, and a mission that is also effective; ending poverty in the world.
Now, in the seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will witness tens of thousands of people flocking to the Great Lawn in Central Park not only to enjoy the action of Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the event’s true goal of ending extreme poverty in 20 years.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting poverty.
In order to get a free ticket for the event (unless you want to pay for a VIP ticket), concert visitors must complete a series of tasks or "actions" such as volunteering, sending emails to world leaders, calling, or other meaningful ways to help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful have Global Citizens over the past 12 years been in achieving their goals?
Is the idea of giving a gift in the form of a free concert the right way to get people to take an action, or is it just another case called “clickivism” – people feel like they’re making a real difference by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, prompting to set other goals.
It is said that this action has helped spur world leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion that will affect more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group had collected 390 commitments and announcements stemming from their actions, at least $10 billion of which had been channelled or fundraised.
The group estimates that safe funds so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and practitioners committed to "helping children grow to their full potential," vowing to give $35 million to Rwanda to help end the country's food shortages.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments, and Global Citizens like you, we can make social injustice about this lack of nutrition a milestone in history,” Tracey Ullman, the ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, told the crowd at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were taken to improve nutrition for mothers and children in the UK, the government announced funding for a project, Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children through nutrition.
Replying to one of the questions in the General Answers on their website asking "what makes you think we can end this extreme poverty?"
Global citizen replied: "It will be a long and difficult road - sometimes we will fall and fail.
However, just like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movement that existed before us, we will succeed, because if we unite we will become stronger.
Janet Jackson, Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are some of the stars featured on this year's show in New York, which will be led by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use the Navy as a "blockade" to curb Russian energy exports - Home Secretary
"If necessary" Washington could ask the Navy for help to prevent Russian energy from reaching the market, including in the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of State Ryan Zinke revealed, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke strongly suspects that Russia’s involvement in Syria – in particular, where it operates on legitimate government invitations – is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
“I’m sure the reason they’re in the Middle East is that they want to be an energy broker, just like they do in eastern Europe, southern Europe,” he said.
And, according to the official, there are ways and means to prevent it.
“The United States has that capability, with our Navy, to ensure open seaways, and, if necessary, to carry out a blockade, to ensure that their energy cannot enter the market,” he said.
Zinke spoke in front of the participants of the event held by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that called itself an "energy customer voice" in the US.
He compared Washington’s approach to the deal with Russia and Iran, seeing that in terms of effectiveness, they were the same.
"Economic choices in Iran and Russia are more or less, utilising and replacing fuel," he said, referring to Russia as one of the "experts in the field" with an economy that relies on fossil fuels.
The statement comes as Trump administration representatives are on a mission to increase their liquefied natural gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia, a much cheaper option for customers in Europe.
To that end, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the “unnecessary” Nord Stream 2 oil pipeline project, which, according to Trump, makes Berlin a “hostage” to Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 oil plant project, designed to double the capacity of the existing 110 billion cubic meters of oil pipeline, is purely an economic project.
The Kremlin denies that Washington’s fierce opposition to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I am convinced we have the same view that energy cannot be made a tool for exerting pressure and that customers should be able to choose their own suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
This U.S. attitude has drawn a reaction from Germany, which has reaffirmed their commitment to this project.
Germany’s leading industry organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has asked the US not to interfere in the European Union’s energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I will face a big problem if the third country mixes our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren Will "Observe the Situation" As She Candidates As President In 2020, Massachusetts Senator Says
On Saturday, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said that she would "observe the situation" while running for president after the part-time election.
While campaigning at the town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren asserted he would consider running.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our blatant government, including putting women in the top position," he told The Hill.
“After November 6th, I will observe the situation as I run for president.”
Warren compared himself to President Donald Trump while campaigning in the city hall, saying that he "brings this region in the wrong direction.
“I am very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” he said.
Warren blatantly expressed his criticism of Trump and prospective Supreme Court chief Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said "Of course we need an FBI investigation before conducting a vote."
However, a poll released on Thursday, showed that most of Warren’s own constituents did not want him running in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of "probable" voters in Massachusetts say it's best for senators not to run, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.
Thirty-two percent supported the nomination.
The poll showed more support for former Governor Deval Patrick to run, with 38 percent supporting the possibility of running and 48 percent opposing him.
Other important names in the Democratic Party discussed regarding the possibility of running in 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would formally decide on it in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin quotes PTSD Track Palin at the time of Donald Trump's campaign
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after entering the army in September.
He was arrested and charged in a domestic violence incident on Monday night.
“What my son experienced, what he will experience when he comes back, I can connect with other families who also feel the consequences of PTSD and some of the injuries our soldiers have experienced,” he said in front of attendees attending the campaign for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrests like "the elephant in the room" and told of his son and other war veterans, "they came back with a little different, they came back harder, they came back and wondered if there was any respect for what they had given, fellow soldiers and pilots and every other member of the military."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, coupled with reports of domestic violence and possession of weapons in a drunken state, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. support the challenge to a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support legal challenges to a new U.S. policy of refusing asylum for victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the district filed a friend-of-the-court brief on Friday in Washington to support asylum seekers challenging the policy, NBC News reported.
Full name of plaintiff Grace v. In the lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policies has yet to be disclosed.
He said his colleague "and his son who is a cruel gang member," had harassed him, but U.S. officials rejected his asylum request on July 20.
He was arrested in Texas.
State prosecutors who supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, which generated large numbers of asylum seekers for the U.S., as a country facing major problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy was backed by a 2014 Immigrant Appeals Board decision that allowed dark immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District Attorney Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "ignores state, federal, and international laws that have existed for decades."
"Federal law requires that all asylum claims must be decided on the basis of certain facts and circumstances relating to the claim, and such prohibitions violate the principles," the friend-of-the-court brief said.
Further prosecutions gave a brief opinion that policies that refused entry of immigrants were detrimental to the U.S. economy, saying that they would most likely become entrepreneurs and "supply the necessary labor."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions, in June ordered immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang cruelty.
"Failure is available to those who leave their home country due to persecution or fears caused by racial, religious, national, or membership issues in a social group, or certain political opinions," Sessions said in the policy announcement on June 11.
Suffering is not meant to alleviate all the problems -- although all the problems are serious -- that people face every day around the world.
A very sad rescue attempt in Palu because the victim doubled as he raced with time to find the survivor.
For the survivors, the situation is getting worse.
"It feels very tense," said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, reassuring her son who is in demand in a refugee center in the destroyed city of Palu.
“Every minute an ambulance comes with a body.
Clean water is very rare.”
Residents look back at their destroyed homes, take in the stuff that is submerged in water, trying to save anything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitalized, the damage caused by the 7.5-magnitude quake, was very chaotic.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a fractured spine and shoulder, lie outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients were treated outdoors due to a powerful follow-up earthquake.
His tears flowed as he recounted his feelings as the earthquake shook his five-storey hotel room where he stayed with his wife and daughter.
“There is no time to save yourself.
I think I'm stuck in the ruins of the wall," Haris told the Associated Press, adding his family was in the city to attend the wedding.
“I heard my wife crying for help, then shut up.
I don't know his condition and my son.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. ambassador accuses China of ‘intimidating’ with ‘propaganda ads’
A week after China's official newspaper contained a four-page advertisement in a U.S. daily calling for reciprocal gains in U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using U.S. press to spread propaganda.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to the China Daily paid supplement at the Des Moines Register - the state's best-selling newspaper - after accusing China of attempting to interfere in the U.S. congressional elections on Nov. 6, a charge disputed by China.
Trump's allegation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the U.S. election, which marked what the U.S. official told Reuters, is a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to pressure China.
Although it is common for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently hampered by an ever-increasing trade war, which causes them to raise the level of import tariffs on each other.
China's retaliatory tariffs at the start of the trade war were designed to hit exporters in states like Iowa that support the Trump Republican Party, Chinese and US experts said.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, the main exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had harmed workers, farmers, and businessmen in America.
China, Branstad wrote an opinion in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, "now double the intimidation by running propaganda ads on our own free media."
“In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government exploits the tradition of free speech and press freedom that is highly valued in America by loading paid advertisements in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, at the kiosks of street newspaper sales here, in Beijing, you will find restrictions on different voices and will not see the actual mirror on the different opinions that the Chinese people may have about the troubled Chinese economic trajectory," the media said in a statement.
He added that "one of the most prominent media in China rejects the offer to publish" his article, although he does not mention which newspaper.
Analysts Warn, Republicans Keep Women Voters Away Before Half-Time Elections With Kavanaugh Disaster
Because of the scarcity of important people in the Republican Party who stood and defended the prospective Supreme Court leader Brett Kavanaugh in the face of several allegations of sexual violence, analysts have warned that they will see a backlash, especially from women, in the upcoming midterm general election.
Emotions over the matter were very high, and most Republicans noted already indicated that they wanted to move forward on the vote.
That cannot be prevented," Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Maxwell School, Syracuse University told The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted Senator (R-Arizona) Jeff Flake's push at the last minute to conduct an FBI investigation would be enough to ease anger on voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow, nor will they forget it in November," Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior advisor and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn said on Friday, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, the protesters shouted "November is near!" as they staged a demonstration in the Senate aisle as the Republican Party controlled the Justice Committee to continue to advance in Kavanaugh's candidacy despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, Mic reported.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of democracy will come out of the list," non-party political analyst Stu Rothenberg, told the news site.
"People say it's high enough; and it's true.
But it could be even higher, especially among women voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18 to 29, who, because they don’t like the president, often don’t vote.”
Even before Ford's public testimony detailing the sexual harassment against him by the Supreme Court's presidential candidate, analysts advised there would be a follow-up backlash if the Republican Party kept pushing him forward with confirmation.
"This is a mess for the GOP," Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News earlier this week.
"It's not just about the committee election or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will be placed on the bench, it's also about how the Republican Party handles this issue and how they treat it," Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps to elect the Democratic Party, pointed to the news channel.
However, the Americans seem to be divided on who to trust after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with the choice a little more in favour of the latter.
A new YouGov poll showed that 41 percent of respondents actually believe or may believe in Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they actually believe or may believe in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they felt Kavanaugh might or indeed be lying during his testimony, while only 30 percent said similar things about Ford.
Following a push from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating charges filed by Ford as well as one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee that a drunken Kavanaugh had attacked him when he was 17 years old.
Ramirez said that the prospective Supreme Court leader showed him his audacity when they attended a party while they were attending college in Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web Inventor Plans to Start a New Internet to Face Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launched a startup that seeks to compete with Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
The latest project of this technology legend, Inrupt, is a company built from the open source platform Berners-Lee, Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who is allowed to have access to any information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, while joking Berners-Lee said that the meaning behind Inrupt was "world domination."
“We have to start now,” he said of the startup.
“This is a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid technology that allows people to create their own "personal online data storage" or POD.
This storage can contain contact lists, task lists, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and professional tools.
Like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify that are all available in one browser and all at the same time.
The uniqueness of this online storage of personal data is that it really depends on the user who can access what type of information.
The company is known as "personal empowerment through data."
The idea to set up Inrupt, according to company CEO John Bruce, is for the company to bring the right resources, processes, and skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several staff developers contracted to work on the project, and a community of volunteer code-makers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team did not speak with "Facebook and Google about whether or not it would introduce a total change in which all of their business models would actually be reversed overnight.
“We didn’t ask for their permission.”
In a post in Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "the Inrupt mission is to provide energy and commercial ecosystems to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built over Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has become an influential voice in network debate neutrality.
Even at the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the Founder and Director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m very optimistic about the next web era,” Berners-Lee added.

The only Church clergyman in England to win Victoria Cross during the First World War as a fighter, is commemorated on his birthplace 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel The Reverend, Bernard Vann won the award on September 29, 1918 for attacks at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, four days later he was killed by a sniper and never knew that he had won the highest British military honor.
A memorial stone was inaugurated by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was a "symbol of intelligence" that would reveal exactly 100 years of his grandfather's achievements to win the award.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "penetrating a very thick fog under a string of fire from field weapons and machines."
Then he rushed forward to the line of battle and with "greatest courage" led the front line before rushing to use field weapons alone and disabling three detachments.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something I knew I wouldn't be able to live but it was a very humble act."
He and his brother Dr James Vann also put a flower pot after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he "feels very pleased to be involved in this parade" and added "the courage of a true hero is being shown with the support that will be given by many people."
MMA fans spend the night watching the Bellator 206, but they even get Peppa Pig
Imagine this, you’ve been spending the night watching the crowded Bellator 206 just to be refused to watch the main show.
The bill from San Jose contains 13 fights, including six on the main card and is being aired live throughout the night in England on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for a confrontation, the audience in England was made stunned when its cover turned into Peppa Pig.
Some people feel unappreciated after they feast until an early special day for the fight.
A fan on Twitter described the switch to children's cartoons as an "irritating joke."
"It is a government regulation, that at 6 a.m. the content was not suitable for broadcasting, so it was replaced by a children's program," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa is a pig," he said.
Bellator company president Scott Coker said that they would improve their scheduling by taking into account audiences in the UK in the future.
“In my opinion, if we think about replaying, I think we might be able to finish it,” Coker said.
“But right now there is six o’clock on Sunday and we won’t be able to fix it until Sunday of our time, Monday of their time.
But we're trying to do it.
Trust me, at the time of change, many texts were back and forth and everything was uneducated.
We're trying to fix it, we think it's just a technical mistake.
No, it's a government issue.
Trust me, next time it won’t happen again.
We will reduce to just five fights from six fights – as we usually do – and we will try to avoid excessive exposure for fans, and we have succeeded.
This is an unfavourable situation."
Previous articleDesert Island Discs: Tom Daley Feels ‘Self-Deficit’ Related to Sexuality Problems
Olympic diver Tom Daley said he grew up with low self-esteem because of his sexuality problems – but that gave him motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize it until he entered high school, that "not everyone is like me."
Speaking for the first time on Radio 4 Desert Island Discs hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said, he spoke of gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He also said being a parent made him not so concerned about winning the Olympics.
The usual host of this long-running show, Kirsty Young, is taking a few months off due to illness.
Appearing as the excluded on Laverne's first program, Daley said he felt "less than" all the other people who grew up with him because "it's not socially acceptable to like men and women."
He said: "To this day, that feeling is less than that of others, and different feelings, has become the real things that give me the power and the power to succeed."
She wanted to prove that she was “something,” she said, so she wouldn’t disappoint everyone as they learned about her sexuality issue.
The Olympic bronze medalist has been a prominent LGBT campaigner and used his performance at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to attract more countries to avoid discrimination against homosexuals.
He said he spoke because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without consequences and wanted to give “hope” to others.
The three-time world champion said he fell in love with a man - filmmaker from the U.S. Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "astonishes me."
Daley was married to an Oscar midfielder who was 20 years older than him last year, and said the age gap was not a problem.
"When you're having so many problems at a very young age" - he attended his first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was very difficult to find someone of the same age who experienced the same tide.
The couple had become parents in June, with a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said "his entire perspective" had changed.
"If you asked me last year, it was all about 'I had to win a gold medal'," he said.
“You know, there’s more to it than just winning the Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son had the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father could not accept that he would die, and one of the last things he asked was if they already got tickets to the 2012 London Olympics - because he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I can't say to him 'You're not going to sit in my dad's front row,'" he said.
“I held his hand as he stopped breathing and still didn’t really stop breathing until he died, eventually I admitted that he wasn’t defeated,” he said.
The following year Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze.
"All I know is, this is what I've dreamed of all my life - to dive in front of a crowd of people at the Olympics, there's no better feeling than that," he said.
It also inspired her first song choice - Proud by Heather Small - which had already merged with her in her preparations for the Olympics and still made her whimper.
Desert Island Discs is a BBC Radio 4 broadcast on Sunday at 11.15 BST.
Mickelson switched roles when proposed at Ryder Cup on Saturday
American golfer Phil Mickelson will record a record on Sunday as he plays the 47th Ryder Cup, but he must switch roles to avoid unpleasant achievements.
Mickelson, who played in a two-year event to record his 12th record, was proposed by captain Jim Furyk for a four-ball and four-group game on Saturday.
Instead of being in the middle of the action, as he usually does for the United States, the top five winner this time divides his time between being cheerleader and doing his game on that range, in the hope of being able to fix what has bothered him.
Never being the straightest golfer despite being at the top of his career, this 48-year-old man is not fit to take a very strict course at Le Golf National, which routinely gives long and harsh penalties for any wrong shots.
And for his own field, it wasn’t scary enough for Mickelson, in the ninth game on Sunday, to face highly accurate Open England champion Francesco Molinari, who has teamed up with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all of their four games this week.
If this American golfer, starting 12 single games with four points below, starting with a hot start, then the Mickelson game will prove to be very important.
Furyk expressed confidence in this man, not because he could say many other things.
"He really understood his role today, hugged me and hugged me, and said he would be ready for tomorrow's game," Furyk said.
"He's so confident.
He is the Hall of Famer and he gave so much to this team in the past, and this week.
Maybe I can't imagine him playing two games.
I imagined the others, but that’s the way it plays and that’s the way we think we should go.
He wants to enjoy a different atmosphere, just like most people do."
Mickelson will pass Nick Faldo's record for the most played Ryder Cup game, on Sunday.
This could mark the end of his career in the Ryder Cup that would never equal his individual record height.
Mickelson scored 18 wins, 20 losses and seven series, although Furyk said his presence brought some unthinkables to the team.
"He's funny, he's sharp, he's funny, he likes to make fun of people, and he's a cool guy in the team room," he explained.
"I think the younger player is having fun with him, this week too, which is pretty fun to see.
He gives a lot of things, more than just playing."
European captain Thomas Bjorn knew the great advantage could soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, captain of Europe, learned from experience that someone who led big enough to his last single game in the Ryder Cup could easily be an unpleasant journey.
Dane made his first debut at the 1997 match at Valderrama, with team captain Seve Ballesteros holding a five-point lead over America, but just touching the finish line with their noses with the thinnest margin, winning 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we get a big lead at Valderrama; we get a big lead at Brookline, where we lose, and at Valderrama, where we win, but just now," said Bjorn, taking pictures, after watching the Class of 2018, winning 5-3 both on Friday and yesterday by leading 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So, history will show me and everyone on the team that this is not over.
Tomorrow you’ll be entering a really boring game.
Go out and do all the right things.
It’s not over until you get points on the dashboard.
We have a goal, and the goal is to win this trophy, and that's the focus.
I’ve been saying for a long time, I’m focused on 12 players on our side, but we’re also very aware of what’s on the other side – the greatest players in the world.”
Glad to see the players playing on a tough golf course, Bjorn added: "In this case I will never progress on my own.
Tomorrow is a different star.
Tomorrow, individual players will progress, and this is a different thing to do.
It’s great to be out there with a colleague when everything goes well, but if you’re out there playing individually, then your abilities as a golfer will be fully tested.
That’s the message you have to convey to all the players, taking out the best of yourself for tomorrow’s game.
Now, you leave your partner and he has to go to get the best out of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent Jim Furyk would ask his players to play better individually than they did as a pair, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Furyk himself had been at both ends of the turn of the last day of the big game, having been part of the winning team at Brookline before ending with a defeat as Europe performed "The Miracle in Medinah."
“I remember every word of it,” he said, answering the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, brought his players together for the final day.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you want to start as fast as you see in Brookline, as you see in Medinah.
When the momentum goes one way, it will put a lot of pressure on the middle game.
We also set up a list of players and put people in a variety of ways that we think, you know, we're trying to do wonders tomorrow."
Thomas has been tasked with trying to lead the match against Rory McIlroy in the top match, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Poulter, other European players being at the top.
"I went with a group of these people in this order because I felt I could shut down all the roads," Bjorn said of his sole choice.
Germany's new warships were suspended.
The German Navy's newest guard ship was supposed to have begun service in 2014 to replace the old Cold War-era warship, but the ship would not be there until at least next year due to the incorrect system and rising costs, local media reported.
The assignment of "Rheinland-Pfalz," the main ship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class cruiser, has now been suspended until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which quoted a military spokesman.
The ship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but post-shipment problems have disrupted the fate of this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships already ordered by the Navy in 2007 will come in place of the old Bremen-class guard ship.
The ship will be equipped with powerful cannons, a series of anti-aircraft missiles, and anti-ship missiles, as well as some stealth technologies, such as radar wipers, infrared, and acoustic locks.
Other important features include a longer maintenance period - it should be possible to use the latest guard ship for two years away from its original port.
However, the continued delay meant this sophisticated warship - which was said to allow Germany to highlight its forces abroad - would be outdated by the time it began entering its duty period, Die Zeit noted.
The unfortunate F125 patrol ship had become the news last year, when the German Navy officially refused to assign the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has returned the ship to the shipmaker after delivery.
Few reasons are known behind the return of the ship, but German media cited a number of important "software and hardware defects" that made the warship useless if used for combat missions.
Software deficiencies are crucial because the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ship will be operated by a crew of 120 sailors - only half of the workforce on the older Bremen-class warship.
The knowledge also that the weight of the ship was very excessive would reduce its performance and limit the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
The "Rheinland-Pfalz" weighing 7,000 tons is believed to be twice as heavy as ships of a similar class used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to the damaged hardware, the cost of production of the entire project – including ship crew training – is also a problem.
It is said to rise surprisingly to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) - up from the initial <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problem that plagued the last guard ship became very important given the latest warnings due to a reduction in German naval forces.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German parliament's defense committee acknowledged that the Navy was actually "a ship with the ability to disperse."
The official said as the problem grew, as the old ships were no longer in use but no replacement ships had been provided.
He regretted that not a single Baden-Wuerttemberg-class patrol ship could join the Navy.
The National Trust listens to the secret life of bats in silence
New research was conducted on a plantation in the Scottish Highlands that aims to reveal how bats use the wild rays in their food hunts.
These findings are expected to shed new light on this unique flying mammal’s behavior and help guide conservation activities in the future.
The study, conducted by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland, will follow common pipistrelle and sopranos as well as long-eared brown bats and Daubenton at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
A special recorder will be placed at the main location around the property to track bat activity throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
The voice expert who analyzes all the recordings will make sure the frequency of the call of the bats and which species does what activity.
Then maps and habitat reports will be created to create images with scales of nature in detail about their behavior.
Rob Dewar, conservation advisor to NTS, hopes this results will reveal which habitat areas are most important for bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help determine what benefits are gained from habitat management work such as grassland production and the best way to preserve forests for bats and other related species.
The population of bats in Scotland and throughout England has declined sharply in recent centuries.
This whale is threatened with the presence of development and development work that affects the nest and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting also pose risks, such as sticky paper suspended to tighten bats as well as chemical treatment of building materials, as well as attacks from pet cats.
In fact, bats aren't blind.
However, due to his habit of hunting at night, his ears are more useful than his eyes in terms of catching the victim.
They use sophisticated gem location techniques to locate insects accurately and barriers on their flight paths.
NTS, which is responsible for handling more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important parks, and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, cares deeply for bats.
It has ten trained experts, who routinely conduct surveys, nest inspections, and sometimes rescue efforts.
The organization has also established the first and only nature reserve in Scotland at the Thrave plantations in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of the ten species of bats in Scotland.
Plantation manager David Thompson said the plantation was an area suitable for bats.
“Here at Thrave, we have a nice area for bats,” he said.
“We have old buildings, lots of old trees, and all the good habitats.
However, there’s still a lot we don’t know about bats, so the work we do here and on other properties will help us understand more and more about what they need to thrive.”
He emphasized the importance of a bat inspection before carrying out maintenance within the property, as without realizing there is a possibility of the destruction of one maternal nest could kill up to 400 female and still small bats, which would likely destroy the entire local population.
Protecting and killing, harassment, or harassment, or destroying its nest is an illegal act.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish official for the Kelawar Conservation Trust, has urged the public to help.
He said: "We still have to learn a lot about our bats and for many of our species that we don't yet know how their populations are going to be."
Ronaldo who rejects rape claims is preparing lawyers to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape claim on him "fake news," and said that people "want to promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyer would sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The Portuguese and Juventus attackers were accused of raping an American woman, named Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He then allegedly paid him by giving $375,000 to keep his mouth shut about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Speaking in an Instagram Live video to 142 million followers hours after the claim was reported, Ronaldo, 33, denounced the report as "fake news."
"No, no, no, no.
What they say today is fake news," Ballon d'Or winner five times said it to the camera.
“They want to promote themselves by using my name.
That's normal.
They wanted to be famous for naming my name, but it was part of the job.
I’m a happy man and everything is fine,” the player added while smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the charges, which they call an "unacceptable report of suspicion in the area of privacy," according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said it would seek compensation as "in exchange for moral damages in amounts appropriate to the severity of the violation, which may be one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years."
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 in a suite room at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga were reported back to the player's room, where he was allegedly raped, according to a report filed in the Clark County Courthouse in Nevada.
Mayorga said Ronaldo kneeled after the alleged incident and told him that "99 percent" he was a "good man" who was disappointingly "only one percent."
The documents say that Ronaldo justified that the two had sex, but it was on the basis of a shared desire.
Mayorga also said he went to the police station and had made a visa for his injuries at the hospital, but later agreed to resolve the issue outside of court because he felt "fearful of getting retaliation" and worried "would be humiliated in public."
The 34-year-old woman said she was now trying to cancel the peace settlement because she was constantly traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo almost joined Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the attack, and this summer he moved to Italian giant club Juve with a deal of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million.
Brexit: Britain 'will regret forever' the loss of car makers
Britain "will regret forever" if it loses its status as a world leader as a carmaker after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added "about" Toyota, the UK has told the BBC that if the UK leaves the European Union without a deal, it will temporarily stop production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
“We need a deal,” Mr. Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of border delays if there were no deal, would be detrimental to Brexit in terms of labor costs.
The factory in Burnaston – which makes the Auris and Avensis production of Toyota – produced nearly 150,000 cars last year that 90% exported to the entire European Union.
"What I think is that if the UK leaves the European Union at the end of March, we will see production stops at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's executive director at Burnaston.
Other UK automakers have expressed their concerns about leaving the European Union without an agreement on how cross-border trade will go, including Honda, BMW, and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, said it would close the Mini factory in Oxford a few months after Brexit.
The main problem associated with what the car makers say is the risk of the supply chain if there is no deal with Brexit.
Toyota's production line is run on a "timely" production principle, with parts coming in every 37 minutes both from suppliers in the UK and the European Union for custom-made cars.
If the UK leaves the European Union without a deal on March 29, there could be a disruption at the border, which the industry says could lead to delays and a lack of spare parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep supplies for more than a day at its plant in Derbyshire, the company's representative said, and thus production would be stopped.
Clark said Chequers Theresa May's plan for future relations with the European Union was "properly calibrated to avoid border checks."
"We have to have a deal. We want to get the best deal that will also allow what I'm saying not only to enjoy success at the moment, but for us to get this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today program.
“The evidence is not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers, that we really have to be able to continue what has already been a very well-run supply chain.”
Toyota cannot say how long its production will be halted, but which is clear in the long run, warning that the cost increase will reduce the factory’s competitiveness and will ultimately be detrimental in terms of labor costs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the manager of the Unite workers' union at the factory, said its members are already increasingly concerned: "In my experience, once this job is done, it will never come back.
A government spokesman said: "We have put forward a proper and sensible plan for our relations with the European Union in the future."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed, White House says
Donald Trump's high-risk meeting with deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein could be "delayed back in a week" as the fight for senior court leader Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the general election, relations between Trump and Russia's aides, as well as potential obstacles to justice by the president.
Whether or not Trump will fire a deputy attorney general, who will jeopardize Mueller's freedom, has sparked rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing using a telegram to record conversations with Trump and likely to oust the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, amid reports that he would resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the UN office in New York, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said he would "choose not" to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was again postponed to avoid clashes with the Senate Judiciary Committee where Kavanaugh and one of the women who had accused him of sexual abuse, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, both would testify.
On Friday, Trump ordered an FBI investigation for a week over claims against Kavanaugh, which subsequently delayed a full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "The date for the meeting has not yet been set, so maybe this week, I can see that resigning it to another good week also given the other things that happened in the Supreme Court.
But we're just looking at it and I've always wanted to give the news to the press."
Several journalists would oppose the statement: Sanders has not held a press conference at the White House since September 10.
Show host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the rare encounter was not because of the dislike of TV journalists "who were trying to attract attention," though, he said: "I disagree with the fact that they were trying to attract attention."
He then proposed that direct contact between Trump and the press be increased.
"The president did more direct-response questions than the previous president," he added, without mentioning any evidence: "We've seen those numbers."
The meeting will still take place, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask questions to the president of the United States directly, it is much better than talking to me.
We try to do it more often and you have seen us do it a lot in the last few weeks and it will replace the press conference when you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump routinely asks questions when leaving the White House or participating in an open session or press conference with visiting senior officials.
A solo press conference is rarely held.
This week in New York, the president will probably show his reasons, making a free and sometimes strange appearance before the journalists gather.
Health Secretary Writes Letter to EU Workers at Scottish NHS on Concerns over Brexit Issues
The Health Secretary has written a letter to EU staff working at the Scottish NHS to express their gratitude to the country and hope they will still remain working here after the Brexit issue.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter in less than six months until Britain withdrew from the European Union.
The Scottish government has committed to meet the cost of filing a permanent status for EU citizens who work in a relocated public service.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the European Union on this withdrawal are still ongoing, approaching the expected decision this fall.
But the British government has also been prepared for a possible scenario of no deal.
I know this must be very disturbing for all of you.
That’s why I now want to reaffirm how much I appreciate the contributions of each member of staff, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the European Union, and others, bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and enhance health care work, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is truly your home and we very much want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after suffering a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers back quarterback Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury on a 31-27 loss from Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, Mike Organ of Tennesse reported.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred shortly before the end of the round.
"He came to the edge of the field and fell faint there," Reed said.
The coach and medical staff gave the oxygen to Abercrombie on the edge of the field before putting it on the stove and bringing it for further evaluation.
An official from the State of Tennessee told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had already left the operating room at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there has been no details on the type/level of injury suffered" and the State of Tennessee is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, this red-shirted second-grader, was in his first season with the State of Tennessee after being transferred from Illinois.
He earned a total of five tekels on Saturday before coming out of the game, which made his total tekels during this season to 18 tekels.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher mattress cost when buying property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher mattress fee when they buy property in the UK, along with additional money that will be used to help the homeless according to the new Tory plan.
This move will hold back the pace of Corbyn's movement's success in attracting young voters
This tax increase will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Department of Finance expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher matriarchal duties as they buy property in the UK - along with additional money that will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce it today.
The move will be seen as an attempt to withstand the pace of success of Jeremy Corbyn’s efforts to attract young voters with the promise of providing more affordable housing and targeting high incomes.
An increase in matriarchal costs will be imposed on individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK, along with additional money that encourages the government’s efforts to combat the slums.
The additional cost – which is an additional cost on the current mattress cost, including the higher level introduced two years ago on the purchase of a second home and the purchase of a house for rent – could reach three percent.
The Finance Department expects this move to rise to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year.
An estimated 13 percent of newly built properties in London were bought by non-English residents, which led to price increases and made it increasingly difficult for first-time buyers to step foot on housing ladders.
Many of the rich areas in the country – usually in the capital – have become “ghost cities” due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy came out just a week after Boris Johnson called for cuts in mattress costs to help more young people own their first home.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining high property prices by buying land but not using it, and urged Mrs May to ignore quotas for affordable homes to fix "residential housing" in the UK.
Corbyn has announced a series of reforms in the housing sector that are interesting, including rent supervision and ending the expulsion "without guilt".
He also wanted to give greater power to the council to build new houses.
May said: "Last year I promised I would dedicate the post of prime minister to restoring the dream of England - that life should be better for every generation.
And that means fixing our shabby housing market.
England will always be open to those who want to live, work, and build life here.
However, it is not the right thing for individuals who do not live in the UK, as well as companies based abroad, to buy a house as easily as a British resident who has already worked hard.
For many people the dream of having a home becomes something very distant, and the unkind treatment against on the sidelines remains real."
Jack Ross: 'My main ambition is to lead Scotland'
Sunderland boss Jack Ross said his "main ambition" was to be Scotland's manager at several stages.
This 42-year-old Scottish player, enjoying the challenge of reviving the North-East club, which currently ranks third in the League One, diverging three points from the top position.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
"I want to defend my country as a player.
I got a B hat and that's him," Ross told Sportsound, BBC Scotland.
"But I'm big and often watch the Scottish team in Hampden with my father as a child, and it's always been something that attracted me to coming back.
However, that opportunity will come, if I succeed in team management."
Managers of Sunderland before Ross included Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic boss said he did not feel anxious to follow in the footsteps of big names at the club as large as that, having previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"For me, the current success will be measured by 'can I return this club to the Premier League?'
Because of the structure and facilities that exist in this club, there is no doubt about being in the Premier League," he said.
“It’s not an easy task to be there, but I would probably just see myself as a successful person here, if I could bring the club back there.”
Ross's career in team management was just three years, after some time as an assistant boss at Dumbarton, and spent 15 months as a coaching staff at Hearts.
Then he helped Alloa recover from the degradation to third place, and turned St Mirren from the degradation gap into a Championship title winner the following season.
And Ross said he now feels more comfortable than he ever did during his playing careers at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren, and Hamilton Academic.
"This may be the crossroads I have to cross," he recalls as he took over Alloa.
"I'm really sure management is the right thing for me, more than playing.
It sounds weird because I’m fine, I’m making a living in a reasonable way, and I’m enjoying some reasonable things.
But playing can be difficult.
There are a lot of things you have to go through every week.
I still experience it in terms of work pressure, but in management it feels fine.
I’ve always wanted to lead something and now I’m doing it, the most comfortable feeling I’ve ever felt in my adult life.”

The survey found that the right time to drink beer was at 5.30 p.m. on Saturday.
The summer heatwaves have boosted earnings of pubs in Britain that are struggling to survive, but put more pressure on the restaurant network.
The figures show that groups of pubs and bars saw sales increase by 2.7 percent in July - but restaurant revenues fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, CGA's business consultant, who compiled the figures, said: "The sun is shining and the UK's participation in the World Cup is longer than expected to mean, July will follow the same pattern as the previous June, where pub revenues increased by 2.8 percent, except for restaurants that received booze.
The 1.8 percent decline in restaurant trade in June will worsen in July.
The sales of pubs and bars that sell beverages so far are the strongest compared to those that happen at down restaurants.
Pubs that sell food also suffer from the heat of the sun, though not separate restaurant operators.
Looks like people just go out for a drink.
Sales across managed pubs and bars that sell beverages rose 6.6 percent for this month, with those selling food down three percent."
Paul Newman, RSM recreation and hospitality analyst, said: "This result continues the trend we have seen since April.
The weather and the impact of major social events or sports remain the biggest factor concerning the sale of the market outside the home.
It is not surprising that the restaurant group continues to struggle to survive, although a 4.8 percent drop in sales year-on-year would be very painful over the ongoing cost pressure.
The long summer should not come at a time when operators selling food are having bad times, and time will tell if the good enough temperatures we already enjoy in August will give you the little break you need."
Total sales growth across pubs and restaurants, including the newly opened, was 2.7 percent in July, showing a slowdown on the brand's launch.

One in Five Kids Have Secret Social Media Accounts They Hide From Their Parents
The survey reveals that one in five children — some of whom are still 11 years old — have secret social media accounts they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students reveals the development of the page "Fake Insta"
This news has raised concerns about the posting of sexual content
Twenty percent of students say they have "primary" accounts to show to parents
One in five children — some of whom are still 11 years old — create social media accounts that they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed the rapid development of a "fake Instagram" account - a reference to a photo-sharing site on Instagram.
The news has raised concerns about the posting of sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they operated a "primary" account that had been cleaned up to be shown to parents, while also having a personal account.
A mother who discovered her 13-year-old daughter's secret site, found a teenager who asked others for "my rape."
Research conducted by the UK Digital Awareness and the Men's Head School Conference as well as the Women's Head School (HMC) of independent schools, found 40 percent of 11 to 18-year-olds have two profiles, with half of them claiming to hold a private account.
HMC head Mike Buchanan said: "This is disturbing so many teenagers who are trying to create an online space that their parents and teachers cannot find."
Eilidh Doyle will be "voice for athletes" at Scottish Athletics Council
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Scottish Athletic Council as the non-executive director at the general annual meeting of the board of directors.
Doyle is the Scottish track and field athlete with the most honours and chairman Ian Beattie describes this move as a great opportunity for those who lead the sport to benefit from his diverse experience at the international level over the past few decades.
"Eilidh is highly respected across Scotland, the UK, and the world's athletic community and we are confident that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly by bringing him into the board," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I act as a voice for the athletes and I hope I can really contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland."
The American athletic athlete, who won the 200m and 400m run at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta among a total of four Olympic gold medals and is now a BBC expert, is now unable to walk after suffering an ischemic attack for a moment.
He wrote on Twitter: "Today I suffered a stroke a month ago.
I can't walk.
The doctor said only time could determine if I could recover and to what extent his recovery.
It’s a very laborious job to fully recover, learn back how to walk, and do aptitude training today!
Thank you for the messages that gave me the spirit!”
Breast pump ads that compare mother to cows have divided opinion in the online world
Breast pump companies have divided opinion in the online world with an advertisement that compares breastfeeding mothers with cows being fertilized.
To mark the launch of a product that is said to be the world's first "silent wearable breast pump," consumer technology company Elvie released an ad inspired by a joke music video to show the freedom this new pump gave to express a mother.
Four moms dancing on a slum containing cow's straw followed a song that included lyrics like this: "Yes, I crawl myself, but you don't see a tail" and "If you don't notice this isn't a cradle, this is my breasts."
Continued with the refrain: "Pump out, pump out, I feed them sweet, pump out, pump out, I squeeze my woman's milk."
However, the ads that have been published on the company’s Facebook page, have sparked online controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received diverse reactions from viewers, with many saying this makes the dairy industry "horrible".
"It's a very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Just like us, cows must also be pregnant and give birth to produce milk, unless their baby is stolen from them within a few days after giving birth.
Elvie breast pump very fit inside breastfeeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment: "Trauma that can be understood both for mother and baby.
But why not use it to advertise a breast pump for the mother who has to take care of her baby?"
Others added: "An ad that has lost its meaning."
Others defended the ad, with a woman admitting that she found the song "funny."
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
I'll buy it if I'm still breastfeeding.
It makes me feel like a cow.
It's a little crazy, but I've got it.
It's a brilliant product," someone wrote.
Others commented: "This is a fun advertisement aimed at raping mothers (often at their workplace or toilet) and who feel like "cow."
This is not an advertisement that praises or judges the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women revealed that they all felt dancing with a hidden pump that slipped inside their bras.
The basic concept of this campaign comes from the insights of many women who squeeze ASI who say they feel like cows.
However, Elvie Pump is completely silent, without cables or tubes and fits inside breastfeeding bras, which gives women the freedom to move around, carry their babies, and even go out while squeezing.
Ana Balarin, a partner and ECD at Mother commented: "The Elvie pump is a pioneering product that deserves to be launched convincingly and provocatively.
By equating the picture between expressing women and cows we want to pump the ASI and all its challenges, as well as showing it through a way of entertaining and entertaining with the full freedom presented by the new pump.
This isn't the first time Elvie's pump has become mainstream news.
At London Fashion Week, a mother with two children performed at the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski using this product.
Hundreds of migrant children move silently to tents on the Texas border
The number of migrant children detained is increasing even though monthly border crossings remain unchanged, partly as a result of harsh statements and policies introduced by the Trump administration that complicate childcare with sponsors.
Basically, most sponsors themselves are immigrants without documents, and are afraid to jeopardize their own ability to stay in the country by stepping forward to save the children.
The risk increased in June, when the federal government announced that prospective sponsors and other adult members of their households should hand over their fingerprints, and the data would be shared with the immigration government.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official in the field of Immigration and Customs, testified before Congress that the institution had arrested dozens of people who applied to sponsor underage children.
The agency then ensured that 70 percent of those arrested had no criminal record.
"Nearly 80 percent of people who are sponsors or members of sponsor groups are in the country illegally, and most of them are evil foreigners.
That’s why we continue to hunt these people,” Mr. Albence said.
Aiming to process children more quickly, officials introduced new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within a month of being detained, not after 60 days, which became the previous standard, the shelter workers said.
Most of them perform through video conference calls, not directly, to apply for their legal status cases to immigration judges.
Those who are not eligible for help will be deported.
The longer children are detained, the more likely they are to become more anxious or depressed, resulting in increased violence or an attempt to escape, addressing shelter workers and receiving system reports in recent months.
Lawyers said the concern increased in larger facilities such as Tornillo, whose signs were in a struggling child tended to be ignored, due to its size.
They argue that moving children to a camp town without giving them enough time to prepare for them emotionally or saying goodbye to his friends can exacerbate the trauma that has already been fought.
Syria calls on US, France and Turkey to resign immediately
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also asked Syrian refugees to return home, even though the country's war has now entered its eighth year.
Moualem, who also served as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces occupied Syrian territory illegally, on grounds of fighting terrorism, and "will be dealt with properly."
"They have to step down as soon as possible and without submitting any conditions," he told the assembly.
Moualem asserted that the "war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011, with more than million people fleeing their homes.
He asserted that Damascus will continue to "fight this holy battle until we clear all Syrian territories" of terror groups and "the presence of illegal foreign soldiers."
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, specifically training and influencing Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the territory of war-torn countries.
Regarding the refugee issue, Moualem insisted it was best for them to return soon, and he blamed "some western countries" for "spreading extraordinary fears" that prompted refugees to move further away.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate this return," he said.
“They are politicizing what should be a fully humanitarian issue.”
The European Union and the United States have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid for Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats say the latest agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone at the Idlib rebel stronghold has resulted in an opportunity to continue political talks.
The deal between Russia and Turkey prevented massive attacks by Russian-backed Syrian forces in the province, where three million people live.
But Moualem asserted that the deal had a "clear deadline" and raised hopes that military action would target the guerrillas including fighters from the Nusra Front linked to Al-Qaeda, which "will be over."
U.N. envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to quickly hold the first meeting of a new committee consisting of the government and members of the opposition to make a post-war Act for Syria and pave the way for general elections.
Moualem highlighted the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, insisting that the panel's work should be limited "to review the articles of the latest Act," and warned against interference.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Period
According to the logic, Trump will win another general election in 2020 unless, as many liberal viewers hope, prosecutions and scandals end his presidency early.
No doubt, "The end of the most dramatic presidency ever!"
So far, there are no signs of fatigue for the audience.
Since 2014, CNN's top watch ranking has more than doubled to 1.05 million and MSNBC nearly tripled to 1.6 million.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has peaked at the top of the cable TV rankings with 3.5 million viewers on the main news night.
"It's a spirit that gets people interested in because it's something they don't understand yet," said Neal Baer, host of ABC's play "Designated Survivor," about the cabinet secretary who became president after the attack that destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a senior comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And Some Truths Difficultly Slip into the Hollywood Boys" Club," has another theory.
He recalled riding a taxi in Boston before the 2016 general election.
The driver said he would give his vote to Trump.
Why? he asked.
"She said, 'Because she made me laugh,'" Miss Scovell said to me.
There's a sense of entertainment in a mess.
Certainly, unlike any other TV show, Washington’s emerging storyline could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families could reunite and restore the global economy.
In contrast, a luxury that can only be felt by the most special audience.
In fact, not only did Trump become a knowledgeable citizen at six o'clock you found yourself witnessing a panel of experts debating the use of the "background" source Bob Woodward for his book titled "Fear," wearing a camel's bomber jacket on Paul Manafort's post-myth of Paul Manafort's camel-skin.
This time, I will never see Super Mario the same way again.
“Part of the policy he’s made makes it the same as a reality show that entertains you every night,” said Brent Montgomery, chief executive officer of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of “Pawn Stars,” about Trump’s show scenes and daily storylines.

Lots of money from the outside floods the competition of the most stringent part-time election in the White House
It was only natural for Pennsylvania 17 to earn a flood of money, thanks to the re-arranged congressional districts that sidelined the two plaintiffs in the same seat dispute.
The Pittsburgh district was recently reorganized, filing Conor Lamb of the Democratic Rep. - who won seats in other districts through a special election last spring.
Lamb advanced against another rival, the Keith Rothfus Republic, which now represents the old Pennsylvania 12th district, which overlaps with the new Pennsylvania 17th district.
These maps were rearranged after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January ruled that the old districts were unconstitutionally biased on the Republican party.
Competition in the new Pennsylvania 17 district has resulted in large campaign funds between the big party's financial side, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became increasingly well-known in Pennsylvania after a thin victory in a general-monitored March special election for Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.
The seat has been occupied by Republican officials for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Politicians are sending the Democratic party a little bit superior.
U.S. Considers Punishing El Salvador for Supporting China, Then Resigns
The diplomats ensured that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little pressure from Washington.
President Trump held a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and booked a hotel in Panama until partners expelled the Trump Organization management team.
State Department officials decided to withdraw the head of the American diplomatic mission from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over "the latest decision that no longer recognizes Taiwan," Heather Nauert, a department spokeswoman, said in a statement earlier this month.
But the punishment is only considered against El Salvador, which has received about $140 million in aid from the United States in 2017, including for drug control, development support and the economy.
The proposed sanctions, which include cuts in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, will hurt the Central American country and the rise in unemployment and murder rates.
As the internal meeting took place, North and Central American officials delayed a high-level conference focused on economic security and prosperity to follow up on the same meeting last year that was seen as a step forward in preventing migrants from entering the United States.
But in mid-September, high-ranking government officials confirmed that they wanted the conference to continue, in order to effectively end punishment considerations for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is currently scheduled to deliver a speech at the conference, currently scheduled for mid-October, as an import signal made by the government at the meeting, diplomats said.
And the three American envoys quietly returned again to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without bringing a new rebuke or harsh punishment from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate displayed by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal considerations of the unclear situation.
Their statement was reinforced by external analysts close to the government and also spoke about this unclear situation.
The Story of Study
Another surprising story is Robert Mueller's special counsel's report on the possible impediment of Mr Trump's justice, which currently has very important evidence in public records.
Mueller’s report also discussed his investigation into whether Trump’s campaign collided with Russia in attacking our general election.
When Congress moves hands, Mr. Trump will be asked to take responsibility for himself, just as he prepares to go again in front of the voters, and perhaps eventually become a jury of his partners.
That’s why there’s still a lot to be done, and I don’t mean to suggest that the fall of Mr. Trump’s rule is inevitable – or his equality in Europe.
There are choices we should make on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long we fight.
In 1938, German officials were ready to carry out a coup against Hitler, if only the West opposed him and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We have failed, and missed the opportunity in avoiding the years of massacres that follow.
The beginnings of history centered along such a point of departure, and an accelerated or delayed march of democracy was inevitable.
Americans are now facing some of these changes.
What should we do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the person who oversees the fate of Mr. Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been under pressure since the paper reported that, last year, he suggested secretly recording the president and arguing that he was not worthy of serving as president.
Mr. Rosenstein said the Times account was incorrect.
"How do we respond if the new F.B.I. investigation asked Brett Kavanaugh to be incomplete or fair - or if he was brought to the Supreme Court despite strong accusations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
And besides, will we vote in part-time for Congress that will ask for Trump’s accountability?
If we fail to pass that test, democracy will deteriorate in the long run.
But I believe we will succeed, because of the lessons I have learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once inhabited my embassy.
He survived, then immigrated to America and, 60 years later, asked me to light a Sabbath candle on a swastika table.
By leaving that legacy to me, how did I lose hope about our future?"

Rangers' Graham Dorrans feels optimistic ahead of match against Rapid Vienna
The Rangers celebrated Rapid Vienna on Thursday, with a win over Austria, following a good draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will strengthen their position to escape from Group G of the European League.
The knee injury left midfielder Graham Dorrans unable to perform in the first season until a 2–2 draw against Villarreal, but he was confident the Rangers could use the result as a pawnstone for greater hope.
"This point is very good for us because Villarreal are a great team," the 31-year-old said.
“In this game we are confident we can get something and go by scoring one point.
In the end, we may be able to do it but, in our opinion, the draw may be a fair outcome.
In the first half, they might perform better but in the second half, we get up and become a better team.
Looking forward to Thursday, tonight is another big European day.
We hope to score three points even though it will be a tough game because they have had a good result in their last game, but, with the support of the supporters behind us, I’m sure we can keep moving forward and get a positive result.
“Last year we had a tough time, because of my injury and the change at the club itself but now there is very good hope at the club.
The skates are great and the kids really enjoyed it. It's a great exercise.
Hopefully we can grow now, put the past behind us and achieve success.”

Although it turns out that the survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be treated, just not many people discussed it with their family members.
About half of people in the nationwide study discuss the cost of long-term care with their partner.
Only 10 percent of them said they discussed this with their children.
“They want family members to provide care, but there is no way to start the discussion,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance business Nationwide.
This is the time to start.
Start talking to your partner and children: You won’t be able to prepare your own family to provide care unless you tell them your wishes first.
Talk with your counselor and your family, where and how you get care, because what you choose will mean very important in determining the cost.
Involve your financial advisor: Your advisor can certainly provide his/her assistance to you in showing you how to pay those costs.
The financing you choose for long-term care includes a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid cash insurance policy that guarantees these costs or insures yourself with your wealth – as long as you have money.
Show your legal document: Facing an obstructive legal debate.
Direct power to your health care, i.e. someone you trust to ensure your health care and ensure if your wishes are carried out by people who are professional when you are unable to communicate.
In addition, your letter of authority in financial matters should also be considered.
A person who is trusted to take care of all the financial decisions you should choose, in addition to making sure your bills are paid in case you are unable to.
Always remember with every little detail: Just imagine when your elderly parents are in an emergency state of health and on their way to the hospital.
Are you ready to answer a variety of questions about both treatment and allergies?
Write down such details so that you are ready to answer.

The shooting event was described by officers as occurring around 02:30 BST, and was said to be a "random action."
The victim did not see who attacked him.
The injuries the victim suffered did not threaten his life and a number of witnesses have been filed by police.
Earthquake and tsunami hit Indonesia
An earthquake and tsunami so severe hit the city of Palu, Indonesia, on Friday, has killed at least 384 people, officials said, and the number of deaths is expected to increase.
The interruption of communication made the officers who sent aid difficult to obtain information from Donggala County, an area north of the city of Palu that was located closer to the earthquake center that struck with a strength of 7.5 Richter scale.
In Palu, after the disaster, more than 16,000 people were evacuated.
Below are a number of key facts about the towns of Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi province, located at the edge of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
When the earthquake and tsunami hit, the city was celebrating its 40th birthday.
Donggala, meanwhile, is a district over 300 km (180 miles) from the coastline to the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The county, which is an administrative region under the province, is estimated to have 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
The economic focus of the Andalusian province of South Sulawesi is to find fish and match crops, especially on the Donggala coast.
However, the existence of nickel mining plays an important role in this province, though it is mostly centered in Morowali, across the coast of Sulawesi.
Recorded in the last 100 years, Palu and Donggala have been hit several times by a tsunami, based on data from the Indonesian Disaster Response Agency.
In 1938, more than 200 people died in a tsunami disaster and hundreds of houses in Donggala flooded.
In 1996, nine people died in a tsunami disaster in western Donggala.
Seismically, Indonesia is located on the Pacific Fire Ring and therefore earthquakes will occur regularly.
A number of major earthquakes and tsunami that have struck in recent years are as follows:
2004: December 26, Indonesia was hit by a major earthquake, right off the west coast of Aceh province, in northern Sumatra, which also triggered a tsunami in 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coastline, and more than half of the victims are in Aceh.
In late March and early April, a series of powerful earthquakes struck the west coast of Sumatra.
On the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra, hundreds of people were killed.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck southern Java, Indonesia’s most densely populated island, triggering a tsunami on the southern coast and killing nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.6 occurred near Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
The death toll was more than 1,100.
2010: One of the islands on the island of Mentawai, off Sumatra, was also hit by a magnitude 7.5 earthquake, triggering a 10-metre tsunami that instantly devastated dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: Pidie Jaya County, Aceh, also experienced superficial earthquakes and resulting in destruction, as well as panic of people remembered for the destruction of the deadly earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
Although there was no potential tsunami, more than 100 people died as a result of the collapse of the building.
2018: Lombok, dubbed the tourist island, also experienced a major earthquake that killed more than 500 people, most of which were on the northern side of the island.
The quake devastated thousands of buildings and temporarily knocked out thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of Sarah Palin, the former governor of Alaska and vice presidential candidate, has been arrested on suspicion of assault.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, obstructing reports of domestic violence and opposing arrest attempts, as Alaska State Police released a report on Saturday.
According to police reports, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police to report an alleged crime, she stole the phone from the woman.
Palin was handed over to Mat-Su Pre-trial Prison, with a $500 fine without bail, as reported by the KTUU.
As reported by the news network, Palin attended the trial on Saturday, declaring himself "innocent, confident" when asked about his defense.
Palin faces three minor Class A violations, which can make him subject to a one-year prison sentence and a $250,000 fine.
In addition, he was also charged with Class B criminal charges, with a one-day prison sentence and a $2,000 fine.
For Palin, this is not the first time a criminal lawsuit has been filed.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His own mother, Sarah Palin, who contacted the police to make a report on the alleged attack.
The case is currently filed with the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was indicted for domestic violence, obstructing reports of domestic violence, and possession of intoxicated firearms, which were also linked to the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of licking his face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was challenged by a veteran group for associating her son's violent actions with PTSD as a result of her duties during Iraq.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia: hundreds of victims killed
On Friday, the Indonesian island of Sulawesi was hit by a massive earthquake, killing at least 384 people.
An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 on the Richter scale that could potentially trigger a tsunami has devastated thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication connections are cut off, as well as deaths are expected to continue to rise over the next few days.
The earthquake struck Sulawesi in the central part, which is located northeast of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
Videos that show how horrific the moment of the disaster is circulating widely through social media.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu at the time, when the tsunami broke the beach.
Federal prosecutors seek rare death sentences for suspected terrorist attacks in NYC
Federal prosecutors in New York sought the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York City, in which eight people were killed -- the sentences included rare and have never been carried out in the federal crime-related state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly committed an assault by colliding with a truck he rented from Home Depot to pedestrians and cyclists on a bike lane along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, in October.
In order to justify this death penalty, prosecutors must provide evidence that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious bodily injury, based on a statement of willingness to impose the death penalty, which was filed to the Southern District of New York.
Based on court documents, then both charges allow for the death penalty to be handed down.
A few weeks after the attack, the federal jury indicted Saipov with 22 charges, including eight counts of murder in launching an act of blackmail, which federal prosecutors usually use in organized crime cases, as well as counts of violence and attempted destruction of motor vehicles.
According to prosecutors, the attack required "substantial planning and early maturity," as a depiction of Saipov's crimes committed with "evil, cruel, and apathetic."
It was expressed in a statement of will, "Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has resulted in injury, danger, and loss to family and friends from Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Mendoza, and Danan Mendoza."
Five of the victims in the incident were Argentine tourists.
It's been a decade since the Southern District of New York dropped the death penalty last time.
In September 2009, Khalid Barnes, charged with the murder of two drug suppliers, was finally sentenced to life in prison.
The last execution of the death penalty in New York's federal court in 1953, was dropped on the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who were found guilty of espionage conspiracy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenberg couple were executed dead with an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, of Uzbekistan, did not show any regret as the day and month after the attack went on.
When asked by the investigators, he said he was happy with what he had already done, police said.
Saipov also revealed to authorities that his attack was inspired by the ISIS video he watched from his phone, as was the content of the accusations.
He also asked for the ISIS flag to be placed in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to the 22 charges dropped on him.
David Patton, one of the federal general defenders representing Saipov, expressed "clearly disappointed" with the prosecutor's decision.
"In our view, the decision to execute death rather than to accept a guilty plea for life imprisonment without a guarantee of release will only prolong the trauma of those involved in the incident," Patton said.
Previously, Saipov's defense team had asked prosecutors not to drop the death penalty.
NIGEL FARAGE is responsible for Brexit negotiations, says Tory MP
Nigel Farage called for today's 'movement of the people's army' in protest at the Tory conference.
The former Ukip leader said that politicians should "feel the heat" of Eurosceptics - because one of the parliamentarians, Theresa May, suggested that they join forces in negotiations with the EU.
Conservative supporter Peter Bone told street action in Birmingham that the UK should have 'out' at the moment if only Farage was serving as Brexit Secretary.
However, the challenge facing May in the reconciliation of her divided position has been underlined by supporters of Remain Tories who joined in separate protests denouncing Brexit in the city.
The prime minister struggled to defend his Chequers compromise plan to stay on track despite amidst the Brexiteers, Remainers and European Union attacks.
Allied countries stressed that he would be pushed forward to reach a deal with Brussels, despite getting a bad feedback - and forcing Eurosceptics and Labour to decide the choice between his package of proposals and 'chaos'.
Bone told the mass Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he wanted to 'get rid of the Chequers.
His proposal, that Farage should appoint a partner to be given responsibility in negotiations with Brussels.
"If the person in charge stays with him, we'll be out now," he said.
Wellingborough MP added: "I stand ready to support Brexit, but we need to get rid of the Chequers."
His statement, while showing his opposition to the European Union: "We are not fighting in a world war to be subject.
We want to establish our own laws in our own country."
Bone blurred the proposal that public opinion potentially caused a change since the 2016 vote: "An idea that states that the British people's thinking has changed and want a fixed condition, that's not true at all."
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns, who also joined the mass action, pointed out to reporters: “Simple, I want to say: O Prime Minister, listen to your people.
Chequers are not popular among the general public, while the Opposition will not vote for them, because they are not popular with our party and our activists who are really down the road and make us elected in the first place.
Our request, get rid of the Chequers and start listening to us."
Through a message addressed to May, he added: "The Prime Minister retains their jobs when their promises are fulfilled."
Farage said that political demonstrations must be respected in order to "feel the heat" if they want to deny the 2016 referendum decision.
“The most valuable thing right now is the trust between us – the people – and our political groups,” he said.
“They’re trying to deny Brexit and here we are today, confirming to them that ‘we won’t let you do that.’”
He added in a message to a crowd of enthusiastic people: “I want you to make our political group, which is preparing to deny Brexit, also feel its heat.
“We are moving the army of the people of this country that will win us in Brexit and will never give up until the independent, self-governing, and proud United Kingdom comes into being.”
Meanwhile, the Remainers mass moved through Birmingham before taking action in the city centre for two hours.
The activist line appears to be spreading the Tories Against Brexit banner after launching its line this weekend.
A colleague in the Labour line, Lord Adonis, smeared the Conservatives' group on the security issue of their party's applications when the conference opened.
“These are the people who tell us that they can master the IT system and all the technology for Canada, whatever, for the sake of the anti-friction border, for the sake of unlimited free trade in Ireland,” he said.
“It’s a funny show.
“There is no good Brexit,” he said.
Warren plans to do a 'serious crash' in presidential election
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would "crash the presidential election" after the election moment in November.
The Boston Globe announced that the Massachusetts Democratic party declared its future in the town hall in western Massachusetts, on Saturday.
Warren, who frequently denounced President Donald Trump, ran for re-election in November against state GOP representative Geoff Diehl, Trump's 2016 campaign vice president in Massachusetts.
In national speculation, he was already branded as an opponent of Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon meeting in Holyoke was the 36th with its voters, which has been called in the city hall format since Trump took office.
A participant posed a question to him, whether there was a plan to run for president.
Warren also responded, that this is the right time "for women to enter the circle of Washington in order to restore our broken government, and that includes the time for women to occupy the top."
Arrested shooter Sims, LSU player
On Saturday, Baton Rouge police, Louisiana, announced the arrest of the suspected shooter to the death of Wayde Sims, a basketball player from LSU, on Friday.
Baton Rouge Police Department announced Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested at 11 a.m. in an ET press conference.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday, in which an identified man asked for help as seen in the footage.
On Friday morning, Sims, 20, was shot and found dead near the Southern University campus.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and eventually died," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, via 247sports.
Wayde then wanted to protect his friend and Simpson released a shot at him.
When questioned, Simpson claims to be at the scene, holding a firearm, and firing it toward the Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested with no resistance meant and thrown into custody in the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
A junior player with a height of 6 feet 6 inches, growing up in Baton Rouge, that's the Sims figure, has played in 32 games with 10 pre-seasons and an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 sprints in each game.
Grand Prix in Russia: Lewis Hamilton wins world title after team admits victory over Sebastian Vettel
Everything became clear at a time when Valtteri Bottas was ahead of Lewis Hamilton in a qualifying event on Saturday that would bring Mercedes team orders to have a big role in the race.
From the pole, Bottas had a good start position and almost left Hamilton as he maintained his position in the first two laps and pulled Vettel to attack his teammates.
Vettel became the first to run into the pit and let Hamilton move in in density at the end of the crowd, something that should have been very decisive.
Mercedes entered the pit one lap later and exited after Vettel, but Hamilton continued after several chases that showed Ferrari drivers' reluctance to leave the inside empty with the risk of surviving after a double move to survive in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started the start in the back row of the grid and was in seventh place at the end of the first lap on his 21st birthday.
He then led most of the race as he withstood the tyre change to target a quick fix and took over Kimi Raikkonen's position for fourth place.
He eventually entered the pit in the 44th lap but was unable to improve his pace in the remaining eight lap as Raikkonen eventually took fourth place.
It was a tough day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and a real man who left me.
The team has done a tremendous job of having one or two," Hamilton said.
That's a very bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocks Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday through his appeal, he did not leak a letter from Christine Blasey Ford about sexual violence against prospective Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly deliver a statement made by Ford before the Senate Judiciary Committee, rather than commenting on what was going on in the senate that showed people who were "evil and obscene and dishonest."
“Something can happen and beautiful things are happening during the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and evil and obscene and dishonest,” he said.
"When you see the drains and leaks then they say, 'Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
You remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak it?
Remember the answer... did you leak the document-- "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak it."
Okay, hold on a second.
What we leaked...No, we didn't leak it," he added, as the senator's impression.
Feinstein had sent a letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh by Ford in July, and it had leaked earlier in September - but Feinstein denied the leak came from his office.
"I'm not hiding Dr. Ford's accusations, I'm not leaking his story," Feinstein told the committee.
"He asked me to keep it a secret and I kept it a secret like his request."
But his refusal seemed to be unaccepted by the president, who commented during Saturday night's rally: "I'll tell you, it's really a very bad body language.
Maybe he didn’t, but it’s the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court candidate, who became accused of sexual harassment of three women, the president impressed giving Democrats the presumption of using the charges for their own purposes.
"They are determined to take over power in a variety of ways.
You see the crime, the violence, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to run for power and control,” the president said in a statement.
League Elite: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars retaliated for a loss on Friday in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants by winning a home game with a score of 5-3 on Saturday.
Giant scored two goals earlier after two strikes from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought home the balance before Dwyer returned the Giants' lead.
Francois Bouchard equalized the position for Dundee before two goals Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured their win.
It was the third Elite League defeat of the season by the Adam Keefes, who successfully chased the lag and eventually outperformed to be able to beat Dundee 2-1 at Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between both sides, with three Giants wins in the previous game.
The openinger from Dwyer came in the fourth minute at 3:35 from the bass given by Kendall McFaull, with David Rutherford giving the bass when Beauvillier managed to double the lead four minutes later.
In a dense opening period, Sullivan brought the host back into the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt became the feeder for the balancer that Cownie did at 15:16.
Dwyer secured the Giants' lead at the first pause when scoring his second night goal at the end of the first period.
The hosts reunited and Bouchard again balanced their position with a power play goal in time to 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen give Dundee an edge for the first time at the end of the match in the second period and he secured a win with his team in the middle of the fifth during the final period.
The Giants, who have so far suffered four defeats from their five games, were at home to face Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air Traffic Driver Dies to Ensure Hundreds of Passengers on Plane Survived From Earthquake
An air traffic driver in Indonesia was hailed as a hero after his death as he ensured that planes carrying hundreds of passengers could fly safely.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a major earthquake struck the Sulawesi islands on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continually shook the region and many were trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
But as his colleagues fled for their safety, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan the Great refused to leave his post in a hard-hit driver's tower at Sis Al Jufri's Pearl Airport, Palu.
He chose to survive to ensure Flight Batik Air number 6321 that was on the runway at the time, could take off safely.
He then jumped out of the traffic driver's tower as he felt the tower began to collapse.
He died later in the hospital.
Indonesia’s Aviation Navigation Services Regulatory Board spokesperson, Yohannes Sirait, said his decision could save hundreds of lives, according to ABC Australia news.
We provided a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter managed to reach Palu.
“We are all saddened to hear this,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities worrying the victims died could reach thousands after the National Disaster Response Agency delivered access to the towns of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong difficult.
"The victims are believed to continue to rise because of the many bodies that are still overrun by the ruins and many others that are unattainable," a spokesman for the national disaster response body Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said.
Waves that reached six meters have caused the Palu to blush which led to a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft carry aid and various supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute of an ambulance carries a corpse.
Clean water is rare.
Minimarkets everywhere are robbed"
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is working hard to help the survivors but we don’t know what they will find there.
It has been a tragedy, but it may be getting worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and asked the Indonesian national army: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete the entire task related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?" the CNN report.
Indonesia was also hit earlier this year by an earthquake in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Micronesian plane crash: Air Niugini delivers one person missing after lagoon plane crash
The airline operating a flight that fell to the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia said one person had disappeared, after previously delivered to 47 passengers and crew had been safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a release on Saturday afternoon that it was unable to identify a male passenger.
The airline said it had worked with local authorities, hospitals and examiners to find the man.
The airline did not promptly respond to requests for more detailed information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue passengers and other crew, after the plane hit the water while attempting to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers were left in hospital on Saturday, and they were all in stable condition.
What caused the accident and the complete sequence of events is still unclear.
Both the airlines and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon around the runway.
Some eyewitnesses felt the plane was beyond the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane came with a very low.
"That's a good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said he and the others managed to pour water as high as the waist through the emergency exit on the sinking plane.
He conveyed panic to the guards and shouted, and he suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy said fishermen working close to the repaired dock also helped rescuers using rubber boats to transport people to land before the plane sank at a depth of about 30 meters (100 feet) in the water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network indicates 111 people have died in a registered airline-PNG accident over the past two decades but none involving Niugini Air.
Analysts give a timeline of night women burned alive
The arrest of a man who was charged with the burning of a Mississippi woman in 2014 was on Saturday in a re-examination.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He made a headline for the jury on how he used cell phone footage to collect various movements made by 29-year-old Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of his death.
Rowlett said he received location data from several mobile phones showing Tellis was in the same location with Chambers on the night of his death, compared to the previous defendant's statement, Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed the accused’s cell phone was in the same location with Chambers during the time, he argued that he was at the time with his friend Michael Sanford, the police eventually asked for an explanation from Sanford.
Sanford attended the trial on Saturday and he testified that he was not in town on the day of the incident.
When the plaintiff asked if Tellis was being honest when he said he was in a Sanford truck on the night of the incident, Sanford said he was "lying, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency that Tellis conveyed was his statement that he knew Chambers about two weeks until the death of the victim.
Cell phone records indicate that they know each other within a week.
Rowlett said that after Chambers' death, Tellis sometimes removed Chambers' messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
“He removes the victim from his life,” Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its closing statement on Sunday.
The judge said he hoped the trial would lead to a jury after that day.
The High Breed: What is the spirit of hip hop?
A group of hip hop trio want to challenge the negative views of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, who came from Bristol, claimed the hip hop movement was far from the origin of the political message and addressed social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and make the hip hop spirit popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have seen recent revivals in the UK through several artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Other black people?!
NY caregivers sue couple for attack after issuing "racist" message
A New York caretaker sued one couple for having attacked discriminatoryly after receiving an indirect message from a complaining mother and stating that she was "another black person."
The couple refused to consider them racist, and considered it more like "extortion."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two, showed her anxiety when she realized that the new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived on her first day of work in 2016.
"I don't want to see anything else," Ms. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she even sent it to Miss Maurice, twice.
After realizing his mistake, Plasco-Flaxman fired Miss Maurice, stating that they were removing a caregiver, who was an African-American mixed citizen, because he had done a nasty job and he expected more Filipinos, based on the New York Post.
Ms. Maurice was paid for a day's work and then returned using Uber.
Currently, Maurice demands the couple to provide compensation for the dismissal, and asks for compensation of about $350 a day for a six-month period, in exchange for the caregiver's job that he initially had to work for, even without a contract.
"I want to show them, look, you can't do something like that," he told the Post on Sunday, then added "I know it's a discrimination."
The couple opposed claims that they were racist, saying the workers Maurice fired were a legitimate thing to do, they were worried they could not believe him after insulting him,
“My wife sent me something she didn’t mean.
He is not a racist.
We are not racists," husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
“But can you let your children be cared for by someone you’ve divorced, even though it’s just a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
Like wrapped up in "extortion," Plasco said his wife had just two months to give birth to her baby and was in a "very difficult situation."
"You're going to chase someone who's in a situation like that?
That's not a good thing to do," the investment banker added.
By the time the legal case was still running, public opinion courts had quickly scrutinized the couple on social media, blaming them for their attitudes and logic.
Paddington publishers worry readers won't be in touch with talking bears, new newspaper reveals
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born not long after her book had been accepted, was described in the letter. "It is very difficult to just talk without knowing the position she was experiencing, reading it first before it was published.
It's funny to know as much as we know about Paddington's great success."
Said his father, who was a BBC cameraman before inspiring through children's book writing with bear toys, who was very optimistic about the results of his rejected work, he added the 60th anniversary of the book's publication that felt "sweet bitter" after his father's death last year.
To Paddington, whom he described as "a very important member of our family," he added his father was quite proud of the end of his success.
“He’s a pretty quiet person, and he’s not a proud person,” he said.
“But because Paddington means so much to him, it’s like you have a child who has achieved something: you’re proud of them even though not all of your efforts.
I think he sees Paddington's success like that.
Although it was the result of his creation and imagination, he always gave praise to Paddington himself."
My daughter is dying and I have to say goodbye to her over the phone.
By the time he landed, his daughter was immediately taken to the hospital of Nice Louis Pasteur 2, but the doctors failed to save him.
"Nad made the call calmly to deliver it was so bad that he was most likely not going to survive," Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse said.
“Then I got a call from Nad saying he was going to die within the next two minutes and he asked me to say goodbye to him.
And I did too.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications that doctors have given to keep his heart beating are slowly running out and leaving his body system.
He had died several times during the handling process and everything felt lethal.
I could just sit there and wait, understand all this has been revealed.
I can’t cry or scream or cry because I’m in a situation surrounded by families and people.
I really have to hold it all.”
Finally Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, currently grieving for the loss of her daughter, boards the plane along with the other passengers - without realizing what has been going on.
"No one knows about it," he said.
“My head is swollen and my tears keep dripping all the time.
It was hard to explain, but during the flight I felt such deep sympathy for Nad.
That he needs love and understanding from me.
I know how much she loves him.”
Women who are grieving post a card to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who lose their loved one try to prevent others from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted cards on a bridge in Welsh with inspiring messages and numbers that can be contacted for support.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 years old when he began suffering from depression and suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want parents to feel the way I feel every day,” he said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, says her son is a promising chef with a contagious smile.
“Everyone knows him from his smile.
They always say that her smile brightens the atmosphere."
But, he stopped working before he died, as he "was in a very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old at the time, was the one who found his brother after he committed suicide.
Mrs. Davis said: "I'm constantly worried if there will be any lasting effects."
Mrs. Davis made those cards, "to let people know that there are other people out there that you can approach and talk to, even if they're a friend.
Don't sit down and shut up - you need to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who was friends with Mrs. Davies for many years, lost Mark, her husband for 15 years, shortly after her mother died.
“He didn’t say if he felt sad or depressed or anything,” he said.
“A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his behavior.
He was at his lowest point on Christmas Day - when the kids opened their presents he didn't look into their eyes or anything."
He said his death was a great trauma for them, but they had to go through it: "It made a gap in the family.
It separates us.
But we have to go through it and fight.”

The future of Brett Kavanaugh is in uncertainty when the FBI begins its investigation
"I think, if we really got something like what he asked for - an investigation that limited his time, limited its coverage - we might be able to bring a little unity," Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was "devastated" amid the council's decision stalemate.
Why does Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their dependence on everything is due to time.
Legislative elections remain for five more weeks, on November 6 - if, as expected, Republicans do it badly, they will become very weak in their chances of making the people they want elected sit in the highest court there.
George W. Bush had contacted the Senators, lobbying them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and through him met with his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's private secretary.
What happened after the FBI made the report?
There will be elections in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats sit.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes among the Senate, which will allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to determine the winner and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
North Korea's number of smugglers 'enjoyed' under Kim
The number of people smuggling from North Korea to South Korea has fallen drastically since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a member of the Korean Parliament said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South unification ministry data, said there were 1,127 divestments last year - compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said border controls between North Korea and China and higher tariffs smuggled by smugglers were key factors.
Pyongyang did not make public comments.
Most migrants from the North were eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 people from North Korea have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most fled through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the Demilitarization Zone between the two Koreas.
China treats smugglers as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forces them back.
Relations between the North and the South - which are technically still at war - have greatly increased in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks centered on delayed denuclearization negotiations.
This comes after a historic meeting in June between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed in a broad sense to cooperate on the nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions for the lack of development since then.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and in that situation, it is unlikely that we will unilaterally drop our weapons," Ri said in a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi accuses Brett Kavanaugh of being "hysterical," saying he is not fit to serve in the Supreme Court
Opposition Party Chairman Nancy Pelosi accused Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of being "hysterical" and said he was not temperamentally fit to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comment in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't help but think that if a woman had her performance like that, they would say 'hysterical'," Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Judicial Council Commission on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denies allegations that he had committed sexual harassment against Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
In his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, several times almost screaming and difficulty speaking when discussing his family and his years during high school.
He also gambled against Democrats on the committee, saying the charges against him were "unreasonable and coordinated character murders" organized by angry liberals because Hillary Clinton lost in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said he believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not serve in the Supreme Court because he was biased towards Democrats.
"I think he disqualified himself with those statements and with his attitude towards Clinton and the Democrats," he said.
Pelosi expressed objections if he would try to claim if he was approved, and if Democrats gained more votes in the People's House of Representatives.
"I would say this -- if he didn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he wasn't fit not only to be in the Supreme Court, but also in the court where he is now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is now a judge in the D.C. High Court.
Pelosi added that he as a Democrat he was concerned about the potential of Kavanaugh's ruling against the Health Services Act or Roe v. Wade, as he was seen as a proponent of conservative justice.
In an appointment hearing, Kavanaugh avoided the question of whether he would overturn certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"It's not time for someone who is hysterical and biased to go to court and expect us to say, 'Isn't that great?'"
And women need to deal with it.
It was an ethical deception, anger for months and years, and he couldn’t get it out without crying.
“We cry when we’re angry: Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's weird, what do you think?"
He went on, "I'm very much helped by a woman who's an executive somewhere, who says that she's also crying when she's angry, but developing a technique that means that she's getting angry and starting to cry, she'll say to the person who's talking to her, "You probably think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then he continued on.
And I think it's brilliant."
Tears are ejected as a way out of anger in part because it is basically misunderstood.
One of my strongest memories of the early work, in a man-dominated office, one time I was crying with unexpressable anger, was my hips being gripped by an older woman – a cold manager I’ve always been a little afraid of – who dragged me down the stairs.
"Never let them see you cry," he told me.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you’re sad and will be happy because they think they’re successful.”
Patricia Schroeder, who is a congressman from Colorado, once worked with Gary Hart in the presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an out-of-wedding affair aboard a boat called Monkey Business and resigned from the election, Miss Schroeder, deeply frustrated, understood that there was no reason for herself not to run for president.
"It wasn't a decision that was thought of with maturity," he told me as he laughed 30 years later.
"There are seven other candidates in the election, and the last thing they need is a new candidate.
Someone called her "Snow Princess and the Seven Dwarfs."
Since it was too late in the campaign, he was left behind in fundraising, and so he swore he would not attend the election unless he managed to raise $2 million.
It was a fight that led to defeat.
He found that some of his supporters who gave $1,000 to the man gave him only $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" he asked.
While he was speaking announcing that he would not launch a formal campaign, he was overly dominated by emotions – gratitude to the people who supported him, frustration with the system that made fundraising so difficult and to target voters rather than delegations, and anger at sexism – making it difficult to talk.
"You'll probably think I'm too nervous," recalled Miss Schroeder about how the press reacted to her.
“You’ll think that Kleenex is my sponsor company.
I remember, thinking, what would they write on my nose?
"She's crying"?
How U.S.-China trade competition might be good for Beijing
The opening of trade competition between the U.S. and China is so frustrating, and while the fight is still far from over, the friction between the two countries may have been beneficial to Beijing in the long run, according to experts.
U.S. President Donald Trump fired the first warning earlier this year by imposing taxes on key Chinese exports including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
A very significant increase was made as of this week with new tariffs affecting goods worth $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), effectively imposing tax on half of all goods entering the US via China.
Beijing has retaliated every time, recently imposing tariffs on five to ten percent on $60 billion worth of American goods.
China has applied to equate the US one-by-one, and the world’s second-largest economy will not change in the near future.
Asking Washington to step down means following the will, but publicly beating the U.S. would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Still, experts say if Beijing can play its cards correctly, U.S. trade competition pressure can positively support China in the long run by reducing dependence between the two economies.
“The fact that rapid political decisions by Washington or Beijing can make conditions that trigger economic movements in both countries actually more dangerous than what observers have known before,” said Abigail Grace, a research fellow who focuses on Asia at the Center for New American Security, an expert agency.
Syria 'ready' to return refugees, says foreign minister
Syria says it is ready for the return of voluntary refugees and offers aid to rebuild a country that has been destroyed by more than seven years of war.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in his country are improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and safe thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas that are destroyed by terrorists to restore them as they are.
All conditions are now present due to the voluntary return of refugees to the country they must leave because of terrorism and comprehensive economic decisions that make their daily lives and livelihoods a target.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled their country since the war began in 2011.
The other six million people still living in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would receive aid to rebuild the destroyed country.

Europe secures Ryder Cup victory in Paris
The European team has won the Ryder Cup defeating the U.S. team with a final score of 16.5 and 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The U.S. has lost six consecutive times in Europe and has never won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained its cup as Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who tried almost all the way through the tournament, hit his tee into the water on par-3 of the 16th hole, admitting his defeat to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari shines throughout his round, becoming 1 of 4 players who have ever received 5-0-0 since the format in place in the tournament began in 1979.
American athlete Jordan Spieth was defeated 5&4 by the lowest-ranked player in the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's top-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to England's Ian Poulter who may have played in his last Ryder Cup.
An eight-time Ryder Cup veteran, Sergio Garcia of Spain became a European with an overall win with a career point of 25.5 at this tournament.
“I don’t usually cry, but I can’t hold it today.
It's been a tough year.
Thank you very much to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm very happy, very happy to get the cup back.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I can help," Garcia said emotionally after the European victory.
He gave his responsibilities to fellow countryman John Ram who defeated legendary U.S. golfer Tiger Woods 2&1 in a single game on Sunday.
"The amazing pride I feel, defeating Tiger Woods, I grew up watching him," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost in his four games in France and now has a 13-21-3 Ryder Cup career record.
Strange statistics by one of the best players of all time, have won 14 major titles just under Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled throughout the weekend to get a fairway with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-caliber golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk spoke after his team's disappointing performance, "I'm proud of these people, they're fighting.
There was a time this morning when we were making Europe difficult.
We're fighting.
Respect for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played very well.
We will reschedule, I will work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we will move forward.
I love these 12 people and I'm proud to be a captain.
You have to pay the respects.
We've lost the top."
