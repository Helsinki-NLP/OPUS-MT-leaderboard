UN chief says there are no military solutions in Syria
Secretary General Ban Ki-moon says his response to Russia’s military support for Syria is that “there is no military solution” to the conflict that lasts nearly five years and more weapons would only aggravate the violence and suffering of millions of people.
The UN chief again called on all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unify and support negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said on Wednesday at a conference that he intends to meet with foreign ministers from five countries permanently present in the council - the US, Russia, China, England and France - on the sidelines of the General Assembly's ministerial session to discuss Syria.
Ban expressed regret that divisions in the council and between the Syrian people and regional powers “made this situation unresolved.”
Ban has asked the five permanent members to demonstrate the solidarity and unity shown when they managed to conclude an agreement on Iran's nuclear weapons, thus addressing the crisis in Syria.
8 figures from polls that show that Donald Trump has real chances
Some have tried to label him as a “flip-flop” politician.
Others called it a joke.
And others are waiting for the implosion.
But no matter how some Republicans try to smash Donald Trump from the top of the polls, it hasn’t worked (yet).
Ten of the last 11 national polls have shown that Donald Trump leads with a percentage of two figures and some voices are beginning to seriously question what this means for the real estate mogul’s chances of appointing.
Of course, it's still premature.
None of this says Trump will win the race to nominate Republicans.
Pundits shows that, in the same period of 2011, Rick Perry's advance made way for Herman Cain in polls, but none of them won in any state in the nomination race.
And the reasons why it would be difficult to fight in the general election are numerous.
But outside groups like Jeb Bush’s Super PAC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth admit Trump’s power and start to support him with money.
Below are a few figures from recent surveys that suggest that real estate mogule is not just something transitory:
The figures indicating support for Trump have gone back to 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a survey by the University of Monmouth showed that only two out of 10 Republicans had a positive opinion on the real estate mogul.
By mid-July, the percentage had risen to 40%.
At the beginning of August, it was 52%.
Six out of 10 Republicans have a favorable opinion on Donald Trump.
About three out of 10 say they have a negative opinion.
These figures are maintained.
A poll conducted last week by Quinnipiac in Iowa concluded that 60% of Republicans in the region have a favorable opinion on Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters would be happy if Trump won the nomination race.
In a poll conducted last week by CNN/ORC, 67% of Republicans said they would be “enthusiastic” or “satisfied” if Trump won the race for nomination.
Only two out of 10 say they would be “broken” if Trump won the nomination race.
Only Ben Carson generates about the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they would be “enthusiastic” compared to 40 percent who say the same about Trump).
Is it the closest thing to enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio, with only 21%.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be “dissatisfied” or “satisfied” if favorite Jeb Bush wins the race for nomination.
Most Republicans don’t see Trump’s temperament as a problem.
Although Donald Trump has been heavily criticized for his insults and his bombastic style, 52% of Republican voters nationwide believe the real estate mogul has the right temperament to be president, according to a poll conducted Monday by ABC News/Washington Post.
We find the same figures in the state of Iowa, where 52% of Republicans still believe Trump has the right personality to lead, according to a poll conducted last week by Quinnipiac.
However, 44% say they don’t have the personality they need to act effectively and nearly six out of 10 say their temperament has nothing to look for in the White House, according to ABC/Post.
The Republicans get used to the idea.
When they take the attitude of intellectuals, Republican voters consider Trump to be authentic.
According to a poll conducted last week by CNN/ORC, when asked who is most likely to win the GOP nomination race, four out of 10 said Trump.
The situation has changed since the end of July, when four out of 10 would have bet on Jeb Bush.
Full information: in the past, GOP voters did not read the future very well.
In the same period of the last election, four out of 10 Republicans elected Rick Perry in the run for nomination, up from just 28% for Mitt Romney.
However, these figures show that the majority of GOP voters consider Trump’s campaign plausible.
Even if the Republicans responded to another candidate. Trump is still at the forefront of all.
Some voices say the split situation will likely contribute to Trump’s victory, while support against Trump will be split into more than twelve candidates.
But a poll conducted in early September by the University of Monmouth shows that in the hypothetical situation of a collaboration between Trump and the majority of other Republican candidates, Trump will almost always benefit from the majority support.
Trump is 13 points away from Carly Fiorina, 14 points from Marco Rubio, 15 points from Walker, 19 points from Jeb Bush and 33 points from Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie.
It's almost on par with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate to win it?
Ben Carson would beat the businessman by 19 points in a hypothetical one-on-one confrontation.
The majority of Donald Trump’s supporters say they have made a decision.
A new poll conducted Tuesday by CBS/NYT shows that more than half of voters who support Trump say they are not changing their voting options.
Obviously, a lot can happen in this regard and no one can say that they will never change their minds.
46% say they leave the door open to the possibility of changing their options.
However, Trump’s most important opponent is currently neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they have decided to vote for Trump are twice as likely.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called Mexican immigrants “violators” in his campaign opening speech two months ago, immigration has been the central topic of the 2016 campaign.
Some are concerned that Trump’s bombastic style will lead to a split between major Hispanic voters and the Republican Party and will undermine rebranding efforts.
But according to a poll conducted Monday by ABC/Post, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
So, it seems that as long as the issue of immigration remains in the spotlight, so will Doland Trump.
Frustration with the authorities reaches new heights.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are now supported by nearly half of Republican voters, largely due to their status as outsiders.
According to a poll conducted Monday by ABC/Post, six out of 10 Republicans say they prefer a political outsider to the detriment of someone with government experience.
The people are also angry at the Washington authorities.
A poll conducted two weeks ago in Iowa by the Des Moines Register/Bloomberg shows that three out of four Iowa Republicans are frustrated with the performance of Republicans in Congress, 54% declaring themselves "unsatisfied" and 21% "nervos at the top."
Jeremy Corbyn makes his debut at Prime Minister's Questions
Since his election, Mr Corbyn's debut at PMQs has been long awaited
The new Labour Party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, will later make his debut at Prime Minister's Questions, meeting for the first time with David Cameron.
Mr Corbyn will address the first of the six questions he is entitled to shortly after lunch; his performance will likely be closely reviewed by the media and Labour MPs.
During his weekly appearances, he called for “less theater and more facts.”
He also stated that he can waive a few participations and that he cedes them to his colleagues.
The confrontation will be Mr Corbyn’s first parliamentary test in the leadership position, coming after he named a “ghost cabinet” and after the speech he gave Tuesday at the annual TUC congress.
Meanwhile, the Labour Party leader’s decision to remain silent at the national anthem in a service held on Tuesday on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of England drew criticism from conservative parliamentarians and kept the front page of the newspapers.
Mr. Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem drew attention
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said he had "respectfully kept silence" and acknowledged "the heroism of the British Air Force in the Battle of England."
But a member of Mr. Corbyn's ghost cabinet, Owen Smith, told the BBC's Two's Newsnight that he would have recommended the Labour leader to sing the national anthem "indifferent" to his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Around twelve ministers in the ghost cabinet refused to be part of Mr Corbyn's leadership team, arguing for differences in views on the economy, defense and foreign affairs, while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party supported him as leader.
The BBC’s political correspondent, Robin Brant, states that the policy differences “accumulate” in the Labour Party after Mr Corbyn’s appointment regarding his position towards the European Union and the benefit limit.
Mr Corbyn said at the TUC conference that the Labour Party would bring about changes that would completely eliminate the idea of limitation.
A few hours later, Mr Smith, the Minister of Labour and Pensions, said the party was “very clear” in its exclusive opposition to the government’s plans to reduce the “cap” level from <0xC2><0xA3>26,000 to <0xC2><0xA3>23,000.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron has faced on the bench in the last decade since he took over the leadership of the Conservative Party.
The Labour leader, who has promised a different approach to politics, says he has ideas “from outside sources” for questions to be addressed to Mr. Cameron and that he has received over 30,000 suggestions.
Islington North MP said PMQs involve too high a level of confrontation and will refrain from retaliation and attacks, committing instead to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people.
Mr. Corbyn said that Angela Eagle, the Minister of Finance, will hold her place at PMQs when he cannot participate – for example when Mr. Cameron is moving abroad.
He also expressed the idea that he would allow other colleagues to take the floor from time to time, saying that he had approached the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, John Bercow, to discuss this issue.
In 2005, when he took over, Cameron said he wanted to give up the political style of "Punch and Judy" often associated with the PMQs but admitted a few years later that he had failed in his career.
Since its first transmission in 1990, PMQs have been considered a key barometer of a leader’s reasoning, of how he leads the Chamber of Deputies, and of his position among fellow MPs, although critics claim it has become a caricature and that he needs a profound reform.
"Framework in Joburg": Homeless youth benefit from photography courses
It's hard to be a homeless man in Johannesburg.
But a group of people who lived on the streets in childhood found a way to learn a trade and earn a living.
"I was shot in Joburg" is a non-profit studio that teaches homeless youth to take pictures of the areas they live in and make money from it.
BBC News has met with one of the first graduates of the project.
JD Sports Chief Says Higher Salaries Could Hurt Expansion
JD Sports Chairman Peter Cowgill said a rise in the UK’s minimum wage could mean “a greater purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers.”
However, it is unlikely that such purchasing power will exceed the higher costs for the workforce within the firm, he says.
Costs could have an impact on JD Sports’ expansion plans, he added, which could mean fewer new jobs.
Thanasi Kokkinakis backed by Australian Tennis President Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves to be praised and not criticized for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was a collateral victim in the “storm” created around his friend, Nick Kyrgios, and his behavior deserves more praise than criticism, according to Australian Tennis President Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, the younger part of the talented duo often called the "Special Ks," was awkwardly dragged into the spotlight by Kyrgios' scandalous shooting of Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
In a qualifying match played shortly after, in Cincinnati, the chair referee had to intervene twice in order to separate Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison, after which Harrison said: "I should have put him on the wagon."
Although he was last seen making a powder rocket after he had muscle cramps and missed a possible US Open tournament, angry Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was firmly defended by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, where he is fighting Sam Groth for second place in the singles after Bernard Tomic in the semi-finals of the Davis Cup against England.
“One thing I feel strongly about is that, in my opinion, Thanasi was drawn a little bit into conflict,” Healy said.
The truth is he broke a rocket when he lost because he accused cramps in the US, but he’s not the first player to break a rocket out of frustration with himself and I know Thanasi well enough to know he wouldn’t be proud of it.
But to be serious, he managed extremely well in pretty challenging situations in the US with Harrison and so on and I think he deserves a lot of trust.
He has an amazing team, he has a great family with him and I think he was treated unfairly.
He is a very mature young man of 19 years, works hard and integrated into the team, has not had any kind of conflict with other players, is very respected in dressing up, trains hard, is in excellent shape, is a very balanced and mature young man and I think his horse is well worth to be excluded.
Healy also supported the decision not to consider Kyrgios for the important referee match, which starts Friday, and described the "common decision" as the most appropriate for everyone, but supported the long-term return of the Canberra native player to the team.
“First of all, we want the team to focus entirely on the referee game and not think at all about the controversy around [Kyrgios],” Healy said.
And I think Nick went up very quickly, as people like Federer and Murray said, he's matured under the public's eyes and he's made some terrible mistakes and he's worth criticizing, but we can both try to help him out for the need to reflect, we can't help him out in the time he's got, we can't help him out.
Elections 2016: Hillary Clinton’s advantage over Bernie Sanders halved in national polls
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton still has a two-digit advantage in the Democratic race for nationally-candidacy, but Senator Bernie Sanders wins the ground.
Clinton is now supported by 47% of Democratic voters (down from 58%), while Sanders is second with 27% (up from 17%).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he will run for president, is backed by 15% of Democratic voters.
At least five months before the start of the primaries, most Democratic voters say it’s too early to say they’ve decided on the candidate they’re going to support.
But Clinton’s supporters are more determined in their choice than the supporters of other candidates.
Compared to the CBS news poll last month, Clinton lost ground in a number of demographic groups, while Sanders earned a few percent.
Clinton retains the advantage among women and moderates, but the advantage has been reduced.
Support among the men has decreased considerably and Sanders is at a distance of only 5 points.
Clinton’s advantage among Democratic voters under the age of 50 has evaporated, now on par with Sanders.
Clinton, however, is still in the forefront of older voters.
Last month, Clinton was ahead of Sanders, with a two-digit percentage of the Liberals, but Sanders now has a five-point lead in this group.
Approximately half of the nationally-democratic voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she were elected to run on behalf of the party.
A quarter would support it somewhat reserved and another 15% would support it just because it represents the party.
Six percent would not support it.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, the likelihood that Clinton’s current supporters will be enthusiastic about her choice is high.
Opinions are more mixed among those who do not currently support Clinton — only about a quarter would enthusiastically support her.
While 48% of Democratic voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton, the number of Republican voters who say the same about the top-ranking, Donald Trump (35%) is lower.
When Clinton’s supporters are asked an open question about why they would like her to win the race, the majority answer is that she has the right experience (16%), followed by the fact that it’s time for a woman to be president (13%) and that this position is the best candidate.
Clinton’s supporters also mention her association with Bill Clinton (9%).
The agreement on these issues and eligibility shall also be mentioned.
Given the fact that the vice president is considering a possible presidential candidate, 57% of Democratic voters would like to see him running — although a third think he should not run.
When asked about the second option for the party's representative, Democratic voters call Biden a majority.
More than half of Clinton’s supporters say Biden would be the second option, long before Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run for the Democratic Party, Hillary Clinton’s advantage over Sanders increases from 20 points with Biden running for 30 points if he doesn’t run.
55% of Democratic voters consider Clinton the most likely candidate to win the general election; however, the numbers fell from 78% last month.
Biden is in second place, but the percentage that is most eligible has risen.
However, when asked what is most important to an elected candidate, Democratic voters prefer issues rather than eligibility.
As last month, no Democratic candidate or potential candidate is considered by these voters to be unacceptable as a representative of the party in the presidential race.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates are doing well in terms of a few key features with respect to their party’s primary voters.
The majority of voters consider Clinton, Sanders, and Biden to be integrity and trustworthy and have solid leadership qualities.
Biden is seen best of all three in terms of integrity, while Clinton’s strength is leadership.
Thirty percent of Democrats do not believe that Clinton is integrative and trustworthy, twice as many as those who say this about Sanders (15%), but 27 percent do not have an opinion about him in this regard.
Democratic voters also generally consider that the three, Clinton, Sanders and Biden, have the same ideologies as they do.
On all of these issues, about a quarter of Democratic voters do not have an opinion on Sanders.
As questions persist regarding the use of a personal email address and a server by Hillary Clinton while she was Secretary of State, most Democratic voters are satisfied with her explanation on the subject and say that it did not affect their general opinion of the candidate.
But things are different among the American public.
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with her explanation, while only nearly a third are satisfied.
The public opinion on this issue was divided in March, shortly after the issue came to light.
The majority of Americans say the email controversy has not affected their general opinion of Clinton, although 36 percent say they have changed their opinion in a negative way.
Mostly Republicans, more than six out of 10, say they have changed their minds about Clinton in a negative way.
Although Democratic voters consider Clinton to be integral and trustworthy, this still raises problems among voters in general: only 32% consider it to be integral and trustworthy, 8% less than last month and 15% less than in May.
62% of voters do not consider it to be integrity and reliable.
At the same time, 55% of national voters do not consider Trump to be integrity and trustworthy.
However, both Clinton and Trump have white balls for leadership.
Among the six candidates evaluated, Biden, Carson and Bush ranked first in terms of integrity.
The number of those who consider Sanders integral is greater than those who do not share the same opinion, however, as in the case of Carson, many do not have an opinion about him.
The margin of error for the sample of 351 Democratic primary voters is 6 percentage points.
Five Brotherhood Members Accused of Murdering Student in Year 1 of Baruch Faculty
Nearly two years after a college student lost his life during an initiation ritual in the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania, five people were charged with murder.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood of New York’s Baruch Faculty brutally attacked Chun “Michael” Deng during an initiation ritual in September 2013 and delayed him to be taken to the hospital, which contributed to his death, according to police statements.
Official sources say the victim was blindfolded, a 14 kg backpack packed with sand was put in his back, and was abruptly stabbed as he tried to reach a target on frozen ground.
Mr. Deng accused him of a headache after which he lost consciousness.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood did not call the emergency number after it fainted and claimed it would have waited an hour before taking him to the hospital, police say.
But they found time to change Deng’s clothes, look for his symptoms on Google, and contact Andy Meng, the Brotherhood’s president at the national level, to ask for his advice, police chief Chris Wagner said at a news conference.
“At this point, members began to hide personal belongings and put the good of brotherhood practically before the good of Michael Deng,” Wagner said.
He could not be resurrected and died the next morning.
According to an autopsy report, Deng suffered repeated trauma to the head, trunks and thighs.
“Too many families have been devastated by fraternal rituals, since 1970 at least one student has lost their lives every year because of the rituals,” Deng’s family lawyer Douglas Fierberg said in a statement.
The brothers and their members must be held accountable, and this action taken by the authorities is important.
The Monroe District Grand Jury recommended that the first five members be charged with a third-degree murder.
Thirty-two other brother-in-laws, including Mr. Meng, will also be charged with rape and complicity in the murder.
“We want to hold not only those involved accountable but, if there is an organization that has authorized the Brotherhood, officially or unofficially, we will also hold them accountable,” Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch School banned the brotherhood and the national brotherhood withdrew its affiliation with the local representation.
This Is What Will Happen When the Federal Reserve Increases Interest Rate
The interest rate will rise and the bull market (the growing market) will plummet, bond profitability will rise and the economy will enter a recession.
That's what we know.
What we do not know is how long it will take and how long it will last.
In economics, history offers few indications of time frame..
After the first rise in interest rates, the recession occurred in just 11 months and lasted 86 months.
The Federal Reserve’s aggressiveness to raise interest rates is often, though not always, a determining factor in how the economy and financial assets respond.
That’s why U.S. central bank officials have emphasized so strongly that investors should focus not on when the interest rate starts to rise but on the trajectory of the time needed for normalization.
In fact, there are multiple variables in the game.
In the end, however, players on the market could find that all the agitation related to the increase in the interest rate has been exaggerated.
“The Fed’s first interest rate hike after the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some voices as a sign of the era of “cheap money,” said Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, in a note to customers.
On the contrary, we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest rates to more normal but still small levels to constitute the seismic shock that everyone seems to fear.
But it cannot be said that there will be no effects.
Below we present how some sectors of the economy might react, based on historical trends:
Given the situation that the market has faced in recent months, anticipation of interest rate growth can volatile things for a while.
However, at the moment of growth, the impact is not so dramatic.
“There seems to be a tendency for capital profitability to stagnate for 12-24 months after the first growth, which may again reflect the shift in monetary policy,” Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study on what will happen after the Fed’s growth.
In particular, in the last 35 years, the market Management has increased sharply - by about 14 percent - towards the increase in interest rate, quite unchanged in the period of 250 days after (average research of 2.6%) after which it returns to normal after 500 days.
Deutsche said the impact on the shares tends to become more pronounced later in the growth cycle of the interest rate and the benefits are beginning to decline.
Recession is a reality of economic life, but rising interest rates often contribute to it.
In the current situation, the Fed faces conditions that have not existed before and that could accelerate a recession.
Specifically, the gross domestic product will approach its historical low point for an increase in the Fed’s interest rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, of the 118 interest rate increases since 1950, only twice the nominal GDP was less than 4.5%.
Even though in the second quarter of 2015 the value was 3.6%, few expect the situation to persist, with the third quarter reaching only 1.5%, according to the Atlanta Fed.
Increasing interest rates in such a fragile economy could be risky and could raise the question “if this time is different,” Deutsche said.
Market players have been preparing for a growth decision by the Fed all year round, with all eyes focused on this week’s meeting of the Federal Open Market Commission, which closes on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe that the FOMC could approve an increase in interest rates on the occasion of this meeting, futures trades indicate a probability of only 25%.
“In our post-1950 study, all of the interest rate growth cycles to date have been in a super-profit growth cycle, with GDP eclipsing peaks before the recession very quickly after the start of recovery,” the report said.
On the contrary, this was a strangely slow recovery after the worst recession in the period analyzed.
The current cycle is by far the longest expected by the Fed since the end of the last recession; the record had been 35 months, and it has reached 74 months and continues.
Fixed income was also volatile given that the market is anticipating an increase in interest rates and the pattern is somewhat similar to that of dividends.
The main difference is that the impact is faster in the case of bonds than in the case of actions when the Fed changes policy.
In the case of obligations, the benefits seem to change direction as soon as the first increase/decrease in the cycle occurs.
At the end of the growth cycle of the interest rate, the profitability of the bonds immediately decreases,” said Deutsche.
Charles Schwab’s strategies are of the opinion that these interest rate increases will lead to the approximation of profitability between short-term and long-term bonds, flattening the curve.
High-profit bonds do better in such an environment, although “we are still precautionary about forcing profitability,” said Kathy Jones, a fixed income analyst at Schwab.
Interestingly, Jones believes that markets have already adapted to the expectations of the Fed’s policy.
“In addition to the power of the dollar and the expected drop in inflation, there are some signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of a more stringent monetary policy,” Jones wrote.
Short-term interest rates have risen, the profitability curve is fairer, the spread of the average loan interest rate has expanded and volatility has increased – all features of the market when the Fed tightens policy.
Largely speaking, companies that carry out their majority business in the U.S. will have to profit from rising interest rates and local products will become more attractive.
High-indebted multinationals will suffer because the rise of the dollar will lead to the cost of their products in the global market space and their debt will be more expensive.
"History shows that 'quality' stocks tend to be more profitable in the three months following an initial increase in interest rates," Goldman Sachs analyst said in a report to customers.
Firms with strong balance sheets outperformed those with a weak balance sheet after each of the interest rate increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004, with an average of 5 percentage points.
Companies with high capital gains as well as low volatility stocks also outperformed similar companies with lower quality, with an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points).
Debt will become an important issue.
Companies with a high percentage of floating debt have the most to lose, says Goldman.
Consumers will also benefit from the rise of the dollar.
Those who save may also have to gain, although experts do not agree on how fast this will happen.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, says MP Andrew Bingham
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham criticised the radio station for “stupid”
It says it is increasingly similar to the commercial opponent.
He also won the BBC Music Awards, claiming they plagiarized the Brits.
Colleague Damien Collins Attacked The Voice, Claiming That This Show Wasn't Original
BBC Radio 3 is "transforming into" Classic FM, an important MP said, putting pressure on the post to prove it does something commercial posts don't do.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told BBC chiefs that the public radio station is “stupid” and increasingly resembles the commercial opponent.
“I have the impression that Radio 3 is ‘stupid’ – although I don’t like to use the word – but I have the impression that it’s turning into Classic FM,” he said.
It also hosted the BBC Music Awards, which were launched last year in December.
The BBC Music Awards, released last year, appear to be Brits under a different name.
So if you’re trying to do something different — these are the two examples that come to my mind that only copy what’s already on the market,” Bingham said.
The BBC Director General has denied the allegations, saying BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial opponent in terms of live music and public education.
I'm not going to find out anything about the classical music I hear on Radio 3.
And his commitment to live music and production has no rival.
“In addition, I think it’s also important that Radio 3’s commitment to discovering new music and allocating new songs,” he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 editor Alan Davey said he needed to put more effort into attracting the audience to the previous period because the British have less knowledge of classical music.
But Radio 3 was not the only element under the BBC logo to be criticized at the Committee on Culture, Media and Sport meeting because it would follow in the footsteps of its commercial rivals.
Conservative MP Damien Collins has attacked The Voice - the talent show bought by the BBC from Dutch producer Talpa Media for the sum of about <0xC2><0xA3>22 million.
Do you understand why there are often discussions related to that show because it is not original and is not distinguished by anything?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC1 show - featuring Paloma Faith and Boy George in the jury - be made "in a BBC-specific manner."
He added that he wants the corporation to “find the chicken with golden eggs in its own yard” next time it launches an entertainment show.
However, he refused to ban future takeovers of new seasons from The Voice or to spend money going on licenses on other entertainment formats.
Internet sales recorded the lowest growth in August and could be to blame for Black Friday
In the first three months of 2015, online sales increased by 7%.
In the last month, there was the slowest growth since 2000 to date.
Online sales took off three years ago, thanks to the use of the mobile phone to make purchases.
Experts are of the opinion that November’s Black Friday could cause reluctance to spend.
For over a decade, online shopping has exploded and turned the shopping streets of Britain into ghost towns.
However, experts say there are signs that online sales are falling, with the latest figures indicating an increase of only 7% in the first three months of 2015.
The total money spent in August represented the lowest growth since 2000 to date, with an increase of only 5% in the last year.
Experts say there are signs that online sales are falling, with the latest figures indicating an increase of only 7% in the first three months of 2015.
“If we look at the level of growth from previous years and go back to 2000, there has always been a trend of rationalization over time,” Andy Mulcahy, the IMRG sales index editor, told the Guardian.
He explained that online sales took off three years ago, when shoppers began using their mobile phone to make purchases.
Thus, it increased the number of people who could shop online and could do it in various circumstances, such as on the couch.
But now that it stagnates a little, you might notice a decrease (increase).
The Black Friday phenomenon, imported from America, is mentioned as one of the reasons for the drop in sales.
In the opinion of the experts, buyers would refrain from making purchases before the event that takes place on the last Friday of November.
Last year, five times the average number of buyers squeezed in front of computers to get their hands on offers, which led to the collapse of the websites of several retailers.
Experts believe that Black Friday, when buyers struggled with chili peppers, could cause buyers’ reluctance.
A study published by the British Retail Consortium found that at least <0xC2><0xA3>1 out of every <0xC2><0xA3>5 is spent online.
In the case of certain products, such as televisions and washing machines, more than a third of purchases are currently made through online stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people prefer to buy clothes and shoes online than to appeal to fashion stores in shopping areas.
Following the sanctioning of the Bin Laden family, Muslims bury the victims killed after the collapse of the crane in Mecca
The bodies of 29 of those who lost their lives were roamed in the streets by Muslims, the first funerals taking place in Mecca.
Saudi Arabia has partially blamed the giant in the construction of the Saudi Binladin Group for the collapse.
The Health Minister said that a total of 394 people were injured following the collapse of the crane
In the streetwalk ceremony, hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims, killed by a crane collapsed at the large mosque in Mecca.
Dressed in white, those who mourned their deaths joined the road to express their condolences, until the first dead arrived at the end of their final journey to Al-Moaissem Cemetery.
The sad memory preserved by the holy place, where only a few days ago a construction crane collapsed through the ceiling of the mosque, falling on the faithful.
The bodies were released for funerals after the King of Saudi Arabia sanctioned the bin Laden family's construction group for the disaster, which also killed 394 people.
In the ceremony, hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims, killed by a crane that collapsed at a large mosque in Mecca.
Among the victims was the father of four children, Qasim Akram of Bolton, Great Manchester, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane collapsed.
Mr. Akram was in the Great Mosque with his parents before the beginning of the annual Hajj pilgrimage.
Saudi authorities have already promised that the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca will continue, with thousands of pilgrims still arriving in the city.
Today, King Salman stated that the Binladin Group should not have left the crane arm raised when the crane was not in operation.
An Arabic version of the decree, published by the Saudi Press Agency, said the Binladin Group was partly responsible for the collapse.
The news agency's English-language service did not provide the details, but said the company's leaders had been banned from leaving the country.
Earlier this week, Salman vowed to reveal what caused the crane to collapse in the courtyard of the Great Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims came before the Hajj pilgrimage that takes place later this month.
Binladin Group has not yet made statements about the collapse of the crane and representatives of the Group could not be contacted for statements.
The Royal Decree blamed the group for not using up-to-date security measures and not coordinating its activities with the meteorological authorities.
Dozens of cranes surround the Great Mosque of Mecca, as part of the massive construction effort led by the Binladin Group.
For several decades, the Binladin family has had a close relationship with the royal family of Saudi Arabia and is carrying out major construction projects.
The last leader of Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, was a “renegate” son, dispossessed by his family in the 1990s.
The crash occurred in strong wind and rain conditions, just days before the arrival of millions of people in the kingdom to participate in the pilgrimage, an essential journey at least once in the life of every fit Muslim.
Authorities say 158 people remain in the hospital.
The authorities decided that the relatives of the deceased should receive one million Saudi Riyals (174,000 pounds) and the same amount should be paid to those with permanent injuries.
The other injured will receive half of this amount.
Advantages and Disadvantages of Converting Credits to Swiss Francs
In the banking market, there have already been two offers for converting loans into Swiss francs, the main advantages being the exclusion of foreign exchange risk and the reduction of rates.
Disadvantages can come in a few years, when variable rates can lead to higher rates.
Transylvania Bank has just completed the process of converting loans into francs granted by Volksbank, and Bancpost has announced the conversion offer for its customers.
According to data compiled by financial portal analysts FinZoom, Bancpost offers three years of fixed interest rate, of 1.5%, the smallest on the market.
On the other hand, the conversion offer of Transylvania Bank was accepted by 83% of customers with loans in francs due to two successive reductions: the balance was reduced by the value of the risk and management commissions paid by the client, then an additional 22.5% reduction was applied to the balance in lei.
Both offers reduce the rates of their own customers, compared to what they paid monthly equivalent in lei before conversion.
Thus, the Bank of Transylvania reduced the rate by 42.5%, and Bancpost, by 33% in the first three years and, theoretically, by 18% in the following years.
Benefits
The main advantage of the cover in lei of loans in CHF is that the currency risk is eliminated, the consumer is protected from future increases of the franc, and the repayment of the loan will be done in the currency in which his salary is collected.
Another major advantage of both conversion offers is that there is no reassessment of the property, no further guarantees and no further proof of income are required.
In practice, there will be no new financial and legal analysis of the loan and there will be no additional costs as in the case of a refinancing.
Both banks also offer a discount on the monthly rate, compared to what customers paid before conversion, equivalent to lei.
Risks
The problem is that the rate in the first years is formed more of the yield, and the customer pays very little of the principal.
The Bancpost offer with a very small interest rate in the first three years seems advantageous to customers.
It is not known how this trend will develop after three years.
The margin offered to customers can be greater than 3.25%, so overall, and the cost reduction is lower.
A possible risk for all loans in lei with variable rates is that the ROBOR index will increase significantly in the coming years (more than the Libor index - CHF).
For example, ROBOR at three months is now 1.44%, but in 2013 it had reached 6%, in 2009 it was over 15%, and in a few days of 2008 it exceeded 40%!
In addition, other costs, not included in the initial offer, may also be incurred.
The time has come for interest rate decisions for the U.S. Federal Reserve
The world looks forward to the two-day meeting scheduled for Wednesday and Thursday, when the US Federal Reserve will make the crucial decision whether to raise or not to raise interest rates for the first time in about a decade.
In a Reuters poll conducted with 80 economists, just over half who last week thought the decision would be made, I now think the situation will be maintained for a while and interest rates will be kept in the current range of 0-0.25%.
It’s a historic event since it’s been seven years since the Federal Reserve brought rates to zero.
For the first time, we are facing a situation where a major central bank could give up the zero rate and initiate a process of normalization of interest rates,” said Angel Ubide, chief analyst at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The U.S. economy has evolved relatively well, bringing trillions of dollars into the balance sheet and generating a low level of inflation.
But the Federal Reserve must not ignore the less pink global situation.
He warned markets to prepare for growth, but there are signs that even they believe such a move is unlikely.
The decision will be announced on Tuesday, 20:00 CET.
Celebrities who have lost their charm
The actor (left), along with his son Redmond (right), has gone through stressful situations in recent years.
In 2001 he struggled with leukemia and in 2009 he lost his life partner, Farrah Fawcett, to cancer.
It is also rumored that the actor would have faced the problem of drug use and in 2008 was arrested for possession of drugs.
All of these certainly have a cost.
Manchester United player Luke Shaw has been on the sidelines for several months due to double fractures.
Luke Shaw suffered a double right leg fracture in Manchester United's Champions League match, ending with a defeat to PSV Eindhoven.
After the event that brought tears to the player’s eyes and will keep him out for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains optimistic that Shaw will be able to play again this season.
The injury came after an unwise intervention by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute after 20-year-old Shaw broke the PSV defense.
He received medical care for nine minutes on the ground and needed oxygen before he was taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said: "He has a double fracture in his leg and is in the hospital."
He will be transferred tomorrow, or maybe the next day, and then he will be operated on in Manchester.
"It's terrible - a boy who came to Manchester United when he was 18, he's in trouble, then he's playing fantastic and now that's something like that.
He was wearing his oxygen mask in his locker room.
Crying.
I am not a doctor, but at the double fracture the rest is six months and will not play in the group stage.
I hope he can play again this season.
It turns out that Moreno was lucky and got rid of the red cardboard and the concession of a penalty kick.
Arbitrator Nicola Rizzoli did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal suggested that the Italian official was wrong.
You can judge yourself when they say it's fault and red cardboard.
It was a very ugly, two-legged intervention.
Shaw tweeted: “Thank you all for the messages, I don’t have words to express how weak I feel, I start the road to recovery, I’ll come back stronger.”
Related news: Manchester United hit by injury to Luke Shaw in defeat at PSV
The England team’s founder has an additional reason to recover to play at the European Championship in France next year in June.
Phillip Cocu, PSV coach, said: "It's a very ugly injury."
Everyone is very sad when a player suffers such an injury.
“Our players never try to offend an opponent.
Moreno broke his leg playing for the Mexican national team against the Dutch national team led by Van Gaal at the 2014 World Cup.
“It’s very difficult for him because he didn’t intend to hurt his opponent, and when you hear that it’s a very serious injury, it’s not good,” Cocu said.
I didn't see the phase.
I could only see the ball, which was heading in another direction, so it looked like [Moreno] touched it but I couldn’t see the intervention on Luke.
In a statement to SBS6, Moreno said: “I know what it’s like, I know how difficult it is to go through something like that.
I feel so bad, I'm so sorry.
PSV player Andrés Guardado also arrived at the hospital after an intervention by Chris Smalling.
Adam Lyth risked England’s omission but still stands strong
Victory against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but after seeing the team selected by England for the tournament, I do not take into account a 3-0 rematch in the test matches.
I wouldn't eliminate the option of a win on the move either.
Alastair Cook’s team may have less experience than three years ago, but it has good players on the spin in the batting line and the collective morale is strong; they won’t be marked by the events of 2012 but will have a positive youth attitude.
Moeen Ali evolves as a spinner and Adil Rashid, although unknown at the testing level, is an option for attack.
Adam Lyth has left the England team for Test matches and has been replaced by Alex Hales
Obviously, as his head coach at Yorkshire, it is difficult for me to analyze the decision not to select Adam Lyth as a team.
He played the seven test matches against two good attackers, in difficult conditions, and the simple but hard reality is that cricket players are judged by results.
There were no question marks related to Joe Root, for example, until the announcements were made because - and I said that before - players are their own selections.
It's been fifty years and maybe Lyth would have extended her run, but her fate is in her hands.
I hope that if he makes more runs for Yorkshire he will have other opportunities.
England’s head coach, Trevor Bayliss, praised his attitude even when performance wasn’t as good as his ability and it doesn’t surprise me; first of all, he’s a team man.
It is difficult to answer the question as to how long a batsman is noticed in test matches.
Lyth had seven runs - like Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton had nine.
Only Compton was lucky at home and on the move.
The only dissatisfaction you could have had was that England preferred Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean tour - when Lyth was in top form - but that missed opportunity is from the realm of the past.
In the team comes Alex Hales, a batsman I quote very well.
He is a cricketer who has "Factor X" and which I noticed early at Yorkshire this season when he scored 236 against us at a Trent Bridge pitch.
It should be given at least the same opportunity as before, but this will certainly depend on the composition of the UAE team.
It was launched the idea that Moeen should open up to the bat alongside Cook, which would lead to an extra spinner keeping at the same time four quicks, and I have nothing against.
I don't see why a pitcher couldn't hit there and this left-handed player has already shown that he's being fucked.
Moeen may not have brought success to his district, Worcestershire, but he was No. 3 for them, so the difference is not great.
My old teammate, Justin Langer, played his first 38 Test 38 games as a first drop before entering the open in 2001.
He immediately erased three centuries and did not look back.
Zafar Ansari comes into the team on the back-up spinner and, although I had limited contact with him, it struck me that he is a very impressive young man.
People could judge his early age – with an average of 31 per bat and 35 per ball – and might think it’s a point, but there aren’t a lot of spinners and the selectors have opted for youth.
You will learn a lot from this tour.
England also made a few changes to the coaching team.
The appointment of Sri Lanka batsman Mahela Jayawardene as a consultant for the test matches could be a master stroke.
He is one of the best players and will bring a lot of experience, given that he played in any situation and against all types of attacks.
Paul Collingwood is coming for the white-ball leg of the tour and will bring both energy and unbridled ambition.
I’ve always believed he was born to be involved in international cricket, either as a player or as a coach, and like Mahela, he has intuition.
Sometimes, new voices in the locker room, even if they transmit messages that have been transmitted before, can bring fresh air to the team.
Colly Durham’s teammate Ben Stokes is resting for the one-day matches, Root got a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with that.
Although not everyone agrees, coaches and selectors do not make the program.
And you have to keep in mind, the jobs of the players depend on the results they get.
Decisions like this are never made easily.
Brexit Camp Could Have Caused Profit If the Economy Stays Calm By 2017
David Cameron’s renegotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU is getting more and more confusing, even without the brilliant Jeremy “Yes or No?” Corbyn’s choice to lead the Labour Party or TUC brings serious criticism of Europe on Tuesday.
Aliens also have characters like Corbyn and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomat explained in recent days that - immersed in crises similar to those in the EU - not all are internally challenged - some Member States are fueled by Britain's agenda of concessions and treaty changes, which most do not want.
In Brighton, on the occasion of the annual meeting, TUC decided that they did not want it either if it eroded social protection.
We could even call it Dave and George's selfie agenda.
The Prime Minister and the Chancellor participate in bilateral summits or sessions in foreign capitals, take a picture in front of a famous local monument, with or without the local representative, then return home and declare that they have won allies for reform.
It's just about me.
My European friend, who wants a UK outlook under the EU’s roof – “Don’t leave us alone with France,” says Berlin – suggests that several obscene ministers and officials from some capitals have come to the point where they don’t care if they stay or leave.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is extremely cautious, is an ally but has been at the forefront for 10 years and wants to leave her position before her situation worsens, as happened with Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16), who have been for too long.
In 2017, French President Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande will be re-sold or replaced.
And his power is in decline.
Poland could soon have a right-wing nationalist government, Spain a left-wing one.
It’s hard to believe that these will help the English who pose, whose energy would be better used to prevent Scotland from leaving the UK — a thing they don’t want either because most have similar separatist tendencies.
Thus, some ministers might even plan to intentionally make remarks that do not help, in the style of the SNP, in the 2017 UK referendum campaign to speed up the Brexit process, my friend suggests.
"The renegotiation was fixed" and "The UK did not get anything of value from the renegotiation."
The Europeans know on their skin how captivating Fleet Street can be and how sceptical the oligarchic press barons are who look at the EU with skepticism, because they did not participate in the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn who ratified our 1973 entry in a 2:1 ratio.
Perhaps they vaguely remember Boris Johnson, the Euro-opportunist, who became famous in the early 1990s when he was a Brussels correspondent.
Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
They included the mix of tax-exempt pockets, phone fraudulent foreigners and pseudo-non-domestics that own most major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair saw them the same way, but he realized that when you’re locked in a cage next to a nervous gorilla, you have to give them the bananas to distract them from the thought of eating you for lunch and tea again.
In fact, Miliband was more Blairite than Blair in opposition to Cameron’s idea of a referendum, given that Blair made a concession on the principle of the abandoned EU constitution, buried by French and Dutch voters in 2005, who offered him an exit card.
The press didn't forgive him for that either.
But Jeremy Corbyn, who touched me in the back months at Westminster - I told him not to waste his time with me - seems to be in danger of adopting Neil Kinnock's 80s boycott strategy from the egg, a mistake then and now.
It may be tough, but it needs to develop a coherent strategy of cooperation with the media, not with me, but with Andrew Marr, whose position on the BBC left her vacant on Sunday.
Corbyn’s official position towards Europe is what I would indulgencely call evolution.
He said he would like to remain in a reformed EU.
The majority of those who disagree with the “anglicism” of the Conservatives might agree with this.
That's what Hilary "A Benn, but not a Bennite" Benn said on radio and TV this week, when his researcher struggled not to admit that Corbyn's appointment as a "shadow" minister on financial issues was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 1970s, when his father struggled on TV to be disloyal to fellow workers, without going too far and without losing his job in the cabinet.
Hilary's fight was more attractive.
But the struggle to stay “in any situation” does not correspond to what McDonnell said and what JC said to colleagues and parliamentarians at the private meeting on Monday night.
Regardless of the image that Corbyn wants to convey - remember, he made me aware too - the discipline of messages remains important in the age of television and especially in the spinning of social networks, a focal point of paranoia and betrayal.
It is fair not to give Cameron a favour ticket in Europe, allowing him to take the backing of the workers in the campaign for the referendum, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins certainly believes this.
But McDonnell and Corbyin’s basic sophism about EU membership – in line with their anti-capitalist past – is no longer just an esoteric discussion among left-wing dissidents for which narcissism of small differences is a central dogma.
As in the case of his sophism about NATO – Tom Watson is unequivocal about the fact that JC will not campaign for resignation – foreign diplomats will be forced to try to understand.
Why should they waste Paris or Berlin’s political capital – and there are suspicious voters – on concessions to Britain when everything could be useless?
The U.S. is already quite disappointed about the weak military performance of the British in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a conservative government cutting costs, as I was reminded at the launch of the British Influence Security Forum on Monday.
Experts criticize the decision of the Department of Public Health of England on e-cigarettes
According to the researchers, the claims of a government agency that e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking resulted from a meeting between 12 people, some of them linked to the tobacco industry.
Experts from the editorial team of the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined the Lancet publication in criticizing the evidence used by the Department of Public Health (PHE) in its report on e-cigarettes.
PHE published the "reference" report last month and described it as a "complex analysis of evidence."
A few researchers, however, questioned the robustness of the data and pointed their finger at links between certain experts and the tobacco industry.
An article published last month in the medical journal Lancet attacked the “extraordinarily fragile base” on which PHE founded its main conclusion.
Two other researchers who write in the BMJ questioned the claims and their grounding “on solid ground or on moving sand.”
Martin McKee, a professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, a professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: “A fundamental principle of public health is that policies must be based on evidence of effectiveness.”
They said it is expected that PHE claims that “current estimates show that e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking” are based on a detailed analysis of evidence and models.
In fact, a single meeting involving 12 people led to the development of a multi-criteria decision analysis model (MCDA) that summarized their views on the negative effects associated with different nicotine-containing products; the results of this meeting were briefly presented.
McKee and Capewell or claimed that one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose chief executive was said to have received funding from British American Tobacco in the past for the conduct of an independent study.
It also validated BAT accreditation in public health in a sustainability report, he said.
They added that one of the 12 participants at the meeting stated the funding received from an electronic cigarette maker but not the funding that there are reports that they had received it from cigarette and tobacco maker Philip Morris International.
The arguments on the basis of which the panel members were selected were not provided, but among them are a few known "frontiers" in the production of e-cigarettes, some of them even declare the financing of the industry.
Other participants in the meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
The Head of the Tobacco Control Section of the PHE also attended the meeting.
The group’s research “convincingly mushcamalizes” the lack of “solid evidence of the harmful effect that most products have according to most criteria,” said McKee and Capewell.
However, none of these links or limitations are mentioned in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell stated that PHE's claims that "to date there is no evidence that e-cigarettes are a factor that encourages smoking among children or non-smokers" are premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, the director of the health department at PHE, says he has responded in the past to the claims made by BMJ.
He said: “E-cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking.”
One in two people who smoked all their lives lost their lives because of this addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risk posed by e-cigarettes is comparatively lower, but we must continue to study the long-term effects.
The PHE has a clear duty to inform the public of information that is and does not come from evidence, given in particular the high degree of public confusion regarding the relative dangers of tobacco.
Every year, about 80,000 people die from a smoking-related illness, and the annual cost of smoking by the national health system reaches <0xC2><0xA3>2 billion.
To put it clearly, the current evidence – that while the use of e-cigarettes is not risk-free, they only represent a fraction of the harmful effect of smoking – is fulfilling our national duty.
Illegal torture equipment - delivered to the door!
Advertisements that shame the UK’s arms trade
Watch the film made by Amnesty International against the arms trade fair.
Awesome killer drones!
Beasts for crushing ankles!
Dispersion bombs!
And electric sticks that cause scary pain without leaving any traces!
The cheering voice and animated images leave no doubt that this advertisement for the world’s largest arms trade is a snarl, made by Amnesty International to underline the British authorities’ desire to sell arms to repressive regimes through Defence and Security Equipment International at ExCeL’s Dock Centre in London.

But a separate campaign has also led to the display of a large number of posters at bus stations and in subways that need a second look.
“Important announcement, travel by DLR between 15 and 18 September?” says one of the ads, using the fonts and branding of the London Underground, the DLR line turning into the image of a tank.
In September of this year, a lot of arms dealers will land on the DLR Customers are asked to help stop the arms trade.
The 300 posters are made by artists who exhibited the works at the Cruel Designs Museum in Dismaland, Banksy.
A group called Special Patrol Group contributed to the distribution in London using "Ad Space Hack Packs", a 6-pound Allen key pack that claims to "facilitate access to about a third of the advertising space at bus stations on the planet."
London’s transport management is not amused by this “vandalism” in the form of steering wheels.
One of the parody ads produced by Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, Curator Cruel Designs and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists are increasingly asking questions and seeking to make political works accessible to the public outside the galleries.
Many artists are heading towards collaborating with activists in protest movements, realizing that they have to go out into the real world for their art to have an impact on society.
Another poster against the arms trade that welcomes the shuttles circulating by the subway.
The film made by Amnesty had over 100,000 views on Facebook in 24 hours and was created by the pro-bono advertising agency VCCP, and the graphic designer and voice-doubling artist also worked for free.
VCCP’s creation director, Matt Lever, was shocked by the silence around the advertising for the arms trade – with an empty space in the ExCel calendar – and thought, “Let’s give them the campaign they’re trying to avoid.”
They played with the realization of a more realistic advertisement but "enriching it with powerful animations and colors, it was more striking".
“They did a great job helping us increase our interest in selling illegal torture equipment at the fair,” said Tom Davies on behalf of Amnesty.
Now, it would be necessary for the UK authorities to take action and ensure that torture equipment is not illegally marketed and delivered to the door.
Perhaps the most creative form of art on the subject of the armament fair comes from within ExCeL, where exhibitors offer fantastic euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab released an order received from the U.S. military on “AT4CS RS with shoulder-supported launcher.”
This includes “a uniquely shaped focal point that delivers stunning effects behind the armor, inside the target.
Whatever that means, it won't be pleasant.
8 Golden Rules for Living at Home
It’s been 11 years since I moved home, when I was a 19-year-old boy who still believed in berets and moral relativity, but it’s only now that I remember the forced smiles of those I’m annoying — and the numerous complaints to others.
Most of the things I’ve learned can be summarized in the form of eight simple rules.
Moving into the home can bring states ranging from nervous breakdown to horror.
It’s tempting to tell people where you come from, if and where you’ve spent a year of study breaks, what do you think of Corbyn and why, “Honestly, you don’t care Marmite because, guys, it’s nothing but yeast extract HAHAHA, you find me in my room.”
Take a deep breath.
And help others to breathe as well - ask questions and show interest in yourself.
They animate the conversation and help you differentiate the people you like from those you wouldn’t be talking to even if the flood would come and they would be the only ones who would have boats.
Don't suffocate people.
Bedrooms are often full of parties with drinks, movie shows and social gatherings, but they are also the place where people dress and try their underwear.

Introverts receive special treatment at the university.
Your bedroom should be a refuge, but in many homes a culture of dormancy is being built, based on friendship, socialization and lifelong friends.
All of this can be terrible for someone trying to recharge their batteries.
Nothing in this culture allows you to say, “I like you and I want to stay friends, but I want you to leave to recover the energy I’ve consumed interacting with you.”
Try to log in when a colleague is exhausted by socializing – and try to send an SMS instead of knocking at the door.
When it comes to knocking on the door, do it.
A guy sitting in the same house as me had a policy that if a door wasn’t locked, then he was invited to come in.
He's seen a lot of things.
Make friends while you're cooking.
Since you start college in Bake-Off fever, if you knock on someone's door to get to know them and take a plate with blacks, it seems less strange, less like the situation of the 50s, "Welcome to the neighborhood, I've cooked something myself, now I'm smiling."
The homemade treats are a great way to make friends.
Your placeholders will feel compelled to stand by and may come to associate your figure with a tasty surprise.
Obviously, you have to be a good cook.
Coconut flour, sugar, and fat will most likely cause others to pretend to sleep when you knock on the door.
Theft of food is a common crime in student homes.
Obviously, if you wipe someone's chicken is stolen, but if you take a drop of milk to put it in your tea is still stolen?
Ask the owner.
It will probably tell you to serve yourself even if it boils inside.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying and I understand you - still try to approach the issue more mature than my home colleague, who colored his milk with liquid detergent to punish those who stole.
Now he's in jail.
Don’t make noise that won’t let others sleep or study.
That's not just because it makes sense, but because you're going on your own.
A girl on the stage with me asked her neighbor to give the music more slowly because it was 3 a.m. and had an exam in the morning.
Their reaction was to make the music louder.
When they finally stopped the music at 5 a.m., the girl was kind and let her sleep for two hours before she let go to the music, locked the door and left for the three-hour exam.
Wouldn’t it be romantic if the future husband/fighting wife moved on to the same level?
On the contrary, wouldn’t it be extremely strange if you’d confuse a roommate with your future husband, you’d get married, you’d split up and you should meet daily and maybe even see him get along with all the common friends?
Of course, you can’t resist the heart – but if a sexy co-worker is definitely not your future husband, at least try to be rational.
The exciting moment you realize that someone has left their keys in the unlocked room, the line between farce and intimidation is finer than it seems.
A successful farce is funny, but it can distort in a few moments.
Teach a fun and valuable lesson about safety by hiding something - but never dirty someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock the door and put the keys in a glass of water that you put in the freezer - but don't glue someone's goods to the ceiling more than twice.
Violinist David Grimal: In Bach’s time there were no world tours.
Beethoven, Brahms, Bartok, Enescu were working people, artists and not commercial representatives.
The French violinist David Grimal is one of the great artists of our times, known not only as a soloist but also as the initiator of a lesser-usual project, rightly "dirty", as he himself says, "Les Dissonances" - an orchestra formed by international soloists and talented musicians.
Les Dissonances was this year at the Enescu Festival with two performances: a performance on Sunday, in which the soloist was David Grimal, the founder of the orchestra, and a month, when the cellist Xavier Phillips was in the foreground, Enescu’s works were untouched.
Both performances, performed on the Athens stage, showed the audience a different way of playing classical music.
Les Dissonances appeared on the music scene in 2004, at the time being the only classical ensemble in which there was no conductor.
The director is the most important musician to musicians.
It is true, on the one hand, musicians need an education either to become soloists, or to become performers in an orchestra - they speak of instrumentals, not composers.
They are trained as "specialized workers".
They have the impression that they need a manager.
On the other side of the stage, for the public, all the musical fetishization is directed at the conductor.
And so, the business, the music industry, does its marketing.
So let’s not talk about music anymore.
So if we look at this world, we have skilled workers on the one hand, which is stupid, and an audience that can’t listen, but must look, which is stupid again,” Grimal said.
The violinist says that this change in the way he makes music came as a result of the "musical deceptions" of his solo career.
I was like a high-level athlete who had to do the same exercise around the world with different orchestras, to make a lot of money and to bring money to the music industry.
Ten years ago, when I was about 30 years old, I found this very depressing, because I no longer found human creativity and fraternity in this system.
So, I didn't find any more sense to continue on this path.
So I decided to create The Dissonances.
This happened in 2004, and at the time no one did anything like that without a conductor: "The musical world, extremely conservative, did not want such projects."
"How do I imagine you doing marketing with a collective of musicians in which there is no ego anymore?" asked the artist.
David Grimal acknowledges that Les Dissonaces is a "luxury", stating that none of the musicians who are part of the orchestra depend on the success of this project to live.
In 10 years of existence of the ensemble, the lack of a conductor did not prove to be a pedestal in the musical act: "The curiously, the more we sing a more complex repertoire, the simpler it seems, because all the musicians are obliged to be present in the opera and not just the role".
In Grimal's opinion, the Enescu Festival is a "very brave", precisely because he also invited Les Dissonances: "An extraordinary festival, where there are the world's largest orchestras that sing three times a day, and in the midst of these orchestras you invited this strange group."
In a temple of orchestral tradition, such as the Enescu Festival, there is a place and interest for something different that breaks barriers.
Speaking of Enescu's work, the violinist acknowledges that he feels the Romanian music of the famous Roman composer, so he did not need a special approach when he introduced Enescu's works into his repertoire.
Grimal notes that Enescu's music is very instinctive, but this happens when we talk about George Enescu and Romanian music, "because there is also a George Enescu who made French music".
Grimal argues for a change in the way classical music education is done, considering that "the profession of a musician, as it is organized today, has a death sentence" and that "the future of music represents music itself".
We don't need to tour the world five times a year if it doesn't help.
In Bach's time there were no world tours.
Beethoven, Brahms, Bartok, Enescu were working people, who were artists and not commercial representatives.
For me, the organization of concerts, festivals, tours, the release of albums, all are formidable, extraordinary, but as long as they do in the service of music.
If not, we are in a system where creativity suffers, it no longer has freedom.
To illustrate this phenomenon, David Grimal gave an example to Romanian products before and after joining the European Union: "In Romania, before you enter the EU, you had vegetables and good meat".
To enter the EU, you had to adopt health laws that are not good for vegetables and meat.
Production and agriculture are at the service of supermarkets, as is the case in France.
The same thing happens with music, it’s the same logic.
Les Dissonances make reds may not be very beautiful, but when we cut them are true reds.
In an ideal world, this music should go back to the center and the institutions and industries that manage this system should understand that music does not need to be sold, but needs to be partisan, and this can be done from the beginning with educational policy.
“If we consider – as Koreans, Chinese, Japanese do – that Western music is one of the most beautiful things of humanity, we would reintroduce its learning into school, we would reintroduce concerts on television and through this education we would no longer have to sell musical by-products,” Grimal believes.
Certainly, there are things in classical music education that remain very communist, that’s everywhere, it’s something very militarized.
It depends on this discipline if we compare a musician to a soldier, or if we form a musician who will sing to an instrument, being, above all, a musician.
We are talking about a completely different education, if we want to form a soldier (this education - n.red.) must be in a way, if we want to form a musician, it is completely different.
“What, in your opinion, is more dangerous, a soldier or a musician?” asked the French artist smiling.
Grimal shows that, for artists, the reward of another way of making music comes precisely from exceeding this "soldier" status, exceeding what "they think are their limits": "Musicians discover at some point that they are not soldiers, and that is why after the concert go out zambitors".
David Grimal spoke about his musical project and his vision of music and the artist at the "Festival of Ideas", a discussion with the public organized at the George Enescu International Festival by the Aspen Romania Institute.

Cinema City is looking for "Little Big Voices"
Cinema City launches the toughest challenge for children: duplicating two characters from the super-production "Snow White 3D"
Do you have a super talented and spontaneous child who likes movies?
Give him a chance to become a star.
In September, as part of the latest campaign dedicated to enthusiastic and ambitious children, eager to become future stars and who are between 8 and 16 years old, Cinema City is looking for "Little Big Voices", giving them an extraordinary opportunity to duplicate two characters from a famous animated film.
If in the classical drawings the emphasis was placed on the approximation of the voice of the actor to the specifics of the animated character, in the latter period, the creation of the story is also considered those who are going to interpret the voices, and they are usually very well known actors.
Cinema City Romania, however, wants to discover new voices and that is why we are launching an unprecedented campaign.
We want to find the right voice and challenge parents to enroll their children in our contest.
They will have a special experience, because the characters are cute and the replicas are funny.
"The children will have fun and have a real chance to be part of a team of actors," said Ioana Ionescu, Marketing Manager of Cinema City Romania.
In the first stage of the competition, from September 11 to September 30, Cinema City organizes a pre-selection after which 10 children (five girls and five boys) will be chosen to give a tryout in a recording studio alongside professionals.
All parents have to do is access the platform micilevocimari.cinema-city.ro, where to enroll the child in the competition and prepare him for the voice test.
Next, you have to choose one of the four movies available on the platform, download the texts that the child is going to read and then, the child will register interpreting his own version of the duplicate.
Four films about friendship, fairy tale heroes, magic and hope can choose competitors to support the test: "3D Yellow Penny", "Mune: The Guardian of the Moon 3D", "Blinky Bill: The Famous Koala 3D" and "Maya 3D Monkey".
In the end, the most talented two children (a girl and a boy) will see their dream come true and will double a character from the superproduction "The Snow Queen - Craiasa Z<0xC4><0x9B>pezii 3D", which will premiere in Romania in November of this year.
FedEx earnings are mixed, tax forecasts for 2016 drop
FedEx has said disappointing results for the last quarter, with the delivery giant cutting profit estimates for the entire year as a result of low demand for transportation services and increased costs for its ground transportation division.
The company also said it intends to employ around 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
In the same period last year, FedEx announced it would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
The company’s shares fell by about 2.5% in pre-market trading, 45 minutes before the sound of Wednesday’s opening bell.
FedEx Corp. said it expects to earn between $10.40 and $10.90 for the fiscal year ending May next year, with 20 cents less, according to an earlier estimate.
Analysts predicted the figure to be $10.84, according to a FactSet survey.
The declining estimate comes despite a 4.9% increase in prices on average, with entry into force on January 4 and higher surcharges for the land transport of large or heavy packages, which will apply from November.
The company said it still expects earnings to increase compared to the previous year as a result of cost reductions, higher revenues and the development of online commerce.
President and CEO Fred Smith said: “The firm is facing a considerably weaker economic situation than expected, especially in terms of global production and trade.”
The holiday-time employment plans were announced a day after the UPS competitor said it plans to hire 90,000-95,000 additional workers, roughly the same number of jobs it did last year.
In the quarter ending August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, 6% more than the previous year.
The earnings per share were $2.42, below the average estimate of $2.44 per share made by 12 analysts who responded to the survey conducted by Zacks Investment Research.
Profit increased by 5% to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts who took part in the Zacks survey estimated $12.23 billion.
FedEx has been hit in recent years by a decline in international priority transport, which has led to stagnation of revenues recorded by its Express unit.
But the explosion in online shopping has upset the results of the FedEx Ground division.
In the last quarter, the ground division’s revenues increased by 29%, but operating revenues virtually stagnated due to higher costs for large packages and own insurance.
The express unit saw an increase in revenues due to higher base rates, while revenues recorded by the freight division fell due to rising costs.
At pre-market trading, about an hour before the opening sound, FedEx shares fell by $3.85 or 2.5% to $150.15.
Closed Tuesdays fell by 11% year-on-year and by 17% from the record high on June 11.
On the occasion of the most anticipated meeting in recent years, Federal Reserve policymakers will spend two days this week around a 27-foot Honduran Mahogany table to decide whether it’s time to raise a key interest rate for the first time ever.
Above them, at the end of the central bank’s meeting room, will be seen a wall painting of the United States.
The map is meant to remind that Janet L. Yellen, Fed President, and his colleagues must put the economic interests of the nation above all else.
The Central Bank has received a double task from Congress: to maximize the employment rate in the U.S. and maintain price stability.
But since the great economic crisis, Fed leaders have confirmed that there is a third unwritten task: financial stability.
And this third task could be the factor X in a decision too difficult to anticipate, which will be announced on Tuesday, and which will determine if the US economy is ready to be debunked by the unprecedented stimulus offered by the short-term interest rate and the near-zero-starting 2008.
Even though most data indicate a strong growing economy, the recent turmoil in global financial markets could scare Fed officials already precautionary about adding volatility by increasing the reference rate to federal funds – even by only a quarter of a percentage point.
“Obviously, the labour market and inflation will be the first and foremost issues they will pursue,” said Lindsey M. Pigza, chief economist at brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
“But I think if they were looking for an excuse not to increase the rate of interest, the growing uncertainty on the world market is enough to give them arguments to wait longer,” she said.
There is no consensus on the Fed’s decision, which in itself causes instability in the financial market.
Approximately half of Bloomberg’s recently questioned economists anticipated an increase in the interest rate this week.
But financial markets are expected to delay the Fed, a key indicator showing that the probability of growth is only 30%.
This would indicate a fall on the stock market if the Fed raises the interest rate, unless policymakers would mitigate the blow promising it would take a long time to grow.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16,599.85.
The move was triggered by expectations that Fed decision makers would keep the interest rate stable this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody’s Capital Markets Research Group.
“It would be surprising for the Fed to raise interest rates right now,” Lonski said.
If the Fed’s decision makers would do so, “they should act in depth in their policies to avoid panic in the financial markets.”
Other experts said an increase in the interest rate would calm financial markets because it would remove the uncertainty about when the Fed will act.
Just a month ago, the Fed appeared to be about to raise the rate by 0.25% this month, the first small step toward a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would confirm the strength of the US recovery.
Yellen said in the spring and early summer that he expected an increase in the interest rate this year despite objections raised by liberals that more economic progress would be needed.
Although job creation slowed in August, the growth of the labour market was solid this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest percentage in more than seven years and close to the level considered by the Fed as total employment.
Wage earnings have shown signs of growth.
And while inflation continued to fail to reach the central bank’s annual target, the Fed’s decision makers said a key reason was the temporary effect of falling oil prices.
The economy “can cope with higher rates and needs them, given the tension in the labor market,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, global financial markets began to enter into fibrillation at the end of this month, after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 16% below the record high in May as investors feared that slowing the Chinese economy would pull down global growth.
The market declined somewhat this month, with the Dow index now at about 10% below the May peak.
For Fed decision makers, market agitation is added to the complex calculation of the moment of interest rate increase.
“Without what has happened in the financial markets and the news of the weakening Chinese economy in recent weeks, it would be more firm within the meeting,” said Stephen D. Oliner, an experienced researcher at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and the former Fed.
Now, he anticipates that they will wait at least a month to better manage the effects.
“There is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact will be on the U.S. economy and they have hardly any data to rely on after the events in China,” Oliner said.
The welfare of the global economy is not one of the major interests of the Fed, so it should practically not be taken into account in decision-making.
But in reality, the Fed has become the global monetary authority.
In recent years, the influence of the central bank has been enormous.
Ben S. Bernanke’s simple hint in 2013 that the Fed might “anger” its monetary expansion triggered an earthquake in global markets.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, Fed officials are expected to not only monitor progress in other areas, but also consult with other central banks and experts to better interpret the world economy.
Its decision-making process is “more art than science,” said Zachary Karabell, head of global strategy at the wellness management firm Investnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank in Richmond, VA, said this month that “the Fed has a history of oversized reaction to changes in the financial market that seem to have nothing to do with economic bases.”
Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Commission, a decision-making body that supported the increase in interest rates, offered as an example the 1998-99 decisions.
A financial crisis that affected Asia caused the Fed to cut the benchmark rate by 0.75% in three meetings, “despite the implications with limited identification potential for U.S. development,” Lacker said.
A year later, Fed officials reverted to those declines.
The Fed should put the issue of financial stability first only in the event of a major crisis, such as the 2008 market earthquake, said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England interest rate committee.
The last turbulent period does not rise far to that level, he said.
“We certainly don’t want to be in a position to be afraid of an increase in interest rates because markets have become angry,” said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still holds a double mandate and does not mention financial stability and, until something changes in this regard, I do not think it should take action prematurely.

Seven's Sunrise dominates polls, despite Nine's attempts to broadcast on the Today Show about changing party leadership
The urgent move of Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson to Canberra to convey on the subject the consequences of the changes from the leadership of the liberal party did not bring a significant increase in the audience for Today.
Channel Nine's morning show aired from the capital after Tony Abbott's defeat to Malcolm Turnbull.
The competing Sunrise show, moderated by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was caught in London as part of a series of broadcasts over several weeks, which included Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This “crossroad” of distance did not seem to matter much to Aussie TV viewers, Sunrise having an audience of 397,000 viewers in the five capital cities, compared to Today with 339,000.
Today saw a slight increase compared to Monday’s (317,000) and last Tuesday’s (283,000) audiences, but the numbers were lower than last Thursday’s (343,000).
Today has reduced the difference from Sunrise in the last few months.
In August, Today had an average audience of 318,000 and Sunrise of 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference varies between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far, in September, Sunrise has an average audience of 349,000 viewers and Today 314,000.
This is the most interesting thing that has happened throughout the morning.
This morning, it is not only Parliament that is affected by the current change!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thank you for the question!

The main news was the stunning debut of the 800 Words series featuring former Packed to the Rafters star Erik Thomson.
The new drama, featuring a recently widowed father who decides to move with his two children on the New Zealand coast, had a very impressive average audience of 1,219 million viewers.
Critics have asked if Thomson is able to do a show on his own without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
The results of last night's hearing were resoundingly "yes".
The X Factor show broadcast by Seven remained on the spot, with 1,136 million viewers, easily taking over The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
Seven recorded ups and downs on the second night he aired The Chase Australia.
The first half hour (17:00 to 5:30) of Andrew O'Keefe's new moderate general culture show had an average of 446,000 viewers.
The second half-hour (17:30 to 18:00) climbed to 623,000 viewers - enough for a small victory over Eddie McGuire's show, Hot Seat (613,000).
On Monday evening, the first half-hour of the show The Chase Australia had an average audience of 520,000 viewers and the second half recorded a huge figure of 720,000.
Hot Seat had an average audience of 620,000.
Chase Australia's second-night drop in audience will give Nine's silent confidence that Hot Seat will finally triumph at 5:30 p.m.
The Chase Australia replaces Million Dollar Minute, a show that failed to win McGuire's show.

Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin to meet to discuss the rights of homosexuals
In 2003, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the richest man in Russia, was arrested under gun threat at an airport in Siberia.
Because he openly challenged President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovski was convicted, his oil company, Yukos, was confiscated and his pro-democracy efforts were diminished.
Four people lost their lives after police fired rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police fired rubber bullets into the crowd demonstrating against the country's proposed new constitution, an official said on Wednesday.
The violence took place on Tuesday evening in the Rupandehi district, about 280 km west of the capital Kathmandu.
According to Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, the district police chief, more than 1,000 protesters gathered in front of a police station, and some of them threw stones and Molotov cocktails.
Mr Dhakal said police forces used tear gas after which they fired into the air before resorting to the use of rubber bullets.
According to him, 20 police officers and five civilians were injured.
It was not immediately clear why rubber bullets, which are known to kill but are usually used as a less lethal alternative, caused so many deaths.
The clash was the latest after weeks of violent protests in the southern region of Nepal, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say the new provinces established under the new constitution would dilute their political influence.
Protests have also occurred in western Nepal, where the Tharus ethnic group wants its own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, were killed in the violent clashes triggered on August 10.
when four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces – a major step towards a new constitution but an extremely controversial issue in Nepal, a centrally-governed country for hundreds of years.
The process of drafting a new constitution began in 2008, but lawmakers accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
This week in Kathmandu, lawmakers voted on the clauses in the draft constitution and officials said the new charter could be adopted on Sunday.
We will not use wire fences, dogs, police and weapons
The Prime Minister continues to exchange remarks with the Hungarian authorities.
At the opening of the government meeting on Wednesday, Ponta reiterated Romania’s firm stance against the refugee crisis.
We make every effort to manage the refugee crisis, all institutions have a coordinated opinion.
Romania does not agree and will not apply anti-democratic measures, guard dogs, wire fences or gunmen.
"It's a shame for 21st century Europe to apply methods from the 1930s," said Victor Ponta.
"The prime minister also said that all the data and details of the refugee crisis will be discussed and established at the CSAT meeting on Thursday," the prime minister concluded.
NHC announces 60% chance of cyclone south of Cape Verde Islands
A large low-pressure front about 560 km south of the southernmost point of the Cape Verde Islands is 60 percent likely to turn into a tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said on Tuesday.
Another well-defined low-pressure front about halfway between the Cape Verde Islands and the Lesser Antilles also shows a 60% chance of forming a tropical cyclone in the next two days, the Miami meteorologist added.
Weight Loss Surgery May Be Beneficial in Diabetics with Mild Obesity
The benefits of weight-loss surgery in people with mild obesity with type 2 diabetes could be maintained for at least five years, according to a new study.
It is still too early to say whether diabetics with mild obesity live longer after weight loss surgery than those following non-surgical treatments.
“It takes a long time to centralize mortality data,” said Dr. Robin Blackstone, a specialist in obesity surgery, as she wrote an article about the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Operations for weight loss, also called bariatric surgery, use various methods to reduce the stomach.
They reduce the feeling of hunger and limit the body’s ability to absorb food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has proven to be effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but most studies have been performed on people with morbid obesity with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a unit of weight in relation to height, is considered normal in the range of 18.5-24.9.
A BMI of at least 25 indicates that a person is overweight and people with BMI over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI by accessing: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers at Min-Sheng General Hospital in Taiwan used the data collected after 2007 in a trial comparing two types of bariatric surgery - gastric bypass and gastric gastrectomy in the cuff - in the medical treatment of type 2 diabetes in obese people.
The average BMI in people who underwent surgery decreased from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year of the study.
Meanwhile, BMI in people who received non-surgical treatments for diabetes remained at nearly the same level, namely 29.
Of those who underwent surgery, diabetes mellitus healed completely at 36% and partially at 28%.
In the group treated by medical methods, by comparison, diabetes mellitus cured completely in only 1% and in part in only 2% of the subjects.
In addition, blood pressure control, triglycerides and “bad” LDL cholesterol “were generally better in the surgical group,” the authors concluded.
The researchers also monitored blood levels of hemoglobin A1c, which reflects blood glucose levels over time.
The researchers write that the optimal level of hemoglobin A1c is less than 7%.
After surgery, the mean level of hemoglobin A1c decreased from about 9% to about 6%.
However, in the group treated by medical methods, it remained at about 8%.
But this improved “glycemic control” — reflected by improved levels of A1c hemoglobin — did not reduce the mortality rate to five years, according to lead researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results associated with the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, compared to the group with gastrectomy in the cuff, the group with bypass surgery lost more weight (18.7 versus 14.2 kg), recorded more significant decreases in BMI (7.4 versus 5.1).
Although the new study does not indicate a benefit in survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study conducted in high-weight people in Sweden that surgery prolongs life, says Blackstone, from the University of Arizona, Faculty of Medicine - Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, obese people who underwent bariatric surgery were about 29% less likely to die after 15 years, compared with a group that tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study did not indicate a survival benefit in patients who underwent surgery, Blackstone said it is an optimistic aspect for people with BMI under 35 who are interested in the procedure.
“This is the point where this work is critical because it states that this surgery is safe in the lower BMI group,” without an increased risk of death or kidney disease, she says.
Blackstone added that patients and their doctors should start taking the weight seriously when the patient’s BMI reaches 27-30.
“I think we wait too long until we urge people to take this aspect seriously,” she said.
I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have shortened their bodies predisposing them to obesity and diabetes, it is extremely difficult to get back to normal.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT news
Europe could not receive all refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis situation is in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader has sent an appeal to end violence in the refugee’s motherland.
The Dalai Lama spoke about the current issue of the refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Oxford Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion, dedicated to ethics studies, at the beginning of his 10-day visit to the UK.
He said that in the current situation, the interests of humanity should prevail over the interests of every nation and even every continent.
He also stressed that, while admirably, the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is inadequate to the situation.
“It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe,” he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised Germany’s and Austria’s efforts to deal with the crisis, he stressed that it is only a temporary solution.
“It’s a wonderful concern for a few thousand refugees, but at the same time we need to think about long-term solutions to bring peace and sincere development, especially through education, to Muslim countries,” he said.
Basically, we need to think about ways to reduce crime in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of force.
The force has never solved these problems," he added.
On the issue of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush’s actions after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, saying that the violent U.S. response generated an uncontrollable chain of events.
After the events of September 11, I sent my condolences in a letter addressed to President Bush and told him to solve this problem without resorting to violence.
I know his motives were strong, but he used force and generated unexpected consequences,” the Dalai Lama said.
Four-fold increase in the number of children who have taken hand detergent in the last 4 years
According to the Anti-Poison Center in Georgia, U.S. anti-poisoning centers have reported an increase of about 400% since 2010 in the number of children under the age of 12 who swallowed hand-washing detergent with a high alcohol content.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Anti-Poison Center in Georgia, cases of ingestion of hand-washing detergent in children under the age of 12 reported at anti-poison centers rose from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
“Children have more frequent access to these products and, unfortunately, a percentage of them reach the emergency room,” Lopez told CNN.
Lopez said some children drink detergent intentionally and others do so to impress their friends or to respond to challenges on social networks.
On YouTube you can watch movies that show teenagers how to drink detergent to create cheap drinks.
Adolescents seem to have mixed the detergent with mouthwash with alcohol to get a stronger drink.
Younger children may be attracted to the attractive smell of the detergent.
“A child doesn’t think it hurts them,” Lopez says.
Many of the most attractive types (handwashing) are the perfumed ones.
Hand detergents with the aroma of strawberries, grapes, orange are the most attractive for children.
Hand detergent contains about 45-95% alcohol.
Especially in young children, only a few swallows can cause alcohol poisoning.
“It’s very concentrated alcohol,” Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the anti-poisoning center at Kansas University Hospital, told Fox 4 in Kansas City.
Thus, we avoid leaving a glass of whiskey on the table, but people leave these hand sanitizers in accessible places and if the little ones get to them, this is a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently ingested the equivalent of four strawberry-scented handwashing sprays at school, has reached the emergency room for treatment.
She had alcoholemia179, twice the threshold at which an adult is considered by law under the influence of alcohol, according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency room doctor who treated her at Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah nodded and could not walk when he arrived at the emergency room.
Doctors monitored her overnight in a separate children's hospital to identify signs of brain damage as the girl fell and hit her head due to alcohol, Ritchey said.
“It was terrifying,” Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah’s mother, told CNN.
It could have been fatal to them.
Lopez advised parents and teachers to use alcohol-free wet wipes or napkins and not to leave the hand-washing product at the disposal of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some detergents have been associated with deaths.
In 2013, two Ontario women died after swallowing a handwash containing an undeclared toxic ingredient.
The health authorities assumed that the product contained methanol, a lethal substance, and not ethyl alcohol, specified as an active ingredient.
In January, three fourth graders in northern New York plotted to poison their “bad” teacher by “putting antibacterial products in the classroom,” according to a police report.
The teacher is very allergic to hand detergent and banned it in her classroom.
The police considered the plan to be "insignificant" and forwarded the disciplinary issue to the school inspectorate.
Rumour Mill: There are no disagreements at Celtic
Griffiths dismantles rumors about Celtic's misunderstandings, with Deila admitting that the Hoops aren't at their best, but they'll be back.
Hearts faces SFA over Neilson’s accusations and Warburton is cautious about January acquisitions that affected the team’s unit
Dons increase the difference from Celtic by five points
Adam Rooney's penalty in the first round brought the Aberdeens a close victory over the Hamiltons at Pittodrie, with Dons scoring a five-point difference between them and Celtic.
Griffiths dismantles rumors of misunderstandings
Rumors of misunderstandings arose at the Celtic, dismantled by Griffiths, who insisted that he and his team should not be subjected to increased pressure given that they are preparing to confront the leaders of the Dutch league.
I don't think we feel the pressure, I think the players can't wait.
The absence of the Scots in the race for the title bores the Dutch - de Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and former Dutch international Ronald de Boer said Dutch football fans have lost interest in the Celtics - because he is not fighting for the title with the Rangers.
De Boer, the current Ajax ambassador, said: “In the Netherlands I no longer give a summary of the Celtic matches; why?”
Because it's not the Rangers out there.
This isn’t just about the return of the Rangers.
We're talking about the old firm.
We talk about both teams together and that’s where the interest comes in.
The tension is high in the Old Firm matches and not only the Scots want to see these matches.
I'll change the situation, Deila promises.
RONNY Deila agreed that Celtic was fighting out of power, but the Norwegian boss promised to change the situation.
The defeat with Malmo and subsequent elimination from the Champions League was followed by the defeat against Aberdeen who played in 10 people, now at the top of the ranking with a five-point lead.
But Deila said, "Celtic have had periods before and they will come back."
We want to get out of this situation as soon as possible.
I know it’s very frustrating and a lot of people are extremely angry or sad about what’s going on.
We feel the same way, but we have to move on.
We need the support of Celtic because that’s how the players get better.
It is extremely important that we remain united now.
Warburton's Prudence for January Transfers
Despite recent comments just a few weeks ago that suggested he would have identified several targets for the January transfers, Rangers chief Mark Warburton is cautious when it comes to transfers, insisting he doesn’t want to affect the Ibrox team’s unit.
The former head of Brentford said: “The January transfer period is very different from the summer period.”
In the case of players transferred in the summer, there is the pre-season period in which they can be integrated, which you could have observed this season in our group.
The team is doing very well.
Sometimes you do more harm if you bring in players that are not needed.
Celtic targets Michu after retiring
The striker from Swansea, Michu, associated with Celtic during the transfers, suggested that he could withdraw at the expiration of his contract with the Swans.
The 29-year-old struggled with ankle problems for two years and failed to leave Wales in the summer.
Hearts confronts SFA over Neilson's comments
The Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was eliminated and lost 3-2, but the bottom red card was then cancelled - the third red card cancelled in eight months.
Neilson maintains his statements, insisting: "I have not questioned the integrity, I have not commented on the performance."
Griffiths vows to avoid Tynecastle
The invincible Hibee was captured after admitting to singing an offensive song about former Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident took place in March 2014, at a pub in the Roseburn region of Edinburgh before a derby with Edinburgh at Tynecastle.
"It was derby and it was the excitement of the moment," the striker said, adding, "I don't need to say I'm not going back to Tynecastle unless I play for Celtic."
Tannadice Council trusts management of Dundee United - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly insists that the Dundee United board is still confident that the management team will change the situation – but agrees that the decline on the ground must end.
I think Stephen Thompson trusts us.
We're going to bring the boys back in shape," Donnelly said.
McInnes is happy for "dirty victory" against Hamilton
Derek McInnes admits that the Aberdeen team must desperately cling to the Hamilton Accies to get their seventh consecutive league win, which brought them five points ahead of the Celtic due to the penalty kick in the first replay executed by Adam Rooney.
McInnes said: "There is no team that has won anything, in the cup or league, and that has not won games like this."
Unemployment rate in Scotland remains unchanged as it rises in the UK
Scotland’s SUMMARY rate remains unchanged, at 164,000 in the May-July period, while Britain’s total number of unemployed rose by 10,000, reaching 1.82 million in the same period.
The unemployment rate in Scotland was 5.9% higher than in the UK, 5.5%, according to figures presented by the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
Meanwhile, the employment rate in Scotland fell by 12,000 over the three-month period, with the number currently employed at 2,612,000.
The employment rate in Scotland fell in that quarter to 74.0% – a figure above the UK average of 73.5.
Scottish Secretary of State David Mundell, commenting on the latest figures, said: “The long-term plan of the authorities laid the foundation for a stronger economy.”
It has been almost a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
Over the past 12 months, we have seen improvements in the Scottish labour market, the employment rate, which is growing and the unemployment rate is falling.
Why I'm Watching an Execution in Oklahoma
In the course of today, except for a late legal intervention, I will look at how a man is condemned to death.
If it happens, and I hope it doesn't, I'll sit in an observer room in the Oklahoma State Penitentiary Execution Room and see how Richard Glossip is executed by administering the lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death.
The invitation came first in January, through his best friend, and although I was shocked, I accepted.
As the day draws nearer to the cause, the idea frightens me.
So, why should I do it?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way to tell the whole story of capital punishment.
It would offer a unique perspective.
It is true, journalists can witness executions in America, and because applications usually exceed the number of available seats, a macabre lottery takes place to decide who will be chosen.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of seats reserved for press representatives from 12 to five.
The elect will look at the execution with impartiality.
I can't do that.
I would stay with Richard Glossip’s closest friends, in addition to developing my own connection with him over months of phone conversations and a visit that lasted two and a half hours.
I like the guy.
We laugh a lot when we talk.
The prison authorities say I can’t be both a witness and a journalist, so I won’t be allowed to have a notebook and a pencil with me to write down what I see.
I'll have to try to remember all the details.
A reporter in Oklahoma accused me on Twitter of compromising my impartiality.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story as he wishes, get access.
I cried at her.
He admitted that he “could have formulated better,” but he still thinks I’m wrong.
Richard Glossip disagreed with some of the things I said and wrote.
Don't tell me what to write and I wouldn't do it even if she asked me to.
I told him he could remove me from the witness list at any time.
But he wants an international report to be present on the subject.
He believes that if he dies, advertising will help the movement against capital punishment.
Kim Bellware, reporter at the Huffington Post, will be with me.
If you want to learn more about the case, listen to the series of media files we made.
I'm not going to go back here on all the details.
I can't say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese make him guilty of complicity.
But I think he's most likely not guilty of murder.
I'm sure there wasn't enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
I think his execution is wrong.
And I'm going to watch him die from this perspective.
I can't claim to be totally objective.
For this, you can read articles written by other reporters.
From me you'll learn what it's like to look at a man I like dying useless.
Peter Moody claims the Stewards tried to spy on him and threatens to withdraw from races
Peter Moody claimed that the stewards Racing Victoria or tried to infiltrate a spy at his stables last year and threatened to immediately withdraw from the races.
He launched an attack against the stewards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria, claiming that they are running a personal campaign against him, the drop that filled the glass being the removal of Lady Tatai from the race due to a treatment given on the day of the race.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he has always tried to do what is best for the field of courses and that he is put in a difficult situation when it comes to the positive result on Lidari's cobalt test, for which he has no explanation.
For 18 months, he swallowed his words about the statements about spies and didn’t want to look like “the vulture that doesn’t reach the grapes.”
“I wasn’t going to say anything about that, and I’ve been silent for a long time, but sometimes you get to a level of frustration so high that everything suddenly buzzes,” Moody said.
It is known that it continued.
Sometimes you react and you have to bear the consequences, and I will have to live with what I said.
Tonight I will go home and sleep peacefully.
I want to head up and I want the owners I work with to see that I strive to offer them the best.
As soon as they start to think that this is not the case, I have to give up my coaching job.
At that point, I'll have to think about what I'm gonna do with my certification.
Previously, Moody dropped the bomb in an interview with racing.com in which he said the integrity department had tried to spy on his stables.
"Eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr Brian Stewart were standing in a room next to a man - whose name I'll tell you if I'm asked - and offered to hire him at my stables to provide information about the activity there."
Obviously, he thinks I'm a fraud.
If so, then they should all resign because they were incompetent in trying to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former President of RVL, David Moodie, current President of RVL, and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of RVL, knew at the time and still know today.
Should I think it's something personal?
Is it necessary for RVL to start having a spine and can draw people from outside trainers to account for what is happening in the industry?
Do I have a bad influence on the industry?
Is my influence on the industry so bad?
Maybe that’s how I see others.
Maybe he has to take my license and put me aside and I have no doubt that the statements I make now might cause him to think about this variant.
But I got to the point where I don’t care anymore and that saddens me.
I'm very sad.
I'll put pressure on them and I'll make them make a decision.
My family supports me and I can leave.
The coach’s frustration increased with the lengthy cobalt testing investigation in which Lidari was involved and the elimination led him to say he could “put his license on the table.”
Moody, whose name is most often associated with the training of the undefeated champion Black Caviar, labeled the rule of the day's treatment as "ridiculous" after a mud or clay cataplasm was applied to the horses' feet, which violates the rules.
It violates the rules of the course.
I have to take full responsibility for this,” he said.
One of my employees accidentally put mud on his leg.
It could've happened last night.
It could have happened yesterday, and that's what happened.
It happened on the day of the race.
Moody could be disqualified for three months for the day-to-day treatment of the race consisting in applying the cataplasm, for which the stewards opened an investigation.
It's a joke.
People who make these rules don’t know anything about horses.
“We all understand the need for rules, but it’s gone too far,” Moody said.
The driver who hit and fled the crash site in Cobram was arrested
Police arrested a man after a collision with a biker produced in Cobram at the end of the week followed by an escape from the crash site.
The cyclist was transported by helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital, being seriously injured after being hit Saturday morning by a car on the Murray Valley highway.
Police officials say the driver of the vehicle did not stop to help the injured cyclist.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man surrendered to Shepparton police.
It appears that he will be charged with fleeing the scene of the accident, failing to provide first aid and other road offences.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, remains hospitalized, in stable condition.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy responds to opponents in the wrestling charges.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy called the criticisms brought by his team’s plating tactics as “denatured subjects” brought into question by the NRL’s top two favourites.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said the referees allowed Storm players to "take the team down" in Storm's nerve-wracking game in the qualifying final played Friday night at Sydney.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a slight reference to Storm after his team's victory in the qualifying match with the North Queensland Cowboys, played on Saturday night, when he called the match two wrangling a "demonstration" of the quest's pre-league price.
Bellamy jumped into the defense of his team's plating tactics and said players were simply focusing on "contact" when playing.
Bellamy says he gained confidence after two important coaches criticized his team, which means they were worried that Storm would beat them.
“And things don’t stop here — I didn’t hear Trent Robinson complaining about wrestling when they beat us with a score of 24-2,” Bellamy said Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we haven’t changed anything all year in our defensive systems or techniques, only that in the last six weeks we’ve really focused on contact in placards and so we’ve changed the situation.
Trent has been in this position for three years and obviously he has a great team so he’s probably not used to losing and it’s been a shock for him.
We know what happens all the time during this time of year.
Bellamy contradicted Bennett's idea of "animating football", reminding his mentor St George-Illawarra Dragons of Bennett's winning the championship in 2010 by playing "complaining" football.
Wayne is talking about exciting football.
"He argued his opinion by comparing his Saturday night game with our Friday night game and talked about how exciting the game was," Bellamy said.
I remember that in 2010, St George received a lot of criticism because he was a boring team and Wayne said he wasn’t as interested as black under his fingernails.
But now he has a team that can play what I consider to be exciting football, especially thanks to the fast young midfielders.
This kind of game you want to do when you have such players.
He brought this argument in 2010, now he wants everyone to adopt his style of play - not every team has two middlemen like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt to be able to play that way.
“It gives me more confidence because they’re saying these things because they’re kind of worried about the game with us.
Six weeks ago they probably didn’t think about us when they thought about important matches.
Bellamy also pointed out that the game between Storm and Roosters was a more scoring match compared to the game between the Broncos and the Cowboys.
The Broncos match was probably a good match, I haven't seen it yet, how long was the score? 16-12?
Our game ended 20-18, in our game there were two more attempts, does that mean exciting game?
Or is it exciting to take a break and not mark?
There are plans for me.
If they talk about us, it means that at some point we could meet them.
Storm is free this weekend because they won the right to play at home with either the North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks in the finals of next Saturday's preliminaries at AAMI Park, the tickets being put on sale starting next Tuesday.
Stevan Hogg used the girl's phone to persuade paedophiles to send pictures
A pedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to ask for images of abused children.
Stevan Hogg picked up the girl’s phone while she was sleeping and then logged in to an online messaging service where another user sent her a series of indecent images with children as the subject.
The girl later woke up and noticed the disappearance of the phone, which she found in Hogg’s hand while he was sleeping.
He looked at the phone and found the disturbing messages after which he immediately alerted his mother.
Upon arrival, police saw the five photos and then analyzed computers found at the address and found "worrying" searches on the Internet using terms to find indecent images with children.
Hogg claimed to have done so to “attract pedophilia” on the Internet before “claiming to be a cop to scare them.”
Prosecutor Eilidh Robertson told the court in Dundee: "He said it was an addiction - that it is addictive to scare people.
He admitted that he did the searches on the computer but said he did so because he wanted to act as a police officer to intimidate paedophiles.
He was asked about the conversations he had with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and about the fact that he asked the person to send him other pictures.
He said he did it to sneeze.
He said he no longer thinks clearly when he drinks and that he wants to see images of rape and murder.
Robertson added: “When the girl found the messages on the phone, she screamed at her mother and trembled and cried.
The girl saw the indecent images on the phone and the accused was confronted.
The girl was interviewed and told that the defendant was using the computer and the Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Last year, on June 14, 23-year-old Hogg, domiciled in Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty to the accusations that he made or took indecent pictures of children, and violated the conditions of parole conditional on January 24 this year and did not attend.
The defense lawyer, Gregor Sim, called for Hogg not to be registered in the sex offender register because it can be said that the crime “did not involve a significant sexual aspect.”
Judge Alistair Carmichael postponed his sentence until October on social media grounds.
Hogg was released on bail in this file but remained in custody before appearances for other files.
He was registered as a sex offender before he was convicted.
Robert Mugabe, President of the Republic of Zimbabwe, delivered the wrong speech in Parliament
At the beginning of the year, Mr Mugabe, the oldest African leader, fell on the steps of a podium.
He was not hurt, however, filming the fall became viral on social media.
The opening of the parliamentary session was also disrupted by opposition representatives who claimed that they had received anonymous death threats, threatening them not to somehow evade Mr Mugabe during his speech.
Last month, they slammed him during his speech in Parliament - a speech he repeated Tuesday.
Innocent Gonese, head of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) parliamentary group, said seven opposition politicians had received text messages on their mobile phones, warning them not to disrupt Mugabe's speech.
“The message was sent by a hidden number but is titled ‘death,’” he told reporters after Mr. Mugabe’s speech.
He warns the parliamentarians concerned that immunity only applies in Parliament and once they leave Parliament, parliamentary immunity is no longer valid.
The head of the parliamentary group said the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, is "concerned" about the threats transmitted to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard to make 30,000 releases
Hewlett-Packard is expected to make between 25,000 and 30,000 deployments as part of the company’s restructuring and cost reduction efforts in the service sector.
This year, HP will be split on the exchange into two companies, separating the computer and printer division from the operations with the company’s growing hardware and services.
The planned deployments will bring costs of about $2.7 billion starting in the fourth quarter, HP said.
“These restructurings will bring a more competitive and sustainable cost structure to the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise,” said Meg Whitman, President and CEO of HP, who will lead the unit after the break-up.
“Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP today and will have a broad portfolio of businesses that will contribute to the company’s transition to the new business style,” Whitman said.
Working as a separate company, we are better positioned than ever to meet the growing demands of our customers around the world.
According to a statement from the company, Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have annual revenues of more than $50 billion and “concentrate on providing integrated solutions without rivals” addressed to companies.
A company founded in 1930 by graduates of Stanford University, Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, whose activity was the production of electrical equipment and whose garage in Palo Alto was called the "Silicon Valley Lawn".
HP has undergone a massive reorganization to adapt to the transition from traditional computers to mobile devices.
The measure taken by HP, the world’s second-largest computer manufacturer and one of the largest technology companies in the U.S., is the latest in the field, based on the idea that companies that focus their attention better in one direction have better performance.
FriendsFest: The Comedy Series That Taught Us Important Lessons About Men's Friendship
The absence of similar characters in the series is evident, given that the need for men to open up is now more desperate than ever, with suicide rates among young men reaching a peak in the last 15 years.
In 2013, suicide was the leading cause of death in men aged 20-45 in the UK, and remains three times more common in men than in women.
In an attempt to address the problem, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) has designated 2015 as the Year of Man, wanting to question the culture that prevents men from asking for help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of the struggle for the success of this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 high school students who had symptoms of depression concluded that if the patient is surrounded by enough friends “with a healthy mood,” his chances of recovery double.
Similarly, for people who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends halves the likelihood of mental disorders.
Of course, in order for friendship to work, it must first be accessible.
In this era of social media-dominated communication, where the emphasis is on style and not substance, the immediate nature of the response often takes precedence over contact with meaning.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to create the appearance of a strong personality, open to fun and success, even if in reality isolation is the dominant one.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values; money, image, social status, all at the cost of intrinsic values—our inner desire for personal development and friendship—which also profoundly affects our mental health.
The billionaire inventor of a video game recently explained that money doesn’t even buy happiness.
The beauty of the Friends series was that it drew attention to this idea.
The characters were not defined by the job but by their own personality, which they showed by interacting as friends.
The humour of Joey and Chandler’s frequent embraces, the moments he looks at football in his comfortable armchairs, and Ross’s passion for Rachel come from the fact that it is known that men can associate with this situation, even if they often refuse to fully explore their feelings.
As one social worker explained to me: “My role in listening to people who are suicidal and depressed has shown how even the smallest interactions with friends can make a difference.”
Often, people who call us don’t feel able to talk to their friends.
The old saying of dealing with yourself is strong, as is the feeling of being perceived as a weak person if you talk openly about problems.
Friends is one of the series that comes to mind when I try to offer more long-term psychological adaptation mechanisms.
The series highlights the small moments of friendship between men.
No matter how much objective, external intervention helps, through the phone, people arrive in moments of despair, long-term support comes from family and close friends.
So, if you participate in this weekend at the FriendsFest organized by Comedy Central, with the complete playback of the filming plates to celebrate the event, why not invite your friends to a coffee in Central Perk.
Or, better yet, if you see someone alone in Starbucks, smile and say hello.
You never know what a difference your friendship can make.
Friends is broadcast by Comedy Central from start to finish - all 236 episodes - on the occasion of <0x23>FriendsFest
Di Maria Marks and Helps PSG Give Malmo Away
Angel Di Maria celebrates alongside Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after scoring against Malmo.
Angel Di Maria scored Tuesday in his Champions League debut and helped PSG take on the Swedish side Malmo.
Below we present the chronicle of the game and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani did their homework, Paris Saint-Germain starting the Champions League series with a calming 2-0 win against Malmo in the game played Tuesday at the Parc des Princes.
Di Maria scored in less than four minutes from the start of his debut match in the Champions League in the PSG team, bringing the French champions in an advantage though they missed a number of occasions before securing their advantage with the goal scored by Cavani in the 61st minute.
Arriving in Group A alongside Real Madrid and Shahtior Donetsk, Paris needed a strong start against the Swedish champions because the goal of the French team is not only to qualify optimally but also to improve the path to the quarterfinals in each of the last three rounds.
However, although they took the points, Laurent Blanc's students were far from a perfect picture, with Zlatan Ibrahimovic wasting the goal after being replaced by his hometown team and the club at which he began his brilliant career in 1999.
“It’s not easy to win at home or on the move in the Champions League, so a 2-0 win creates problems for our opponents and makes a comfortable difference to the next-place finishers, even if there are other aspects that we have to perfect throughout the season,” Blanc said.
It's a good sign.
We wanted to win and we did, although I’m sorry we didn’t manage to score one or two more goals.
Ibrahimovic returned after injury to one of three changes to the Paris team, with a 2-2 draw at Bordeaux's home in Liga 1 on the weekend, but Di Maria took over the spotlight in the fourth minute.
Last month when he was transferred from Manchester United, the Argentine offensive midfielder was named the man who will take PSG to the next level in Europe and demonstrated this when he stabbed Marco Verratti behind Malmo's defense before shoving unbelievably over the Johan Wiland in the corner.
But if someone expected PSG to win by punching their fingers, they were disappointed.
Malmo, who defeated Celtic in the play-off to reach this stage and entered the field with nine national team titles, with a five-man defense and two defensive midfielders, was a strong opponent.
But their attack was not impressive, with the exception of Nikola Djurdjic's shot that passed Kevin Trapp's post in the 34th minute.
Instead, PSG players slowed the pace a few times, taking a few unnecessary passes and not finishing the interventions, even Ibrahimovic who missed no less than five attempts only in the first replay and was then replaced by Cavani even after the game resumed.
Ibrahimovic, however, proved to be much more skilled in supporting his teammates, his concern being the one that Di Maria sent in a deflected shot by Wiland over the gate in the 52nd minute.
The second goal was scored in a final after an hour away from the match, thanks to Cavani, the Uruguayan who scored the sixth goal of the season after Ibrahimovic passed from Maxwell's centre.
This goal eliminated the Malmo hopes of rebalancing the score and only a superb stop of Wiland from a distance for the rejection of David Luiz maintained the final score before new entry Ezequiel Lavezzi canceled a goal in the extensions.
Malmo’s Norwegian coach, Age Hareide, later said PSG was with a class over and that “The last game I played in the Champions League was in December last year.”
Since then, I have only played in the Swedish league, which does not rise to the same level.
The qualifications are not enough.
Down the hat for PSG.
They did an excellent game.
Glencore Collects $2.5 Billion in Stock Sales
Swiss mining giant Glencore, hit by the fall in stock prices on the commodity exchange, has raised $2.5 billion from the sale of shares as part of a broad plan to massively reduce debt.
The company, listed on the London Stock Exchange, said it had sold new shares worth <0xC2><0xA3>1.6 billion to pay off the debt.
After losing 57% of its market value this year, the company is catching up with falling prices on the commodity exchange, because China’s decline in economic activity influences demand and causes disaster in markets.
The preferential right to subscribe has raised the price of Glencore shares on the London Stock Exchange in Wednesday morning transactions.
Shares rose by 2.77% to 131.60 shillings at the FTSE 100 index, which opened at a value of 0.69% higher.
Glencore has revealed the sale of $2.5 billion worth of shares as part of broader plans to cover nearly a third of its $30 billion debt.
The company sold the new shares at a price of 125 shillings per share, 2.4% less than Tuesday’s closing price.
It took 1.3 billion shares from the company, representing 9.99% of the group.
Concerns about the growth of the Chinese economy in prolonged stagnation led to a substantial increase in iron ore prices by about half, and coal, copper and other commodities fell by 20-40%.
Xi calls for wider expansion of the global economy.
On Tuesday, President Xi Jinping told a reforming group that the economy needs to open up to the outside world more broadly to fuel growth.
“China must commit to attracting foreign investment and expertise and to improving openness policies,” Xi said at the 16th Meeting of the Central Leading Group for Deepening Overall Reform (CWG).
Promoting openness and encouraging reforms will bring new impetus and vitality and make room for economic growth, Xi said.
The steering group adopted a series of guidelines, including a negative list of market access regulation, loosening customs control policies, encouraging state-owned enterprises to absorb private capital and reorganising the resident registration system.
According to the statement, a negative list will be drawn up that will identify sectors and areas of activity in which investments are not allowed.
The system will be gradually tested and improved through test programs.
According to the statement, the measure is important because it will give the market a more important role in allocating resources, ensuring a legislative-based business environment and providing a wider market opening.
State authorities will also weaken controls over the powers they delegate to companies, ensuring that these companies decide how to run their businesses.
Also, according to the statement, China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms for promoting regional growth.
In an attempt to open up state-controlled sectors, more sectors will be open to private investment.
“The state authorities will not change their foreign investment policy and will protect the legitimate interests of companies established from foreign investment and will provide better services to them,” the statement said.
In addition, it will be easier for foreign nationals to apply for permanent residence permits or so-called "green cards", optimising requirements and streamlining the application process.
The meeting also discussed the guarantee of the right of lawyers to practice and the education of judges and prosecutors.
The meeting was attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang and leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, according to a statement made after the meeting.
The unions in education, dissatisfied with the government's proposal to increase wages by 10%
Negotiations between Prime Minister Victor Ponta and the leaders of the unions in Education did not reach any result, with the government proposing a salary increase of 10%, from December 1, with pay to January 1, 2016, and the unions wanted a growth of 15%, in November, or one of 20%, in December.
The discussions took place at the Victoria Palace on Tuesday evening, the prime minister being accompanied by the Minister of Education, Sorin Cimpeanu, the Minister of Finance, Eugen Teodorovici and the Minister of Labour, Rovana Plumb.
The proposal of the Government today did not satisfy us, otherwise we would not have been in a position to summon the heads of our federations.
The 10 percent that we are promised today is less for us than we expected.
“In fact, these 10 percent are the money that we have stipulated in our agreement with the Government last year for 2016,” said Anton Hadar, president of Alma Mater, at the end of the talks.
In the future, health and education will be the areas where we will invest all the money we have.
According to him, Thursday, there will be a meeting of the FSLI, which will also be attended by representatives of the Government to present to the representatives of the confederations of the country the proposal of wage increase, following the unionists to decide whether to accept the offer of the Executive.
The prime minister also told unionists that the government is trying to send the Wage Law to parliament as soon as possible so that it can enter into force on December 1.
The normative act envisages an increase in salaries in the educational system by 25% of the total increase of 70%, an increase provided in the document to be elevated over the next four years.

Immigrant Crisis: Tragedy in the Aegean Sea
At least 22 migrants drowned in Turkey’s territorial waters on Tuesday after the ship they were in sank.
Among the victims are 11 women and 5 children, according to Yahoo News.
The boat was in the Aegean Sea and headed for the Greek island of Kos.
Turkey's coast guard said it had rescued 249 people on the wrecked boat, but their nationality is not yet known.
Earlier, on Monday, two other people died while trying to cross the Aegean Sea.
Also over the weekend, 34 migrants, including 4 babies and 11 children, drowned on the Greek island of Farmakonisi, 15 kilometres off the Turkish coast.
The situation was similar: the ship carried more people than its capacity, so it sank.
The route has become popular lately for immigrants who want to escape the war and the harsh life of countries like Syria or Iraq.
Over 100 stewardesses fired for being too fat
Air India has fired about 130 stewardesses and stewardesses for being overweight, the airline said at the end of last week.
The state company said the decision was made for security reasons and recent government regulations, but critics said the measure was “ridiculous” and “so much sexist.”
Resignation at the table is the latest in a ten-year struggle between the company and the busiest stewardesses.
The weight limit for these dates back to the 1980s, when Air India began to use charts with the ideal weight and height.
In 2006, Air India fired the nine stewardesses considered "exceptionally overweight", as this "may have an effect on the reflexes and may impede the agility needed to carry out emergency measures."
The stewardesses sued the company, won and were re-employed, but the company fired them again in 2009.
“All efforts to make them lose weight have failed,” a spokesperson for the company said.
Steaua footballer gives lessons to Gigi Becali: What decision he made
A star footballer gives Gigi Becali lessons on the promotion of young players.
If the champion's financier decided to close the football academy in which he invested a considerable amount, founder Paul Papp opened a football school.
The "Paul Papp" Academy will operate in the town of Dej, while the villagers are waiting for a first selection action.
I am extremely happy that I have reached this stage, to give the start of the Football Academy that bears my name.
For me, it is extremely important to find talented children who can play football without having to worry about material training.
They need to have one concern: to play football as best as possible.
Technical details do not have to be taken care of.
They need to put their talent in value.
This is what he wants to do at the Football Academy 'Paul Papp'.
"I am also waiting for Mayor Costan Morar at the first selection of the children, to show them that he is with them," Papp told dejeanul.ro.
At the Star Foundation Academy, children under the age of 11 are expected.
The whole party wants to govern.
The interim president of the PSD Liviu Dragnea said on Tuesday that the entire party wants to remain in government, and if the prime minister wants, the PSD Congress will formalize this decision.
I understand that Mr. Ponta is waiting for this decision from the PSD Congress, everyone wants to go to government, the whole party.
If we want to formalize it through a congressional decision, we will do it too.
There won't be any emotion about it.
"There have been no elements, votes in the party, opinions in the party that give someone uncertainty to the government or that give someone the impression that someone in the party does not want the PSD to remain in government, in the current government, with the current Prime Minister," Dragnea said at the end of the session of the Permanent Bureau of the PSD National.
PSD announces when Congress will be held - what will be decided then
Prime Minister Victor Ponta said on Tuesday that it is important that the PSD Congress, beyond the election of the leadership, give a clear message whether it wants to continue the government or if the party decides to move to the opposition.
Dragnea: I will announce Monday whether I will be running for a position in Congress
On the other hand, Liviu Dragnea will announce next Monday whether he will run for a leadership position at the next Congress.
I will sing, Monday, after the Executive Committee, if the date of the congress is established.
"I will announce if I will run for a position in the leadership of the party," Dragnea said at the end of Tuesday's session of the National Permanent Bureau of the PSD.
Asked if the hesitation regarding the announcement of the candidacy has anything to do with his file, Dragnea said he did not have this problem.
I don’t have the problem you’re referring to, but I think it’s fair and honest with all my party colleagues to announce me a candidacy or not as soon as the Congress date is formally established.
"It's the only motivation," Dragnea said.
The vast majority of the Social Democratic affiliates proposed the extraordinary PSD Congress on October 11, and the exact date of the Congress will be decided Monday by the party’s Executive Committee.

"In the research, the young people stated that they intended to arrive in France, a fact for which they contacted a national, through which they met with the Italian driver, who offered to transport him to his destination, where he was to receive 2,000 euros of the person," the statement said.
The two migrants were prepared "criminal work under the aspect of saving the crime of attempting to fraudulently cross the state border".

As for women, 33% said they were satisfied, 24% were very satisfied, 8% were very dissatisfied, 14% were slightly dissatisfied and 19% chose the appropriate category.
When we look at the degree of satisfaction (positive), we will notice that men are more satisfied.
As for the neutral state (appropriately), we see a difference of two percent.
“Also in the very unsatisfied situation, the biggest difference is recorded at the slightly unsatisfied response where we see a difference of 6 percent,” the statement said.
The study also found that a quarter of Romanians (26%) spend an hour or even less time together, 18% spend between five and eight hours together, and 45% between two and four hours.

What Happened to Coach Darren Cahill?
Simona Halep is faced with a crucial decision for her career as she has to choose whether or not to continue to work with coach Darren Cahill.
The two worked this year as part of the Adidas Player Development program, with the Australian technician being with romance only on major tours.
Simona had only words of praise to Cahill, who seems to be the only coach who managed to impose himself in front of the sporting whim.
The Adidas program will end at the end of this year, and Halep has to decide whether to give Cahill a consistent contract or give up his collaboration.
We don't know exactly what's going to happen yet.
We talk and see.
“After Singapore I will be able to give an answer,” Simona testified at a press conference.
Darren Cahill is one of the most expensive coaches in tennis today, asking for a contract of about $1 million a year.
In addition, the Australian is also a sports commentator, a profession he would not want to give up at the moment.
The last event Simona and Cahill will work together on is the Champions Tournament in Singapore.
It wasn't normal, I wasn't respected
Victor Piturca revealed how he broke up with Romania’s national team last fall.
The former selector testified that he did not understand the FRF president, Razvan Burleanu, after he took the place of Mircea Sandu, and thus made the decision to leave the national.
In the end, he proposed to the head of the Federation to substantially increase his salary in order to stay, but he was refused.
At the moment, I'm not sorry I left the country.
Then I was sorry, we left a job behind.
So I thought it was good for me and I think it was good for me.
What happened to me when I was a selector was not normal, I was not respected, my work was not respected.
I worked well with the former Federation, but when Burleanu came to the Federation he came up with a preconceived idea, he didn't know me, he found out different opinions in the press about me.
It didn’t change me because it was very difficult at the time, with the results I had, plus the financial situation was in the middle.
We continued the work, everything went very well and he probably changed his ideas too.
But I wanted to leave.
If he wanted me to stay, then I proposed an extension of the contract.
We have around 400 and some thousands of euros a year, we are going to have around 600,000 euros.
I didn't talk to Burlean, I talked to him with his right hand.
"It was agreed, but only if we finished first in the group," said Victor Piturca at Dolce Sport.
Victor Piturca resigned from the national team of Romania in the autumn of last year, although the team had good results in the Euro 2016 preliminaries.
The technician accepted the proposal to train in Saudi Arabia, he immediately taking over the Al Ittihad group.
Armoured and water cannons at the border
Hungarian police have detached Humvee military vehicles equipped with machine guns at the Serbian border, after violent clashes on Wednesday, when water and tear gas cannons were used against immigrants who wanted to penetrate from Serbia, despite the fact that a garrison of U.S. troops was used.
At least 20 police officers and two children were injured in clashes, Russia Today reports.
So far, 20 police officers have been injured and the ambulance service has taken over two children who were injured after being thrown over the security fence.
"We will rebuild the fence and strengthen it and protect Hungary's security by any means possible," Prime Minister Gyorgy Bakondi said in a statement.
Police have tried to control with the cannons of water and tear gas the crowd of people throwing with plastic bottles, stones and pieces of floor.
Authorities reported that dozens of immigrants broke the fence at the crossing between the cities of Roszke and Horgos and managed to penetrate the country.
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto has called on Serbia to take measures against "very aggressive" immigrants from the border.
There are reports that the Serbs supplemented their forces at the border.
Following the incidents on Wednesday, Budapest suspended the crossing of the Roszke-Horgos border for 30 days.
Hungary is in a concerted effort to close its borders in order to secure access for immigrants.
If Tuesday announced that next to the sardine fence on the border with Serbia will raise one on the border with Romania, to the vehement protests in Bucharest on Wednesday, the Hungarian Prime Minister announced the raising of a fence on the border with Croatia.
A rare disease that a man suffers from
The American Nick Hess was banished from his family as an alcoholic, his wife even filming him when he was stifled, could hardly stand up and his words were hard to understand.
Although the 35-year-old man said he did not drink alcohol, he was clearly in a state of intoxication.
When he first accused me of being drunk without drinking, I thought he was crazy.
"But friends and family thought 'maybe he drinks alone, he's an alcoholic in secret,'" he said.
When he saw the footage of his wife with him, the man from Columbus, Ohio, simply didn’t recognize himself: “I was looking into my eyes and I wasn’t there.”
'It was terrible, I didn't remember anything.'
In addition, his wife, who, although he hesitated for a while, eventually went with him to countless doctors, remembers that Nick's breath smelled of alcohol.
The moment that made Nick think the most was when, after a minor accident, when he was hit by another car, it was discovered that he had an alcoholism three times over the legal limit, although an evening earlier he consumed only one beer.
After years and countless investigations, it was discovered that Nick suffered from an extremely rare disease, "Auto-brewery syndrome".
Basically, the body causes all the carbohydrates consumed to ferment, turning into alcohol.
The one who said it could be Nick's disease was his wife.
The disease has not yet been cured, but since he gave up on carbohydrates, Nick has had no such episodes.
He destroyed a Mercedes with a golf course.
A South Korean man destroyed his car, a Mercedes S63, in protest of the services he had on his part.
The man "attacked" his car with a golf cart, causing enough damage to get the car out of use, BT reports.
The whole scene was filmed, and the video reached the Internet, for the amusement of those who watched it.
The man claimed that the car has defects that endanger his life and his family.
His anger came when the dealer from whom he bought the car did not solve his problem, as he was convinced.
The government approved, on Wednesday, "National Strategy on Immigration for the period 2015-2018" and "The Action Plan for the current year", documents considered to be "another stage that Romania is going through as part of efforts to modernize the process of managing immigration in the national territory", according to a press release.
The source cited shows that the strategy aims to effectively manage the phenomenon of immigration, including general strategic objectives, specific objectives and action guidelines that reflect policies established at European level, adapted to national realities.
In view of the problems faced by the states in the immediate vicinity of Romania, measures are envisaged for the united and coherent management of situations caused by the possible emergence of an influx of illegal immigrants on the territory of Romania, generated by situations of a political, social, economic or military crisis.
“The Roman authorities will contribute to the creation of a flexible admission system, but at the same time will pay special attention to citizens coming from states with potential migration or that may affect national security,” the source added.
The strategy identifies a number of factors that can influence immigration and asylum, including maintaining the conflict situation in Syria, reactivating the conflict in Iraq, maintaining an unstable situation in neighboring areas of Romania (Ukraine, Transnistria), perpetuating and increasing the intensity of the Israeli-Palestinian armed conflict.
On the other hand, the document also sets out some general strategic objectives related to immigration, such as: promotion of legal migration, stricter controls of the legality of the seat of third-country nationals on the territory of Romania and the appropriate application of removal measures and restrictive measures.
The national strategy also includes specific objectives relevant to the implementation and implementation of the general strategic objectives.
These include: facilitating access to the territory of Romania for third-country nationals who meet the employment needs of the labour force, facilitating the access of third-country nationals to higher education institutions in Romania for the areas and professions identified as deficit.
With regard to the 2015 Action Plan, the Government considers that it is "a means by which concrete activities are established that will lead to the creation of a flexible system to stop the growing migration phenomenon."
Romania, in a European top on the labour market
Latvia, Romania and Bulgaria recorded the largest increase in the total labour cost of the EU Member States in the second quarter of the year compared to the same period in 2014, according to data published Wednesday by the European Statistical Office (Eurostat).
The index refers to expenditure on employers’ staff.
Thus, between April and June 2015, the total cost of labour increased by 1.9% in the European Union and by 1.6% in the euro area.
Romania ranks third in the EU at rising labour costs
The highest growth rates were reported in Latvia (7.9%), Romania (7.7%), Bulgaria (6.8%), Estonia (5.5%) and Lithuania (4.3%).
The only EU countries where hourly labour costs fell in the second quarter of this year were Greece (minus 2.9%), Cyprus (minus 1.2%) and Italy (minus 0.4%).
The advance in labour costs in Romania in the period April - June 2015 is mainly due to the increase in the hourly cost of labour in industry and services, by 7.9% and 7.6%, respectively.
In the construction sector, Romania recorded an advance of 5.8% of the hourly labour cost.
The activity report of the TVR leadership, rejected in the committees: Stelian Tanase risks resignation
The Parliament’s Culture Committees rejected Wednesday’s report on the activity of the Board of Directors of the Romanian Television Society in 2014.
17 MPs voted against the rejection of the report, one against the rejection (Senator Varujan Vosganian) and one abstained.
The text of the report will be forwarded to the Permanent Bureaus meeting.
They'll decide, probably next week.
The next plenary session will be debated.
"I think considering this situation will be done relatively quickly," Senate Culture Committee President Georgica Severin said in a statement.
He added that "it was good sense" that the TVR leadership was also present at this meeting, given that no representative of the TVR leadership was present at the meeting of the Culture Committees.
It felt good to have TVR leadership present because no one here was subjected to personal attacks or anything like that.
The invitation was made to CA members last night, with an approximate hour that we did not know the time either, but today, after the meeting of the Bureaus gathered, I personally sent a fax to the TVR leadership inviting her.
I believe that at the time you are called, you are a budget employee, paid from public taxes, and you are called to a meeting of the committees assembled even if you don’t like living.
"Because it's your duty to serve, you're in an institution under Parliament," Severin said after a meeting of Parliament's Culture Committees.
He added that the financial aspects of the institution were discussed at the meeting on the basis of the negative opinion of the Committees on Budgets.
We saw the debts as they went on, came up with the idea that this year it would have been up to date, but they did not pay out of the historical ones.
"I will remind you that it is not my fault or anyone else in these commissions that has lost that pleasure with the banks and with the tax, it is clear management issues," Severin said.
He added that after the activity report will be rejected by the plenary, elections will follow for a new Board of Directors, and that it will elect the director general of the institution.
I don’t know who will be nominated for this position.
Miracles will not happen.
It is important to make political decisions for this institution to function.
I'm not the man to lie to you, to tell you that a genius will appear who will stand at the tail here and fight.
I hope that those who decide, in Parliament's plenary, by their vote will choose with great reason the people who will lead the TVR.
There must be people who know what is going on there, have experience and have a lot of fairness and respect for the institution and tradition.
I don’t know who he will be, if you ask me what qualifications he should have - I feel good about the attitude towards employees because it’s a bunch of petitions coming from employees, complaints, dismissals.
“When you get these 50, 60, 70 sessions, something is rotten and we’re talking about the financial situation that is a disaster,” the president of the Senate Culture Committee concluded.
Although he did not present himself to Parliament, the President-General Director of the TVR, Stelian Tanase, sent a letter to the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Valeriu Zgonea, in which he asked that Parliament consider a number of measures that could lead to the saving and guaranteeing of your own economic and political independence of this independent television, the public broadcaster.
In the letter, Stelian Tanase requests, in addition to the indexation of the TV fee, to amend and supplement HG 978/2003 on the fee for the public television service, in the sense of updating the provisions at the level of technological changes on a daily basis, as well as for regulating the procedure on the control of TV fee payments and penalties and the determination of penalties and penalties.
It also wishes to issue a provision that provides for the extension of the obligation for all electricity suppliers to become mandated by the SRTv for the collection of TV fee, by involving ANRE in the regulation of this activity.
In his opinion, it is necessary to set a maximum ceiling of 5% of the commission on increments.
Stelian Tanase calls for the reduction of the VAT quota for the activities specific to the public television station and the contribution to the CNC from 15% to the level of 3%, but also the amendment of Law 41/1994, in the sense of the possibility of receiving budget/financial allocations for the purchase of licenses for major cultural and sports events.
He argues that SRTv will enter into incapacity for payment in the coming months considering that the labour legislation obliges the employer to execute judicial decisions, even if they are not final, and wage rights are honoured with priority over any other obligation.
The TVR administration has made constant efforts to reduce the costs of TV staff and production.
"Thus, travel and other cost-generating activities were reduced, a number of commercial contracts were renegotiated, and at the end of July the TVR News post was closed," the president's letter read.
Tanase appreciates that the disastrous financial situation cannot be remedied only by her own efforts.
"Without the support of the state institutions - Government, Parliament, Presidency - Romanian Television will sooner or later be unable to fulfil its public mission," the letter said.
The leadership of the House of Representatives decided to send the letter to the Committee on Culture.
Vasile Blaga's son-in-law sent to trial
Vasile Blaga’s son-in-law, Ionut Andrei Rudeanu, was sent to court on Wednesday by prosecutors at the Bucharest Court of Appeals.
He is accused of tax evasion, in a file with damages of about 600,000 euros, being under judicial control.
Andrei Rudeanu was arrested on May 22.
He founded the security firm Axis Corporate Security SRL, along with his mother, in April 2009, a year after he married Vasile Blaga’s daughter, Agathe.
The investigations revealed that, in order to avoid paying taxes and taxes to the state budget, representatives of a company specialized in the provision of security services would have created a criminal circuit, consisting of several commercial companies, which would have highlighted fictitious transactions.
"In fact, in the company's accounting there would have been fictitious purchases of services, which, in reality, were not provided, the state budget being thus damaged by about 600,000 euros," the Romanian Police said in a press release.
The Seychelles established the fate of Sanmartean
Al-Ittihad club leaders have determined the fate of Lucian Sanmartean.
Although the Arab press announces that Sanmartean's separation from Ittihad is imminent, Ladislau Boloni's entreprise, Arcadie Zaporojanu, says this will no longer happen.
Boloni is very pleased with Sanmartean.
Lucian plays match keeper and does it well.
The seismics also realized that he was the best and that it would have been wrong if they abandoned him.
It would have been the option to bring another, much better player, but nothing came out.
"There have been several discussions with Mbark Boussoufa, but nothing has happened," Zaporojanu told Digi Sport.
Lucian Sanmartean arrived in Al-Ittihad earlier this year.
Ilie Sarbu was elected vice-president of the Court of Auditors
Parliament’s plenary voted on Wednesday to appoint PSD Senator Ilie Sarbu, the nephew of Prime Minister Victor Ponta, as vice-president of the Audit Authority of the Court of Auditors.
According to Mediafax, 290 votes for and 108 against were recorded.
The vote was secret, with bulletins.
NLP representatives were the only ones who voted against this proposal, Digi24 informs.
Moreover, the Liberals have criticized Sarbu’s appointment to the post and announced that they will challenge it to the CCR, under conditions where he has a DNA file but does not have the necessary preparation and experience.
Ilie Sarbu has 30 days, according to the law, to resign from the Senate, because the new position of the Court of Auditors does not allow him to make politics anymore.
The PSD Senator will serve as the vice-president of the Audit Authority of the Court of Auditors, who remained free after Ioan Anton was resigned, following a decision of the Constitutional Court in September 2014, which found him to be unconstitutional.

As Bradley Cooper is about to play the role of a chef in the film Burnt, the actor made a revelation that his fans did not expect.
In a recent interview, he said he grew up in the kitchen: “I’ve worked most of my life as a cook.”
He revealed that he had been working in the kitchen since he was 15 years old, when he was working for a Greek restaurant, so that then, in college, he would continue on the same path.
The actor explained that his mother had Italian origins, so the whole childhood cooked with the Italian grandmother, reports ContactMusic.
Asked what plans he had for the future at the time, Bradley Cooper said he was never the type of man to make plans for five years, "not even two."
"It's not at all motivating for me to have a map," he said.
"I have dreams, things you would have worked on if I told you," he said, but said that what he had wanted since childhood was fulfilled.
At the age of 40, the actor admitted that he is in the near future directing, taking the role of Clint Eastwood, who took over at that age.
Ponta, accused of uncontrolled slanders and irrational claims
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto on Wednesday condemned the claims of Romanian Prime Minister Victor Ponta that Hungary's political leaders are "nothing better than those in Syria, Libya or other countries from which refugees flee."
"Yesterday, Victor Ponta lost his self-control and, through his irrational claims, insults the whole of Hungary," the Hungarian foreign minister said in a statement.
Civilized European politicians do not say such uncontrolled slanders.
"His remarks have only one explanation: he has completely lost his support in domestic politics in Romania," the head of Hungarian diplomacy said.
In a Facebook post on Tuesday evening, Prime Minister Victor Ponta said he wanted to attract attention and sanction the behavior of high-ranking Hungarian government officials who, in his opinion, “are a disgrace to the culture and values of the European Union.”
I do not want to respond to the challenges posed by some Hungarian government representatives.
"This is a disgrace to the culture and values of the European Union; and in anti-Semitic attitudes, and in terms of the treatment of minorities of all kinds, and now during the refugee crisis!"
The Romanian Prime Minister added that he is a fan of rational and sustainable solutions to the refugee crisis, saying that brutalities and aggressive laws will not solve the problem.
The gimped sarma, aggressive laws, prisons and brutality will certainly not solve the problem – they will only look like in Hungary, in the heart of Europe, there are policymakers with nothing better than those in Syria, Libya or other countries from which the refugees flee!
"I believe in solidarity, in rational and sustainable solutions and above all in the superiority of European values - what we see in Hungary in recent days is in total contradiction with these goals and values!"
Earlier on Tuesday, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto called the remarks of Romanian Prime Minister Victor Ponta about Hungary’s handling of the refugee crisis “simple lies,” saying the claims were inappropriate for a 21st-century leader.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy also cited Tuesday as the "extremist and false remarks" of the Romanian prime minister about the domestic political crisis in Romania and said Budapest was waiting for an apology from the Romanian side.
Szijjarto referred to a statement made Monday by Prime Minister Victor Ponta.
What I have said and always say is that I am against xenophobic speeches the idea of closing the borders, that everyone who comes is some terrorists, they are Middle Ages bullshit, and I am totally against this approach.
If we can receive more, we will receive it, the problem is our logistical ability to treat those people like some people, not how our Hungarian neighbors are treated with beating and inseracy.
"I do not agree with that," the head of the Roman executive said at a press conference in Targu-Jiu.
Also on Tuesday, Peter Szijjarto announced that the Budapest government decided to start preparations on the ground for the extension of the fence it is building on the border with Serbia on the border with Romania, to face a possible change of route used by migrants.
Later, Prime Minister Victor Ponta said that Hungary's decision to erect a border fence does not solve any of the refugee problem and "scoot Hungary from Europe".
What is the link between Osama bin Laden and the collapse of the Mecca crane?
Saudi authorities said Saudi giant Binladin Group, belonging to Osama bin Laden's family, was "partially responsible" for the collapse of a crane on Friday at Mecca's Great Mosque in an accident that killed 107 people.
According to an investigative committee, the company did not “compliance with security rules,” the Saudi Press Agency (SPA) reported.
The company’s directors have been banned from leaving the country until the investigation into the case is completed.
The company will also be excluded from new public contracts.
The construction company is owned by the family of former Al Qaeda terrorist network leader Osama bin Laden.
The company was founded by Osama bin Laden’s father 80 years ago and is currently run by the brother of former terrorist leader Bakr.
Binladen Group has been working for 4 years to expand the Great Mosque to accommodate more pilgrims.
The accident occurred on Friday night during a storm, when a crane, probably unbalanced by strong winds, collapsed on the eastern side of the roof of Mecca’s Great Mosque.
As a result of the accident, 107 people died and nearly 400 were injured.
How He Shuts the Mouth of the Defenders
Considered by many the world's greatest Roman footballer in history, Gica Hagi was labeled, after his retirement from work, as a weak coach, who may not be able to perform well in the new posture.
After unfortunate experiences at the national team, Steaua or Galatasaray, Hagi took over, a year ago, the role of coach at Future Constanta, the team he sponsors.
After a fixed year of taking over the team, the King has shown he is capable of transforming a team struggling to save from retrograde into a top one.
Thus, after a year, the Future recorded, with The Hague coach, 16 victories, 11 draws and 11 defeats.
The scoreboard is one of a top team that beats the European Cups.
Things took an even better turn for the Future this season, as the team reached second place in Liga 1, with 19 points, one less than the leader Astra Giurgiu.
The future also has the best attack in League 1, with 20 goals (equal to Astra), more than double the Star.
On the other hand, even though he brought more experienced players to the team, Hagi continued the policy of promoting young people, and lately in the starting team appeared names such as Ianis Hagi or Hodorogea.
The club's policy has made Future a tracking team for foreign teams, so Hagi sold 1.5 million euros this summer - Ianis Hagi (Fiorentina - 1 million euros) and Alexandru Mitrita (Bari - 500,000 euros).
Along with Star, Future is the only profitable team in Liga 1, according to data from the Trade Registry.
In the refugee crisis, Romania has so far played as a small country.
It’s a legitimate strategy, but after that you can’t ask to be treated as the seventh EU country.
The big countries come up with solutions for the whole EU, says Cristian Guinea, a member of the board of directors of the Roman Centre for European Policies.
In an interview with Ziare.com, Cristian Guinea showed that Europe cannot be turned into a fortress, and purely police means will not work in this crisis: “Maybe we have doubts about the quality of the values with which these people come.”
But there are masses that have started and we can't go back in history.
Migration is a reality to which we must adapt as best as possible and adapt them to us.
In the opinion of Cristian Guinea, we are in an extremely emotional moment, when politicians feel the need to show their muscles.
Once it passes, Europeans will not be willing to give up free movement, but the rules in the Schengen area must be changed: "Schengen is now like an animal created in another era and that was not adapted to the present situation."
Where are we in the refugee crisis after this JAI council which, in fact, has not resolved anything?
It is clear that the EC President in agreement with Donald Tusk did not want to force a vote on the council.
All the forecasts said he would have had the necessary votes.
Prior to the Treaty of Lisbon, the JIA applied the principle of unanimity and any state could block any decision.
Therefore, things have been very little integrated in the area of justice and internal affairs.
After Lisbon, the normal procedure, in which the EC has the initiative, applies, and the Council approves it by a vote of 55% of the states, i.e. 16, which represent 65% of the EU population.
The calculations said that the votes were there.
But they didn't want to go ahead.
Because it’s a sensitive issue, there have been rejection reactions even in Germany against Chancellor Merkel’s opening policy and they didn’t want it to appear in many countries as a reaction like “the EU is sending migrants to our heads.”
So they have dawned, but the problem remains because, obviously, this wave creates a huge problem for the Schengen governance and we will probably witness major changes there in the next period.
So the mandatory quotas weren't really eliminated, but the subject was just left to cool off?
Yes, on the other hand, we are talking about a greater involvement of Frontex in the management of the external borders, which means a shift from the individual responsibility of the members at the Schengen external border to the responsibility of the Community agencies.
Greece's border with Turkey is also Germany's border with Turkey, de facto, and this wave of migrants has given the boundaries of the old Schengen system.
Perhaps he will give up the Dublin principle that migrants are the responsibility of the state where he first enters because it is not sustainable.
If Greece is captivating, you can't tell infinity that it's Greece's business.
Problem and common.
Just because the problem is common, is a solution possible without a precise, perhaps even mandatory, mechanism of sharing the effort of reception?
No one knows exactly how the mandatory quotas will work if they are reached.
Because there remains a problem: what do you do with a man who does not want to come to Romania or Portugal, but to Sweden or Germany?
I don’t think European states will take up migrants: you go to country X or country Y.
It will probably reach some unique filtration centres, in Greece or Turkey, where asylum applications are processed.
We are working on solutions like this.
But the problem doesn't have a simple solution.
There are countries that have decades of experience in trying to integrate migrants, they are countries with no experience, like Romania, where the problem of migrants will increase the xenophobic current.
Of course, we are talking about the millions of people who are in Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, who are in precarious camps and who have just begun to leave for Europe.
An estimate says that only 10% have started to leave, winter is hard to pass the Mediterranean, but we expect next year at a wave maybe even bigger.
What do we do with these people?
My prognosis is that we will get used to this problem, we will not look at it as catastrophic from a media point of view.
Talk about countries with less or more experience.
Does it seem to you that there is a place where it has really succeeded in integrating large groups from an extra-European culture?
I look at the Maghrebs in France, the Turks in Germany, they're still enclaved.
I wouldn't go for radical statements.
Of course, their integration is more difficult than other migration waves, but that doesn’t mean they don’t integrate at all.
It remains an unintegrated part that creates major social problems in France, Germany, the United Kingdom.
But purely police means will not work.
To create a fortified and illusory Europe.
We need to move to the mechanisms of integration in European societies.
There were some mistakes here.
We need to be more pretentious.
Let us ask these people to learn the language, to try to take on the values, to stop staying with one foot in Europe and one foot in their home country, bringing the rest of the family, including by marriage conveniently.
However, the imminent problem of these people must be separated from the long-term problem of their integration.
If others have failed in long-term integration, it does not mean that we have to look at them as they drown in the Mediterranean.
Perhaps we have doubts about the quality of the values that these people come with.
And if there’s going to be an intervention in Syria, which I don’t think, it doesn’t mean the country will be rebuilt overnight and you can take them back.
Until solutions emerge, we see strongholds within Europe.
Borders have been closed, walls have been erected, border controls have been reintroduced into the Schengen area.
Is the European project in danger?
The European project as such is not, the Schengen area as it was built, yes.
It was built quite minimally and arranging the rules so that the pressure was too high on the countries where these migrants set foot for the first time.
I mean, we're free to go around, but everyone's got their own problems.
In the face of such a wave it cannot be so, because some countries do not face.
When there are such waves of emotion, politicians want to show that they are doing something, but in the long run, not much changes.
After the attacks in France, we do not have much more draconian anti-terrorist legislation in the EU than we did last year.
It’s a wave of public emotion that settles in both directions.
And it’s so unstable from week to week that you can’t make decisions based on it.
We have a lot of talk, a lot of belligerent statements from politicians at home under the pressure of being masculine.
And then you have the dramatic case of the child drowned in Turkey and the public opinion is excited.
After the public emotion passes, we will return to the reasons why we created this space, this freedom of movement that is not only for people, but also for goods.
This is the European single real market.
And I do not think that Europeans will give up this principle of freedom of movement.
There will be other rules and that's different.
Schengen is now like an animal created in another epoch and that was not adapted to the present situation.
How has Romania played in this crisis so far?
As a small country, which believes that if it pulls the groove on its eyes and opens its ears, the theme disappears.
Faced with the reality of migrant waves, you can choose to be part of the solution or say it’s not your small country problem.
That's what we did, it's a legitimate strategy, but after that you can't ask to be treated as the seventh EU country.
You're not, you're not playing at the big country level.
Large countries come up with solutions for the whole EU, good or bad, we are not discussing their quality now.
Just like Poland did.
On the other hand, the effect of this crisis is that the Roma’s appetite for Schengen will be greatly reduced.
President Iohannis says it's good that we haven't come in yet.
So we move from desperation of entry to a more pragmatic position, but the goal remains.
There is, of course, a risk if Romania and Bulgaria enter Schengen as migrants see us as the alternative route.
This does not mean that there is a reason for us not to enter Schengen anymore, but rather to be more pragmatic.
Romania will be a part of Schengen, and Schengen will exist, but transformed in the sense that external borders will become common responsibility, there will be unique rules for accepting migrants, unique rules for deportation for those who do not receive asylum, unique rules for countries considered safe.
The Ukrainian president said that after Russia moved its attention to Syria to Ukraine, no one died.
Is there a link between the two focusses, a game of Russia?
Russia has a frustrating power.
She believes that being great power means harassing Americans and Europeans.
From this point of view, yes, there is a connection.
Without the military and financial efforts of the Putin regime, it is likely that the Assad regime would have collapsed long ago.
And it was good to blow up before the main or opponent was the Islamic State.
Two years ago it was a struggle between the Assad regime and the secular and moderate Muslim militias, supported by the Gulf and Western countries.
Then the Islamic State rose and now we don’t know if we want the Assad regime to fall.
Russia has been able to complicate things, but cannot participate in the solution.
It creates outbreaks of instability and chaos that it cannot close.
But you are great power only if you have solutions.
Playing off-side is just a strategy to earn time.
Putin is probably waiting for offers to be made to him, to press the buttons to resolve the situation.
Offers do not come because the world is not convinced that it can solve in one way or another things created by it all.
But I disagree with the theories that these people are ruled by an invisible hand.
Let's not see Putin stronger than he is.
What button will appear soon.
Millions of Facebook users have become accustomed to the “Like” button, and now social network representatives are preparing another opposite, the “Dislike” button.
Marti, Mark Zuckerberg, co-founder and CEO of the company, announced on the account or that this button will be available soon, the New York Times reports on the blog.
Zuckerberg said the "Dislike" button will show a nuance of what a user feels rather than a simple option.
However, his ad raised the issue that Facebook could become a less friendly place.
Zuckerberg mentioned that he wants to avoid the moments when someone posts on the account or an important event in life, and someone else will give "Dislike".
Users of the network, which has reached 1.5 billion active accounts, have long asked for the opportunity to express their negative emotions or empathy with something sad.
Zuckerberg also said it is not very comfortable for people to "like" current events, such as the refugee crisis, or in the case of the death of a family member.
"You may not feel comfortable giving likes to that post," a Facebook spokesperson said.
The option of a new Facebook button has not been well received by everyone.
“There’s already enough hate on Facebook and social media,” Atiq Haneef, Afghanistan, said on the New York Times Facebook page.
"I'm going to give 'Dislike' to the 'Dislike' button," he said.
Roger Anderson, an Atlanta microbiologist, said there was nothing wrong with this button, encouraging people to have different opinions on Facebook.
Debra Aho Williamson, a social media analyst at eMarketer, said it’s hard to imagine that a single button can transmit a complex range of negative emotions.
Moreover, she argues, the election campaign in America is approaching, and the "Dislike" button would create a total disaster.
Only 70 refugees have entered Hungary in 24 hours.
Hungary accepted only 70 migrants, a handful of thousands coming to the table at its southern border with Serbia, government adviser Gyorgy Bakondi announced on Tuesday.
Hungary has declared a state of emergency over the course of the day in two counties along the border with Serbia due to the flow of refugees, closing a main border crossing point and announcing it will build a fence on its border with Romania, DPA recalls.
The measure drew a sharp response from Serbia.
Yesterday they said they would seal the border for those who want to cross, but not for those who want to seek asylum.
"As you can see, this is totally different," said Serbian refugee minister Aleksandar Vulin.
Prior to the imposition of new immigration legislation, a record 5,809 migrants entered Hungary on Sunday, police said on Monday.
In 2015, more than 170,000 immigrants from the Middle East and Africa entered Hungary from Serbia.
Many avoid being registered and try to get to the West, especially in Germany.
The "new" seat of the County Council stands to drink.
Two Constructors in Insolvency
The massive investments made here in recent years, in order to change the institution, are falling apart because they have been stopped several times.
Two important builders who worked here went into insolvency during the works.
The headquarters of the County Council on Vasile Alecsandri Street will collapse on its own.
A year and a half after the construction of the building had to be completed, the work did not reach even half of it.
A final stage in the building’s epoch took place in the past few days, when the National Dispute Resolution Council (CNSC) rejected a complaint from the company that wanted to take over the contract for the technical project for the works that are still to be executed.
The original project was developed by Impex Romcatel SA.
After the insolvency of the builder and the interruption of the works, the negotiation procedures were started without the publication of an announcement of participation with Impex Romcatel, the company was to update the technical project, and then a new auction for works was organized.
"The negotiations were not concluded by a contract, however, with CJ assessing that the proposed form would have disadvantaged the institution," said R<0xC4><0x83>zvan Timofciuc, representing public relations within CJ.
CJ’s decision to suspend direct negotiations was challenged in court by Impex Romcatel.
The oushean court sent the complaint to the CNSC, which rejected it as late.
This does not mean, however, that CJ can start looking for another designer.
Impex Romcatel has the possibility to appeal the decision of the CNSC to the Court of Appeal, only after a final judgment of it can be taken into account the finding of another designer.
Thus, the building’s consolidation work could be resumed as early as next year.
Our intention is to restart the work as soon as possible.
In principle, the restoration of the technical project should not take long, but we need to get to the conclusion of a contract.
"We wait to see if the decision of the CNSC will be attacked or not," Timofciuc said.
Consolidation work on the former headquarters of the Police Chess Department began in 2011.
A first contract of works was terminated in April 2012, after works of 4.5 million lei were carried out.
The auction was resumed and the contract was awarded by Moldoconstruct SA.
However, the company went into insolvency, and this contract was terminated after payments of 1.5 million lei were made.
The work has so far been done in a proportion of about 50%.
Initially, the works of consolidation, refunctionalization and attication of the building had been valued at 7.7 million lei.
"Ready, I say it all!" - the statement that could incriminate the former chief of the Cadastre
One of the employees involved in the file scandal from the Registrar Office signed an agreement on the recognition of the facts, against deferred imprisonment.
Most likely, his statements will incriminate the other defendants, headed by his former boss, Narciza Nedelcu
An advisor from the Office of Real Estate Registration and Advertising (OCPI) Ia<0xC8><0x99>i accused of DNA in a corruption file has acknowledged his telefax.
The agreement on the recognition of the facts signed by Dumitru Dasc<0xC4><0x83>lu was registered yesterday at the Ia<0xC8><0x99>i Tribunal, the judges determined to give a solution in this case on September 29.

In the case of those who did not agree to the contract with Dasc<0xC4><0x83>lu, the prosecutors stated that he, as an advisor of the Registrar Office, together with other colleagues, "made false several processes-verbal acceptance, pri sells the contracts of services in the previous key by O.C.P.
In recent days, the former head of the Office, Narciza Nedelcu, but also other former or current employees of OCPI were sent to trial in this file, the accusations being the settlement of services to the mentioned companies, although the work was not carried out.
Pre-trial exceeds 300,000 lei.
Adventures in the Stone Age
In the opinion of FRH president Alexandru Dedu, Romania can host a major handball competition only in 2024, and the preparation of the women’s handball national for qualifying for the Olympic Games costs a fortune.
The President of the Romanian Handball Federation, Alexandru Dedu, said yesterday, during a meeting with the press, that it is a great pride that our country has three teams in the Champions League groups.
As for Romania's national women's handball team, "the main goal is to qualify for the Rio Olympics, but for that it has to go through two stages of caudine forks, firstly the World Championship and secondly the pre-qualification tournament," Dedu said.
We are looking forward to qualifying for the Olympic Games.
There are some fantastic requirements from the technical staff led by Tomas Ryde.
Staff that will be composed of seven or eight people.
He wants a second coach, a doctor, two masori, a goalkeeper, a physical trainer, a chief of delegation.
They asked us to get the qualification some things, more specifically physical training materials, of which I have never heard.
That's all to get to the Olympics. and I'll do whatever it takes to have them.
We are talking about a massive investment, there are a lot, a lot of money.
But that's the way to perform.
Because at the moment we are in the Stone Age with preparation.
“The teams we’re fighting have these materials and they’ve had them for some time,” said Dedu, who said he’s trying to get the necessary amounts to purchase these products from MTS and COSR.
The President of the FRH also referred to the infrastructure in Romania and the possibility of our country hosting a major handball competition.
We don't have a room in Bucharest.
It is an infrastructure problem and it is shameful to be questioned by a European Gymnastics Championship.
Let’s not forget that in other parts of the world, Olympic quarters have been built entirely in the space of two years.
Before 1992, in the current Olympic area of Barcelona there was a garbage dump, and now it has become a beauty landmark.
The same thing happened in London, where the 2012 Olympics was a success in terms of investment.
“In my vision, in 2024 we can host a major competition,” Dedu said.
He added that the international handball bodies are willing to grant Romania the organization of a major competition.
For me it is a priority to bring major handball competitions to Romania.
Mr. Ga<0xC8><0x9B>u went civilized with a project, the people agreed in principle, but it quickly became clear that the hall would never be built.
And I had discussions with the EHF, I told them that we want to, that we are able to organize and they said that I agree and invite them to the first match in the new hall in Bucharest and then we discuss concretely.
“So we have the whole opening, both at EHF and at IHF, but we don’t have the infrastructure,” the FRH official explained.
The former great handball player avoided evaluating the chances of the women's teams CSM Bucharest and HCM Baia Mare to reach the Final Four: "I have asked all coaches to be booked in the forecasts, that if they do not meet they will return against them".
Good road to the World Cup
Romanian rugby union debuts on September 23, against France
The captain of the national rugby team, Mihai Macovei, said on Tuesday in a press conference that all the components of the lot of Romania are ready for the matches of the World Cup in England, where he hopes to achieve two victories: "We are ready."
Both me and my colleagues are with the engines at maximum speed.
We trained to give the best performance in the four games.
Everyone will have high expectations, because our goal is to win in two games, against Canada and Italy.
All groups are heavy and ours is the same.
Let's take it easy, first with France and then we'll see.
But if we win with Canada, the match with Italy will be our final.
I cannot describe in words the joy of participating in the World Cup, it is the crowning of so many years of work.
I wish I wouldn’t disappoint anyone in the rugby family and come home with beautiful results.
“We want you to be proud that some players, a small family like rugby in Romania, are proudly representing the tricolor,” Macovei said.
The Romanian national team manager Lynn Howells, who had first experience as a World Cup coach, hopes to make the Romanians proud of the rugby team: "It is a great honour for us to participate in this World Cup".
I’m sure the players are ready to participate in the tournament.
For me, it's an extraordinary experience.
It is very important for me to make the Romanians proud of the national team at every match.
The President of the Romanian Rugby Federation, Haralambie Dumitra<0xC5><0x9F>, is confident that Romanian players can confirm the progress made in recent years in rugby.
We have a very difficult group and we want to confirm the progress made on the national team.
I wish the athletes success and I am convinced that we will be in the middle of the event.
"These guys started playing in the Romanian teams at 18-19 years old, so there is cohesion, there is a band of friends, who fixed themselves to make a dream come true," said Dumitras.
At the Rugby World Cup in England, Romania will progress to Group D, having scheduled the following matches: with France on 23 September in London; with Ireland on 27 September in London; with Canada on 6 October in Leicester; with Italy on 11 October in Exeter.

14 million lei given to the Hospital "St. Spiridon" in Ia<0xC8><0x99>i at the budget correction
What will be purchased with this significant amount of money?
The hospital "St. Spiridon" received from the Ministry of Health, following the budget correction, about 14 million lei.
The money that the medical unit received to use by the end of the year will be invested in the modernization and arranging of some clinics, but also in medical equipment and equipment for which the hospital has already started the public procurement procedure.
Thus, the sanitary unit will be equipped with a new tomograph computer, with a new radiology apparatus, with six trays used for surgical interventions, six adequately equipped TIA beds, ophthalmological microscope and other devices necessary to carry out the medical act.
On the other hand, 5 million lei of the money received from the hospital will be directed to the construction and furnishing of the "Great Fire".
From the money from the budget rectification, UPU will receive 500,000 lei for the completion of the modernization work in the main throne.
“In addition, in the coming days we will do the reception of the work from the walkway linking UPU to the clinics of cardiology, hepatology and gastroenterology to ensure the transport of the patient from UPU in decent conditions to the neighboring clinics,” explained the manager of the medical unit.
The hospital will soon have in the court and the Clinic of Dermatology in T<0xC4><0x83>t<0xC4><0x83>ra<0xC8><0x99>i, which it will organize in the outpatient clinic, in the same form under which it currently operates.
The clinic will operate in the area where allergology, haematology and endocrinology are located in the outpatient clinic and will have about 30 beds.
The jasmine, made of laughter by RATP controllers and a folding.
A Tourist's Passion
A family of tourists from Cluj came to Ia<0xC8><0x99>i to visit him, but the trip ended with a bitter promise.
After my life experience, neither I nor my wife ever want to walk in your town again.
Involuntarily, they were hit by the wrong information in the folds, by the dissent of RAPT controllers and, bonus, by a fine "that's what the law says".
The couple arrived in Ia<0xC8><0x99>i a few days ago, stayed in a hotel in the Centre and asked for tourist folds.
They also received a folding sheet in which the RATP routes were passed.
"Armed" with these maps, the wives visited Ia<0xC8><0x99>u.
But two days ago, in Copou, they wanted to get to the Palas Mall.
Because there was no ton of tickets at the station near Copou Park, they relied on the information printed on the flyer: that they can get a ticket by SMS.
No one told them that this service no longer exists.
Confident in the folding, they got on a bus and tried to text after the instructions on the folding.
Unfortunately for them, he made his appearance a team of RATP controllers.
They said that the service no longer exists for two years and that it was announced in the press that it was cancelled.
WHERE DO I KNOW what was written in the local press, I came an evening before I visited the city?
I talked to the controllers, I explained the situation, they said they didn't care, it wasn't their job.
The attitude was very challenging.
They said all I can do is give us one fine instead of two (me and my wife).
“I paid, I didn’t want to ruin my day at the stand at the gendarmerie and give statements there!” says Ovidiu.
In conclusion, the family was fined for incorrect information on the folding and controllers who "applied the law to blood."
It’s not right, and I made an appointment at RATP Iasi to get my money back.
It's not about money, I'm not exaggerated by many, but the idea is that I felt cheated.
Ghinion for the rapists in Vaslui.
They had an accident and remained in preventive detention.
The trial of the seven rapists from Vaslui has been moved, since yesterday, to the Court of Appeal Ia<0xC8><0x99>i.
Judges in Isenia have tried for the first time in a non-public hearing in which the seven young people accused of kidnapping an 18-year-old girl have asked to be released.
Before the very beginning of the trial, one of the Iseni judges to whom the case had been assigned, Viorel Munteanu, made a request for abstinence, which was admitted by his colleagues at the court.
The magistrate was active until the summer of this year at the Vaslui Tribunal, where he was the president of the Pe nale Section, he being the one who, on 9 April, admitted a challenge made by four of the accused, ordering their placement in house arrest.
At present, the case is judged by a whole of which the magistrates Maricica Mititelu and Geta Sandu are part.
Previously, in the file, Judge Dan An Ton also formulated a restraining order on the grounds that his daughter is in a concubine relationship with one of the rapist lawyers.
The two judges decided that the Vaslui rapists would continue to remain in pre-trial detention.
These negroes will remain incarcerated for at least another 30 days, when judges will reconsider the possibility of their release.
The next trial period will take place at the Ia<0xC8><0x99>i Court of Appeal on 6 October.
Before reaching the Ia<0xC8><0x99>i Court of Appeal, the dome with which the rapists were transported from Vaslui was involved in an accident produced in the P<0xC4><0x83>curari neighborhood, the car entering Ia<0xC8><0x99>i on the belt.
The Iveco utility vehicle with which the seven rapists were transported hit a Volkswagen car that had come out of the Canta street, and the driver tried to turn left.
The duba circles from the end of the Sins.
The car entered Ia<0xC8><0x99>i here because the employees of the Penitentiary Administration preferred the route from Vaslui to Ia<0xC8><0x99>i on Grajduri, then on the belt road.
They cut the road by a few miles.
Immediately after the impact, the escort of the detainees called for another transport, to take the prisoners.
In a short time, a car from the Iasi Maximum Security Penitentiary was sent to the scene of the accident, which took the seven prisoners and transported them to the Court of Appeal.
As a result of the accident, none of the detainees were injured.
To transfer them to the other hut, the guards surrounded the rear of the nil cars, and the arrests went out at speed, two by two.
"The incident was not reported to the police, because the drivers of the two vehicles were kind to each other regarding the damage to be paid," said Chief Commissioner M<0xC4><0x83>d<0xC4><0x83>lin <0xC4><0xA2><0xC4><0x83>ranu of the IPJ.
The Great Migrations
Romania is not, and will not be, prepared for what is to come.
What about Europe?
I say it from the beginning, clear and clear: the number of 7,000 refugees that Romania should and should naturalize is in itself a small but huge number compared to the capacity of the Romanian state to manage such a project.
For Romania, even the voluntary quota proposed by Bucharest, in the amount of about 1,500 souls, far exceeds the good intentions of solidarity with the European Union expressed in recent months.
Certainly, if those migrants will even agree to settle in our localities, the chances of integrating them quickly into Romanian society are extraordinarily small.
I am sure they will be the first to lose their patience.
Parasitized by interlopers and paralyzed by a venereal political class, the Romanian state proves impotent in all areas.
The inability to integrate gypsies is just a trivial example.
In addition, governments of any color have not been able to absorb European funds, to make roads, kindergartens or modern schools, to provide decent medical care, to collect misery from the streets, to create decently paid jobs, or to preserve their own generation.
Why would the refugees settle in another country from which they are fleeing?
But what produces much wonder is especially the hypocrisy with which such a crisis is treated.
First, we are struck by the warlike tyranny of the EU’s powerful states, which show maximum generosity when it comes to sharing the troubles with the smaller countries.
Then comes the fearsome hypocrisy of Romanians who, although they have millions of relatives scattered all over the world, do not yet accept the other - another language, another religion, another blood.
Probably out of fear of stealing from someone's national being.
Finally, there is also a hypocrisy of many migrants, who, although only invoke the horrors of war as the reason for their departure, do not accept any destination of the exodus other than Germany or the Nordic countries.
Not all refugees are Syrians, and there is no war in Pakistan.
Also, the simplistic way in which the crisis is analyzed can only be ridiculed.
The causes must be eliminated, some support, and, relying strictly on the book of political correctness, I demand peace and investment for the countries of origin of the migrants.
But in Romania there is peace and even more, from time to time, something foreign capital enters the national economy – but that does not prevent tens of thousands of Romanians from leaving their country every year.
Why is he leaving?
In this crisis, the European Union has revealed itself to us as an anchored, disconnected and outdated construction of the situation.
I lamented that Romania is not able to invent a country project, but here the EU does not have a plan for the future either.
And improvisations and threats help nothing.
Then what more does the EU benefit if the only advantage enjoyed by the Romanians - the right to free movement - could be challenged because of the waves of refugees crossing the borders like through cheese?
At some point, the war in Syria will be over.
But not the migrant crisis.
Over the coming decades, overpopulation, poverty, climate change, resource depletion, etc. will push millions of desperate migrants, from Asia and especially from Africa, towards a better life.
With such politicians, Romania is not and will never be prepared for what will follow.
7,000 euros a year to rent the Pogor Club.
Destiny, practically, imposed
The auction for concessions is for a period of 10 years.
After 7 years in which it remained closed, the club in the courtyard of the Romanian Literature Museum is offered by the County Council for concession for a period of 10 years.
The construction has a useful area of 134 sqm, on two levels of rough.
CJ accepts as destinations given to the building only those of the literary cafe, library or other activities with a cultural profile.
The building was valued at <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>68,300, the starting price of the auction being <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6,830 per year, with a bidding step of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>25.
The dealer will have to continuously and permanently operate the building and fully cover the cost of refurbishment of the property, in accordance with the technical project to be drawn up.
"The Club Pogor building is in an advanced state of degradation due to the fact that during the period in which the public power unit operated in these spaces and after its evacuation, no current repairs and maintenance work have been carried out as the procedure documents are currently required during the operation," the document states.
The club's concession offers are expected until September 18th.
Two brothers from Tome<0xC8><0x99>ti swallowed sleeping pills.
They were taken to the hospital.
Two 9-year-old children, respectively 11-year-olds from Tome<0xC8><0x99>ti, brothers, swallowed several pills of Diazepam.
They found the pills in the house and took them out of curiosity.
Their mother underwent treatment, and the drugs weren't hidden.
The children were urgently taken to St. Mary's Hospital in Iasi.
They are in stable condition, as the doctors say.
EXCLUSIVE: A meeting that breaks your heart.
At the age of 20 he received a brave gift: biological parents
Lost in the hospital in vague conditions, in the black 1990s, when she had only two months of life, small, sickly and helpless, and then adopted by a strong family in Italy, in the same year that the groom was vaguely adopted, and the bride-to-be, the bride-to-be, the bride-to-be, the bride-to-be, now the bride-to-be.
Crina will be celebrating her 20th birthday, and her adoptive parents in Palermo have thought about giving their beloved daughter an amazing and courageous gift: a visit to Romania, to Ia<0xC8><0x99>i, to know their unclear past.
"The Ia<0xC8><0x99>i Diary", which witnessed the search for the family of origin after some extremely vague indications, witnessed these meetings that practically break your heart.
The reporting of reporters, the emotions of the moments, the statements of those involved, their reactions are rightly moving and overwhelming.
The story of Crina begins 20 years ago in the village of Ruginoasa, while she was only two months old.
Then, due to a health problem, the girl had to be hospitalized in the city.
At home there began to be disagreements between the parents, and the mother was forced to leave the home.
He decided to keep the girl and send me out of the house.
He stopped the girl, and since then I didn't know anything.
“When I found out she was in the hospital, it was too late,” recalls Alina, the girl’s biological mother.
Crina was hospitalized with her grandmother at the municipal hospital in Pascani, and even then her father, Balkan Coast, went to work in the city of Alexandria, Teleorman County.
Their lives were to be separated permanently.
They haven't found Crina in the hospital.
After boarding, Crina's father went to work in another locality, and returned after six months.
Meanwhile, the girl was transferred to the hospital in Ia<0xC8><0x99>i, and the father, when he returned, did not find her.
I think it's been almost nine months since the girl was in the hospital.
"She thought she was abandoned," a granddaughter of the family tells the story.
Due to financial problems, Grandma was unable to come with Crina to Ia<0xC8><0x99>i, and the girl remained in the care of doctors.
Because no one was interested in the fate of the child during all this time, it was taken over by the General Directorate of Social Assistance and Child Protection Ia<0xC8><0x99>i, who then gave it to the care of the Placement Center in Bucium.
There were years when abandonment and adoption were less regulated than today in Romania.
At the Bucium Center she was found by the Italian Salvadore and his wife, a couple from Palermo who wanted to have their child but failed.
They fell in love with the blonde Crina instead, and after a while she was going to permanently move with them to Italy.
The little girl had already done almost two years, as long as the adoption formalities lasted.
When I saw Crina, I felt like she was our girl.
“It’s like my wife gave him life,” Salvadore, the adoptive father, tells us smiling as he grabs the girl’s fiery hand in his palm.
In the country, Crina’s parents, Alina and Costica, continued the search separately, each where they could.
The father asked the authorities in Ruginoasa, but received no answer where his child might be.
The police then told her that it was possible to die, but in Ia<0xC8><0x99>i the parents found out what really happened to their daughter.
When I looked for her here, they told me at the Tribunal that she was leaving for Italy, in Palermo.
And I didn't have the conditions to look for her anymore.
We prayed to God that it would be good.
I've been thinking about her in all the years that have gone by, but there was no way we could walk around, find her.
"It's hard," Crina's biological mother tells us with tears in her eyes.
However, even though the years have passed, the parents of Ruginosa have not been forgotten.
In Italy, Salvadore and his wife explained to the girl where she came from and that her past ties her to Romania.
I was little when I found out.
I think I was five or six years old.
I reacted as a child, I was curious.
“I wanted to get to know my parents in Romania,” says Crina.
And her dream was to become a reality.
In March of this year, Chief Commissioner Romic<0xC4><0x83> Ichim, the director of the Regional Center for Prevention, Evaluation and Advice on Anti-Drugs in Ia<0xC8><0x99>i, was contacted by an acquaintance from Italy, who explained Salvadore’s desire to find Crina’s biological family.
And the quests started only with a name.
After the request we had from our partners in Italy, we started the first steps.
We only receive one name, the Coastal Balkans, then the locality, the Ruginosa.
Soon I had an activity with the town hall there, and I was able to ask if there is by locality the name received.
Then they gave me a few clues, just that the person I found was not the one I was looking for.
"It took about a month or so before we found the girl's biological father," said Roma chief commissioner Ichim.
In total, it took more than three months for the authorities to find Costica and Alina, especially since they each had their home in a different location.
We started out somewhere in March, and in June-July we completed the identification of biological parents and discussions.
"Then we decided to have a first meeting in September," Romica Ichim added.
In the past weekend, Alina and Costic<0xC4><0x83> saw their lost girl for the first time in the halls of the hospital in Ia<0xC8><0x99>i 20 years ago.
The father, excited, could hardly control his tears, and his hands trembled unceasingly.
He barely changed a few words with the people around him.
A week before the meeting, she couldn't sleep at all.
He was still excited, trembling.
"To see your child after so many years, it's something," a granddaughter, who also came with Costica from Ruginoasa, tells us.
Crina's meeting with her mother and biological brother
In conversations with his daughter, who is about to study at a well-quoted university in Italy, Costa Blanca told him, among other things, that if she ever wanted to return to him, in the village, she should come quietly: she can give him something sheep, goats, to find a boy in the village and bury her.
Mom is excited, crying, and she hardly believes that such a thing can happen to her.
I'm very excited.
I didn't think that could happen.
I’ve seen such cases on TV, I’ve been thinking all these years, I was hoping, but I didn’t think I could be like that.
They're very big emotions.
If he could forgive me.
I hope to visit in the future.
"Hopefully we can keep a bond," Alina, Crina's mother, tells us with tears on her cheeks while holding a napkin tightly in her hand.
In him she still hides her tears, of happiness, because in a short time she will see her face after such bitter weather.
On the other hand, Crina, who will be in just a few days, this month, 20 years old, is trying to calm down like an emotional child.
She doesn’t know what to expect, but she sketched a vague idea about her biological parents.
He thinks they are young, but now before the meeting he tries to gather his thoughts, because he has a lot to say, but nothing to blame.
My parents are two mothers and two fathers.
But my parents are the ones who raised me.
It will be a beautiful meeting, a wonderful experience.
"I hope to have a nice memory with them, because now there are so many things to say," Crina confesses to us.
First family meeting in Ia<0xC8><0x99>i
In Unirii Square, under the sky of the beginning of autumn, the family in Ruginoasa reunite their fate with their daughter in Palermo.
Crina is 20 years old, graduating from high school, following the Italian school model, but she can start a new chapter with Alina and Costica, her biological parents.
It no longer divides its borders or countries, but only one barrier: that of language.
Over which, with the help of a translator, an Italian owner of a local in the center of Ia<0xC8><0x99>u, passed easily.
Those who have managed to make this meeting possible say that it is the first event of this kind done, and that in the future, if the opportunity arises, they will do so.
It’s the first event of its kind organized, with such an emotional burden, and I’m happy to be a success.
We at the Center have different activities, and we are often associated as an institution that deals only with people who consume, people who are addicted to drugs.
But we're trying to give society something good back.
"If I am asked for such an event, I will do it with great pleasure," says Romic<0xC4><0x83> Ichim, director of the Regional Center for Prevention, Evaluation and Advice on Drugs in Ia<0xC8><0x99>i.
Behind him, the Balkan family, with Crina in the middle, moves away telling stories.
I understand: they have a lot to say to each other.
Armistice with guns on his feet, yesterday, at the PSD.
Everybody's pulling their soul
The camps in the outlying branch of the PSD have concluded an armistice with a gun to the foot.
After successive rounds of talks, held from Friday to Sunday, the first and most tense, the PSD leaders agreed to temporarily suspend hostilities.
Pressed by the party’s executive president, Liviu Dragnea, to present a united position, the coming Social Democrats will send him a full list of potential candidates for the party’s functions.
Far from being over, the party’s internal war seems to have only taken a break to allow the fighters to shoot their soul.
Dragnea did not give an ultimatum.
He launched a very simple and very current message in the present conditions: try to find a solution to not endanger the party.
We have elections in the party on October 3.
All functions will be made available to those who want them.
"Until then, we remain in the existing structure," said interim mayor Mihai Chirica.
The two days of the weekend discussions only led to the conclusion that nothing definite has been established.
In the elections in October, a fierce competition is expected for the post of president of the county branch of the PSD.
On the short list of possible candidates for the main office in the party’s branch are the state secretary Maricel Popa, Senator Florin Constantinescu, Senator Sorin Laz<0xC4><0x83>r, the county councillor Vasile C<0xC3><0xA2>tea and the interim president of the County Council, Victorel Lupu.
The mayor of the Duca Schitu municipality, Mihai Mihalache, may also be added.
One option taken into account is the candidacy of the leader of the district councillors of the PSD, Cristian Stanciu, if Lupu will no longer enroll in the race, sources within the party saying that he is not interested in the function.
The only name not mentioned by any of the participants in the negotiations in recent days is that of the former head of the branch, Mayor Gheorghe Nichita.
The list of candidates is open.
According to the statute, even on election day can be applied, and no one would be surprised if it happened.
"Important is that we remain united, and we will remain together after 3 October, when we have a new Executive Bureau, a new County Permanent Bureau and all the new leadership structures," C<0xC3><0xA1>tea said.
Until the internal elections, the leadership of the county branch of the PSD will be ensured by Victorel Lupu, a close of Nichita and Stanciu.
However, Lupu is on leave until September 29, the preparation of the elections to be practically ensured by the executive secretary of the branch, the county councillor Mihail Popescu, who is in cold relations with the Nichita camp.
Contacted by telephone, Cristian Stanciu appreciated the discussions in recent days as leading to "a partial consensus".
There is a wide availability to maintain balance and unity in the party.
A partial consensus has been reached, in the sense of supporting a unitary team to deal with the judiciary.
"But on the other hand, there are several variations on the intentions related to the candidacy for the presidency of the PSD Ia<0xC8><0x99>i, the list remains open," said Stanciu.
An outgoing judge rejected the case of the rapists in Vaslui on the grounds of concubination
The seven young people in Vaslui County convicted of rape arrive today at the Ia<0xC8><0x99>i Court of Appeals.
The Vaslui people sentenced to sentences between five and eight months and eight years and four months will present their arguments for their release today, after the foundation court, the Vaslui Court, established their imprisonment immediately after the sentence was pronounced.
The file was registered in the Court of Appeals at the end of last week, with Magistrate Dan Anton making an application for abstinence, admitted by his colleagues.
Anton alleged that one of the defendants' lawyers, lawyer Bogdan Luca, is the concubine of his daughter, lawyer Dana Anton.
Luca defends Silviu Ovidiu Burada, who received the highest penalty in this file.
How the Judges Motivated the Judgment
At the end of last week, the magistrate at Vaslui Judiciary who convicted the seven young men motivated the sentence.
In justification, the judge talks about the defiant reaction of the accused, but also of those who supported them, stating that such attitudes create a strong sense of indignation among the public.
"The court finds that after the time of placing under the preventive measure of judicial control, a restrictive measure of freedom but not deprivation of freedom, under the impact of the attitude of the accused, the families and their local supporters, the constraints of the people who are subject to them, have been felt at the level of the local community with a severe and national feeling of indignity.
Magistrates also dismantled the main defense of the seven defendants who during the trial invoked the fact that the girl they raped would not be a “church door.”
“The court underlines that the moral quality of the injured person is irrelevant, an aspect that the defendants wanted to highlight through the defences they formulated, since a person’s physical and sexual freedom cannot be violated under any pretext,” the statement said.
Corbyn, Brexit and the future of Europe
For economic and demographic reasons, the prosperity they have enjoyed in the last decades cannot continue the same in the years to come.
By Saturday, probably few people in Romania knew who Jeremy Corbyn was.
Even today, after he became the new leader of the Labour Party in Britain, many wonder how much it can affect us to choose a politician who, after all, is not in a decision-making position.
Jeremy Corbyn is the most radical leftist Labour leader since the war.
Marxist declared, anti-monarchist NATO (he at one point asked Tony Blair, then Prime Minister, to remove the royal family from Buckingam Palace), a fierce anti-American and a sympathizer of Vladimir Putin (he was also regularly invited to the UE's s<0xC3><0xA2>r<0xC3><0xA2>l<0xC3><0xA2>h and the <0xC3><0xA2>r<0xC3><0xA2>l<0xC3><0xA2>l<0xC3><0xA2>h and the <0xC3><0xA2>r<0xC3><0xA2>l<0xC3><0xA2>l<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>r<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>h<0xC3><0xA2>
For Corbyn, who at the time considered the killing of Osama bin Laden a real tragedy, ISIS is almost preferred to the United States.
According to the model of all populist demagogues, Corbyn has, of course, miraculous anti-austerity solutions.
Things like the ones Tsipras said and promised in Greece until the time when he gave birth to the real world and economic laws.
The economic program of the new Labour leader provides, among other things, massive renationalizations and printing money as a solution for financing development projects and covering very generous social benefits.
Sure, some might wonder why the money-printing solution is not unanimously adopted globally, we would then have a global overall prosperity!, but who else would prevent such details.
Of course, we can tax the bankers on blood, becoming a kind of enemy of the left, but what has been seen so many times in the past, not only in the former communist states or in Ecuador or Venezuela, but also in France, at the beginning of the mandates of Mitterrand and Hollande.
Additional sums are quickly swallowed up by the generous, uncovered promises made by populist demagogues.
As Margaret Thatcher famously said, “The problem with socialism is that at some point the money of others ends.”
Few give Jeremy Corbyn real chances of ever becoming prime minister.
In the early 1980s another radical leftist leader, Michael Foot, who was not as extreme in convictions as the fresh leader of the party, failed regretfully in the election.
And then there was still a working class in Britain, in the classical sense of the word, relatively consistent and structured.
And the unions were sensitively more influential than they are now.
In the conditions of the new industrial landscape, where services are dominant in the workforce as a whole, and extended automations have made the industry massively in need of highly skilled labor, Corbyn’s rhetoric has a limited appeal.
But even from the opposition, it can influence important developments that can directly affect us.
In his latest issue of the Financial Times, he believes that Corbyn’s election increases the chances of Brexit, or Britain’s exit from the EU.
The new Labour leader was a consistent opponent of the country’s membership in the Union.
In the eyes of the radical left, Brussels is the agent of international capitalism and a promoter of globalization that has forced the austerity of the poor.
When you combine these kinds of ideas with those expressed by the radical right, with anti-immigration rhetoric, and you look at the refugee crisis that swirls from the foundations of the EU, you reach an explosive mix.
And not just for the UK.
But if the British decide after the referendum, which is to take place by 2017, to leave the Union the loss of symbolic capital for the entire European project and the deep failures created within it by the Euro crisis and now the reason for the refugees, between the North and the South, between the East and the West.
All the more so for a whole series of member states, London was a counterweight to the Franco-German axis (where Berlin is becoming more and more dominant).
True, the British business environment, the City, are strong advocates for the country’s stay in the EU.
But today’s Europe is no longer the Europe of the past.
There are many resentments, which increase in intensity even in these weeks.
The problem is that Brussels, even recently having a sample in the speech of Jean Clude Junker, tends increasingly to make major decisions over the heads of the vast majority of Member States by consulting with only a few European powers, mainly with Germany.
And this is happening in conditions where electoral support for anti-system, anti-immigration and Eurosceptic formations is growing dramatically across the continent.
In other words, the negatively charged emotional climate has reached higher levels than ever in the past.
Where and the conclusion the Financial Times draws when assessing the chances of Brexit.
The pro-EU option is based on a cold calculation based on the national interest.
If voters make a brain decision, then the UK will remain in the EU.
But Corbyn’s victory reminds us of the power of emotion in current politics.
However, Eastern Europe can be significantly affected by such major developments.
Especially if, as is expected, we will witness a more pronounced integration of the euro area, which will push most of the countries in the region and to the periphery of interest and that of the decision-making process in Europe.
Corbyn, Tsipras and Syriza in Greece, Podemos in Spain, even Bernie Sanders in the United States feeds their populist rhetoric from the frustrations accumulated in Western societies.
For economic and demographic reasons, the prosperity they enjoyed in the last decades, the generous social benefits, can no longer continue the same in the years to come.
Under the explosive pressure of the dual crisis, the Euro-immigration zone, both provoked by hasty decisions that only took into account the integrationist political ambitions, not the ability and willingness of the peoples and governments of Europe to respond to such challenges, turmoil affects the turmoil on the continent and major tensions within the EU.
And it's hard to exclude anything from the point of view of possible scenarios.
The question is whether our main political leaders are able to cope with such complicated situations.
Constantin Br<0xC3><0xA2>ncu<0xC8><0x99>i, the peasant god.
Rockefeller: "How can I help you?"
He said, “I’m going to take the workshop!”
The great sculptor had a great dream: to be someone, to become famous, to be heard about him in the whole world.
But behind his reputation lies something almost forgotten today, when millions of success stories are delivered to us, recipes for success in life.
That thing also has a name.
It's called "trude."
What to write about Constantin Br<0xC3><0xA2>ncu<0xC8><0x99>i?
What else is there to say, actually?
His figure appeared on the banknotes.
And recently, a well-known bank in Romania hired an actor to play him in an advertising clip.
Brancu<0xC8><0x99>i makes and delivers money at nearly 60 years since he is no longer among us.
In Romania, there are hundreds of streets and boulevards that bear his name.
In fact, even the author of this text lives on one of these streets.
And when he goes outside with his maturation, he hears the following instructions: "We go to the park, to Brancu<0xC8><0x99>i".
The country is haunted by its statues.
There are few Romanian personalities whose works are known to so many people, from children to the elderly.
Br<0xC3><0xA2>ncu<0xC8><0x99>i’s infiltration capacity is a huge one.
Even the Communists failed to erase him from Romania’s memory and culture.
Its quotes now spread the internet, receiving hundreds of thousands of likes and shares.
And, then, again, what else would there be to say, to write about this man?
Looking out of the pile of books and articles that try to recreate his destiny, Br<0xC3><0xA2>ncu<0xC8><0x99>i’s life seems almost fantastic, totally improbable.
You know, it’s those people who tell you that if you weren’t lucky enough to be born into a big city and family as well as a strong family, your chances of success in life are almost zero.
Br<0xC3><0xA2>ncu<0xC8><0x99>i's life is the perfect counterexample.
And maybe there would be a key here.
Maybe this is where the next text should begin.
With a sentence, however distasteful they are.
Look at the success stories of the Cretans, which are delivered to you daily in the newspapers and on the TV.
Look closely at the figure of this man.
Do you want to know how to succeed in life, how, today, heard from him an entire world map?
It's simple.
He worked his whole life to be someone.
That's what he did.
Constantin Br<0xC3><0xA2>ncu<0xC8><0x99>i was born on February 19, 1876, in Hobi<0xC8><0x9B>a, a small village in Pe<0xC8><0x99>ti<0xC8><0x99>ani commune, Gorj county, at the foot of the Carpathians.
He is the fifth child of Mary and Radu Nicolae Br<0xC3><0xA2>ncu<0xC8><0x99>i.
Although he came from a family of strong peasants, Br<0xC3><0xA2>ncu<0xC8><0x99>i leads a modest life, but one of which he would collect his landmarks that would guide his artistic vision later.
Recalling his childhood and the places where he grew up, the artist was to testify, in a meeting with Petre <0xC8><0x9A>u<0xC8><0x9B>ea, from Paris, in 1933: "At that time life was beautiful and harmonious".
For millennia, people have led, happily, a patriarchal life.
Everything went smoothly from one season to the next.
And do you know why things have changed?
The civilization of the great city has come to us.
However, Brancusi’s childhood was far from idyllic.
One of the moments spent in these early years of life is extremely suggestive for the combination of purity and violence that characterized the future sculptor years spent in his hometown.
The moment is reproduced in the work "Br<0xC3><0xA2>ncu<0xC8><0x99>i. A biography", written by Alexandru Buican.
In 1879, Constantin Br<0xC3><0xA2>ncu<0xC5><0x9F>i was 3 years old.
In the fall of that year, when it was done "in the boiler", following those who taste the liquid to see if the process is taking place properly, Br<0xC3><0xA2>ncu<0xC8><0x99>i catches a moment of general inattention.
He fills his palms with snails and drinks on unripe.
It falls into sleep almost instantly.
The first people notice only after a few minutes.
Mother panics, then hysteria, believing her son has died.
In the evening, when his father, Radu, returns from the vineyards accompanied by praises, he sees from afar the desperate signs of those who await him with soul to mouth.
The party immediately turns into a jelly.
The father is already thinking about the funeral.
However, one finds that it is good to call Baba Br<0xC3><0xA2>ndu<0xC5><0x9F>a, a dophtoroaie and servant of the Br<0xC3><0xA2>ncu<0xC8><0x99>i.
The bran checks the baby's breathing, then puts them under the nose of a horse's whale, gathered nearby.
The baby's sneezing hard.
The world applauds.
While the boy is allowed to sleep further his drunken, joyfully, the party of praise continues with even more force.
The next day, the father and son meet through the barn.
Radu Br<0xC3><0xA2>ncu<0xC8><0x99>i puts Constantin to collect some nuggets and bring them to him.
The father puts his child down with his head and, with the boy's clothes, beats him to remember.
And while he feels the wearyness of the hits, the little Brancusi has the revelation that the world can be viewed from a different perspective and that things around him can turn upside down.
Especially the position of the sun, unlike the well-known one, makes him wonder, as he would recognize in old age, if not somehow the astrologer himself participates in his disorder.
Would the sun have been as troubled as his father by what had happened to him?
Currently, the city is not working.
A parliamentarian calls on politicians to remind them of those who voted for them.
Independent MP Viorel Bl<0xC4><0x83>ju<0xC5><0xA3> called on the PSD and PNL to stop the internal struggles and to reorient their agenda towards the electorate.
What we see now on our political scene is a big disconnect and so on.
I haven’t seen any of the USL projects from 2012 to continue.
Neither the highway nor the Regional Emergency Hospital, you can only see how politicians dispute their possible locations according to the real estate interests.
Let's leave politics a little bit behind, get together and talk.
At present, the city is not working.
"If you're busy with the civil war, you don't have time for those who chose you," Blajut said.
He said that the current political class has disappointed the Iesean electorate, the consequence being a very small presence in the upcoming local elections, around 30%, representing practically the faithful electorate of the parties.
The MP also believes that voters will always be oriented towards traditional parties, expressing their reservations about new political initiatives, such as the "Pentru Ia<0xC8><0x99>i" party that will be launched today.
Local parties have very little chance and will only break from the right constituency, not the PSD.
Such parties are based on civicly active people, who are usually right-wing.
"The right is shattering even more, which is not good for anyone, nor for the PSD," Bl<0xC4><0x83>ju<0xC8><0x9B> said.
He said he was not interested in a candidate for the upcoming local elections, dispelling rumors about his intention to enroll in the race for the City Hall.
I've said before that I don't want to run for any local office.
I would also like to see you continue as a member of Parliament for the next term.
I tried to appeal to the unit for Ia<0xC8><0x99>i and in the discussions in the halls with the other parliamentarians, and I was accused of wanting to make an image of myself.
I don't want to, but we can't go on like this anymore.
“If people voted for us, it doesn’t mean they’re stupid to vote for us if they don’t see anything,” Bl<0xC4><0x83>ju<0xC5><0xA3> said, who said that the main reason the electorate is no longer interested in politics is the hypocrisy of the electorate.
A friend of mine said he didn’t have the money and had to take the bus.
Let's not be hypocritical.
There's not a lot of money.
Sometimes I'm embarrassed to pick up the cash from the cashier.
At the end of the term, I will make a report on everything I have spent, except the salaries of the employees of the cabinet and its maintenance.
It happened to raise in a month and 30,000 lei, with all the transportation, accommodation and other bills.
“Saying a parliamentarian that he doesn’t get his money is pure hypocrisy,” Bl<0xC4><0x83>juts concluded.
