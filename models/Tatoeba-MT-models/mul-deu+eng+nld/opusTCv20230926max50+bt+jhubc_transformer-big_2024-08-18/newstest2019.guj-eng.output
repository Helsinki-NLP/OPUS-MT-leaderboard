A Thousand Farmers Arrived at the High Court Against the Drum Project Bullet Train for Development of Gujarat
A petition has been filed by the High Court against the cultivation of land from farmers in Gujarat for the Central Government's Dream Project Bullet Train.
During the hearing of the application, 11,000 farmers had agreed to show the fact that the State Government did not have the right to cultivate their land.
In the wake of the Chief Justice's chamber, the Central Government's ultimatum stated that if the Central Government does not submit a reply on the land acquisition by the 26th date, the Court will issue a final order.
The High Court, which also violated the orders of the High Court and the Supreme Court, has smeared against the central government.
A further hearing on the matter will be held on the 26th of September.
The High Court, which saw a dispute over the agreement of a thousand farmers in Gujarat's eight districts in the Inter-Rajyay Bullet Train project, took the form of the state government.
You're leading the court in the wrong direction.
In your submission, only four to seven farmers have stated that a large number of farmers who have already been raised here have been sanctioned.
Advocacy Anand Yazdika, on behalf of farmers, argued that Rs.1 lakhs of rupees worth Rs.10,000 crores is not the most expensive project in the country, the central government has said.
The Central Government is trying to ensure that the case does not go ahead in the High Court without submitting a reply.
Farmers are being threatened by the Collector as a last weapon because the central or state government has no strong defences regarding land-granting.
As a result of the new condition of the land, black mail is being sent to take possession of the land.
If the land is not cultivated, it is being threatened by this kind of conquest.
Despite the order of the Supreme Court on August 10, the Central Government does not submit a reply to the High Court.
As a result, farmers will be asked to go back to the Supreme Court tomorrow and comply with their orders.
More than 3,000 farmers from Gujarat's eight districts will go to Japan to protect their land and to the Japan International Co-Operation Agency (JICA) about the injustice committed by the Central Government with them.
If the agreement with the Central Government is unfair to the farmers, the agreement is also foreseen to be cancelled.
Farmers have been loaned thousands of crores of rupees for the Bullet Train as a result of the agreement with the Japanese company Jeka for the Bullet Train.
Japan has not yet received more than Rs 30 crore from the Japanese government.

At the international level, the Chinese yuan is trying to establish an international interest rate at the same level as the euro, yen and pound, including the dollar.
Looking at the possibility of an economic embargo on the part of the United States, India and Russia are looking to make this deal in rupees and rubles.
INTERNATIONAL DISCOUNT: India and Russia have today reached an agreement on the S-400 defence missile system between the U.S. and the U.S.
On the second day of his two-day visit to India, Russian President Vladimir Putin will be seen signing the agreement with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the occasion of his two-day visit to India.
The S-400 deal is underway in an effort to pave the way between the two countries by taking the U.S. dollar for the payment of the deal.
Sources claim that India and Russia are looking at the possibility of an economic embargo on the part of the United States to make this deal in rupees and rubles.
The U.S. banned China's trade deal with China.
It should be noted that in September, Russia delivered S-400 missiles with China.
After the deal, U.S. President Donald Trump has decided to put a ban on China in the wake of the deal.
As a result of the ban, it became almost impossible to buy a missile using the US dollar for China, the US said.
However, over the past few years, China has tried to raise its debt to the U.S. dollar as a terrorist-intensive currency, compared to the dollar.
After the move, China has been constantly trying at the international level to make the yuan an international currency in comparison to the euro, yen and pound, including the dollar.
China, on the other hand, has the largest reserve of the U.S. dollar in the world's terrorist trade.
The U.N. wants to make China an international leader.
The five-billion-dollar mega-defense deal could place a U.S. lockdown (counting U.S. Enterprises Threat Sessions - CAATSA).
Last month, the U.S. imposed a ban on the purchase of S-400 missile systems on China.
India and Russia had already started to set up an alternative system for this deal from that time onwards.
The INS Chakra, which had previously been leased from Russia, was subject to a U.S. ban on a $2 billion deal between India and Russia, according to Reuters.
The Economic Analyst contends that in order to get out of such a situation, India should use the rupee-ruble exchange as a terrorist-national currency and try to make a deal.
It is worth noting that all the defence deals that India has made with Russia so far have been made only by means of the dollar.
Why did the U.S. Constitution become a law?
In August, President Donald Trump approved the Qatari Act, in light of Russia's modern-day defense missile system, to be passed by the U.S.-led U.S.-backed U.S.-backed U.S.-backed U.S.-backed U.S.-backed U.S.-backed U.S.
It should be noted that this law has been prepared by the United States in the light of Russia's moves.
Including Russia's 2014 attack on Ukraine by capturing Crimea, engaging in Syria's civil war and meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

In the relevant presentation of his book, it has gone on to Sanskrit, and scholars of the world have detailed what Sanskrit has proved important: "Shakek Ashni Bhachwa is the son of Sir William Jonsen."
It's fuller than the Greek language, more vipulous than the Latin, and it's more subtle than both.
Nehru further notes: "I don't know how many times Sanskrit has become a dead language, so I don't know when it has become a popular language."
Today, the Sanskrit language remains the language of prayer and the swearing-in of members such as Union Minister Smriti Irani as a Member of Parliament.
We need to revitalize and revitalize Sanskrit by expanding the year of Sanskrit.
If the dead language of Israel could be revived by Hebrew, Sanskrit would still be the living language.
It would be a good idea to try to make it a popular language, instead of trying to make it look like it's a social or political endeavor.

Whatsapp users can no longer do more than 5 times this work, will soon feature
Whatsapp's messaging service is going to bring a huge feature for its users.
The company has said that it is going to make up to five users of the limit of sending forward messages to prevent false information and fake news in India.
The company informed by e-mail on Friday morning that more messages, photos, and videos are being forwarded in India compared to any other country in the country.
In this case, a new feature is being launched to take the Forward message here.
This feature is currently being started in the course of testing.
After this feature, users will be able to share video photos of only five people in India.
The company went on to say that, like five times, videos and photos will be shared after that, we will have to remove the Forward option.
It should be noted that the Watts app was launched on the Forward feature on the 11th of July.
If any of the people who were in this position were to have a message sent to you, the message would have been sent to you by a message sent to you.
This will make it easier for the user to understand what the message is forward or not.
On the other hand, in the earlier statement, Watts had said that he was taking advice from those academic specialties and law enforcement agencies in order to stop the spread of fake news.
It's worth noting that Watts has 230 million users across the country.
In addition, in terms of the number of users who use WhatsApp across the country, that's 1.5 million.
