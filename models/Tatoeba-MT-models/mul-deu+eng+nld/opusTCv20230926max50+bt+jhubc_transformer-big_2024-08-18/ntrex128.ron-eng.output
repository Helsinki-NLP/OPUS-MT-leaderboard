Members of the National Assembly of Wales are concerned that they may give the impression that they are “puppets”
Several members of the National Assembly of Wales are dismayed because they have been suggested to change their title or to be called MWP (Members of the Parliament of Wales).
This problem was caused by plans to change the name of the assembly in the Parliament of Wales.
Members of the National Assembly of Wales present on the political scene fear that this would cause ridicule.
A member of the Labour Party in the National Assembly of Wales is concerned that he "speaks with Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh, "twp" means "obtuz" and "pwp" means "faeces".
A member of the Welsh Party of Wales in the National Assembly of Wales said that the group as a whole is “not delighted” and suggested alternatives.
A member of the Conservative Party said the group had an “open” attitude towards the name change, but that he also noticed that “MWP” resembles “Muppet”.
In this context, the letter "w" is pronounced in Welsh as is the letter "u" in English spoken in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Committee, which is currently preparing legislation to introduce the name change, said: “The final decision on how the members of the Assembly are appointed will certainly depend on the members themselves.”
The Law of 2017 on the Welsh Government gave the Assembly the opportunity to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which revealed that many of them want to use the "Parliament of Wales".
With regard to the title of members of the National Assembly of Wales, the Commission preferred "Members of Parliament of Wales" or "WMP", but the "MWP" option received the most votes in the public consultation.
Members of the Welsh National Assembly appear to have suggested alternative options, but trying to reach a consensus could give a head start to Elin Jones, the chairman of the board of directors, who is expected to send the bill on the changes in the process.
The reform legislation will include other changes to the way the assembly operates, including rules on disqualification of members and the structure of the committee system.
The members of the National Assembly will have the last word regarding their title when the law is debated.
Macedonians Vote for Referendum on Change of Country Name
This Sunday, citizens with voting rights will express their opinion on the change of their country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular vote was organized to settle a decades-old dispute with Greece, the neighboring country, which has its own province called Macedonia.
The government of Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor is a claim on its territory and has repeatedly opposed Macedonia’s accession to the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, a vehement opponent of the plebiscite on the name change, said he would not consider this vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say the name change is just a compromise that will allow him to join the EU and NATO.
St. Martin’s Episcopal Church Bells Stopped Fighting as a Result of Problems Faced by Churches in Harlem
“Historically, the veterans of the place I was talking to told me that before you found a bar and a church on every street corner,” Adams said.
“Today, there are no bars and no churches anymore.”
He also said that the disappearance of bars is understandable.
“People are socializing differently these days,” he said.
“Bars no longer have the role of living room for the whole neighborhood, where people usually gather.”
And with regard to the churches, he is concerned that the money obtained from the sale of goods will be spent faster than expected by the leaders and that, “early or later, the birthday will be the same.”
He added that churches could be replaced by residential buildings with condominiums filled with people who won’t support the neighborhood’s remaining sanctuaries.
“The overwhelming majority of people who will buy condos in these buildings will be white,” he said, “so this will speed up the closure of churches, as it is unlikely that many of the people who move into these condos will become members of the respective churches.”
Both churches were built by congregations made up of white people before Harlem became a metropolis of African-American people – the St. Martin Metropolitan Community in 1870, a decade ago.
The original Methodist Congregation, made up of white people, moved out of the area after 1930.
A congregation of African-American people, carrying out religious activities nearby, took over the building.
The St. Martin Church was taken over by an African-American congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who boycotted merchants on 125th Street, a main shopping street in Harlem, who opposed hiring or promoting African-American people.
A fire that took place in 1939 greatly affected the building, but Father Johnson's menorahs made plans to rebuild it and included the carillon in them.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and successor to St. Martin's Church, called the carillon "the bells of the poor".
The expert who put the carillon into operation in July described it differently: “a cultural treasure” and “a historical tool that is irreplaceable”.
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, said he was the world’s first carillon operated by an African-American musician, Dionysius A. Lind, who moved to a larger carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said it wasn't replaced at St. Martin.
What has been heard from St. Martin in recent months has been a complicated story, which has included architects and contractors, some brought by church deacons, others by the episcopal diocese.
Sacristy, the governing entity of the parish, consisting of deacons, wrote to the diocese in July to complain that the diocese "will seek to pass the costs" to sacristy, even if it was not involved in the hiring of architects and diocese contractors.
Some of the dignitaries complained about the lack of transparency that the diocese proved.
A shark injured a 13-year-old child trying to catch lobsters in California
According to authorities, on Saturday, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old child while he was swimming, trying to catch lobsters in California on the day of the opening of the lobster season.
The attack took place around 7 a.m., near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been swimming for about half an hour with his friends on Saturday morning when he heard a boy screaming for help and then moved out of a group to help him.
Hammel also stated that he initially thought the boy was delighted that he had caught a lobster, but then realized that he was yelling “He bit me!
He bit me!"
The entire clavicle was ripped apart, Hammel said he noticed when he reached the boy.
“I shouted to everyone in the water and told them to come out of the water, ‘There’s a shark in the water!’”
The boy was taken by helicopter to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and is still in critical condition.
The shark species responsible for the attack is not known.
Salvamar, Captain Larry Giles, said at a press conference that a shark was spotted in the area a few weeks ago, but it was concluded that it is not a shark species that poses a danger.
Giles added that the victim suffered trauma to the upper part of the trunk.
Authorities have restricted access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigations and security reasons.
Giles has also mentioned that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but many of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury Retailer Plans to Strengthen Its Position in the Beauty and Fashion Market in the UK
Sainsbury takes Boots, Superdrug, and Debenhams, providing rays of beauty products in the style of a universal store with specialized sales assistants.
As part of a strengthening of position in the beauty products market in the UK, worth <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion, which continues to grow, although sales of domestic products and in the field of fashion success are not in line with many, the biggest rays of beauty products will be in the market.
The investment in the beauty industry comes in the context where supermarkets are looking for a way to use the space previously destined for TVs, microwaves and household products.
Retailers at Sainsbury said the number of beauty products they offer will double, reaching up to 3,000 products, including, for the first time, brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing games like L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will also receive more space, with marked areas similar to those in Boots stores.
The supermarket is also relaunching its makeup range, Boutique, which means that most of the products are aimed at vegans, an increasingly popular demand among young shoppers.
In addition, French retailer The Fragrance Shop will be included in two stores of the Sainsbury chain for testing, the first being opened last week in Croydon, south London, and the second in Selly Oak, Birmingham, in the second half of this year.
Shopping online and the tendency to buy smaller amounts of food every day from the nearest grocery store means that supermarkets need to find new ways to motivate people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, executive director of the Sainsbury retailer, said outlets will increasingly look like universal stores as supermarket chains are trying to cope with the fight against the big discount stores, Aldi and Lidl, which offer more services and non-nealing products.
Sainsbury has included both Argos outlet products in hundreds of stores and Habitats, since it bought both chains two years ago, which means it has seen growth in food sales as well as increased profits.
The supermarket’s previous attempt to refresh its compartments of pharmaceutical and beauty products has failed.
Sainsbury tried to merge with Boots in the early 2000s, but negotiations stopped after a divergence over how to share Boots stores' revenues in its supermarkets.
The new strategy was conceived after Sainsbury sold his pharmaceutical business, which included 281 stores, to the company Celesio, which owns the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million, three years ago.
This means that Lloyds will play an important role in the plan, adding an extended range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury’s Chief Commercial Officer, said: “We have transformed the look of our rays with beauty products to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in the specialized training of our colleagues, who will be at your disposal to provide you with advice.
Our range of brands can adapt to all needs, and the attractive environment and convenient locations make us an extraordinary location to purchase beauty products, revolutionizing the old way of shopping.”
Peter Jones Is Angry After Holly Willoughby Withdraws From <0xC2><0xA3>11 Million Contract
The protagonist of the TV show “Dragons’ Den”, Peter Jones, is furious after TV presenter Holly Willoughby withdrew from a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million contract with his lifestyle company to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time to get involved in their Truly brand project, which includes accessories and household items.
The couple's company was compared to the Goop brand owned by Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old show host of “This Morning” announced on Instagram that she will retire.
Holly Willoughby sparked the anger of Peter Jones, the protagonist of "Dragons' Den", withdrawing at the last minute from their lifestyle service business to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to the sources, Jones was furious when one of the most beloved people on television admitted Tuesday, during a tense meeting at his business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts were not worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million.
The company was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and nearly doubled Willoughby's fortune to an estimated <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
After Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that he would resign from his contract for Truly, Jones left the UK to take refuge in one of his vacation homes.
A source said: “Truely was by far one of Holly’s priorities.
It would be her long-term future for the next two decades.
The decision to retire has shocked everyone in the world.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, it was just a little bit before the launch.
There is a warehouse full of products at the Marlow headquarters that are ready to be sold."
Experts believe the withdrawal of the show's show This Morning, which is among the best-selling stars in the UK, could bring the company millions in damages, as a result of investments in products such as pillows and candles, clothing and household items, as well as the potential in the future.
It can also be the end of a long-term relationship.
Willoughby, mother of three, and Dan Baldwin, her husband, have been friends for ten years with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
Willoughby laid the foundation of the Truly brand with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined them as director in March.
The couple spend their holidays together, and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will become M&S brand ambassador and replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night: “We don’t want to comment on his business.”
I was very tough, and then “we fell in love”
He joked at the critics he would receive from reporters for making a comment that some would consider “unworthy of a president” and for having such a positive attitude towards the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump take such a big step back?
Trump said he imitated a “news presenter” voice.
“I didn’t take a step back.”
He said Kim is interested in having another meeting after the initial meeting in Singapore in June was described by Trump as a huge step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
But the denuclearization negotiations have stopped.
More than three months after the Singapore summit in June, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told leaders around the world at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea had not noticed a "appropriate response" by the United States to the North's response to the United States's crackdown.
Instead, he noted that the United States continues to issue sanctions to put pressure on it.
Trump had a more optimistic viewpoint in his motivational speech.
“Everything is going well with regard to North Korea,” he said.
“We’re moving towards a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
We have a great relationship now.”
He also said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had positive results: the cessation of missile tests, the support provided for the release of hostages and the return of the US military.
He also defended his unusual way of talking about his relationship with Kim.
“It’s easy to behave like a president, but if I did, instead of the 10,000 people out there trying to get into this impenetrable arena, there would be around 200 people,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
A tsunami and an earthquake in Indonesia devastated an island, causing the deaths of hundreds of people
After the earthquake in Lombok, foreign non-governmental organizations were told that their assistance was not needed.
Although more than 10% of the population of Lombok Island has been displaced, it has not been declared a national disaster, a necessary condition for triggering relief actions at the international level.
“Unfortunately, in many cases, it was very clear that I am not asking for international assistance, so it is a rather difficult situation,” Sumbung said.
Although the Save the Children Foundation is trying to form a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet known whether foreign personnel are allowed access to the site.
Sutopo, the spokesman for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian authorities were evaluating the situation in Palu to see if international agencies could contribute to relief efforts.
Given the earthquakes that Indonesia is constantly suffering, it is unbelievable that the country continues to be insufficiently prepared for the anger of nature.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not found very often on other coasts.
It appears that the absence of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, although a warning has been issued in this regard, may have contributed to the loss of lives.
Even in the best of circumstances, the journey between the islands of Indonesia proves to be a challenge.
Natural disasters complicate this even more.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat the victims of the earthquake is heading to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has proposed that improving Indonesia’s precarious infrastructure be the focal point of his election campaign and has generously allocated money for roads and railroads.
But the lack of funds affected the administration of Joko, who will participate next year in a new election campaign.
Joko also faces persistent pressure from sectarians in Indonesia, as members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands displaced from their homes as gangs of Christians and Muslims crumbled through the streets using machetes, arrows and arrows, as well as other rudimentary weapons.
Video: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge gives the save goal and equals the score in the match against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat to Chelsea with a goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at London's Stamford Bridge football stadium.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri, while he was about 30 yards away from the opposing team, and his team was led by Chelsea 1-0.
He hit the ball and sent it to the left before firing towards the gate.
The ball reached above which, heading towards the right corner of the top of the gate.
Eventually, the ball passed Kepa Arrizabalaga who jumped towards her and fell into the gate.
“I just had to try to get to the ideal position, get the ball, and players like Shaq always try to get as far ahead as possible, so I tried to get as much time as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante coming and it was enough, I didn’t think much about it, I just took the ball away.”
Chelsea led 1-0 to the break after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The attacker of the blue team sent the ball to Mateo Kovacic, then turned back in the middle of the field and ran to the Liverpool team's half-field.
Kovacic made a quick one-two move in the middle of the field.
Then he sent the ball to Hazard, who entered the cage.
Hazard surpassed the defense and sent the ball into the net, succeeding to hit it with his left foot and pass the Liverpool player Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will have a match against the Napoli team in the Champions League group stage on Wednesday at 15:00 at Stadio Sao Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play against Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 15:00 in London.
The number of deaths caused by the Indonesian tsunami reached 832
The number of deaths caused by the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia reached 832, according to the national disaster agency, on Sunday morning.
Several people have been trapped under the ruins of buildings collapsed by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake that took place on Friday and triggered waves of up to 6 meters, the agency's spokesman, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, said at a press conference.
The city of Palu, which has a population of over 380,000 people, has been covered by the remains caused by the collapse of the buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man suspected of killing a woman by stabbed
A murder investigation was launched after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. with gunshot wounds at Grayson Mews on John Street and was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have asked people in the area who have heard or seen anything related to the matter to come to the statement section.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hagan said: “The investigation is in its infancy, but I call on all the people who were near John Street in Birkenhead and who heard or saw something suspicious to contact us.
I would also like to ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, who have recorded any useful material with the help of the on-board camera, to contact us if they have any information essential to our investigation."
A police spokesperson confirmed that the body belonged to a woman in Birkenhead and that it was found on a property.
This afternoon, several people who think they know the woman came to the scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
Investigations are underway, and police said they were trying to inform the victim's relatives.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews tried to return to his own apartment, but was told by police that no one was allowed into the building.
He was shocked when he found out what had happened.
People living in the building were told it would take a few more hours before they were allowed in.
A police officer told a person that the entire area is now considered the scene of the crime.
On the spot, a woman appeared in tears.
Repeatedly, “It’s so horrible!”
At 2:00 p.m., two police docks were in the perimeter and another one was outside.
A few police officers were standing in the perimeter, monitoring the apartment block.
Anyone with information is asked to send a direct message to the police <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 and mention the case 247 of September 30.
Cromwell's statue of Parliament becomes the most recent commemorative monument affected by alterations on the "write of history"
Its removal would represent a poetic justice for the destruction in the Taliban-style of England's many cultural and religious artifacts carried out by its fanatical Puritan descendants.
But Cromwell described Jeremy Crick’s suggestion as “a madness” and “an attempt to rewrite history.”
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable in the current debate about removing statues that the figure of Oliver Cromwell from outside the Palace of Westminster would become a target.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil War was neither commanded nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps he would sacrifice a wrong Cromwell for the actions of his ancestor Thomas of the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is evidence of the 19th-century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure that many believe deserves to be celebrated.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case, of course, the monarchy.
Whether it is an exact representation, this is the subject of an ongoing historical debate.
But certainly, the conflict of the mid-17th century has led to the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable individual figure who is part of this division.
His accomplishments as Lord Protector also deserve to be celebrated and commemorated."
A pig killed a farmer in China.
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China, according to local news agencies.
The man, identified only by his family name "Yuan", was found dead after an artery was cut off and was covered in blood near a pig farm in Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, according to the Sunday Morning Post editorial in South China.
A pig farmer was preparing to inject pig vaccines at a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
It appears that he came with his cousin from the neighbouring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that the door to a neighboring Quetzal was open.
He said there was a large male pig with blood in its mouth.
Law doctors confirmed that a pig weighing about 300 kg caused the farmer’s death, according to the report.
“My cousin’s legs were full of blood and broken,” the cousin, whose surname is “Wu,” told Guiyang Evening News.
Surveillance cameras recorded Yuan entering the market Thursday at 4:40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
About an hour later, his body was found.
The animal that caused the death of the man did not belong to Yuan, nor to his cousin.
A market representative told Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking someone else, while police collected evidence from the crime scene.
It appears that Yuan's family and authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although they are rare, there have been cases of pigs that have attacked humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their Massachusetts farm, causing serious injuries to the man.
Ten years ago, because of a 300 kg pig, a man in Wales was stuck in his tractor until his wife came to scare and chase the animal.
After a Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but that the taste of blood can trigger such reactions.
“It’s just playing.
They like to fly, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to give them the proper respect,” he said.
Hurricane Rosa, which has lost its intensity, will cause torrential rains in the southwest of the United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa loses its intensity as it moves toward the colder waters off Mexico’s northern coast.
However, Rosa will bring rains that will cause flooding in northern Mexico and the southwest of the United States in the coming days.
Rosa records wind conditions at a speed of 85 km/h, being a Category 1 hurricane on Sunday from 5 a.m. and was located about 600 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to arrive in the north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a depressed zone has begun to form over the Pacific Ocean and is moving eastwards, to the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula, on Monday, in the form of a tropical storm northwards, it will begin to push the Tropical-Intensive Humidity of the United States.
On Monday, Rosa will bring rainfall of up to 25 cm in some parts of Mexico.
Then, the tropical humidity that will interact with the depressed area will generate abundant rainfall in the southwest in the coming days.
Local rainfall between 3 and 10 cm will cause dangerous rapid flooding, waste streams and possibly landslides in the desert.
Intense tropical humidity will cause precipitation rates of up to 5 and 8 cm per hour in certain areas, especially in some parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Precipitation is expected to be between 5 and 10 cm in the southwest, especially in most of Arizona.
Rapid flooding may occur due to conditions of rapid deterioration due to the widespread nature of tropical rainfall.
It is not recommended to venture into the desert on foot, given the threat posed by tropical rain.
Heavy rains could cause canyons to turn into violent rivers, and storms will bring local winds into rifts and dust.
The nearing depressed zone will bring torrential rainfall to areas off the southern coast of California.
Precipitation of almost 2 cm is possible, which could lead to minor streams of residues and slippery roads.
This will be the first rainfall in the region in the wet season.
Spread tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona in the second part of the Sunday and the first part of the Monday, before the rain spread further Monday evening and Tuesday.
The heavy rainfall will spread to the so-called “four corners” on Tuesday and will continue until Wednesday.
In October, there will be intense temperature changes in the U.S. as the Arctic region becomes colder, but the tropics remain quite warm.
Sometimes, this leads to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
On Sunday, there are dramatic temperature differences in the U.S. central region.
There is a temperature difference of nearly 10 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, as well as between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the prolonged heat of the summer will try to form and expand again.
Much of the central and eastern U.S. area is expected to face a warm beginning of October, with temperatures of up to 27 degrees in extended areas, from the southern plains to certain portions of the northeast.
On Tuesday, New York City could reach 27 degrees, about 4 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates high chances of above-average temperatures for the eastern U.S. by the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh’s audition.
More than 20 million people followed the press statement backed by Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of a sexual assault that allegedly took place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
At the same time, the political confrontation continued, with TV broadcasts interrupting Friday's normal program for a last-minute news: an agreement concluded between Arizona Senator Jeff Flake to have the FBI conduct an indictment investigation for a week.
Ford told the jury that she was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh had harassed her while he was in a drunken state and that he had tried to undress her at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in an intense testimony, said it was 100% certain that this did not happen.
According to Nielsen, more than 20.4 million people would have watched the hearing on Friday.
The company counted average views on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers were not immediately available for other networks that broadcast it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble counting people watching from the office.
To put this in perspective, this audience is similar to that for a football game in the play-offs or Academy Awards.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, whose hosts strongly supported Kavanaugh’s appointment, was ahead of all channels, with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the daily hearing.
ABC was in second place, with a total of 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, CBS was watched by 3.1 million people, NBC by 2.94 million, MSNBC by 2.89 million, and CNN by 2.52 million.
Interest remained at a high level after the hearing.
Flake was in the middle of Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican’s office issued a statement that he would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, he was filmed by CNN and CBS cameras Friday morning as protesters shouted at him and he tried to climb into an elevator at a Judiciary Committee meeting.
He stared down for a few minutes while people were arguing with him, and everything was broadcast live on CNN.
“I’m right here in front of you,” said one woman.
“Do you think he’s telling us the truth?
He was told, “You have power, while so many women are powerless.”
Flake said his office issued a statement and stated, before the elevator closed, that he would have more to say at the committee meeting.
Television later broadcast the vote live on the Judiciary Committee to advance Kavanaugh's nomination for the Senate vote.
But Flake said he would only do so if the FBI agreed to review the charges against the nominee next week, a request from minority Democrats.
Flake was largely convinced by his conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
Flake's decision came after a conversation with the Coons and several senators thereafter.
Flake's election was an important one, as it was obvious that the Republicans would not have the votes needed to approve Kavanaugh without investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Accuses Critics of ‘Political Games’ on Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accuses critics of her plans to leave the European Union of “political games” with Britain’s future and undermining national interests in an interview with the Sunday Times.
Theresa May, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, attended the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview that is next to the photo on the front page of the newspaper, former Prime Minister Boris Johnson issued an attack on its Brexit plan, the so-called Chequers plan, saying the proposal that Britain and the European Union would "recoup their tariffs".
Wayde Sims Shooting: Police Arrest Dyteon Simpson, Suspected of Killing LSU Player
Police have arrested a suspect in the deadly shooting of 20-year-old LSU basketball player Wayde Sims.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and jailed on charges of second-degree murder, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
Authorities released the footage of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said the Sims had lost their glasses during the turn.
Police recovered the glasses from the crime scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, according to WAFB, a CBS affiliate.
After Simpson’s interrogation, police say he admitted to having shot Wayde fatally.
His bail was set at $350,000, according to the lawyer.
The Baton Rouge Law Office published a preliminary report on Friday, saying the death was caused by a gunshot to the head through the neck.
The department pays tribute to the Louisiana police force, the state police forensic laboratory, the police at Southern University, and the citizens of the area for the assistance provided in the investigation, which led to the arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the police for “diligence and the pursuit of justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
The 1.98-meter-high striker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
Last season, he averaged 5.6 points and had 2.6 recoveries.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was “devastated” and “shocked” by Wayde’s death.
“This is worrying me all the time,” Wade said.
A volcano has thrown a column of ash over Mexico City.
The ash from the Popocatepetl volcano reached the southern districts of the Mexican capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexican citizens on Saturday to keep their distance from the volcano after activity in the crater started and 183 emissions of gas and ash were recorded within 24 hours.
The center monitors several hummings and vibrations.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash on car windshields in Mexico City’s neighborhoods, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in the activity of the volcano, which is located 72 km southeast of the capital, after a 7.1 magnitude earthquake rocked central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Dispute between police and Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with the gendarmes on the first anniversary of Catalonia’s secession vote, gathering thousands of opposing demonstrators.
A group of masked pro-separatists kept away from the gendarmes bombarded them with eggs and powder paint, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that were usually flooded by tourists.
The riots intensified later, with the police using their batons to control the situation.
For several hours, pro-independence groups chanted “We don’t forget, we don’t forgive”, while Union protesters shouted “Long live Spain!”
14 people received medical care for minor injuries caused during the protests, according to local media.
Tensions remain high in the region that wants to become independent a year after the October 1 referendum was deemed illegal by Madrid, but celebrated by Catalan separatists.
Voters chose, by an overwhelming majority, to become independent, although voting participation was low, and those against secession boycotted, for the most part, the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 100 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting at polling stations in the region, leading to violent riots.
Pro-independence groups camped overnight Friday evening to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration continued, but the protesters were forced to choose a new path.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer has hopes of gaining independence from Catalonia.
“Last year I had some of the most beautiful moments of my life.
“I watched my parents cry with joy that I could vote, but now we have nothing to do,” he said.
Despite achieving a vital but close victory in the regional elections of December last year, Catalan pro-independent parties tried to keep up this year, many of the most well-known leaders are either in exile and refereeing to their own exile, or in detention.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest on his phone in support of police, said politicians on both sides fueled the conflict.
“The situation is getting more and more tense,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in prison since the end of last year, announced that he will run for the European Parliament next year.
"As a candidate for the European elections, it is the best way to denounce the regression in democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Several men arrested after they entered a house by car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car broke into a house in Londonderry on several occasions.
The incident took place on Thursday at approximately 7:30 p.m. in Ballynagard Crescent.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said damage was caused to the gates and even the building.
It seems that at some point, an arcade was used against the car.
Menga's shot helped Livingston win 1-0 against the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first win for Livingston
Livingston left the Rangers unanswered, with Steven Gerrard reaching his second defeat in 18 games as manager of Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's shot proved to make a difference while Gary Holt's team played at the same level as Hibernian in the second half.
Gerrard's team is left without a moving Premier League win this season and is facing the Hearts leaders, being behind them with eight points next Sunday.
Prior to that, the Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston continues undefeated in the division up to six games, with Holt's head coach still feeling the taste of defeat as he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses his chance against crunchy visitors
Holt’s team should have gone a long way before enrolling, and their orientation caused all sorts of problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson managed to penetrate and tried to shoot through the gate space, then Alan Lithgow managed to shoot wide after he slipped in to intercept the ball sent by Craig Halkett.
The hosts were content to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could make trouble for visitors at the free kicks.
And that's how the crucial goal came.
The Rangers accepted a free kick, and Livingston managed an opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson collaborating to take care of Menga, who smashed and scored from the center of the box.
At that point, the Rangers dominated the possession, but faced the impenetrable defense of the host, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was no longer bothered by the rest of the match.
This game model continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced a defense from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was unsuccessful against Allan McGregor of the Rangers, and Lithgow gave a wide shot from another Livingston player.
The diagonal passes continued to come in which the Livingston team, but unsuccessfully, and the two penalties applications - after Halkett abruptly beat Glenn Middleton and after a hent - were not accepted.
"Phenomenal game" offered by Livingston – analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
A performance and a phenomenal result for Livingston.
They were excellent, without exception, continuing to exceed expectations on an upward trajectory.
Their style of play and the team have not changed at all since returning to the top, but the merits must be given to Holt for the way he coached his team since he took over.
He had so many models to follow.
Captain Halkett was great, with an excellent organized defense, while Menga put Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall in trouble throughout the game.
But the Rangers weren’t very inspired.
Although they have had good performances since they were driven by Gerrard, they have not reached the same standards.
The goal passes were unsuccessful, they only managed once to catch the free opponents' gate, and this should be an alarm signal for the Rangers, who are in the middle of the ranking.
Mixed reactions to Erdogan's visit to Cologne
Everything was pink on Saturday (September 29th), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin for breakfast.
It is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, aimed at redressing relations between NATO allies.
They are dissatisfied with issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s accession to the EU.
In this context, Erdogan went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest number of Turkish citizens in the world, outside of Turkey.
Police have invoked security reasons to prevent the gathering of a crowd of 25,000 people in front of the mosque, but enough supporters have gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan, mostly Kurds, have made their voices heard, condemning Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him with open arms in the country.
The contradictory protests reflect the division in respect of a visitor considered a hero by some Turks in Germany and an autocrat by others.
Road accident in Deptford: a cyclist dies after collision with a car
A cyclist died after a collision with a car in London.
The accident took place at the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a crowded street in Deptford, southeast of the city, around 10:15.
The driver of the car stopped, and paramedics showed up at the scene of the accident, but the man died on the spot.
The accident comes just months after another cyclist died in an accident that took place on Childers Street in which the driver fled from the scene, which is about a mile from where the accident took place on Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police said the officers were trying to identify the man and inform his relatives.
Access is restricted in the area, the bus route is diverted, and motorcyclists are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Jail: Six Officers Injured After Injury
Six officers in the prison were injured following a beating at a men’s high-security prison, a prison representative said on Friday.
On Sunday, a turmoil at HMP Long Martin in Worcestershire started at around 9:30, which is underway.
Specialized officers were brought in to deal with the rigging, in which eight detainees are involved, isolated in a wing.
Officers were treated on the spot for minor injuries to the face.
A prison spokesperson said: “The assistance of the prison’s specialized staff was requested to deal with an ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members received medical care after they were injured.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we have very clear rules as to those responsible, who will be transferred to the police and could spend a longer period of time after gratification."
In HMP Long Lartin there are more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the governor of the prison needed hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
And last year, in October, rioting officers were called to prison to deal with a very serious situation, staff being attacked with billiard balls.
Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City are in danger of being flooded due to Hurricane Rosa (dry zones can enjoy the benefits as a result of this)
A tropical depression rarely occurs in Arizona, but this is likely to happen early next week, as the remaining energy resources of Hurricane Rosa will be used in the southwest desert, presenting a risk of rapid flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued rapid flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday in the western area of Arizona, south and east of the Nevada region, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to have a direct trajectory to Phoenix on Tuesday, and in the second part of Monday it will cause precipitation.
The National Meteorological Service of Phoenix announced in a tweet that “only ten tropical cyclones have maintained a storm or tropical depression at a distance of about 320 km from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane with action at a distance of about 60 km from the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict precipitation between 5 and 10 cm, with isolated amounts of up to 15 cm in Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
In other areas of the southwestern desert, including the center of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, quantities between 3 and 5 cm will be recorded, with total possible quantities up to 10 cm in isolated areas.
For regions outside of the risk of rapid flooding, the rain brought by Rosa could be a blessing, given that the region is affected by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious problem, in some areas, torrential rain will be beneficial because the south-west faces drought problems.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, just over 40 percent of Arizona is facing at least severe drought, respectively, the second-largest category,” information found on weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa will lead to landslides on the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, which still had hurricane power on Sunday morning, with winds of up to 136 km per hour, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and moves north with 19 km per hour.
The storm will meet colder waters in the Pacific and will therefore decrease.
Thus, it is expected to produce landslides in Mexico, with a tropical storm power in the afternoon or evening on Monday.
The torrential rains in Mexico could be significant, presenting a high risk of flooding.
"Torrent rainfall of between 8 and 10 cm" from Baja California to northwestern Sonora is expected, and can reach up to 25 cm," according to weather.com.
Then, Rosa will head north in Mexico as a tropical storm, before reaching the Arizona border on Tuesday morning, as a tropical depression, passing through Arizona and arriving in southern Utah on Tuesday night.
“The main danger posed by Rosa or her remains is extreme torrential rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and the desert in the southwestern United States,” a National Hurricane Center spokesperson said.
It is expected that these rains will produce sudden floods, which will endanger people’s lives, and will bring waste streams into deserts, as well as landslides into mountainous areas.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: four people arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old man was found in some of Somerset’s neighborhoods with gunshot wounds.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton on Saturday at about 4:00 a.m.
He was taken to the hospital, where he was in stable condition.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-olds and one 20-year-old were arrested last night in the Radstock area, according to police in Avon and Somerset.
The officers asked for the help of citizens who might have material on their mobile phone, respectively, to appear at the police station.
Trump says Kavanaugh has faced “dissatisfaction and anger” of the Democratic Party
“A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote of rejection of the Democratic Party’s ruthless and outrageous tactics,” Trump said at a meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump also said Kavanaugh faced the “dissatisfaction and anger” of the Democratic Party during his nomination.
On Thursday, Kavanaugh testified before Congress, vehemently denying Christine Blasey Ford’s claims about having sexually harassed her ten years ago when they were teenagers.
Ford has also testified at the hearing about her claim, according to the report.
The president said on Saturday that “the American people saw on that day Kavanaugh’s genius, quality and courage.”
“A confirmation vote by Judge Kavanaugh is a confirmation vote for one of the best lies in the legal realm of this generation,” he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh’s nomination while talking about the importance of the Republican presence in the midterm elections.
“We are five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our lives.
I’m not a candidate, but in a way, I’m a candidate,” he said.
“For this reason, I’m everywhere expressing my positive opinion about the candidates that I consider outstanding.”
Trump argued that Democrats are on a mission to “resist and obstruct.”
The first key procedural vote in the Senate since Kavanaugh’s nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, an assistant to the GOP leadership told CNN.
Hundreds of people killed by earthquake in Indonesia, the number is increasing
At least 384 people have been killed, many of them taken by the huge waves that hit the beaches when a powerful earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered Friday at a beach festival in the city of Palu, when waves of six meters high hit the beach at dawn, people being taken by the water and destroying everything in their way.
The tsunami was followed by an earthquake of 7.5 degrees.
“When the tsunami threat was issued yesterday, people were still seeing their activities on the beach and did not immediately run away, thus becoming victims,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the BNPB disaster mitigation agency, told a news conference in Jakarta.
“The tsunami brought with it cars, bushes, houses, hitting everything on the land,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami traveled widely at a speed of 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
He added that some people were forced to climb trees to escape the tsunami and survived.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Photos published by the disaster agency show several destroyed buildings and shops, overturned and collapsed bridges, as well as a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the relics continued to shake the town on the coast.
The quake was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) said the energy emitted by Friday’s powerful earthquake was about 200 times higher than the power of the Hiroshima atomic bomb in World War II.
The geographic structure of the city, which is at the end of a long and narrow bay, probably intensified the extent of the tsunami, the spokesman added.
Nugroho described the damage as "extended" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of the victims were found trapped under the ruins of the collapsed buildings, he said, along with the 540 injured and 29 missing.
Nugroho said the casualties and damage could be greater along the 300 km coast north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the earthquake epicenter.
The communications were “completely disrupted, with no information” in Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living there,” the Red Cross said, adding that its staff and volunteers are heading for the affected areas.
He added: “This is already a tragedy, but it could get worse.”
On Saturday, the agency was harshly criticized for not informing about a tsunami that would hit Palu, although authorities said the waves had arrived at the time of the warning.
In social media posts, you can hear a man on the upper floor of a building shouting frenzied warnings that the tsunami is approaching people on the adjacent street.
Within a few minutes, a wall of water hits the shore, taking with it buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to immediately confirm the veracity of the material.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage, which blocked communications in Palu, making it difficult to coordinate authorities’ rescue efforts.
The army has begun sending cargo planes with aid from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but people evacuated still need food and other basics.
The city's airport has been reopened for rescue efforts only and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo planned a visit to the evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The number of deaths caused by the Indonesian tsunami exceeds 800.
The situation is extremely serious.
While Word Vision staff from Donggala arrived safely in the city of Palu, where employees are housed in improvised shelters in the office yard, they passed by devastating scenes, Doseba said.
He added: “They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed.”
The situation is very serious.
Even though aid groups began to launch relief efforts in the event of a disaster, some people complained that foreign workers with extensive expertise had been prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, financial resources, material delivery and personnel can only reach the place of production of a disaster if it is declared a national disaster area.
This hasn't happened yet.
“It’s still a disaster at the provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“After the government says, ‘Yes, this is a national disaster,’ we can begin international aid actions, but nothing has been announced yet.”
After the second night of Friday’s earthquake and tsunami in Palu, friends and families of the missing hoped that their loved ones would be miraculously saved from such a national disaster.
On Saturday, a boy was pulled out of a canal.
On Sunday, rescue workers released a woman who was under ruins for two days, with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the national paragliding team, trained for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia, two of the missing paragliders.
Other prisoners at the Roa Roa hotel, including Mandagi, were his students.
“Given my experience in paragliding, I have my own emotional burden,” he said.
Gendon told how, a few hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel in the community of paragliders, he sent desperate messages on WhatsApp to competitors in Palu who participated in the festival organized on the beach.
But in the right of his messages appeared only a grey steak, and not two blue steaks.
“I think that means the messages weren’t sent,” he said.
A group of thieves stole $26,750 while feeding an ATM in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, the thieves stole the sum of $26,750 from a Brink employee who feeds an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car emptied an ATM from the entertainment complex and was preparing to carry more money, Dennis McCarthy wrote in a statement.
While he was busy, another man "runned through the back of employee Brink" and stole a bag of money to be transported.
According to the statement, witnesses noticed several suspects fleeing the scene, but police did not mention the number of people involved in the incident.
Any person who has information about their identity is asked to contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes stage name to Ye
The rapper Kanye West changed his stage name to “Ye”.
On Saturday, he announced the change on Twitter: “The individual officially known as Kanye West.”
West, 41, has been called "Ye" for some time and uses this title as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
This change comes before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album, Yandhi.
It comes on the show instead of the singer Ariana Grande, who canceled "for reasons of an emotional nature," the show's producer said.
In addition to being an abbreviation of the current stage name, West has previously stated that the word has religious significance for him as well.
"I think 'yes' is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," West said earlier this year, as part of a discussion about the title of the album with radio host Big Boy.
“So I’m you, I’m us, it’s about us.
It all started with “Kanye,” which means unique, and came to “Ye,” which is a reflection on our good, evil, vague, and whole things.
The album is more of a reflection on what we are as people."
He is one of several rappers who chose to change their stage name.
Sean Combs had countless stage names, Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced his preference for the name Love and Brother Love.
And a former West collaborator, JAY-Z, changed his name, sometimes with punctuation, sometimes without, as well as in large letters.
Mexico's President vows not to use military force against civilians
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has promised he will never use military forces against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students.
On Saturday, Lopez Obrador promised at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would “never use the military to repress the Mexican people.”
The troops fired at a peaceful demonstration in the market on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people at a time when the leftist movements of the students were taking root in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by granting monthly grants to students and by opening several free public universities.
He said that unemployment and the lack of educational opportunities attract young people to criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double funding for AI
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount it spends on research in the field, says Kai-Fu Lee, the investor and user of artificial intelligence, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after more members of the U.S. government have made announcements about AI, even though there is a lack of an official strategy for artificial intelligence in the U.S.
In the meantime, China presented its plan last year: it aims to be at the forefront of AI innovation by 2030.
“Doubling the budget for AI research would be a good start, given that all other countries are far behind the U.S. and that we are looking for the next AI discovery,” Lee said.
Doubling the funds could double the chances of the next big AI achievement being made in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book “Superpowers of AI: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China’s most prominent companies, Face<0x2B><0x2B>.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that defeated U.S. player Othello, who was the best in the field at the time, and later served as CEO of Microsoft Research and president of Google's subsidiary in China.
Lee appreciated previous competitions by U.S. governments in the field of technology, such as the Agency’s Robotics Challenge of advanced research projects in the field of defense, and asked when it would be the next, to help identify future visionaries.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get government funding, Lee said.
“It’s not China that puts bars on academic leaders, it’s corporations,” Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired outstanding graduates from universities to work at AI in recent years.
Lee said changes to immigration policy could help the U.S. intensify its AI efforts.
“I think it should automatically be offered a visa to PhD students in AI,” he said.
The State Council of China issued a Plan for the Development of the New Generations of Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
The National Foundation for Natural Sciences in China provides financial support to individuals in academic institutions similar to the way the National Foundation for Science and other government organizations provide money for researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic activity is lower in China, Le said.
At the beginning of the year, the U.S. Department of Defense set up a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, with the aim of involving partners in the field and academics, and the White House announced the formation of a selection committee in the field of artificial intelligence.
This month, the U.S. Army Research Institute (DARPA) announced a $2 billion investment for an initiative called “AI Next.”
Also, at this time, the NSF invests more than $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
In the meantime, there have been no changes to U.S. legislation aimed at creating a National Security Commission in the field of Artificial Intelligence.
Macedonians will vote in referendum if they want to change the name of the country
Macedonian citizens voted in a referendum on Sunday if they wanted the country’s name to be changed to “the Republic of North Macedonia,” a change that would resolve a decade-old dispute with Greece that opposed its accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which includes a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of the neighbouring country is a claim on its territory and has opposed its accession to the EU and NATO.
The two governments agreed in June on the proposed new name, but opposition nationalists argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia’s Slavic majority population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and that a boycott campaign had cast doubt on the presence of the vote, as it was possible not to reach the minimum limit of 50%, necessary for the validation of the referendum.
The question on the ballot for the referendum will be: “Do you agree to join the EU and NATO, accepting the agreement with Greece?”.
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say it is a price to be paid by Macedonia, one of the countries that resulted from the destruction of Yugoslavia, in order to be accepted into entities such as the EU and NATO.
“I am here today to vote for the future of the country, so that the young people of Macedonia live free under the umbrella of the European Union, because that means safer lives for all of us,” said the 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, quite a few members of parliament have said they will respect the result of the vote to make it decisive.
For the name to be changed, a two-thirds quorum in parliament is required.
The State Electoral Commission said no irregularities were reported until 1 p.m.
However, participation was only 16%, compared to 34% in the last 2016 parliamentary elections when 66% of the people with the right to vote showed up to vote.
“I came to vote for my children and for our place in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter from Skopje, the country’s capital.
On 30 September 2018, Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dusko voted in a referendum to change the name of Macedonia, which will allow him to join NATO and join the European Union.
In front of the Skopje parliament, the 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small scene and pulled chairs in front of the tents raised by those who will boycott the referendum.
“We support NATO and the EU, but we want to join them with the top, not the back door,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If we are not wanted by the name of Macedonia, we can go to other countries, such as China and Russia, and we can become part of the Eurasian Union."
Zaev said NATO membership would bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
“I think the majority will be in favor of changing the name, because more than 80% of our citizens are in favor of joining NATO and the EU,” Zaev said.
He said a result in favor of changing the name would be “confirmation of our future.”
According to a poll published last month by the Institute for Policy Research, between 30% and 43% of citizens with the right to vote will participate in the referendum, under the number of participants required.
According to another poll conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia, 57% of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote for the change.
In order for the referendum to be valid, the vote must be 50% plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would represent the first serious blow to the pro-Western government’s policy since its takeover in May last year.
Video: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City manages to pass the entire defense of the Brighton team and score a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling have managed to pass Brighton's defense and win Manchester City 2-0 at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England on Saturday.
It seemed that Aguero was incredibly easy to score in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker received a pass in the middle of the field at the beginning of the sequence.
He moved very quickly among three defensive players from Brighton, before reaching the free side of the field.
Then, Aguero woke up surrounded by four players from the opposing team.
He managed to pass a defender, and then outperformed several opponents on the sidelines of the Brighton team.
After that, he took a pass to the left, the balloon reaching Sterling.
The English forward sent the ball back to Aguero, who hit the ball with his right foot, avoiding Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan with a shot at the right side of the gate.
"Aguero is facing a few leg problems," Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We talked to him and agreed to play 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We’re lucky he scored a goal at the time.”
But Sterling is the one who got their initial lead for the Azuri in the Premier League game.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got a deep pass on the Brighton team's territory at that stage.
Then he gave a pass on Leroy Sane's left flank.
Sane dribbled the balloon several times until he sent a pass to Sterling, who sent it towards the gate.
The Azuri attacker hit the balloon to the net just before heading off the field.
Manchester City will face Hoffenheim in the group stage on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to wreak havoc in the game against the Rockies
With the national team eliminated from the competition in the play-offs, there were not too many reasons to force another start.
But Scherzer, being extremely competitive, hopes to win Sunday in the game against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still implications in the play-offs for the Rockies, who have an edge over a game against the Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West.
The Rockies got at least one unpredictable spot, with a 5-2 win over the national team on Friday night, but still trying to keep their first division title.
“Even if we don’t play for nothing, at least we can enjoy the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd, and the other team would probably play at the highest level of any point I could face this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to compete in these circumstances?”
The national team has not yet announced the player who will open the match on Sunday, but according to the sources, it is inclined to let Scherzer give the first shot in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would be on the opening kick of the match with number 34, had a warm-up session on Thursday and will throw in normal conditions this Sunday.
The Washington midfielder has an 18-7 score and an ERA of 2.53 and 300 misses in 220 and 2/3 matches this season.
Trump Expresses Support in West Virginia <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
The president referred to the situation regarding a decision by the Supreme Court regarding Brett Kavanaugh while talking about the importance of the Republican presence in the midterm elections.
“All of our efforts are at stake in November.
There are five more weeks until one of the most important choices in our life.
This is one of the great ones, I don’t run, but I actually run, which is why I’m trying my best to support good candidates,” he said.
Trump continued: “You see this horrible, radical group of Democrats, you see what’s going on right now.
And they are determined to take back power by using any necessary means, you can see their evil.
They don’t care who they hurt, who they have to crush to get power and control, that’s what they want, to have power and control, and we won’t give it.”
He also said the Democrats are on a mission of “resistance and obstruction.”
“And you can see that in the last four days,” he said, describing Democrats as “angry and evil, disgusting and lying.”
He referred to Senator Dianne Feinstein of the Democratic Party and who is part of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which was heavily looted by the public.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you disclose the document?
Oh, please?
Hmm... I... wait a minute—that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party no longer tolerates people with a different viewpoint.
People who express their opinions are no longer tolerated.
It did not surprise me at all that Momentum activists in my local party supported the motion of censorship as far as I am concerned.
After all, I am just one of the members of the Labour Party in Parliament who has been told that they are not welcome, just because we have expressed our opinion.
Joan Ryan, my colleague in Parliament, has received similar treatment because she was vehemently anti-Semitic.
As far as I am concerned, the motion for censorship has been a criticism of me for not agreeing with what Jeremy Corbyn said.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, similar issues, ironically, about which neither Jeremy had a common opinion with previous leaders.
The statement for the Labour Party’s Friday meeting in Nottingham East said that “we want our meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
Most of the eight-year period as a member of the Labour Party Parliament, the GC meetings on Friday evening were like this.
Unfortunately, today, many meetings do not take place in this way, and the promise of a “better, milder” political environment has long been forgotten, if ever respected.
It has become increasingly evident that different opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that each opinion is judged according to what is accepted by the party leadership.
Things began to be like this when Jeremy became a leader, when I noticed that some colleagues with whom I had a common vision on politics began to expect me to change my way of thinking and to agree with some things the EU previously would not agree with, among them being numbered.
Every time I speak in public, no matter what I say, there is a wave of abuse on the desocialization networks that calls for my elimination from the party, denouncing center politics, telling me I shouldn’t be in the Labour Party.
And I'm not the only person who's dealing with this.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than my colleagues, because comments about my person tend to be of a political nature.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who face abuse of a sexual or racist nature, but they maintain their level of involvement in this.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is that abuse has become a normal thing.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should adopt a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer accept different views within the party, and with every motion of censorship or change of selection rules, the party becomes increasingly less flexible on this issue.
A lot of people have advised me in the last two years to put my head down, not to be so vocal, and everything will be “okay” like that.
But that's not why I went into politics.
Ever since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, when I was a student, motivated by the fact that the negligence shown by Thatcher's government led to the collapse of my class, I wanted to fight for improved public services for those with the greatest local need for them.
I have never concealed my political views, including in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East can say that my views on politics and issues with which I disagree with the current leadership are ambiguous.
To the people who supported Friday’s motion, I can only say that, in the context of the country heading for Brexit, which will affect our local households, businesses and services, I do not understand their desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But the only message I want to convey is not for the Momentum Group in Nottingham, but for the citizens, whether or not they are members of the Labour Party: I am proud to represent you and I promise you that I do not consider your threat of party elimination or political opportunism to stop me from making decisions.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: the Ayr football team reaches the top of the rankings
Despite the fact that two late attempts influenced the final result in some way, there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win today’s highly interactive match in Tennent’s Premiership.
He is now at the top of the rankings, being the only team without any defeat in the top ten.
In the end, it all came down to their better defense, as well as the fact that they took more advantage of the chances that emerged, which helped the host team and gratified coach Peter Murchie.
“We have been subjected to several tests during our games so far and we continue to be unbeatable, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said: "The merits are given to the Ayr team, they took advantage of the chances more than we did."
Grant Anderson's attempt of the 14th minute, transformed by Frazier Climo, gave the Ayr team an advantage, but a yellow card received by the Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who was able to join the team, this transformed him into the Warriors, allowed the unsuccessful team's Jacqueline Jacrose to switch.
Climo got a penalty for Ayr and, even in the middle of the match, managed to register, and then managed to transform an individual attempt, and the score was 17-5 for Ayr at the break.
But Melrose started the second rehearsal very well, and Patrick Anderson's essay, transformed by Baggot, reduced the margin to five points.
The match was suspended for a few minutes due to the serious injury of Ruaridh Knott, who was taken off the field with the plate, and from the restart of the game, Ayr was released through the attempt of Stafford McDowall, transformed by Climo.
Ayr team captain Blair Macpherson then received a yellow card and again, the Melrose team made the reserve player pay with an untransformed attempt by Bruce Colvine, at the end of a heavy pressure.
However, the host team recovered, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card because he liked Climo without the ball, MacPherson managed to score, giving Ayr a lead.
Climo transformed the try, as he did again near the start of the game, after Kyle Rowe executed a "box kick" move and sent extreme Gregor Henry into the depths for the host team's fifth try.
The star of the sitcom "Still Game" seems ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
Ford Kiernan, the star of the sitcom Still Game, seems ready to move into the hospitality industry after learning he was appointed director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old man plays the role of Jack Jarvis on the BBC's beloved show, writing the script and playing alongside his longtime partner, comedy actor Greg Hemphill.
The two announced that the next series, number nine, would be the last, and it appears that Kieman is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to the official registry information, this is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the news, though a source from Scottish Sun suggested Kiernan wanted to get involved in the “restaurant development industry.”
“The sea is ours”: Bolivia hopes the court will reopen the way to the Pacific
Marines patrol a naval headquarters full of cranes in La Paz.
Public buildings bear the blue flag, like the ocean.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are covered with the motto: “The sea is our right.
We've got to get her back."
Along Bolivia, which has no outlet to the sea, the memory of a lost coastline in front of Chile in a bloody 19th-century resource conflict is still alive – just like the desire to sail back into the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are probably at the highest level in recent decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling by the International Court of Justice on October 1, after five years of deliberations.
“Bolivia has the necessary momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, awaits the result with a positive vision,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will follow the ICJ’s decision on the big screens across the country, hoping that the Hague court will give a ruling in favor of Bolivia’s claim and that, after decades of firm discussions, Chile is forced to negotiate the granting of a sovereign exit at sea, Bolivia.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic president – who faces a controversial fight for next year’s re-election – also has a lot to gain from Monday’s decision.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will decide in favor of Bolivia, and that too little would change if it happened.
The UN body in the Netherlands does not have the power to grant the territory that belongs to Chile and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of the possible talks.
The fact that the ICJ’s decision comes just six months after the final pleas were heard indicates that the case “was not complicated,” said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And not only has Bolivia not been successful in the cause, but it is possible that the last four years have given it back.
“The problem of access to the sea has been diverted by the current Bolivian administration,” Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
Morales’ belligerent rhetoric has weakened any Chilean residual goodwill, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to hold discussions afterwards.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision-making process was unusually fast.
Monday will bring for Bolivia “an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile” and a chance to “end the 139 years of disagreements with mutual advantages,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – another of Latin America’s most beloved presidents – used the maritime issue as a political backing.
“Bolivia will never give up the right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“Decision is an opportunity to see that we have to go through the past.”
North Korea Says Nuclear Disarmament Won't Happen If U.S. Can't Be Trusted
Ri Yong Ho, North Korea’s foreign minister, said his country would never disarm its nuclear weapons if it could not trust Washington.
Ri spoke about this on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to keep its promises made during a summit in Singapore with rival leaders.
His comments come in the context where U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be about to resume diplomatic action on the nuclear threat more than three months after his meeting in Singapore with North Korean President Kim Jong Un.
Ri said it was an "irreal vision" for the continued sanctions and objections of the United States regarding the declaration regarding the end of the Korean War to ever cause the northern territory to cede.
Washington has reluctance to agree to the declaration without Pyongyang taking significant disarmament measures first.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there are many skeptics who do not believe that Pyongyang has serious intentions to abandon the arsenal that the country considers the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
A fashion show from Paris presents the latest trends regarding hats and will be available in stores soon
If you’re looking for hats to expand your collection or completely protect yourself from the sun, you don’t have to look anymore.
Fashion creators Valentino and Thom Browne shocked the participants at Fashion Week in Paris, launching a series of oversized and extravagant hats for their spring-summer 2019 collection.
The not practical hats have won the Instagram platform this summer, and the fashion designers have sent out the creations that steal your eyes on the podium.
The piece of resistance of the creation, made by Valentino, was an extravagant hat, beige, with a wide boron, similar to a feather, in which the heads of the models sank.
Other oversized accessories include beaded melons, a wizard’s hat, and even a pineapple, but they’re not designed to protect your head from the cold.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of bizarre masks, in time for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had sewn lips and brought more of the accessory chosen by Hannibal Lecter, and did not fashion haute couture.
One of the creations appeared to be a diving equipment, having an oxygen tube and glasses, while the other appeared to be a melted-ice cone.
And if you want to continue to adopt such a dressing style, with oversized clothing items, you are in luck.
Stylists foresee a return of huge bonnets in luxury fashion stores.
Oversized hats come back after the appearance of the “La Bomba” hat, the straw hat with a wide bore, seen by everyone, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The return of the very practical hat that appeared on all social networks caused the appearance of another oversized creation on the podium, namely the beach straw bags, with the same size as the model in the swimsuit that wears it.
The orange reef bag, with reef straps and a white leather handle, was the strength piece of Jacquemus’ spring-summer 2019 “La Riviera” collection at Fashion Week in Paris
Star stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect to see oversized beach hats and bags in luxury stores next summer, as the fashion designer has had such a strong impact that it will be hard to ignore the demand for accessories.”
John Edward: Linguistic Competencies, Essential for Global Citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a record of academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with another set of exceptional exam results, which is backed by individual and collective successes in sport, art, music and other community efforts.
With more than 30,000 students in Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide services at the highest level to their students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for high and higher education, their chosen careers, and their place as global citizens.
As an educational sector that can conceive and implement a special school curriculum, we note that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject of choice within schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, your words will come to his mind.
If you speak to him in his own language, the words reach to his heart.”
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely solely on English when we want to build relationships and trust people from other countries.
Based on the recent results of this year’s competition, we note that foreign languages are at the top of the rankings, with the highest rates of promotion within independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who have studied foreign languages have obtained a Higher Grade A certificate.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72% of students obtained a Higher Grade A certificate in Mandarin; also, 72% of those studying German, 69% of those studying French and 63% of those studying Spanish have a certificate.
This demonstrates that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will certainly need in the future.
Now, foreign languages, as a subject, are held the same as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school curricula and in other fields.
A survey conducted by the UK Commission on Employment and Skills in 2014 found that for reasons given by employers to fight for vacancies, 17% were attributed to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, increasingly, language skills become imperative for preparing young people for their future careers.
With more job opportunities that require foreign languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career one chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future, having such a lifelong ability.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically put a multilingual person ahead of the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of over 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75% were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to carry on a conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage, 15%.
Therefore, investing in learning foreign languages is important for today’s children.
Having more languages, especially in countries with developing economies, children will be more likely to find significant jobs.
In Scotland, each school will teach other foreign languages.
A number of schools will focus on more modern classical languages, while others will learn languages that are considered to be the most important for the UK when looking ahead to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s interest, there will always be more languages of choice within independent schools, with educators who specialize in this area.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and encourage them with the skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future holds.
It cannot be denied at this time, in a global business environment, that languages continue to be vital for the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should indeed be regarded as “international communication skills.”
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
It has to be done (it has to be done).
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron to make his debut at Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans who want to see LeBron James making his debut for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday's preseason opening against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how many minutes you'll play remains to be established.
"It's going to be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell wrote on Twitter that James will probably play limited minutes.
Following training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers’ six-game preseason program.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need pre-season games to prepare,” he said.
Time of Trump’s election rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is starting a series of campaign meetings tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of five Trump meetings scheduled for next week, which include stoppages in places where the electorate is favorable to him, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
As the confirmation vote for his elected candidate for the vacancy to the Supreme Court is temporarily suspended, Trump wants to strengthen support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans risk losing control of Congress after the November vote.
What time will Trump’s election rally take place in West Virginia tonight and where can I watch it online?
Trump’s meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 19:00 East Coast time tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s election rally in West Virginia online via the live video stream below on YouTube.
Trump is likely to discuss this week's hearing of Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, a hearing that has become strained over allegations of sexual misconduct, while the Senate's expected confirmation vote is suspended for a week, so the FBI invests.
But the main goal of this series of meetings is to help the Republicans, who are facing tough elections in November, win some ground.
Trump’s campaigners said the role of these five meetings next week is “energizing volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majority held in the Senate and House of Representatives,” Reuters reported.
“Congress control is so important to his program that the president will travel to as many states as possible before entering the very busy campaign season,” a Trump campaign spokesperson, who did not want to be named, told Reuters.
Scheduled to take place at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, the rally tonight could attract supporters from “Ohio and Pennsylvania and be featured in the Pittsburgh media,” according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time Trump has visited West Virginia, the state where he won the election at a difference of more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is leading the polls.
“The fact that the president came to try to propel him into polls is not a good sign for Morrisey,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
The 2018 Ryder Cup: The U.S. team proves determination and continues to fight to keep the chance for simple trials starting Sunday
After three clearly dominated sessions, it is possible that Saturday afternoon's foursome test was exactly what the Ryder Cup needed.
The always oscillating pendulum of motivation is a concept invented for the world of sports, but players really believe in it, especially in competitions like this one.
So, where is their motivation now?
"They led us by six points, now the difference is just four points, so we're relying on this drop for a bit of motivation," Spieth said at the end of the day.
Europe still has the advantage, of course, with a four-point lead, when there are still twelve points in the game.
The Americans, Spieth says, feel that the game is starting to change in their favor and that there are plenty of reasons to encourage, the most important of which is the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each won three out of four points.
Spieth sent the balls to the green area with a lethal precision, being an example for his colleagues.
Those festive goutal screams became increasingly noisy as the round progressed, especially when he scored a crucial point by which he returned to parity the score in the fourth game after he and Thomas had been driven by two points after the first two holes.
The kick that won the match at 15 was celebrated with a similar yell, a yell that makes you think the American team still has a chance.
“You just have to focus and worry about your own game,” Spieth says.
That’s all there is to these players.
18 holes to make a good impression.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed revelation of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but adorable couple of Europe won four out of four games and it seems they can’t go wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple that didn't need any additional punches on Saturday afternoon, but this statement is valid for Saturday morning, and for Friday afternoon, even for Friday morning nine points.
This performance and the way in which their energy seems to flow to and from the enthusiastic audience reinforces the view that they will be the most dangerous players on Sunday. No other player would be more popular than Fleetwood or Molinari if they would bring the National Golfers to a good end when a potential Lepene win over Europe.
Preferably, both at the same time, at different holes.
Discussions about the glory of Europeans remain premature, for now.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly passed Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning at the fourballs, when he paired up with Alex Noren.
An additional blow and two doubles at the first nine holes plunged the Spaniard and the Swede into a pit so deep that they were not even close to getting out of it.
On Sunday, however, no one will be safe.
Fourballs and foursomes are fascinating and worth watching closely due to the interactions between couples, given and undated tips and how a strategy can change in place.
The Europeans have played better as a team so far and have a significant advantage in the final day, but this foursome also showed that the U.S. team has the motivation to continue the fight, which some, especially those in the United States, doubted.
Europe lead by 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe starts the last day of the Ryder Cup with a significant advantage after finishing the fourballs and foursomes on Saturday with a 10-6 advantage over the United States.
The inspired pair consisting of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the offense with two wins over a hesitant Tiger Woods, which increased their score so far at Le Golf National by four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, trying to regain the trophy he lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated American players who made many mistakes in the morning's fourballs and won the series with a score of 3 to 1.
The U.S. opposed a more serious resistance to the foursome, where it won two games, but could not reduce the deficit.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points out of the 12 simple Sunday games to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European novice to win four points in a row, and together with Molinari, a pair dubbed “Molliwood” after a sensational weekend, they are the second pair to win four points out of the four opening games in Ryder Cup history.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, they stood out superbly to defeat the discouraged Woods and American novice Bryson Dechambeau with an even clearer 5-4 score.
Woods, who had problems in the two games on Saturday, had occasional genius sci-fi, but so far lost 19 of the 29 games to fourballs and foursomes, seven of which were consecutive defeats.
Justin Rose, who rested during the morning fourball session, came back with partner Henrik Stenson in the foursome and beat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka 2-1, the world's first and third positions.
However, Europe did not have an unhindered journey on this pleasant and cool day in southwestern Paris.
Jordan Spieth, triple major tournament winner, and Justin Thomas became the benchmark for the Americans, earning two points on Saturday.
They managed to win a 2–1 match against the Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs, then came back later and beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4–3 in the foursomes after losing the first two.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team managed to recover a four-point deficit in simple trials, though, because they are the current holders of the trophy, Furyk's players only need an equal result.
However, after being in place for the second two days in a row, a Sunday counterattack seems unlikely.
North Korea says there is “no chance” to unilaterally disarm as long as there is no trust
North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the extension of the sanctions would deepen distrust in the United States and that it was impossible for the country to unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons in such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the Annual General Assembly of the Global Council that “significant measures to prove their good faith” were implemented in North Korea last year, such as stopping nuclear tests and missile testing, dismantling the nuclear test site and the commitment to non-proliferation.
“However, we do not see any appropriate response from the United States,” he said.
“If we can’t trust the United States, we won’t trust our national security capabilities, and in such circumstances, we can’t unilaterally disarm the first.”
Although Ri resumed North Korea’s familiar objections about Washington’s opposition to a “straightened” approach to denuclearization, according to which North Korea would be rewarded if it took step-by-step steps, his statement seemed significant because it did not directly reject the denuclearization.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a premiere summit between a US president and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, where Kim pledged to make progress toward a "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula's North Korean denuclearization" while Trump of.
North Korea sought an official end to the Korean War from 1950 to 1953, but the United States said that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
In addition, Washington has failed to respond to calls for relaxation of the harsh international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
“The U.S. insists on the option of ‘denuclearization first’ and increases the pressure by sanctions to achieve its goal in a coercive way, even objecting to the ‘declaration of an end to the war,’” Ri said.
“The impression that sanctions can get us down on our knees is an illusion that only people who don’t know us have.
But the problem is that prolonged sanctions deepen our distrust.”
Ri did not mention the plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leader referred to at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted the three meetings between Kim and Moon Jae-in, the president of South Korea, over the past five months, adding: “If the denuclearization issue had been negotiated with South Korea and not with the United States, the denuclearization of the peninsula would have been the nuclearization of the peninsula.”
Even under these circumstances, Ri’s tone of speech was very different from last year’s, when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to target U.S. territory with North Korea’s missiles after the “malicious President” Mr. Trump “missed” Ki.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened North Korea with “total destruction,” praised Kim for his courage to initiate the disarmament process, but said the work was just beginning and sanctions would remain in place until North Korea.
On Wednesday, Trump said there was no planned period for this and added: “It doesn’t matter if it lasts two or three years or five months.”
China and Russia say Pyongyang should be rewarded by the UN Security Council for the measures taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: “Implementation of the Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and uninterruptedly until we achieve complete, final and confirmed denuclearization.”
The Security Council unanimously increased the sanctions imposed on North Korea since 2006, in an attempt to block funds for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not have very good results.
When he left Pyongyang in July, he said progress had been made, but just hours later, North Korea denounced that he had made “gangster threats.”
During a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile launch pad and a nuclear complex if the United States takes “appropriate measures.”
He said Kim told him that the “appropriate measures” he was looking for were the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and that he wanted a normalization of relations with Washington.
<0xE2><0x86><0x90> Harvard Students Do Lessons on How to Get Enough Rest
A new Harvard University course this year encourages students to sleep more, in an attempt to combat the growing “macho” culture that makes them subject to “all night” energized, caffeine-energized learning sessions.
A scientist has discovered that often students at the most prestigious university in the world do not even master the basic concepts of the way they should take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, is the one who created the course, which is believed to be the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to create the course after holding a lecture on the impact of sleep deprivation on the ability to learn.
“In the end, a girl came up and said to me, ‘Why are they telling me this only now, in the last year?’”
She told me that she was never told about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, first introduced this year, explains to students the essential concepts of how good sleep habits help improve academic and athletic performance, as well as overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the university’s executive director of health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after finding that students were seriously sleep deprived during the week.
An hour-long course can involve a number of interactive tasks.
Within a section is presented the image of a home room, and students can click on coffee pots, curtains, sports pants and cards to tell them what are the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is affected by lack of sleep, but also about the importance of a program.
In another section, participants were told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
A map of the campus, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily schedule.
“We know we can’t immediately change the behavior of the students.
But we believe that they have the right to know, just as anyone has the right to know what the effects of smoking on health are,” added Professor Czeisler.
The culture that makes students proud of learning all night still exists, he adds, adding that modern technology and the increasing pressure imposed on students have turned sleep deprivation into a growing problem.
Sufficient sleep, of a good quality, should be a student’s “secret weapon” to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said, even to avoid weight gain, because deprivation of sleep makes the brain think that studant your body is starving, which is what it is.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student from California who studies chemical and physics biology, helped Professor Czeisler create the course after attending one of his courses in his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to promote a course for all students.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar study program before enrolling in this institution where competition is fierce.
Professor Czeisler advised students to schedule an alarm to know when it is time to go to bed, as well as for waking hours, and to know what are the harmful effects of the “blue light” emitted by electronic screens and LEDs, which can disrupt the circadian rhythm and cause diffraction.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal knocks Gerrard's team
The Rangers suffer from another case of on-the-go depression as Dolly Menga's blow condemned Steven Gerrard's unconvincing team to a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
The team on Ibrox wanted to get their first away win from the 4-1 victory against St. Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team managed to manage Gerrard's second defeat of 18 games as a coach, which puts the Premiers in Labrod's eight-point lead.
Menga entered seven minutes before the break and uninspired Rangers players did not seem at any point to be able to equalize.
The Rangers thus fell to sixth place in the rankings, while Livingston climbed third place, behind Hibernian, to a single goal difference.
And the Rangers could face other problems as the cough referee Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound after an object was apparently thrown out of the pelvis of the visiting team's fans.
Gerrard switched eight players from the lot which he easily won against Ayr in the Betfred Cup semi-finals.
Holt, on the other hand, used the same 11 Livingstone players who managed to get an equal with Hearts last week and has every reason to be proud of the way his well-trained lot suffocated his opponents during the match.
Even though the Rangers had a superior possession, Livingston used the balls they had more effectively.
He should have scored just two minutes after the start of the game, when Menga's first pass pushed Scott Pittman to the goal defended by Allan McGregor, but the midfielder missed a very good opportunity.
A deep free kick from Keaghan Jacobs found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner, Alan Lithgow, sent her to the bar.
The Rangers took control, but left the impression that they had more hope than they trusted in their game in the last third of the match.
Alfredo Morelos strongly believed he should have received a penalty when he clashed with Steven Lawless in the fifteenth minute of the game, but referee Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian's request.
The Rangers scored only two goals in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was not bothered by Lassana Coulibaly's head or Ovie Ejaria's weak hit.
Although Livingstone’s 34th minute goal did not meet the game’s trend, no one can deny that it was deserved, either for the effort put in.
Again, the Rangers failed to prevent a deep centering of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield had no reaction when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his calm and passed it to Menga, who finished with a single shot.
Gerrard acted on the break, when he switched Ryan Kent to Coulibaly; this movement almost immediately gave fruit, when the extreme centered on Morelos, but the impressive Kelly came out of the bushes to block him.
But Livingston continued to attract visitors to the exact same type of match he preferred, with Lithgow and Halkett intercepting center after centering.
Holt's team could have extended their lead in the final stages, but McGregor managed to block Jacobs' blow, then Lithgow sent his head over the corner.
Glenn Middleton, a reserve for the Rangers, asked for a penalty by the end of the match, but again, Thomson disagreed.
Almanah: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now, a page in our Sunday morning Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago (and the count continues...), is the day on which the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the creation of the device known as the Geiger counter.
An essential device for science ever since, the Geiger counter has become essential for pop culture as it did in the 1950 film The Bells of San Coronado, in which Roy Rogers and Dale Evans played cowboys with unlikely inclinations.
Man: “What else is that?”
Rogers: “It’s a Geiger counter, used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you wear these headphones, you can hear the effects of atoms emitted by radioactivity in minerals.”
Evans: “Yes, they hear a lot of sneezing!”
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before he turned 63.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
New Cancer Vaccine Could Teach the Immune System to ‘detect’ Harmful Cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "detect" harmful cells and destroy them
As part of the treatment, the vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize harmful cells
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, altering them in a laboratory
They can “detect” a protein common to many cancers and then be reinjected
A test vaccine delivers promising results to patients with a range of cancers.
The ovarian cancer of a woman treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize harmful cells has disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, altering them in the laboratory so that they can "detect" a common protein of many cancers, called HER2, and then re-injecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Institute of Oncology in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results suggest that we are dealing with a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “determines the growth of several types of cancers,” including those of the breast, ovaries, lung and colorectal, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach, to take immune cells from patients and “teach them” to target cancer cells, also worked for the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West held a diatribe of support for Trump while wearing a MAGA hat after appearing on SNL.
It didn't work out too well.
Kanye West was smuggled into the studio during Saturday Night Live after a show unleashed in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he intends to run for office in the 2020 election.
After performing the third song, called Ghost Town, during which he wore a Make America Great hat, the artist unleashed a speech against the Democrats and reaffirmed his support for Trump.
“Often when I talk to a white person, I’m asked, ‘How can you like Trump? He’s racist.’
“Well, if I had been worried about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago,” he said.
SNL began the show with a screenplay starring Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star took over Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on allegations of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, West's diatribe filming was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock was trying to take West over with this post.
In addition, West complained to the public that he had trouble in the backyard because of his whisper.
“They tried to intimidate me behind the scenes.
They said, "Don't go out wearing this hat."
I was assaulted!
They also told me I got very low,” he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West went on, “You want to see how low I got?” and then he said, “I’m going to grab Superman’s coat, because that means you can’t tell me what to do.
Try it with love.”
His comments attracted public outcry at least twice, and members of the SNL team appeared to be embarrassed, Variety reported; one person from the team told the publication: "There was a complete silence in the studio."
West was invited as a last-minute replacement for soloist Ariana Grande, whose beloved, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West raised many eyebrows when he performed the song I Love it dressed like a bottle of Perrier.
West was backed by the leader of the TPUSA conservative group, Candace Turner, who wrote on Twitter: "For one of the bravest spirits among us: THEM MULTISHES THAT YOU HAVE GLOATED."
Karen Hunter, the host of a talk show, wrote on Twitter that West, simply, “was himself and that’s wonderful.”
“But I choose NOT to reward someone (by buying their music or clothing or supporting their ‘art’) whom I think embraces and expresses an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He is free.
And so are we,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, announcing that from now on it is "the entity officially known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name; West follows in the footsteps of Diddy, formerly known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, took the name Snoop Lion and, of course, the former music legend, Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then to "the artist previously known as Prince".
Accused of attempted murder for a beating in a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after another man was stabbed in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defence lawyer is expected to appear before the court in Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be examined by the Public Prosecutor’s Office.
Kit Harington, the star in the Throne Room, attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for the role of Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series The Urge of the Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor attacked the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that presenting these roles on the screen makes the boys think they have to be tough to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said she felt "something went wrong" and wondered how the issue of toxic masculinity could be managed in the <0x23>MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his co-worker in the Throne Room, Rose Leslie, who is 31, admitted that he is “very determined” to talk about the issue.
“Personally, I’m very determined to talk about it now: where did I go wrong with masculinity?” he asked.
“What did I teach men about how to be like adults, given the problem we’re facing now?”
Kit believes that television might be partly responsible for increasing toxic masculinity through very masculine characters.
He continued: “What is born and what is learned?
What do young boys learn on TV and on the street, what makes them think that they must be a certain type of man?
I think that’s one of the big questions of our time: how can we change that?
Because it’s clear that something has happened to the young people.”
In the interview, he admitted that he will not play in any series based on the Urzela of Thrones after the series ends in the summer of next year, saying that "he finished with the battlefields and the horses".
From November, Kit will play in a new production of Sam Shepard’s True West, which tells the story of a filmmaker and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that the best thing that has happened to him because of the series The Throat of Thrones is that he met his wife, Rose.
“I met my wife when I made this series, so it assured me the future of my family and my life from now on,” said Kit.
Rose played the role of Ygritte, the girlfriend of Jon Snow, the character played by Kit in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on the property of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in the number of new cases
China has announced a 14 percent increase in the number of Chinese citizens suffering from HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected by the disease in China, officials say.
Approximately 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases have been transmitted sexually, unlike in the past.
In the past, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
But the number of people who contracted HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
From year to year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV is an acute problem in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is widely considered.
Because of the country’s conservative values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men will eventually end up marrying a woman.
Many of the cases of transmission of diseases come from inadequate measures of sexual protection in such relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicines as part of its efforts to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that an employee has disclosed data to Republican Party senators, talks about “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday denounced allegations that a member of her team posted personal information about three Republican senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed the allegations were made by analysts and "extremely right-wing" websites.
“Lies, lies, and other miserable lies,” Waters said in a tweet.
The information disclosed included the senators' personal addresses and phone numbers. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information came online Tuesday, posted by an unknown person from Capitol Hill during a Senate hearing on allegations of inappropriate sexual behavior against Brett Kavanaugh, who was nominated as a judge at the Supreme Court.
The leak of information took place shortly after the three senators asked Kavanaugh questions.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was associated with Waters’ office and presented information to a member of Waters’ team, Hill reported.
“These unfounded accusations are completely false, an absolute lie,” Waters said.
“The team member, whose identity, personal information and security were compromised as a result of these false accusations, was in no way responsible for leaking this information.
These unfounded accusations are completely false, an absolute lie.”
Waters' statements were criticized online shortly after they were made, including former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This denial is outrageous,” Fleischer wrote.
“This suggests he doesn’t have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn't do, they don't have to be angry.
It doesn't have to be challenging.
It does not have to question the motives of the defendant.
It has to be calm and calm.”
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters' reaction to that of Judge Kavanaugh, criticized by Democrats, who said he seemed a little too angry during Tuesday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican who is running against Waters in the midterm elections, also commented on the situation on Twitter.
“It’s important, if it’s true,” he wrote.
In its statement, Waters said its office had alerted “the appropriate authorities and legal entities about these false accusations.
“We will make sure that the perpetrators are discovered,” she continued, “and that they will be held accountable to the law for all their destructive and dangerous actions for any of my team members.”
Review Johnny English hits again: wet-free parody of spy movies, starring Rowan Atkinson
It has become a tradition to look for meanings associated with Brexit in any new British film, but this does not apply to the new film in the parody series of action films that features Johnny English as the main character, the series that began in 2003 with Johnny English and came back to life in 2011 with Johnny English.
Will this blinking satire of how strange we are become the nation’s new export opportunity?
However, Johnny English, the incompetent spy with his gaze and rubber face, has been renewed for the second time his license to spoil everything. The character's name means, first of all, that it is a general comic creation for the cinematic audience.
He is, of course, the scrambled secret agent who, despite his claims for luxury and extravagance, has a bit of Clouseau, a drop of Mr. Bean and a knife tip of that guy who contributed with a single note to the musical theme of the 2012 Chariots of Fire at the Olichi desceration.
The character relies on the explorer and mysterious countryless man Atkinson once played in Barclaycard TV commercials, which left chaos behind him.
This last adventure of JE also has one or two nice moments.
I liked it when Johnny English approached a helicopter dressed in a medieval armor and the rotor sticks slightly hit his cockpit.
Atkinson's gift to physical comedy is highlighted, but the humor is rather weak and strangely superfluous, especially because "serious" films such as the 007 series or Mission Impossible reliably offer comedic moments as an ingredient.
Humor seems to be more aimed at children than adults, and for me Johnny English’s quirky adventures are not as inventive and intelligent as Atkinson’s silent movie gags when he plays Bean.
As usual, the premise is that the UK has serious problems.
A cyber-hacker has infiltrated Britain’s supersecret web network of spies and revealed the identities of British agents undercover, to the desperation of the service agent, a sadly minor role for Kevin Eldon.
It’s the last drop for a pompous and under siege prime minister who is already suffering a serious crisis due to the decline in political popularity: Emma Thompson does everything she can with her character like Theresa May, but the script doesn’t give her a chance to shine.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that all active spies have been compromised, so she must activate an agent in the reserve.
This is Johnny English's own joke, now working as a teacher in an upper-class school, but also giving lessons on how to be an undercover agent. Here are some nice jokes, because English runs a School of Rock-style spy academy.
English is brought back to Whitehall for an emergency meeting, then reunited with his former partner, Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine commander, a very enthusiastic and precious character, a role in which Vicki Pepperdine's talent is a bit wasted.
Thus, these Batman and Robin of the creation of confusion in His Majesty's Secret Service return to action, confronting the beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls under the spell of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain’s IT problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough embark on an inner odyssey of burlesque adventures: disguised as waitresses, set fire to a fashionable French restaurant, create chaos when sliding aboard Volta’s luxury vessel, and then English triggers his pure-form anarchy for the house’s virtue when he tries to familiarize himself with a set och.
This last sequence is very ambitious, but no matter how cute and colorful the film is, it seems like a television production for children.
A rather mediocre film.
As with other Johnny English films, I can’t help but wonder: can’t the British film industry really give Rowan Atkinson a role to match his talent?
Workers deny they plan for the British to work four days a week, but to be paid for five
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party would have a radical plan, according to which the British would work only four days a week, but would be paid for five days.
It appears that the party wants corporate leaders to benefit from the possible savings thanks to the AI revolution, giving employees another day off.
Employees would enjoy a three-day weekend, but their salary would not have changed.
Sources say the idea would “fit” with the party’s economic program, which wants to tilt the balance in favor of the workers.
The transition to the four-day working week is supported by the Trade Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A source from the leadership of the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: “Announcement of a policy revision is expected before the end of the year.
It will not happen overnight, but a four-day working week is an appropriate aspiration in the approach of the party to rebalancing the economy in favor of the worker, as well as in the party’s overall strategy on industry.”
The Labour Party is not the first to support this idea; the four-day working week was one of the Green Party’s promises in the 2017 general election campaign.
However, this aspiration is not supported by the entire Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: “The four-day week of work is not a party policy and is not taken into account by the party.”
The shadow cabinet’s chancellor, John McDonnell, took advantage of last week’s workers’ conference to describe his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he is determined to take back power from “faceless directories” and “profits” from utilities.
The shadow cabinet’s chancellor’s plans also refer to the fact that the current shareholders of the water-providing regions may not fully recover their shares, because the Labour government may receive “deductions” due to certain crimes.
It also confirmed plans to appoint workers on the company’s boards of directors and to create ownership funds through which to transfer 10% of private sector companies’ equity to employees, who will thus receive annual dividends of up to about <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy reveal in the show "60 Minutes" whether the FBI investigation would make Kavanaugh change his mind
The FBI's investigation into charges brought against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his candidacy as a judge in the Supreme Court by at least a week and raises the question of whether Republican senators could be persuaded to no longer support him because of the FBI's findings.
In an interview broadcast Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find information that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more willing to do that than his South Carolina colleague.
“Of course,” Kennedy said.
“I said that from the beginning of the hearings; I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when this happened, when the charges came up, and I asked him, “Are you guilty?”
The answer was decided, swiftly, unequivocally."
Graham's voice, however, appears to have been carved in stone.
“I’m determined about Brett Kavanaugh, so it would take some explosive charges,” he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett resolutely rejects the accusations," Graham said, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“None of the people she named confirmed the report.
And it happened 36 years ago.
I doubt that something will change.”
What is the Global Citizen’s Festival and has it managed to do something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event attended by an impressive group of stars with an equally impressive mission: to eradicate world poverty.
At its seventh edition, the Global Citizen Festival will attract tens of thousands of people to Central Park, not only to follow artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B or Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the true purpose of the event, eliminating extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free event ticket (unless they are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), viewers had to pay for a series of tasks or “actions” such as volunteering, sending emails to world leaders, making out-of-the-box phone calls, or making some other significant donations.
But what was the success of the Global Citizen Festival when only 12 years were left to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a good way to convince them to act or is it just another case of so-called “clickivism,” a concept that refers to people who feel they have accomplished something by signing an online petition or sending a message on Twitter?
According to Global Citizen, there have been more than 19 million “actions” from its supporters since 2011, which have promoted different goals.
The organization says these actions have prompted world leaders to announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group was talking about 390 commitments and announcements caused by its shares, in which at least $10 billion has already been spent or raised.
The group estimates that the funds insured so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and intermediaries who have pledged to “help children grow to their full potential”, which has pledged to provide Rwanda with more than $35 million per month on Twitter.
“With the help of the UK government, donors, national governments, and global citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition become just a basement note in the history book,” said Tracey Ullman, Ambassador to The Power of Nutrition.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were carried out in the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced it would fund the The Power of Nutrition project, which will provide nutrition interventions for 5 million women and children.
The answer to one of the most common questions on their website: “What makes you think you can eliminate extreme poverty?”
Global Citizen responded: “It will be a long and difficult road, sometimes we will fall and we will make a mistake.
But like the big civil rights or anti-apartheid movements that have taken place before us, we will succeed because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are among the artists who will perform at this year’s event in New York, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use naval forces for a “blockade” that would complicate Russia’s energy exports, says Home Secretary
Washington can, “if necessary,” call on the naval forces to prevent Russian energy from reaching certain markets, including the Middle East, U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said in a statement.
Zinke argues that Russia’s commitment to Syria, particularly where it acts at the invitation of the legitimate government, is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
“I think the reason I’m in the Middle East is because I want to mediate energy sales, as I do in Eastern Europe and in southern Europe,” he said.
And, according to the official, there are ways and methods to manage the situation.
“The United States has the ability, through our naval forces, to ensure that the maritime routes are open and, if necessary, to create a blockade so that energy does not enter the market,” he said.
Zinke addressed the participants at an event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that declares itself the “voice of the energy consumer” in the US.
He went on to compare the way Washington interacts with Russia and Iran, showing that the approach is practically the same.
“The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less the use and replacement of fuels,” he said, saying about Russia that he “knows one trick” because of the fossil fuel-dependent economy.
The statements come at a time when the Trump administration is trying to increase exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe, to replace Russia, the much cheaper option for European consumers.
In this regard, Trump administration officials, including President Donald Trump, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the “inappropriate” project of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which Trump said would turn Berlin into a “prisoner” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion project of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will double the capacity of the existing pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin said the U.S.’s fierce opposition to the project is driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I think we look at things the same way: energy cannot be an instrument by which pressure is put and consumers should be able to choose suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position attracted critics from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industrial organisation, the German Federation of Industries (BDI), has called on the United States not to intervene in EU energy policies and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem with a third state intervening in issues about our energy,” said Dieter Kempf, president of the German Federation of Industries (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren is “seriously considering” running for president in 2020, Massachusetts Senator says
Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts senator, said on Saturday that she must "think seriously" if she candidates in the presidential election after the midterm elections.
During the meeting at the mayoral seat in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering a nomination.
“It’s time for a woman to go to Washington and repair our broken government, and that’s why we need a strong woman,” she said.
“After November 6th, I will seriously consider whether I will run for president.”
Warren also had something to say about President Donald Trump during the mayor’s meeting, saying that he “directed the country in the wrong direction.”
“I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren was a very vocal critic of Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, the candidate he named for the Supreme Court.
In a Twitter post on Friday, Warren said “normally we need an FBI investigation before the vote.”
However, a poll published on Thursday showed that even a majority of Warren’s voters do not think they should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of “probable” voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run, according to a poll conducted by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent of respondents support such a candidacy.
The poll showed more support for a candidacy for former governor Deval Patrick: 38% of respondents support a potential candidacy for him and 48% are against it.
Other names of well-known Democrats who could run in 2020 are those of Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make a formal decision by January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin Talks About Post-Traumatic Stress Syndrome Suffering from Track Palin at Donald Trump Meeting
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enrolling in September.
On Monday evening, he was arrested and charged in a case of domestic violence.
“The things my own son goes through, which he went through after he came back ... I can understand the suffering of other families who feel the ramifications of post-traumatic stress syndrome and the scars of our soldiers coming back with,” Trump told a rally in support of Donald Trump.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said that her son and other war veterans "return a little different, tougher, come back wondering if there is any respect for what they and their soldiers in the military and air forces, as well as all the other members of the Armed Forces."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, preventing reporting an act of domestic violence and holding a drunken gun, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesperson for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and the District of Columbia contest a new asylum application policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to the new U.S. policy that refuses to grant asylum to victims trying to escape violence caused by gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the District completed an amicus curiae application Friday in Washington to support a dispute over asylum-seeking policies, NBC News reports.
The plaintiff’s full name in the Grace v. Sessions trial that the American Civil Liberties Union initiated in August against federal policy was not disclosed.
She said her partner "and his violent sons, members of a gang" abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
The state-appointed lawyer representing Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which have produced a large number of asylum seekers in the United States, as nations facing a widespread problem of hostages and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy annulled a 2014 decision by the Immigrant Appeals Council that allowed immigrants without documents trying to escape domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The District of Columbia Attorney General, Karl Racine, said Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international legislation".
“Federal law states that all asylum applications must be judged on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and such a limitation violates this principle,” the application said.
In addition, lawyers argue in the application that the policy of refusing entry of immigrants affects the U.S. economy, saying it is more likely that they will become entrepreneurs and “provide the necessary labor.”
Jeff Sessions, the U.S. Attorney General, ordered immigration justices in June to stop granting asylum to victims who are trying to get rid of abuse and violence.
“Asylum is granted to those who leave their country driven by persecution or fear because of discrimination on the basis of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a social group or because of a political opinion,” Sessions said on June 11.
The role of asylum has never been to solve all the problems people face every day in the world, not even all the serious problems.
Desperate rescue operations in Palu, where the death toll has doubled, in a race against a timer to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation has become more and more serious.
“The situation seems very tense,” said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother who aligns her baby suffering from fever at an evacuation center in the destroyed city of Palu.
“Ambulances bring bodies all the time.
Drinking water is not enough.”
Residents began to return to their destroyed homes and organize their flooded goods, trying to save everything that could be saved.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake on the Richter scale, were overcome by the situation.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered fractures to the spine and shoulder, rest outside the military hospital in Palu, where patients are treated outdoors due to strong and continuous responses.
He has eyes full of tears when he remembers how he felt the violent earthquake shaking the five-storey hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
“We didn’t have time to save ourselves.
I was caught in the ruins of the wall, I think,” Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
“I heard my wife screaming for help, then just silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope I'm safe."
U.S. ambassador accuses China of “abusing” “propaganda ads”
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in a U.S. daily praising the mutual benefits of trade between the U.S. and China, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to distribute propaganda materials.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to the China-paid supplement in Des Moines Register, Iowa's best-selling newspaper, after accusing China of meddling in the November 6 election, a charge China rejects.
The allegation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the U.S. election marked what U.S. officials told Reuters is a new phase in Washington’s escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to publish commercials promoting trade, Beijing and Washington are currently stuck in a growing trade war, which involves waves of rising tariffs on imports.
The tariffs imposed by China in retaliation at the start of the trade war were created to affect exporters from states such as Iowa, which backed Trump’s Republican Party, experts in China and the US said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers and businessmen.
In an editorial published Sunday in the Des Moines Register, Branstad wrote that China “continues this abuse by publishing propaganda ads in our own free press.”
“When it disseminates propaganda by publishing an advertisement in the Des Moines Register, the Chinese government does not respect America’s cherished tradition of free speech and free press,” writes Branstad.
“Instead, at the street newsstand here in Beijing you will find few voices of dissidents and you will not see any real reflection of the divergent opinions that Chinese citizens have on China’s worrying economic trajectory, given that the mass media is under control.”
He added that “one of the most important newspapers in China refused to publish” his article, although he did not say what newspaper it was about.
Republicans alienate female voters ahead of midterm elections due to Kavanaugh scandal, analysts warn
As many of the top Republicans support and protect the Supreme Court-appointed Brett Kavanaugh from multiple allegations of sexual abuse, analysts have warned there will be a backlash, especially from women, during the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions created by this scandal were extremely strong, and the majority of Republicans who publicly discussed it intend to continue voting.
“Such reactions will not be forgotten,” Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University’s Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he had doubts that Senator Jeff Flake’s last-minute initiative on an FBI investigation would calm the angry electorate.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, they will not forget tomorrow, and they will not forget in November," Karine Jean-Pierre, senior consultant and national spokeswoman for the progressive group, told the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted “November Friday!” while demonstrating in the Senate halls when Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee chose to continue Kavanaugh’s nomination process despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford’s testimony, Mic reported.
“The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will be very high,” said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst for the news site.
“People say they were already very big and that’s true.
But it could be even bigger, especially among undecided female voters in the suburbs and the young electorate, aged between 18 and 29, who, although they do not approve of the president, often do not vote.
Even before Ford’s public testimony, in which he detailed allegations of sexual abuse brought to the nominee in the Supreme Court, analysts suggested they could follow a backlash if Republicans continue the confirmation process.
“This has become a mess for Republicans,” Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said earlier this week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about the committee vote or the final vote or the possibility that Kavanaugh is confirmed, but also about how the Republicans treated this situation and how they treated it,” Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, an electoral support group for Democrats, told the news channel.
However, Americans seem to be relatively divided about the part that they should believe according to the testimonies of Ford and Kavanaugh: a little more people seem to believe the latter.
A new YouGov survey showed that 41% of respondents strongly believe or believe it is likely that Ford’s testimony was true, while 35% said they strongly believe it or that Kavanaugh’s testimony is likely to be true.
In addition, 38% said Kavanaugh lied, probably or certainly, while only 30% said the same thing about Ford.
At Flake's initiative, the FBI is currently investigating allegations made by Ford, as well as at least one other person, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Last week, Ford took an oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh abused her in a drunken state at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee exposed his genitals to her while attending a party while they were students at Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web Inventor Plans to Create a New Internet to Compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that wants to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company based on Solid, Berners-Lee’s open-source platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who has the right to access the information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt is “global dominance.”
“Now we have to do it,” he said of the startup.
“This is a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own “personal online data archives” or PODs.
It may contain contact lists, programs, calendars, music libraries, or other personal and professional instruments.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in one browser, all at once.
What is unique about this online personal data archive is that the user has complete control over who can access this type of information.
The company calls this “personal data consolidation”.
According to the company’s CEO, John Bruce, the idea is for Inrupt to contribute with adequate resources, processes and skills so that Solid is made available to everyone.
Today, the company is made up of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, a team of developers working on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a complete change when their business models are completely over-the-top at once.
“We don’t ask for their permission.”
In a post published Saturday on Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that “the mission of Inrupt is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of a new Internet on Solid.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he created the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on internet neutrality.
Even after launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic about this next era of the Internet,” Berners-Lee said.
Bernard Vann: The cleric who won the Victory Cross in World War I is celebrated
The only Anglican Church clergyman to win a Victoria Cross medal as a World War I fighter was celebrated in his hometown after 100 years.
Lieutenant-Colonel Bernard Vann won the medal on 29 September 1918 in the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
He was killed by a sniper four days later and never knew that he had been awarded Britain’s highest military honor.
A memorial stone was unveiled on Saturday by his two grandchildren during the parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of the grandsons, Michael Vann, said he was "wonderful" that the stone would be unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather won the medal.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "with a very shallow fog and under intense fire of artillery and machine guns".
Later, he rushed to the front line and, with "a fantastic bravery", opened the way for the soldiers, then attacked an artillery nest alone and managed to eliminate three of the detachment's weapons.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918, just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “a thing I know I’ll never be able to match, but that makes me feel humiliated.”
He, along with his brother, Dr. James Vann, also deposited a crown after the parade, which was conducted by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Orchestra.
Michael Vann said he was "very honored to play a role in the parade" and added that "the value of a true hero is demonstrated by the support a lot of people give."
MMA fans stayed up all night to see the Bellator 206, but got cartoons with Peppa Pig instead.
Imagine you've been up all night watching Bellator 206, a multi-star event just so you can't watch the main event.
The San Jose event schedule contained 13 fights, including six on the main panel, and was to be broadcast live throughout the night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi was preparing to face Rory MacDonald, spectators in the UK were amazed when the broadcast was replaced by an episode of Peppa Pig.
Some were not satisfied at all, because they stayed up all night to watch the fight.
A fan on Twitter described the move to children's cartoons as "a kind of bad joke."
“Government regulations say this content is not suitable for 6am, so they had to switch to children’s programs,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa pig, yes."
Scott Coker, president of Bellator, said that in the future, they will program their events in such a way that they can be watched by spectators in the UK.
“When I think about reruns, I think we could probably figure it out,” Coker said.
“But it’s six in the morning on a Sunday here and we won’t be able to do that until Sunday, our hour, or Monday, their hour.
But we're working on that.
Believe me, when the program changed, I started receiving a lot of text messages and they weren’t all friendly.
We tried to solve the situation, we thought it was a technical mess.
But it wasn’t about that, it was about government regulation.
I can promise you it won't happen next time.
We'll sum up to five fights instead of six, as we usually do. We tried to offer the fans more and we crossed the limit.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Previous articleDesert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt “inferior” over sexuality
Olympic scout Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality, but this motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he only realized when he arrived at school that “not everyone is like me.”
Invited to the first Desert Island Discs show presented by Lauren Laverne on Radio 4, he said he was talking about gay people’s rights to give others “hope.”
The athlete also said that when he became a parent, he cared less about the Olympic Games.
Kirsty Young, the usual presenter of the traditional show, will be missing a few months due to an illness.
Invited to the first edition presented by Laverne, Daley said that when he was a child he felt “inferior” to others because “it was not socially acceptable to like boys and girls as well.”
He said: “Until now, these feelings of inferiority and the fact that I felt different, it was the real things that gave me the strength and the resilience to achieve success.”
He wanted to prove that he was “someone,” he said, so that he wouldn’t disappoint everyone when they finally find out about his sexuality.
The winner of two bronze medals at the Olympics has become a well-known supporter of LGBT campaigns and has taken advantage of his appearance at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to demand more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he decided to speak because he felt lucky that he could live freely, without traces, and because he wanted to give others “hope.”
The triple world champion said he was "taken by surprise" by the fact that he fell in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black.
Daley was married last year to the Oscar-winning filmmaker, who is 20 years older than him, but said the age difference was never a problem.
“When you go through so much at such a young age,” he said, “it’s hard to find someone of the same age who went through the same good and bad times at the first Olympics when he was only 14 years old, and his father died of cancer after three years.”
In June, the two became the parents of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, which, Daley says, changed his “whole outlook.”
“If I had been asked last year, I would have been interested in nothing but winning a gold medal,” he said.
“You know what? There are more important things than the gold medals at the Olympics.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son is named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he was going to die and that one of the last things he wanted was to find out if they had received tickets to the 2012 London Olympics because he wanted to be first.
“I couldn’t tell him, ‘You can’t be the first, Dad,’” he said.
“I held him by the hand when he stopped breathing and just after he stopped breathing and died I finally accepted that he wasn’t invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
“I knew that was what I had dreamed of a lifetime, to jump in front of the spectators in my country at the Olympics, there is no better feeling,” he said.
This also inspired him in the chosen music, Proud by Heather Small, a song that encouraged him before the Olympics and still excites him.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15.
Mickelson, out of shape, was passed on the reserve bank Saturday in the Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Saturday, when he will play in the forty-seventh Ryder Cup match, but he will have to get back in good shape so that this is not an unfortunate occasion.
Mickelson, who plays in the biennial event for the twelfth time, another record, was passed on the reserve bank by captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's fourball and foursome trials.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as was often the case for the U.S. team, the five-time major tournament winner divided his day between being a team-mate and practicing his punches in the hopes of rectifying what was wrong.
The 48-year-old has never had the most straight drives, not even in the best period of his career, so it’s not the best choice for the narrow terrain at Le Golf National, where long areas of rough often punish incorrect hits.
And if the pitch isn’t big enough, in Sunday’s ninth game, Mickelson will face Francesco Molinari, the meticulous British Open champion who allied himself with rookie Tommy Fleetwood and won all four games of the week.
Mickelson’s game could prove absolutely crucial for the Americans, led by four points to the entry into the 12 simple matches, which must start in force at this stage.
Furyk expressed confidence in his player’s ability, but he couldn’t have said anything else anyway.
“He fully understood the role he played today, he punched me on the shoulder, he hugged me and told me he’d be ready for tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is a member of the Hall of Fame and has contributed a lot to these teams in the past and this week.
I had no idea he was going to play in two games.
I imagined more, but this has happened and this is how I thought we should proceed.
He wants to play, like everyone else.”
On Sunday, Mickelson will exceed Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup games.
This could be the end of his career in the Ryder Cup, which has not risen to the level of his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, although Furyk said his presence brought some intangible advantages to the team.
“He’s funny, he’s sarcastic, he’s smart, he likes to play with the players, he’s a great guy in the team’s locker room.”
“I think young players have fun playing with him, it was fun to see them do that during the week.
Its role is more important, it’s not just about the game.”
Europe's team captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the considerable advance could soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the Europeans, knows from experience that the considerable advance of the first day of trials in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable journey.
Denmark debuted in the 1997 match at Valderrama, when the team led by Captain Seve Ballesteros led the Americans by five points, but only if he managed to beat them with a minimum difference of 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 to 131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“I remember that we had a considerable lead at Valderrama; we had a great lead at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we barely managed to win,” Bjorn said after watching how the 2018 team, which won 5–3 on Golf and 10 on the way, both on Friday and Friday.
“So history shows me and my team that it’s not ready yet.
Tomorrow we have to play at the top.
Let's go out there and do everything perfectly.
The game is only ready after the points are passed on the table.
We have a goal and it is to win this trophy, it must remain the goal.
“I’ve always said we have to focus on the 12 players in our team, but we also know what’s waiting for us on the other side: the best players in the world.”
“I’m not in a hurry to draw conclusions,” Bjorn said, pleased with the way his players handled a difficult field.
Tomorrow is a completely different situation.
Tomorrow, individual performances are important, and this is different.
It’s great to be on the pitch with a partner when things go well, but when you’re on your own, then you’re tested to the fullest, as a golfer.
This is the message you have to convey to the players, that they have to be in the best shape tomorrow.
Now they leave their partner behind and they have to play as well as they can."
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk, the captain of the opposing team, hopes that his players will play the rehearsal better than they did with the partners, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Furyk himself was on both sides of such comebacks on the last day: he was on the winning team from Brookline, then in the losing team when Europe won the “miracle of Medina”.
“I remember every word,” he replied when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 captain, managed to encourage his players before the last day.
“We have 12 important matches tomorrow and we’d like to start with some quick wins, like at Brookline, like at Medina.
When the inertia develops in one direction, put a lot of pressure on those matches in the middle.
“We created the right lot and ordered the players the way we wanted, you know, we’re trying to create a little magic tomorrow.”
Thomas was assigned the task of leading the fight: he will face Rory McIlroy in the main match, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are the other Europeans in the second half of the program.
“We chose this group of players in this order because I think it covers all the subjects,” Bjorn said of the lot for the simple test.
Germany's new warship, postponed again
Germany’s newest naval frigate was supposed to be put into operation in 2014 to replace the Cold War warships, but this will not happen until next year, due to faulty systems and rising costs, local media reported.
The entry into service of the "Rheinland-Pfalz" ship, the standard ship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg frigate class, has now been delayed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper, citing a military spokesman.
The vessel should have been introduced into the maritime forces in 2014, but problems arising after delivery affected this ambitious project.
The four vessels of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the old frigates of the Bremen class.
They are supposed to be equipped with a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-vas missiles, as well as stealth technologies, which provide a low radar, infrared and acoustic footprint.
Other important features will include longer maintenance periods; it should be possible for the new frigates to be able to go on missions for two years without returning to the original port.
However, continuing delays mean that these last-generation warships, which are said to increase Germany’s maritime strength, will already be outdated before they enter service, Die Zeit notes.
The F125 frigate was discussed in the press last year when the German Navy officially refused to take the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time that the Navy returned a ship to the builder after delivery.
Not much information is available about the reasons for the refusal, but the German media cited a number of crucial "software and hardware defects" that would have made the warship useless in a combat mission.
The software flaws were important in particular because the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, only half of the crews on the older Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, it was shown that the vessel was of much too heavy weight, which reduced its performance and limited the Navy's ability to add future equipment.
The 7,000-ton Rhineland-Palatinate vessel is believed to be twice as heavy as the vessels used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the defective mechanisms, and the cost of the entire project, including that of the crew training, has become a cause for concern.
It is said to have reached an astonishing figure of 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars), from the initial price of 2.2 billion euros.
The problems of the newest frigates are of particular importance given the latest warnings that Germany’s maritime power is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the defence committee in the German parliament, acknowledged that the Navy “began to be left without vessels that can be sent on missions.”
The official said the problem has increased steadily over time, as the old vessels were discontinued without being replaced with some new ones.
It deplored the fact that none of the frigates in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class came into operation within the Navy.
The National Trust is spying on the secret life of the lilies.
New research that is being carried out on a property in the Scottish Highlands will reveal how bats use the environment to hunt prey.
It is hoped that the findings will reveal new things about the behavior of these unprecedented flying mammals and will help future conservation activities.
The study, conducted by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland, will analyze common dwarf foxes and pygmy foxes, as well as eared foxes and water foxes from the Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment will be located in key locations around the property to track the activity of lilies throughout the season.
The NHS team and volunteers will also conduct mobile studies using manual detectors.
Specialized audio analysis of all recordings will estimate the frequency of sounds made by bats and which species emit certain sounds.
A map of the habitat and a report will be produced to create a detailed picture, on a scale, of their behaviour in the environment.
Rob Dewar, a nature conservation consultant for NTS, hopes the results will reveal which habitat areas are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as the creation of lawn, and what is the best way to maintain forest land for foxes and other associated species.
Flea populations in Scotland and across the UK have declined considerably in the last century.
They are endangered by the construction and development work that affects their nests, but also by the loss of habitat.
Both wind turbines and public lighting are risks, as are flies traps and some chemical treatments for building materials, but also attacks by domestic cats.
In fact, bats are not blind.
However, because they hunt at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated eco-location technique to accurately identify insects and obstacles on their flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 major parks and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, is thinking very seriously about bats.
They have ten trained experts, who periodically conduct studies, control the nests, and sometimes perform rescue missions.
The organization created even the first and only flea reserve in Scotland, on the Thrave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight of Scotland's ten flea species are found.
The estate manager, David Thompson, says this is the ideal territory for bats.
“Here at Thrave, the area is great for bats,” he says.
“We have old buildings, a lot of old trees and a perfect habitat.
But there’s a lot we don’t know about bats, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us understand why they need to multiply.”
It stresses the importance of looking for butterflies before carrying out maintenance work on the properties, as simple unintentional destruction of a maternal nest could kill up to 400 females and chickens, which can destroy the entire local population.
Lilies are protected, and killing, harassment or disturbing them, as well as destroying their nests, are prohibited actions.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official at the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help them.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about bats and we don’t know how populations evolve for many of our species.”
Ronaldo denies rape charges as lawyers prepare to sue Germany’s magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo said the charges against him were "fake news" and that some people "want to advertise" using his name.
His lawyers are determined to sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published the accusations.
The Portuguese striker and Juventus were accused of raping an American woman, identified as Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Der Spiegel reported on Friday that the footballer paid her $375,000 to avoid talking about the incident.
Hours after the charges were posted, in a video broadcast on Instagram Live for his 142 million followers, 33-year-old Ronaldo said they were “fake news.”
“No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news,” the five-time Golden Balloon winner said in front of the video camera.
“They’re going to advertise using my name.
It's normal.
They want to become famous by using my name, but I'm used to it.
I’m a happy man and everything is fine,” the player added, smiling.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over these charges, which they called “an inadmissible report of some privacy-related suspicions,” according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz says the player will seek compensation for “moral damages equivalent to an amount appropriate to the seriousness of the crime, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years.”
The alleged incident took place in June 2009, in an apartment at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a club, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player's room, where he raped her anal, according to documents filed in Clark County District Court, Nevada.
Mayorga claims that after the incident, Ronaldo fell on his knees in front of her and told her that he is "a good boy" in a proportion of "99%", and that he was betrayed by that "one percent."
The document claims that Ronaldo confirmed that he had sex with the prosecutor, but that they were consensual.
Mayorga claims that she addressed the police and that the photographs of her injuries were taken at the hospital, but later accepted an agreement outside the courtroom because she was "terrified by the possibility of revenge" and was concerned that "she would be publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old woman is now seeking to cancel that agreement because she continues to be traumatized by the incident.
At the time of the attack, Ronaldo was about to move from Manchester United to Real Madrid. This summer, he was transferred to the Italian giant Juventus, after a deal worth 100 million euros.
Brexit: Britain 'will forever regret' the loss of automakers
Britain would “repent forever” if it lost its status as the world’s leading carmaker after Brexit, Secretary of State Greg Clark said.
He added that it is “worrisome” that Toyota UK told the BBC that if the UK leaves the EU without a deal, it will temporarily stop production at its Burnaston plant near Derby.
“We need an agreement,” Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of delays at the border in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
The Burnaston factory, where Toyota’s Auris and Avensis brands are manufactured, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“My opinion is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production will stop at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s executive director at Burnaston.
Other UK automakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, said they were afraid of leaving the EU without a cross-border trade deal.
BMW, for example, says that after Brexit, it will close the factory in Oxford where the Mini is produced for a month.
The main concerns are created by what manufacturers call the risks associated with the supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line operates on the “fix on time” principle: for custom-made cars, parts arrive at 37-minute intervals from suppliers in the UK and the EU.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there could be border problems, which industrial producers say could cause delays and a shortage of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to store more inventory for a day at its Derbyshire plant, the company says, so production would be stopped.
Clark said Theresa May’s Chequers plan for future EU relations was “precisely calibrated to avoid these border delays.”
“We want to have the best deal, which will allow us not only to enjoy the success of the present, but also to take advantage of this opportunity,” he told Today on BBC Radio 4.
“Evidence from not only Toyota but also from other manufacturers shows that we must continue to be able to use what was a very successful supply chain set.”
Toyota could not specify how long production would have to be stopped, but warned that the increased prices could reduce the factory’s competitive capacity over the long term and ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and is in charge of the United trade union at the factory, said the members are increasingly concerned: “The experience has taught me that after they disappear, these jobs don’t come back.”
A government spokesman said: “We have created a precise and credible plan for the future relationship with the EU.”
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, says White House
Donald Trump's high-level meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "delayed another week" as the fight for the Supreme Court-appointed Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees special adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates Russia’s interference in the election, the links between Trump’s and Russia’s aid and the potential obstruction of justice by the president.
Rumours about Trump’s possible dismissal of the deputy attorney general, thus jeopardizing Mueller’s independence, have been circulating in Washington circles for months.
Earlier this month, The New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the possibility of wearing a microphone to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of suspending the president through Amendment 25 to the U.S. Constitution.
Rosenstein denied this report.
But last month he went to the White House, and reports say he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was at the time at the United Nations headquarters in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he "would rather not" fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a conflict with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump called for a week-long FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh, which again delayed the vote in the Senate plenary.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “It has not yet been decided on a date in this regard. It may be this week or it may be postponed by a week, taking into account all the other things that are happening now in the Supreme Court.
But we’ll see and I always like to keep the press informed.”
Some reporters would dispute this claim: Sanders has not had a press briefing at the White House since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the reduction in the number of briefings was not caused by antipathy towards TV reporters, who like to go on the show, although he added: "I don't deny that they like to go on the show."
Then, he suggested that there would be increased direct contact between Trump and the press.
"The president attends more questions and answers than all previous presidents," she said, adding without mentioning any evidence: "We have analyzed the figures."
“There will be more briefings,” Sanders said, but “I think it’s much better for the press to have the opportunity to address questions directly to the President of the United States, not me.
We are trying to do this most of the time and you have noticed that we have done this many times in the last few weeks, and discussions with the President of the United States will replace press briefings when it is available.”
Usually, Trump answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he attends open sessions or press conferences with dignitaries visiting him.
The press conferences given exclusively by him are rare.
This week in New York, the president demonstrated why this is happening, having an improvised appearance, on bizarre occasions, in front of the assembled reporters.
A Secretary of State of the Ministry of Health addressed, in a letter, to EU employees of the National Health Service (NHS) in Scotland on Brexit-related concerns
The Secretary of State wrote to EU employees working at the NHS branch in Scotland to express their gratitude on behalf of the country and the desire that they remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, has sent the letter under conditions less than six months before the UK’s withdrawal from the European Union.
The Scottish government has already made a commitment to bear the costs of applications for permanent resident status for EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: “During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on the withdrawal have continued, awaiting decision-making this fall.
But the UK government has begun to prepare more and more for a different scenario, in which there would be no agreement to leave the EU.
I know this is a very stressful time for you.
For this reason, I would like to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of each employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues in the European Union, but also outside the European Union, have valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service and also bring benefits to the patients and the communities we serve.
You can consider Scotland your home and we want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after suffering a blow to the head
Tennessee State Tigers founder Christion Abercrombie underwent an emergency surgery after suffering a blow to the head on Saturday, in the match his team lost to Vanderbilt Commodores, with a score of 31-27, said Mike Organ.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the strike took place shortly before the break.
“He got to the shower line and just collapsed,” Reed said.
Abercrombie was put on his oxygen mask by physical trainers and medical staff on the shower line before putting him on a plate and carrying him off the field for a detailed assessment.
A Tennessee State representative told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had left the operation he was undergoing at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is no details yet on the type/size of the injury" and that Tennessee State is trying to figure out when it occurred.
Abercrombie, a student in year 2, is in his first season at Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
On Saturday, he managed to make a total of five payouts before leaving the match, reaching a total of 18 payouts throughout the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty on the purchase of a property in the UK.
Foreign buyers will pay a higher stamp duty on the purchase of a property in the UK, following the extra money being used to help homeless people, according to the Conservative Party’s new plans.
This change will neutralize Corbyn’s efforts to attract young people with voting rights
The stamp duty will be applied to persons who are not payers of taxes and taxes in the UK
The Treasury expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help homeless people
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty rate when buying a property in the UK, and additional money will be used to help homeless people, Theresa May is set to announce today.
The change will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s efforts to attract young people with the right to vote, promising more affordable homes and targeting high-income people.
The higher court fee will be applied to natural and legal persons who are not paying taxes and taxes in the UK, and the additional money thus obtained will be used to support the Government’s efforts to help homeless people.
The surcharge, which adds to the current stampede court fee, including the elevated levels two years ago for second property and properties purchased for rent, could reach a value of 3%.
The Treasury expects this change to add up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
About 13% of newly built properties in London are bought by non-residents in the UK, which leads to rising prices and puts those who want to buy their first home in difficulty.
Several thriving areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become “ghost cities” because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend much of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a cut in the stamp tax to help young people buy their first home.
He accused major construction firms of keeping property prices high as a result of the purchase of land but without using it, and asked Theresa May to waive taxes on affordable homes in order to solve the “house problem” in the UK.
Corbyn has announced a number of attractive real estate reforms, including rental controls and the cessation of unwarranted evacuations.
It also wants to give councils greater powers when it comes to building new houses.
Theresa May said: “Last year I said I would dedicate my term as prime minister to fulfilling the British dream, a better life for every new generation.
And that means fixing the existing problems in the real estate market.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is not fair for people who do not live in the UK, as well as companies based abroad, to be able to buy houses as easily as hard-working British residents.
For too many people, the dream of owning a house has become far too distant, and living in unworthy conditions is far too real.”
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to be the manager of Scotland's national team"
Jack Ross, the manager of the Sunderland football team, said that "his final goal" is to become, at some point, the manager of the Scotland national team.
The 42-year-old enjoys the challenge of “resurrecting” the northeastern club, which is currently in 3rd place in the Premier League, with a difference of three points from the first place.
He moved to the Light Stadium team this summer after last season's return to the St. Mirren football team in the first division of the Scottish Premiership.
“I wanted to be a member of the national football team, but as a player.
We got into the national B team and that's all," Ross told Sportsound.
“But I spent a lot of my childhood watching Scotland’s games at Hampden with my father and I always wanted to come back.
But I will only get this opportunity if I succeed as the manager of the club."
Ross' predecessors, as Sunderland's managers, include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former club manager Alloa Athletic said he has no emotions to be the successor to such sacred names and to such an important club after he declined offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“The only thing that worries me and that could affect my success is the question, ‘Can I help this team get back into the Premier League?’
There is no doubt that the structure and facilities available at this club allow him to be in the Premier League,” he said.
“It’s not easy to make her get there, but I think the only thing that would make me feel like a successful man is to contribute to the club’s return to the Premier League.”
Ross has only three years of leadership experience, after a period where he was assistant manager at Dumbarton and another 15 months spent as a member of the training staff at Hearts.
He then helped the Alloa club recover after relegating to Division C and managed to save St. Mirren from relegation, helping the team win the championship the following season.
Ross said he feels better now than in his entire playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
“It was a decisive moment,” he said about taking over the leadership of the Alloa club.
“I really thought I was more suited to the role of manager than the role of player.
It may sound strange, because I had a good time, I won well and I had a few successful moments.
But it's hard to be a player.
You have to do a lot of things and repeat them weekly.
I’m faced with similar situations as a manager, in terms of stress and pressure, but I feel it’s the right role for me.
I’ve always wanted to be a manager and now that I can do that, I feel like it’s the thing that suits me the best in my whole adult life.”
You can listen to the entire interview on Sunday, September 30, between 12:00 and 13:00 on the Sportsound broadcast by Radio Scotland.
The ideal time to drink a pint of beer is Saturday at 5:30 p.m., according to a survey
The heatwave this summer has led to an increase in revenues in pubs in the UK, but putting more pressure on restaurant chains.
According to figures, pubs and bars recorded a 2.7% increase in July, while restaurant revenues fell by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, CGA’s representative who provides business consulting services and conducted the survey, said: “The constant warmth and participation of England in the World Cup over a longer period than expected, the 8% in May contributed to a pattern in July, compared to the previous month.
The number of customers lower by 1.8% in the restaurant industry in June fell even more in July.
Pubs and bars serving only drinks have recorded a much higher profit than restaurants.
And the pubs that serve food have experienced heat losses, but not as big as those of restaurants.
It seems that people went out into the city just to have drinks.
Sales of beverages across all bars and pubs increased 6.6% this month, and food was down 3%.
Paul Newman, RSM’s spokesperson for the hospitality industry, said: “These results continue the trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
The weather conditions and the impact of large-scale sporting and social events remain among the most important factors contributing to the sales associated with the OOH advertising market.
It’s no wonder that restaurants continue to see losses, although a 4.8 percent year-on-year drop in sales will add to current cost pressures.
The long canicle summer could not come at a worse time for food industry operators and only time will decide whether the more moderate temperatures recorded in August will bring better news.”
Total sales of pubs and restaurants, including the newly opened ones, increased by 2.7% in July, reflecting the low number of newly launched locations.
The company that monitors the sales of pubs, bars and restaurants in the UK, Coffer Peach Tracker, collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined profit of over <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion, the official industry standard.
One in five children has a secret account on a social network that they hide from their parents.
According to a survey, one in five children, some up to the age of 11, has a secret account on a social network that they hide from parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in "false Insta" accounts.
Knowledge has heightened fears about posts with sexual content
20% of students say they have a "main" account that they show to their parents
One in five children, some up to the age of 11, create an account on a social network that they keep hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid rise in “false Insta” accounts, referring to the Instagram photo sharing platform.
Knowledge has heightened fears about posts with sexual content.
20% of students said they have a “main” and “clean” account that they show their parents, but that they also have other private accounts.
A mother, who accidentally discovered the secret account of her 13-year-old daughter, noticed the posting of a teenager asking to be "violent."
According to research conducted by the UK’s Digital Awareness company and the HMC (Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference) from independent schools, 40% of young people aged 11 to 18 have two profiles, and half of them have acknowledged that they hold secrets.
HMC director Mike Buchanan said: “It’s alarming that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces that parents and teachers don’t have access to.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the “voice of the athletes” in the Scottish Athletes Commission
Eilidh Doyle was elected as the non-executive director of the Scottish Athletics Commission at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most decorated field and track athlete in Scotland, and Ian Beattie, the president, has described the change as a great opportunity for those who make decisions about sporting activities to take advantage of the vast experience it has gained internationally in the past.
"Eilidh enjoys respect throughout the Scottish athletes community, the UK, and the world, and we are confident that Scottish athletes will have significant benefits with its inclusion in the committee," Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I’m excited to be able to represent the athletes and hope to make a real contribution and help with the way sporting activities take place in Scotland.”
The American national, who won the 200- and 400-metre rehearsals at the 1996 Atlanta Games in addition to the four gold medals won at the Olympics, is now a frequent commentator on the BBC, and has been invalidated after suffering a transient ischemic attack.
He tweeted: “A month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors told me that only time will decide whether I will recover or to what extent.
It was a titanic job, but I completely recovered, I learned to walk again, and today I do agility exercises!
Thank you for your encouragement messages!’
A breast pump ad that compares women to cows divides public opinion in the online environment
A breast pump company has caused a split in public opinion in the online environment with an ad comparing breastfeeding mothers to cow mulching.
To mark the launch of a pump that wants to be “the world’s first silent and portable breast pump,” consumer technology company Elvie released an ironic ad, inspired by a music video, to showcase the freedom the new pump offers breastfeeding mothers.
Four true mothers dance in a barn full of cowhide on a melody that includes verses such as: "Yes, I sneeze, but I don't have a tail" and "If you haven't noticed, they're not ungrateful, but my breasts."
The chorus continues: “I pump, pump, lactate babies, pump, pump, extract the milk from girls.”
However, the advertisement, published on the company’s Facebook page, sparked controversy in the online environment.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video was the target of mixed reactions from those who viewed it, many of them declaring that it exposes the “horror” of the dairy industry.
“It was a very bad decision to use cows to promote this product.
“Like us, they have to stay pregnant and be born to produce milk, except that their babies are stolen just a few days after birth,” one person wrote.

Another person commented: “It’s understandable how traumatic it is for both the mother and the child.
Of course, why not use them to promote a breast pump for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Someone else added, “A very inappropriate advertisement.”
Other people defended the advertisement, one person saying he thought it was a “hilarious” advertisement.
“I think it’s a brilliant idea.
I would have bought one if I were still breastfeeding.
The pumping really made me feel like a babysitter.
Advertising is a bit inappropriate, but I've taken it as such.
But the product is brilliant,” one person wrote.
Another person commented: “It’s a funny advertisement that targets mothers who use the pump (often at work or in the toilet) and who feel like “teachers.”
It is not an advertisement that praises or judges the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, the group of women reveals that they danced with discrete pumps inserted into bras.
The concept behind the campaign is that many women who use the breast pump say they feel like lice.
But the Elvie pump is completely silent, has no wires or tubes and fits discreetly in a breastfeeding bra, giving women freedom of movement, the ability to hold their children in their arms and even go out into the city while using the pump.
Ana Balarin, partner, consultant and developer in design at Mother, commented: “The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves such a bold and challenging launch.
By comparing breastfeeding mothers and milk cows, we wanted to highlight what it means to use a breast pump and the challenges in this regard, presenting, in a fun and real way, the incredible feeling of freedom that the new pump will give.
It's not the first time that the Elvie pump hits the front page.
During the presentation of fashion designer Marta Jakubowski at Fashion Week in London, the mother of two children appeared on the podium while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children have been transferred to a refugee camp on the Texas border.
The number of detained migrant children has increased, although the number of people who crossed the border each month has remained relatively the same, largely because the rhetoric and harsh policies introduced by the Trump administration have caused the process of placing children at sponsorships to be complicated.
Usually, many sponsors are themselves immigrants without documents and are afraid that they will endanger their stay in the country if they request to take children.
The risks increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors, as well as other adult family members, must register their fingerprints and that their data will be communicated to immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a high-ranking official of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, told Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who requested the sponsorship of unaccompanied minors.
Later, the agency confirmed that 70% of the arrested had no previous criminal record.
“About 80 percent of people who are sponsors or family members of the sponsors live illegally in the country, and most of them are foreign criminals.
Which means we will continue to look for those individuals,” Albence said.
To speed up the process of processing children in the system, the authorities have introduced new rules, according to which children must appear in court one month after detention, and not 60 days as the previous standard stipulated, according to shelter employees.
Many will plead for the case through a video call, and not personally before an immigration judge, to claim legal resident status.
Those who are not considered eligible will be deported immediately.
The longer children stay in custody, the more they can become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent reactions or attempts to escape, according to shelter workers and reports issued by the system in recent months.
Lawyers said these concerns are accentuated at a larger unit, such as Tornillo, where there is a possibility that signs indicating a child has problems are not observed, due to the size of the unit.
They added that transferring children to the refugee camp without giving them enough emotional preparation time or to take good-bye from friends could cause them trauma, which many of them already suffer.
Syria calls on U.S., French and Turkish forces to withdraw immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also asked Syrian refugees to return home, even though Syria has been at war for eight years.
Moualem, who is also the interim prime minister, said foreign military forces were illegally on Syrian territory under the pretext of combating terrorism and that “the situation will be properly managed.”
"These must be withdrawn immediately and unconditionally," he said in the assembly.
Moualem insisted that “the war on terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions have been de-rooted from their homes.
He also said Damascus will continue “this sacred battle until we remove terrorist groups and the illegal foreign presence from all Syrian territories.”
In Syria there are about 2,000 military forces in the United States, which are mainly engaged in training and advising Kurdish and Arab forces in Syria that oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
There are also more than 1,000 French military troops in the war-torn country.
Regarding the refugee issue, Moualem said there were favorable conditions for their return and accused “some Western countries” of “spreading irrational fears,” which caused refugees to keep their distance.
He added: “We have called for the support of the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate their return.”
“Political influences are brought into an issue that should be purely humanitarian.”
The United States and the European Union have issued warnings that they will not support reconstruction in Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition on ending the war.
U.N. diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the creation of a demilitarized zone in the Idlib region to expel the last group of rebels has created an opportunity to continue political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement helped to avoid a large-scale assault with the help of Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province where three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement has “clear-limited” terms and expressed hope that military action would target jihadist groups, including those on the Nusra front, which have links to the Al-Qaeda network and which “will be eradicated.”
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to meet soon in a first meeting of a new committee of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and prepare the ground for elections.
Moualem presented the conditions for the Syrian government’s participation in the committee, stating that the committee’s activities should be limited to “reviewing the articles of the current constitution” and issued a warning regarding interference.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Term
If we were to follow this logic, Trump would be re-elected in 2020, unless the dismissal procedure or scandals would end his term as president earlier, which a large part of the liberal audience hopes to happen.
In this case, it would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic end of a presidential term of all time!”
So far, it seems that the audience is still interested in the subject.
As of 2014, early-time audiences doubled on CNN, reaching 1.05 million and nearly tripled on MSNBC, reaching 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, in the first-time, Fox News is watched by an average of 2.4 million people, compared to four years ago when it was watched by 1.7 million, and the show "The Rachel Maddow Show" on MSNBC has a major audience record, with 3.5 million people watching it.
“This is a subject that attracts the public, because we can’t understand it,” said Neal Baer, the producer of ABC’s dramatic “Reserve President” series, about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after a catastrophic attack on the Capitol building.
Nell Scovell, a comedy writer with extensive experience in the field and the author of the book "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club" has another theory.
She recalls a taxi ride through Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told him he was going to vote for Trump.
Why? she asked.
“He said, ‘Because it makes me laugh,’” Scovell told me.
In chaos, entertainment is valued.
Of course, unlike anything else broadcast on TV, action in Washington could determine the future of the Roe versus Wade case, if immigrant families can be whole and about the state of the global economy.
Changing the position is a luxury that can only be afforded by the privileged public.
However, you are not just an informed citizen of the Washington Post when you arrive at the sixth hour of viewing the debate by a committee of experts on how Bob Woodward uses "deep background" (confidential) sources for his "confidential" description of his book, "Fear", about the "Fear" of the 1st-piece woolen jacket.
For example, I will never look at Super Mario again in the same way.
“A lot of what it does makes you feel like you’re watching a reality show and it feeds you with subjects every night,” said Brent Montgomery, executive director of the media group Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of the show “The Aces of the Manatee” and challenged Trump’s constant shifting distribution, smearing the smear of a situation.
Don’t let yourself miss an episode, because you’ll feel like you’re behind.
When I went to visit Mike Fleiss this week at his house on the northern shore of Kauai Island, it was 27 degrees outside and it was sunny, and he was standing inside looking at MSNBC and recording on CNN.
He could not slip out of front of the television, especially as Brett Kavanaugh was going to face the Senate's legal committee and was going to decide the Supreme Court's future.
“I remember doing some shows that came out of the ordinary in the past, and people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end for Western civilization,’” Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was a joke, but they seemed to be right.”

Overwhelming external financial resources for the tightest midterm elections associated with the House of Representatives
As a result of a redesign of the electoral districts, which resulted in two mandate holders running for the same office, it is not surprising that the 17th electoral district of the state of Pennsylvania enjoys overwhelming financial resources.
Thus, the new suburb of the Pittsburgh district brought in the Democratic representative Conor Lamb, who won, in another district, the special elections last spring.
Lamb is running against another running mate, Republican Keith Rothfus, who now represents Pennsylvania’s 12th constituency, which significantly overlaps with the 17th constituency.
The electoral maps were reconfigured after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutional, manipulating the boundaries of the districts in favor of Republicans.
The race in the new 17th constituency triggered a competition in funding campaigns between major party funding bodies, the Congressional Committee for the Democratic Campaign (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a close victory in a special, high-profile election that took place in March for Pennsylvania’s 18th electoral district.
For over a decade, the office was held by a Republican, and President Donald Trump won in this district by a difference of 20 points.
According to political commentators, Democrats enjoy an easy advantage.
The United States considered penalizing the state of El Salvador because of its agreement with China, but then resigned
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Trump had a welcoming meeting with the President of the Republic of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and held a hotel in Panama until the partners evacuated the Trump Organization leadership team.
State Department officials have decided to summon US heads of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama as a result of “recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan,” Heather Nauert, the department’s spokeswoman, said in a statement.
But sanctions were considered only against the state of El Salvador, which received US aid worth about $140 million in 2017, including for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts in financial aid and restrictions on visas, would have been painful for the Central American country and the high unemployment and crime rate.
As internal meetings have made progress, officials in North America and Central America have postponed a high-level conference focused on economic security and prosperity to continue a similar meeting last year, considered a step forward in efforts to prevent the right of migrants to the United States.
But by mid-September, administration officials had made it clear they wanted to continue the conference, effectively ending any review of sanctions on El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now scheduled to address the conference, scheduled for mid-October, wanting to highlight the importance the administration attaches to the meeting, diplomats said.
The three U.S. ambassadors returned peacefully to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without receiving new messages or harsh punishments from Washington.
A White House spokesman for John Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations only if they remain anonymous.
Their reports were co-ordinated by an external analyst, who is a close associate of the administration and who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
The Study of History
The next thing that could happen is Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on possible obstruction of justice by President Trump, about which there is now solid evidence made public.
Mueller also appears to be directing his investigation into the existence of a plot between the Trump campaign and Russia regarding the attack on the US election.
If Congress changes, Trump will face appropriate responsibilities within the body, even as he prepares to stand before the electorate and possibly a jury made up of his colleagues.
There are many possible situations and I don’t want to suggest that Trump’s “fall” is inevitable, as is the case for his European counterparts.
There are choices that we all have to make on one side of the Atlantic and that will determine the duration of the investigation.
In 1938, German officers were prepared to give a coup d'état against Hitler, only if the West had opposed him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We have failed and thus missed the opportunity to avoid the years of massacre that followed.
The course of history depends on such critical moments, and the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Americans are facing a few such critical moments right now.
What do we do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult position since it was reported in the newspaper that last year he had suggested the president's covert registration and speculated that he was incompatible with the president's role.
Rosenstein said the Times report was incorrect.
“How will we respond if the new investigation requested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or correct or if it is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we fail to pass these tests, democracy will have a long winter.
But I don't think we're going to fail, after the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy residence.
He survived, emigrated to America, and, 60 years later, sent me to light Sabbath candles on the table with swastika.
With such a legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?”

Rangers player Graham Dorrans is optimistic about his match with Rapid Vienna
On Thursday, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna, knowing that the victory in the match with the Austrians, after Spain’s impressive equaliser against Villarreal at the beginning of the month, will place it on a strong position to qualify for Group G of the European League.
A knee injury did not allow midfielder Graham Dorrans to play this season to a 2–2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use this result to his advantage to achieve better performance.
"It was a good point for us, given that Villarreal is a good team," the 31-year-old said.
"We started the game thinking we're going to get a good result and we won a point.
I probably could have signed up in the end, but overall, I think the equation was the right result.
I think they were better in the first half, and we did better in the second.
Thursday will once again be an important evening for Europe.
With a little luck we will get three points, but it will be a difficult match, because they had a good result in the last match played. However, with the support of the supporters, we will certainly feel more motivated and will have a positive result.
“Last year was clearly a difficult one, considering my injuries and changes at the club, but the situation is better at the moment.
The team is fine and the boys really like to be here; the workout goes well too.
Let’s hope that we will persevere, that we will leave behind what we’ve spent in the last season and that we will have good results.”
Women Are Insomnia Due to Retirement Savings
Despite the fact that the survey participants knew clearly how they wanted to be cared for, few people spoke to family members about it.
About half of the people who participated in the study by Nationwide said they were discussing the cost of long-term care with their spouse.
Only 10% of them said they had been talking to their children about the topic.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t initiate this conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance company Nationwide.
Here's how you can get started.
Discuss with your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to provide the care you need if you don’t make your wishes known in time.
Work with your counselor and family to discuss where and how you will receive care, as these choices could be a significant factor in determining costs.
Get involved with your financial advisor: and the financial advisor can be a real helper when it comes to paying for these expenses.
Your financing choices for long-term care can include a standard long-term insurance policy, a mixed cash life insurance policy, to help you cover these expenses, or you can insure your own well-being – as far as you have the money.
Put your legal documents in the right place: come face to face with problems of a legal nature.
Obtain a medical decision-making authority, to designate a trusted person to oversee your medical care and to ensure that professionals in the field respect your wishes where you cannot communicate them.
Also, consider carrying out an empowerment with respect to your financial resources.
Choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions on your behalf and who will ensure that your bills are paid, if you do not have the necessary capacity to do so.
Don’t forget the little details: imagine that an older parent of yours has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Could you answer questions about her medications and allergies?
Write down these details in a written plan to be prepared.
“And it’s not just about the financial side. Can you tell me who the doctors are dealing with it?” asked Martin.
“What are the medications?
Who will take care of their dog?
Make a plan for all of these things.”

Police officers described the incident, which took place at 2:30 a.m., as "accidental shootings".
The victim was unable to see the attacker.
The injuries did not endanger his life, and police called on witnesses to testify.
Earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died as a result of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to authorities, and the number of deaths is expected to increase.
Due to the disruption of communications networks, authorities dealing with disasters were unable to obtain any information from the Donggala kingdom, an area in the north of the city of Palu, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 degrees on the Richter scale.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster occurred.
Here are some key information about Palu and Donggala, from the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the provincial capital of central Sulawesi Island, located at the end of a narrow bay, on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with a population of about 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when it was hit by a tsunami and earthquake.
Donggaga is a regency that stretches on a coast with an area of more than 300 km in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
Regent, an administrative region located at the bottom of a province, has a population of approximately 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fish farming and farming activities represent the central point of the economy of the province in the center of the island of Sulawesi, especially the Donggala coastal region.
Mining activities for the extraction of nickel are also important in the province, but are concentrated mainly in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi Island.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times over the past 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
Also in 1996, a tsunami struck the western part of the Donggala regency, causing the deaths of nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Circle of Fire, an area with intense seismic activity.
Here are some of the earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred in recent years:
2004: On December 26, a powerful earthquake off the west coast of Indonesia's province of Aceh, north of Sumatra, triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries, causing the deaths of 226,000 people on the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them from Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra Island in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people have died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-degree earthquake on the Richter scale hit the south of Indonesia’s most populous island, Java, triggering a tsunami that hit the south coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-degree earthquake on the Richter scale took place near Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-degree earthquake on the Richter scale hit one of the Mentawai islands off the coast of Sumatra Island, triggering a tsunami up to 10 meters high that destroyed dozens of villages and killed around 300 people.
2016: A low-intensity earthquake occurred in the Pidie Jaya kingdom of Aceh, causing damage and panic as people recalled the devastating 2004 earthquake and tsunami, which resulted in a large number of deaths.
There was no tsunami this time, but more than 100 people were killed by the collapsed buildings.
2018: Several powerful earthquakes took place on the tourist island of Lombok, causing the deaths of more than 500 people, most of them in the northern part of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily trapped under debris.

Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, being involved in a domestic violence complaint and in opposition to arrest, according to a report published Saturday by police in the state of Alaska.
According to the police report, when an acquaintance of his female sex tried to call the police to claim the alleged crimes, he took his phone.
Palin is in police custody, at the Mat-Su unit, pending trial, and is being held on the basis of a $500 bail-free bail, according to KTUU.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he declared himself “100% innocent” when his plea was sought, according to the network.
Palin faces three Class A charges, which means he could be jailed for up to a year and fined $250,000.
He was also charged with a Class B offence, which is punishable by a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged.
In December 2017, he was charged with violence against his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to announce the alleged assault.
The case is pending in the Veterans Court in Alaska.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, engaging in a complaint of a domestic violence crime and possessing a gun while he was in a state of intoxication in connection with an incident.
According to his girlfriend's statement, he punched him in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticised by veteran groups in 2016 after her son’s violent behavior was associated with post-traumatic stress syndrome he suffered after he was part of the Iraqi military.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds dead
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-degree earthquake on the Richter scale triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electrical and telecommunications networks are damaged and the number of deaths is expected to increase in the coming days.
The quake occurred in the central province of Sulawesi, which is in the northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
On social networks there are videos that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people were at a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the shore.
Federal prosecutors want capital punishment for suspected terrorist attack in New York City
New York’s federal prosecutor wants the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terror attack that killed eight people, a rare punishment that was no longer applied in the state for a 1953 federal crime.
It appears that Saipov, 30, used a rented Home Depot truck to carry out an attack on a bike lane on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, hitting pedestrians and cyclists on his track in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" inflicted serious bodily injuries, according to the statement of intent on the request for capital punishment filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both sides of the indictment can receive a death sentence, according to the court document.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury charged Saipov with 22 charges that include eight counts of organized crime, usually used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, as well as a count of violence and vehicle destruction.
The attack required “substantial planning and premeditation,” prosecutors said, describing how Saipov executed the act as “hateful, cruel and depraved.”
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injuries, suffering and losses to the families and friends of the following people: Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian av Pagccou".
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the last trial of a capital punishment case in New York's Southern District.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was charged with the murder of two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last capital punishment applied in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, two husbands executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War, two years earlier.
Rosenberg's wives were executed on the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a Uzbek citizen, showed no regrets in the days and months following the attack.
He confessed to the investigators that he liked what he did, according to the police.
Saipov told authorities he felt inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the plaintiff.
Also, according to the police, he asked to raise the ISIS flag in the hospital room.
He pleaded not guilty in respect of the 22 heads of indictment.
David Patton, one of the defenders in the office who represented Saipov, said they were “obviously disappointed” by the prosecutor’s decision.
“We believe that the decision to impose capital punishment, instead of accepting a plea for guilt with life imprisonment, with no possibility of release, will only prolong the trauma associated with these events for all those involved,” Patton said.
Saipov's defense team has previously asked the prosecutor's office not to apply the death penalty.
A member of Parliament who is part of the Conservative Party argues that Nigel Farage must be at the forefront of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to “mobilize the civilian army” during a protest at the Conservative Party conference.
The former Ukip leader said politicians must “feel the pressure” from Eurosceptics, following the statement by a member of parliament Theresa May who suggested that he should be at the forefront of negotiations with the European Union.
Peter Bone, a member of the Conservative Party, said at a demonstration in Birmingham that the UK would have “exited” by now if Farage was Secretary in the Brexit campaign.
But the challenge May faces in terms of extremely divided camps has been accentuated by members of the Conservative Party who have joined another protest, against the European Union’s exit organized in the city.
The prime minister is working hard to ensure that his compromise plan, the so-called Chequers plan, proceeds properly, facing attacks on the part of those who support leaving the European Union, those who want to remain in it, as well as on the part of the European Union.
The Allies stressed that it will continue to try to conclude an agreement with Brussels, regardless of the consequences, and will force Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose between its offer and “chaos.”
Bone said at Solihull’s “Leave Means Leave” pro-Brexit event that he wants “to give up the Chequers plan.”
He suggested that Farage should be part of the team and be given the responsibility associated with the negotiations with Brussels.
“If things were led by him, I was no longer in the European Union,” he said.
The Conservative MP, the Wellingborough constituency's representative, added: "I will support Brexit, but we have to give up the Chequers plan."
Referring to his opposition to the European Union, he said: “We did not fight in world wars to be slaves.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Bone denied suggestions on changing public opinion at the 2016 vote: “It is not at all true that the British have changed their minds and that they want to remain in the Union.”
Andrea Jenkyns, a member of the Conservative Party that supports Brexit, was also at the demonstration and told reporters: “I just want to say this: Madam Prime Minister, listen to the voices of the people.
“The public does not agree with the Chequers plan, the opposition will not vote for it, our party does not agree with it, nor our activists who go out on the street and who support us, first of all, in elections.
Give up the Chequers plan and start listening."
In a message addressed to Theresa May, she added: “Prime Ministers who hold office are those who keep their promises.”
At the meeting, Nigel Farage said politicians should be put in a position to “feel the pressure” if they are about to give up the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
“It’s a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit and we’re here today to tell them we’re not going to let them do this.”
In a message to his enthusiastic thanks, he added: “I want you to help us put pressure on our political class, which is about to betray Brexit.
“We are mobilizing the civilian army of the country that brought us victory in Brexit and we will not give up until we become an independent, self-governing and proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, those who support staying in the European Union marched through Birmingham before a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A small group of activists raised banners that read “The Conservative Party is against Brexit” after the group launched this weekend.
Lord Adonis, a member of the Labour Party, laughed at the Conservative Party members and the security issues they faced in the party's application at the start of the conference.
“These are the people who tell us that they can implement IT systems and all the technology for Canada plus plus, for the digitization of customs procedures, for free and unrestricted trade in Ireland,” he added.
“It is a farce.
Brexit does not bring benefits,” he added.
Warren is planning to seriously consider running for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would seriously consider running for president after the November elections.
According to the Boston Globe, the Massachusetts Democratic Senator spoke on Saturday about her future during a mayoral meeting in the western state of Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Geoff Diehl, a member of the House of Representatives on the part of the Republican Party, who was co-chair of Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
She was at the center of speculation that she could defeat Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was the 36th meeting of voting citizens using the format of the mayor since Trump took over as president.
One participant asked her if she was going to run for president.
Warren responded that the time has come for “women to come to Washington to solve the problems of our severely affected government and this includes a woman in his lead.”
A suspect has been arrested in the case of the death that caused the death of the Sims player from the LSU team.
Police in Baton Rouge, Los Angeles, on Saturday announced they had arrested a suspect in the death that led to the death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at an ET press conference at 11:00 a.m.
They posted video footage of Friday's shooting, asking for help identifying the man in the pictures.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot and killed near the campus of Southern University on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head, causing his death," police chief Murphy J. Paul told 247sports on Saturday.
Wayde tried to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted that he was on the scene, that he was in possession of a weapon, but also that he shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and was taken into police custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
The Sims, a junior player with a height of 1.98 m, who grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games, being 10 times in the initial lot in the last season and playing, on average, 17.4 minutes, with 5.6 points and 2.9 recoveries per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton wins world title after his team helps him win in front of Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the orders given by the Mercedes team would play an essential role in the race.
Ranking first in the standings, Bottas had a good start and nearly defeated Hamilton, defending his position in the first two laps and inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to stop at the boxing and left Hamilton at the queue of the group, which should have been decisive.
The Mercedes stopped at the box one lap later and came behind Vettel, but Hamilton managed to advance after several schemes that forced the Ferrari driver to leave the interior free after making a double move to defend himself on the third lap.
Max Verstappen started the back row of the car and was in seventh place near the end of the first lap, even on the day he turned 21.
He then took the lead for much of the race, aiming for a quick finish and trying to overtake Kimi Raikkonen and take fourth place.
He eventually stopped at the boxing at the 44th round, but could not increase the pace in the last eight laps, with Raikkonen remaining in fourth place.
“It was a difficult day. Valtteri did an exceptional job all weekend and behaved like a real gentleman, letting me get ahead.
“And the team did an excellent job to get the victory over the Ferraris and to achieve this double,” Hamilton said.
Horrible body language.
President Donald Trump ironized Senator Dianne Feinstein on Saturday at a rally on her insistence that she did not facilitate the “leaking” of Christine Blasey Ford’s letter, which accused the Supreme Court-appointed Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford’s testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee, commenting instead that what is happening in the Senate showed that people are “living, immoral, and lying.”
“The only thing that could happen is the beautiful thing that happens in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and evil and immoral and lying,” he said.
“When you see that they published and leaked information and then they say they didn’t.
They're not the ones responsible.
Do you remember?
When did I ask Dianne Feinstein if she facilitated the document's leak?
Do you remember her answer? She said: umm..poftim?
Aaaa...no.
I didn't do that."
Well, wait a minute.
Did we do that?...No, we didn't," he added, imitating the senators.
Feinstein was sent a letter detailing Ford's charges against Kavanaugh in July and was "slide" in September, but Feinstein denied that the "sleeping" had occurred from her office.
“I have not concealed the accusations regarding Ford, and I am not the one who facilitated the “leaking” of her account,” Feinstein told the commission.
“He asked me to keep it confidential and that’s exactly what I did.”
But her denial does not seem to have fallen well on the president, who commented during Saturday's meeting: "To be honest, it was a terrible body language.
Maybe she didn’t, but it was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing to defend the candidate for the Supreme Court, who was accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that Democrats use the accusations to achieve their own goals.
“They are determined to take power in every possible way.
“Observe evil, immorality, it doesn’t matter who they hurt and who they have to destroy to gain power and control,” the president said.
Elite League: The Stars of Dundee win 5-3 against the Giants of Belfast
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars paid for the Friday loss in the Elite League, winning against the Belfast Giants in Saturday's return game, with a score of 5-3 in Dundee.
The Giants had a two-goal lead, with the hits being executed by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie equalled the score before Dwyer brought the Giants back to the opposing team.
Francois Bouchard equalized the score for Dundee before two goals scored by Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured their victory.
It was Adam Keefe's third defeat in the Elite League this season for players who had regained ground by beating the Dundee team 2-1 on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, with the Giants winning the last three games.
Dwyer's opening performance kicked off in the fourth minute, respectively 3:35, from a pass by Kendall McFaull, then David Rutherford passed decisively to Beauvillier who doubled the team's lead four minutes later.
In a game that started so dynamic, Sullivan returned the host team to the game in the 13:10 minute, before Matt Marquardt offered Cownie the opportunity to score for an equal score in the 15:16 minute.
Dwyer secured the Giants' advantage before the first break, when he scored his second goal at the end of the first replay.
The host team regrouped and Bouchard again equaled an impressive goal in the 27:37 minute.
Later, in the second replay, Cownie and Charles Corcoran helped Nielsen gain an advantage for Dundee for the first time in that match, thus ensuring the team's climb to fifth place in the standings, in the middle of the last replay.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will host the Milton Keynes on Friday in their next game.
Air traffic controller dies after taking off a plane with hundreds of passengers during an earthquake.
An Indonesian air traffic controller is considered a hero, dying after safely taking off a plane with hundreds of passengers.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a powerful earthquake rocked the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Several powerful replicas have taken place in the area and many people are trapped under the remains of the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues fled to save his life, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the control tower of the Sis Al Jufri Mutiara airport in Palu, which was shaking heavily.
It remained in place to ensure that Batik Air’s flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, would take off safely.
Then he jumped out of the air control tower when he noticed that he was about to crash.
He later died in the hospital.
A spokesperson for Indonesia’s air navigation service provider said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, according to ABC News Australia.
I've prepared a helicopter to transport him from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he passed away this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
“We are saddened by this news,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the number of deaths could reach thousands, with the national disaster management agency declaring that access is limited in the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
“We believe the number will increase because many victims are still under ruins and we haven’t had access to many of them,” the agency’s spokesman, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, said in a statement.
Waves up to six meters high have devastated the city of Palu, with a joint funeral to be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring aid and supplies.
Laughter Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute an ambulance brings victims.
It is almost impossible to find drinking water.
All mini-markets are looted."
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Red Cross in Indonesia is in a hurry to provide assistance to the survivors, but we don’t know what they will find on the spot.
It’s already a tragedy, but it could get worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the national army: “Please work day and night to complete all the evacuation operations.
Are you ready?” he told CNN.
Indonesia was rocked earlier this year by an earthquake in Lombok, which killed more than 550 people.
Air Niugini says a person is missing after a plane crashed in a lagoon in Micronesia
The airline that owned the plane that crashed into a lagoon in the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia now declares that one person is missing, having previously stated that all 47 passengers and crew have been safely evacuated from the plane that sank.
Air Niugini said in a press release that a male passenger has been missing since Saturday afternoon.
He also said he was trying to find the man, along with local authorities, hospitals and investigators.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for additional details about the passenger, such as age or nationality.
Local boats were used to recover the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at the airport on Chuuk Island.
On Friday, authorities said seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained at the hospital on Saturday and that they were all in stable condition.
It is not yet known what caused the accident and the exact order of events.
The airline and the U.S. Naval Forces said the plane had missed the runway and reached a lagoon next to it.
Some witnesses believe the plane has crossed the end of the runway.
U.S. nationality passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane had reached a very small distance from the ground.
“It’s a very good thing,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes also said that he and other passengers managed to cross the water, which had reached the rim, and to reach the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He also said that the flight attendants panicked and yelled and that he suffered a minor head wound.
U.S. naval forces said sailors working nearby to renovate a landing gear jumped in aid, using an inflatable boat to transport people on board before the plane sank 30 meters underwater.
According to data from the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in accidents of some airlines registered in the PNG over the past two decades, but none of them included an Air Niugini aircraft.
Analyst presents the chronology of the night a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecutor’s office ended its plea deal regarding the resumption of the trial for a man accused of burning a woman in Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for several hours as an expert in information analysis.
He presented to the jury how he used the recordings on his mobile phone to topple the actions of 29-year-old Quinton Tellis as well as those of his victim, 19-year-old Jessica Chambers, on the night she died.
Rowlett said she received location data from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers the night she was killed, contradicting her earlier claims, according to the Clarion Ledger newspaper.
The moment the data revealed that his cell phone was with Chambers when he said he was with his friend, Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford was called to the witness box and confessed that he was not in the city that day.
When prosecutors asked Tellis if he told the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he " lied because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis stated that she knew Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Recordings on mobile phones indicate that they had known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that shortly after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' text messages, calls and contact details from his phone.
“He deleted it from his life,” Hale said.
According to the schedule, the defense will begin its final plea on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the jury to decide at the end of that day.
The High Breed: What Is Conscious Hip-Hop?
A trio that sings hip-hop music wants to change the negative way this kind of music is seen with the help of songs with positive messages.
The Bristol-based band The High Breed argues that hip-hop has ceased to convey political messages and address social issues, as it originally did.
They want to go back to their origins and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
A recent revival of artists such as The Fugies and Common in the UK has been observed through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another person of color?!
A New York nanny sues a couple for firing her after she received a “racist” text message.
A New York nanny sues a couple for dismissal for discriminatory reasons after she accidentally received a text message from her mother complaining that she was “another person of color.”
The couple denied that they were racists, claiming that she sued them for “extortion.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed her dissatisfaction when she learned that the new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, was of color when she showed up on her first day of work in 2016.
“Nuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Maurice twice.
After realizing the blunder, feeling embarrassed, Plasco-Flaxman fired Maurice, stating that the nanny, who is African-American, did not fulfill her duties properly and that the Post-Yorkian had expected to receive a proper nanny.
Maurice was paid for her work day and sent home with Uber.
Now, she sues the couple for compensation for her dismissal and demands the amount of $350 a day for six months, the period during which she had to live with them and carry out her activity, despite the fact that this was done without a contract concluded.
“I want to show them that such things are not done,” she told the Post on Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple denied claims that they were racist, saying it was normal to fire Maurice because they feared they could no longer trust her after they insulted her.
“My wife sent him a wrong message.
He is not a racist person.
We are not racists,” her husband, Joel Plasco, told the Post.
“But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you’ve wronged, even if by mistake?
The newborn baby?
Let's be serious."
Considering the process an action of "extortion", Plasco said that his wife will be born in two months and that she is in a "very difficult situation".
“Do you really want to take revenge on a person in such circumstances?
This is not the case,” added the banker.
While the trial is underway, public opinion has accused the couple on social media, judging them for the behavior and logic they have demonstrated.
The editors of Paddington's story feared that readers would not be able to identify with a talking bear, according to a new letter
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after accepting the book, said of the letter: “It’s hard to put yourself in the skin of a person who reads it for the first time before it’s published.
It's very funny now, after we've seen that Paddington has had a huge success."
She also said her father, who was a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired by a toy bear to write the children's book, would have been optimistic about the rejection of his work, adding that the anniversary of his death on the occasion of the 60th anniversary of the book's publication.
About Paddington, whom she describes as “a very important member of our family,” she added that her father had a discrete pride in the success he later enjoyed.
“He was a pretty quiet man and he didn’t like to brag,” she said.
“But because Paddington was so real to him, it was like having a child who had a success: you’re proud of him, even though it’s not your success.
I think that's how he saw Paddington's success.
Although it was his creation, based on his imagination, he always used to give his credit to Paddington."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone
Upon landing, her daughter was quickly transported to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
“Nad called me often to tell me that it’s very serious and that he doesn’t think he’ll survive,” Ednan-Laperouse said.
“Then I got a call from Nad telling me she’s going to die in the next two minutes and I have to say goodbye to her.
And that's exactly what I did.
I said, "Tashi, my dear, I love you very much.
We'll be together soon.
I'll join you.
The effect of medications taken by doctors to keep her heart pumping blood began to decrease and leave her body.
He died a short time ago and the organs began to stop working.
I had to sit there and wait, conscious of everything that was going on.
I couldn’t scream or scream because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to control myself.”
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, in mourning after his daughter's death, boarded the plane, along with other passengers, who did not know what was going on.
“No one knew,” she said.
“I kept my head down and the tears didn’t stop flowing.
It’s hard to explain, but during the flight I had an overwhelming sense of sympathy for Nad.
I realized that he needed love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Previous articleTwo Angry Women Place Miscellaneous Messages on a Bridge to Prevent Suicides
Two women who have lost their loved ones because they committed suicide are trying to prevent other people from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys place various messages on a bridge in Wales, many of which are motivational and include phone numbers that people can call to get support.
Sharon Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 years old when he began suffering from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel the way I feel every day,” she said.
Davis, 45, lives in Lydney and says his son was going to be a promising chef with a smiling smile.
“Everybody appreciates his smile.
They always said that his smile would change your mood.”
However, he gave up his job before dying, because he had arrived at a very unhappy time in his life.
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother after taking his life.
Davis said, “I still think you’re going to have a domino effect.”
It created the messages “to convey to people that they can call someone or that they can talk to someone, even a friend.
Exteriorize yourself, you need to talk to someone."
Kelly Humphreys, Davies's longtime friend, has lost Mark, the life partner she had at age 15, shortly after his mother's death.
“She didn’t tell me she wasn’t feeling well or that she was depressed,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, I noticed that he changed his attitude.
He was in a deplorable state on Christmas Day, when the kids unpacked their presents and he didn’t even look them in the eye.”
She said his death was a huge trauma for them, but she must overcome it: “He caused a huge pain within the family.
We're devastated.
But we have to move on and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake as a result of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's investigation.
“I thought that if we could get something similar to what he was asking for — a limited-time, small-scale investigation — we could have little unity,” Jeff Flake said Saturday, adding that he feared the commission was about to “disintegrate,” against the backdrop of a blockade party.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their reluctance is entirely due to the temporal factor.
There are only five weeks left until the November 6 election – if, as expected, Republicans have poor results, their attempts to place the one they want as a winner in the election for the country’s highest court will be significantly weakened.
George W. Bush called on senators to convince them to support Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Bush and through whom he met his wife, Ashley, Bush’s personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI finalizes the report?
A vote will take place in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Kavanaugh can reach at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to make the difference in the case of equality and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
The number of refugees in North Korea is falling under Kim’s leadership.
The number of North Korean refugees in South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from South Korea’s unification ministry, said that last year about 1,127 people fled the country, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park said the key factors were tighter border controls between North Korea and China and higher tariffs levied by those who illegally transport people across the border.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
A vast majority of refugees from the north are eventually granted South Korean citizenship, according to the report.
Seoul officials say more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily demilitarized protected zone (DMZ) between the two sides of Korea.
China considers refugees to be illegal migrants rather than refugees, and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still practically at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for some discussions on the topic of denuclearisation negotiations.
This came after the historic meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed, in general terms, to work together for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused that U.S. sanctions have caused a lack of progress since.
“If we can’t trust the United States, we won’t be able to trust our national security, and in such situations, under no circumstances will we be the first to disarm unilaterally,” Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi describes Brett Kavanaugh as "hysterical", declaring he is incapable of serving in the Supreme Court
Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic minority leader in the House of Representatives, described Brett Kavanaugh, nominated to the Supreme Court as "hysterical" and said his temperament was inappropriate for the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comments Saturday in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I can’t help but think that if she was a woman in this situation, she would have been declared “hysterical,” Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, which took place on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied allegations that he sexually harassed Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very excited, sometimes almost yelled and lost his voice due to emotions, while discussing his family and high school years.
He also explicitly denounced the Democrats on the committee, calling the accusations against “a grotesque and coordinated murder of character” organized by furious liberals that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said he felt that Kavanaugh's testimony had shown that he could not serve in the Supreme Court because he had shown that he was biased against the Democrats.
“I think he disqualifies with those statements and the way he attacked the Clinton family and the Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi deviated from the subject when asked if she would try to suspend Kavanaugh if he would be confirmed and if Democrats would win a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I just want to say this: if he doesn’t tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then it’s not appropriate, not just for the Supreme Court, but also for the court he’s in right now,” Pelosi said.
Currently, Kavanaugh is a judge in the District of Columbia Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she is concerned about Kavanaugh’s possible decisions against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe versus Wade case, as he is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh ignored the question of whether he would overturn certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“It’s not the right time for a hysterical, biased person to go to court and wait for us to say, ‘Oh, how wonderful!’” Pelosi said.
And women need to be able to handle it.
It’s a justified diatribe, months and years of accumulated anger and can’t speak without bursting into tears.
“We cry when we get angry,” said Gloria Steinem 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do I?"
She continued, “I received significant help from a woman in an executive role who told me that she was also crying when she was nervous, but that she developed a technique that, when she got angry and started to cry for me, she said to the person she was going to be with.
I'm nervous."
And then it goes on.
I thought it was a great thing."
Tears are allowed for the externalization of anger, partly because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of the clearest memories of one of my first jobs, in a male-dominated office, where I started to cry because of an inexpressible robbery, is that I was caught in the head by an older woman, a cold director, and the one I've always been afraid of.
“She should never see you crying,” she told me.
“I don’t know if you’re angry.
I think you're sad and they'll be glad they provoked that feeling."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democrat in the Colorado State Congress, worked with Gary Hart in the presidential election.
In 1987, when Hart was caught having an extramarital relationship on a boat called Monkey Business and withdrew from the race, extremely frustrated Schroeder thought he had no reason not to run for president.
“It wasn’t a very well-thought-out decision,” she says laughing, 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another one.
Someone referred to the situation as “White as Snow and the Seven Dwarfs”.
Because the campaign was at the end, she was behind fundraising and vowed not to enter the race if she failed to raise $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She found out that some of her supporters who were giving the men $1,000, they were giving her only $250.
“Do they think I’m getting discounts?” she asked.
During the speech in which she announced that she would not officially launch a company, she was so affected by emotions – as a result of the gratitude for the people who supported her, the frustration provoked by the system and the fact that it was so difficult for her to raise money and discriminate against her peers and target voters instead of delegates.
“You would have said I had a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder recalls the media’s reactions to it.
“You would have said that one of my sponsors is Kleenex.”
I remember thinking about what they'd write on my gravestone.
“Did she cry?”
How could the trade war between the United States and China be beneficial to Beijing?
The salvos that announced the start of the trade war between the United States and China have been overwhelming and, while there seems to be a long way to go before it ends, the disputes between the two countries could be beneficial for Beijing in the long run, experts say.
US President Donald Trump issued the first warning earlier this year by imposing tariffs on key imports from China, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most important escalation occurred this week with new taxes, which affected products worth $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), effectively applying taxes on half of all goods in China that arrive on U.S. territory.
Beijing has taken revenge each time, most recently imposing a tariff of between 5 and 10 percent on US products worth $60 billion.
China has warned it will respond to every blow from the United States and it is unlikely that the world’s second-largest economy will take a step back in the near future.
For Washington to withdraw, China must agree to its demands, but publicly ceding to the United States would be far too humiliating for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards well, U.S. pressures on the trade war could positively support China in the long run, reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision made in Washington or Beijing could lead to an economic collapse in both countries would actually be more dangerous than what has been predicted so far,” said Abigail Grace, an associate researcher who focuses on Asia at the New American Security Center.
Syria Is Ready for Refugees to Return, Foreign Minister Says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help to rebuild the country devastated by a war that has lasted more than seven years.
During his speech at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the situation in the country is improving.
"Today, the conditions on the ground are more stable and safe, thanks to the progress made in combating terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists so that things return to normal.
The existing conditions allow the voluntary return of refugees to the country they have been forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and lives.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war broke out in 2011.
Six million people who continue to live in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would be happy to receive aid to rebuild the devastated country.
But he stressed that conditional assistance or assistance from some countries sponsored by the insurgency will not be accepted.
European team wins Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup after defeating the American team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National in the outskirts of Paris, France.
The United States has now recorded its sixth consecutive defeat in Europe and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe came back in first place after the team led by Danish captain Thomas Bjorn scored 14.5 points, needed to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who made incredible strides for most of the tournament, sent the ball from the initial hit in the water to hair 3 from hole 16, handing the game to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has had an incredible performance in all seasons, becoming one of the four players with a 5-0-0 result since the current format of the tournament, since 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth lost in the 5th and 4th holes to the player in the last place in the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
World No. 1 player Dustin Johnson lost to England's Ian Poulter in the 2nd and 1st holes, probably his last game in the Ryder Cup.
A Ryder Cup veteran who participated in eight editions, Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the player in Europe with the most wins, scoring an average of 25.5 points throughout his career.
“I’m not used to crying, but today I can’t refrain.
It's been a tough year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and for believing in me.
I’m very happy that I was able to win the cup again.
It’s teamwork and I’m glad we could have been of help,” Garcia said, excited about the European victory.
He gives the relay to his landlord, John Ram, who defeated Tiger Woods, an American golf legend, at holes 2 and 1, at the individual game on Sunday.
“I’m very proud to have beaten Tiger Woods. I used to watch his matches when I was a kid,” said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now holds a 13-21-3 record in the Ryder Cup.
A strange statistic for one of the best players of all time, who won 14 important titles, being surpassed only by Jack Nicklaus.
Throughout the weekend, the American team made a real effort on the golf course, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played extraordinaryly throughout the tour.
U.S. team captain Jim Furyk said after a disappointing performance of his team: “I’m proud of them, they’ve really worked hard.
This morning, there were a few moments when I put pressure on the European team.
I've had a crunch fight.
Take off the hat for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played very well.
We'll regroup. I'll work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we'll move on.
I love these 12 boys and I am proud to be their captain.
We must give them due respect.
They played better than us.”
