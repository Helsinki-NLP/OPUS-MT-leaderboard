Barack Obama will be the fourth President of the United States to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
U.S. President Barack Obama will arrive in Oslo, Norway to spend 26 hours and receive the Nobel Peace Prize, as the fourth U.S. president in history.
The diploma, medal and check of $1.4 million will be received, among other things, for the exceptional effort in strengthening world diplomacy and cooperation among nations.
The White House chief and his wife Michelle will arrive in the Norwegian metropolis in the morning and have a lot to do.
First, a visit to the Nobel Institute, where he will meet for the first time with the five members of the committee that, in October, elected him out of 172 people and 33 organizations.
The couple then planned a meeting with Norway's king, Harald V, and Queen Sonia.
In the afternoon, the visit will culminate with a ceremony in which Obama will receive the prestigious award.
It will be the fourth U.S. president to receive it, though the third to receive it in his office.
The White House has already announced that, upon receiving the award, it will talk about the Afghan war.
The President does not want to avoid this issue, knowing that he is receiving the prize as president of a country that is currently at war in two countries.
His war effort increased even more with the sending of additional troops to Afghanistan, which does not forget to mention any of his critics.
At the ceremony, Obama will also receive the gold medal, diploma and check of ten million Swedish crowns (approximately 24 million Czech crowns).
It is proposed to donate them to charity, but it has not yet decided which particular organization.
During his full programme, the President and his wife will participate in a banquet attended by the Norwegian Kings, the Prime Minister and 250 other guests.
Obama had a rather reserved attitude toward the award from the outset.
He mentioned, for example, having the feeling that he did not deserve it at all.
He also repeated several times that the prize is not only for him, but for all who fight for the same values as him.
Immediately after the announcement, he mentioned that it represents “a challenge to take action.”
Nature Defendant Accused of Blackmail
The Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice Police accused the president of the Civic Association of Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice (Sociedad de defenders de la natura Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice) of blackmail.
Last year he appealed several times against some construction licensing procedures and to withdraw the appeals demanded investors money for their own benefit, said Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice police spokeswoman Alena Romov<0xC3><0xA1>.
The president of the Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice Nature Defenders Society is Lubom<0xC3><0xAD>r Studni<0xC4><0x8D>ka.
He is currently in custody and faces a sentence of up to three years in prison.
Brno doesn’t like containers too much to separate garbage
In Prague, citizens can separate the packaging of beverages and in the villages of southern Moravia can be found containers for separating garbage everywhere.
What about Brno?
It takes several minutes to find the respective containers.
I do not want to say that in Brno there is no separation of garbage.
It seems to me that, to be the second largest city in the Republic, the town halls are not interested enough in this problem.
Brno is totally lagging behind in the separation of waste, not only because we citizens can only use containers to separate paper, glass and plastic, but above all because of the number of containers for such waste.
Have you ever tried, for example, to throw in the center a PET bottle to the right container?
It is almost impossible, especially requires a lot of time and patience.
The only place I have found so far is in the square Moravské n<0xC3><0xA1>m<0xC4><0x9B>st<0xC3><0xAD>, opposite the Potrefen<0xC3><0xA1> Huse.
Let Mr. Onderka and his comrades not be angry with me, but that seems too little to me.
Needless to say, it is not easy to separate garbage elsewhere.
That's why many of my friends prefer not to separate her.
by vacancies
What happens is that the containers are far away.
I'm not surprised.
I myself offered, after a party, to throw in the trash several bottles of glass and plastic.
But on Kaunicova Street I didn't see any red containers nearby.
Luckily, going to the tram I found the right place.
However, the garbage was already overflowing from the container.
It’s still the center of Brno, the most representative part of the city, isn’t it?!
What happens is that ecology and aesthetics do not seem to interest the socialists of Brno too much.
They prefer to buy the city the extra league of hockey, which shames us all over the republic, and not buy more containers or offer the separation of other materials to make Brno cleaner.
I am happy to be able to compare my hypothesis, after browsing the Internet a little, with the official statistics.
According to the EKO-KOM society, Brno is truly the worst in the entire region of Jihomoravsk<0xC3><0xBD> kraj.
The budget of "Paroubek" removed money from income and sickness benefits
After the left, despite the government’s opinion, adds funds for farmers or officials, there may not be enough money in the budget for incomes, sickness subsidies or construction savings.
But neither for the interests of the state debt or international disputes.
This will hurt all those who rule in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the social democrats and communists imposed the increase for some groups, they were confident that the government would subsequently ask for a loan for sensitive expenses, incomes, or sickness subsidies. “That only means delaying the problems for the future, it’s placing mines,” says Janota.
What happens is that when you borrow money, you have to pay higher and higher interest rates and, one day, you have to return the money.
The state doesn’t have many options for getting money.
If it does not reduce the state’s social subsidies or operating expenses, it has to increase taxes.
To all that the left has added now: firefighters, teachers, farmers.
And later on, their children too.
People don't have to worry about income or sickness benefits, they're going to get them.
But the price to pay will be the increase in public debt; next year there will not be just 163 billion in the treasury, but more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, the debt will continue to rise alongside interest expenses.
The state will need money to cover them and will no longer come up with a slight increase in VAT or a reduction in maternity allowances, as the government did in its deficit package.
Due to the dislocation of money for the benefit of some groups of voters, next year will also need five billion to complete the construction of highways and railways.
These are, above all, the sectors in which the bidding has already taken place and where the construction process has already begun, whose projects cannot be changed and their price cannot be reduced.
The most you can do is keep them, which is also not free.
That means delay or cessation of the 30 major constructions; the possibility of obtaining European funds is also in jeopardy, says Transport Ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka.
<0xC4><0x8C>SSD proposed a salomonic solution for the reduction of funds: it will get money from the dividends of <0xC4><0x8C>EZ, which is mostly owned by the state, and will add the transport fund.
The problem is that the value of the dividend is never safe nor is it a bottomless bag.
Last year, <0xC4><0x8C>EZ allocated 18 billion to the budget.
Each year the dividends are settled ecological damages, serve to complete the account for the rents or serve as a reserve for the prepared reform of the rents.
Moreover, with this trick, according to EU rules, the real budget deficit increases to the level of 5.7% of GDP.
The carnival of money transfers does not end here.
Nearly three billion were obtained from the budget to grant various compensations to victims of communism and crimes, or for costs of litigation, even in construction savings.
It is unclear whether the state will need such funds.
It's a lottery.
If we lose some international litigation, we may have to pay for it, says Janota.
After that, the Minister will have to save money within the spring or, in the worst case, hand over the government budget reserve.
A hundred million are already missing for the St<0xC3><0xA1>tn<0xC3><0xAD> pokladna (State Fund) project, which is worth two billion and has already been started. It should allow online monitoring of what the various authorities are spending on.
The first stage begins in January.
If the finance minister does not find the money elsewhere, the project will have to stop and sanctions will come, Janota warns.
Your future smartphone will be able to work with two operating systems
Americans will have a mobile phone in which the user can, by pressing a key, switch between several operating systems.
The revealed plans sound promising.
With just one tap, they move in a few seconds from Windows Mobile to Android.
This possibility is the goal of the American company VMware, which focuses mainly on the development of virtualization software for computers.
On your mobile you can carry two user profiles at the same time.
They can switch between them and divide them between home and work.
The two operate at the same time, Srinivas Krishnamurti of VMware said in an interview with Computerworld magazine.
It was introduced in November last year and several days ago it was demonstrated for the first time.
It will be launched in 2012.
The virtualization of smartphones is no longer a fiction.
VMware has already successfully demonstrated to journalists how the smartphone works with two operating systems.
It was the Nokia N800, modified with 128 MB of RAM, where the aforementioned systems, Windows Mobile and Android, work at the same time.
The development of new mobile phone technology is at its peak.
VMware is cooperating with European and U.S. operators to test virtualization of smartphones and these phones will reach customers during the year 2012.
The lack of snow in the mountains worries hoteliers
Not only the skiers in Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e are concerned about the snow-free slopes.
The lack of snow prevents people from booking ski stays in hotels and guesthouses.
Therefore, in Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e you can still get free rooms for all winter dates, including New Year's Eve and New Year's Eve.
We have a lot of visitors on our pages.
People look at deals, check prices, but are still afraid to book with commitment.
And if they call us, they immediately ask about our opinion, whether these Christmases there will be snow or mud," said Martin Jandura, the maintainer of the information portal Spindl.Info.
Those who want to spend in <0xC5><0xA0>pindler<0xC5><0xAF>v Ml<0xC3><0xBD>n a New Year's Eve according to their expectations, should not hesitate to book the stay.
Those who prefer to save money and put the quality of accommodation in second place, can try to wait a few more days.
A city welcoming to all, <0xC5><0xA0>pindler<0xC5><0xAF>v Ml<0xC3><0xBD>n has a variety of hotels and other lodging options.
I think they will continue to offer them, but soon they will give in and offer shorter stays.
And then the free rooms will sell quickly, Jandura estimated.
Ingotours, a Vrchlab<0xC3><0xAD> travel agency, continues to offer free beds for all winter dates.
Now what interests us most is the Christmas week, which is not yet complete.
Half of the places offered are still free.
That’s why we’ve already prepared some last-minute holiday stays,” said Ingtours director Petr Schiefert.
The Vrchlab<0xC3><0xAD> travel agency can still offer New Year’s Eve in Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e, but there are fewer seats available.
They sell very well also the first fourteen days of February, the remaining winter dates are sold regularly.
This year's interest in winter stays is hampered by the lack of snow in Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e.
People are waiting to see if there will be snow.
No one wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
If the slopes remain snowy during the week, the Christmas dates will run out as well,” Schiefert says.
On the contrary, it is a little easier to occupy the rooms at the Horizont hotel in Pec pod Sn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE>kou; last year was more difficult.
We are about five percent better.
For New Year's Eve and Christmas, we have the last free seats.
Interest increases during the Polish holidays in January and February is also sold well," said Karel Rada, director of the best hotel in Pec.
Eighty percent of New Year’s Eve stays are already occupied also in the Omnia hotel, near the central parking lot in Janské L<0xC3><0xA1>zn<0xC4><0x9B>.
On the contrary, in the newest hotel in Janské L<0xC3><0xA1>zn<0xC4><0x9B> at Christmas half of the beds are still free.
This January was a big surprise for us, as we are about sixty percent of the occupancy capacity.
February has been a little weaker, but as soon as snow falls, interest in staying in Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e will surely increase, said Erik Sporysch, the director of the Omnia hotel.
However, for the moment it seems that the hoteliers of Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e will have the snow cravings waiting.
On Thursday temperatures should fall and, if there is rainfall, in the mountains should snow.
But then temperatures will rise again, said Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Jakubsk<0xC3><0xBD> of Hradec Kr<0xC3><0xA1>lové, of the Hydrometeorological Institute of the Czech Republic.
U.S.: Repetition is the mother of wisdom
It is comical that Barack Obama, the president with the reputation of the smartest man, as a diligent student repeats in the Afghan question the strategy of his predecessor, whom he himself considered the most foolish.
When he finally revealed his eagerly awaited Afghan approach, it proved to be a copy of the script used for Iraq by Bush, created three years ago.
Not only is the same text used several times as in Iraq, but it also did not hesitate to use the title of Bush’s January 2007 statement for its own statement: “A new way forward.”
It was he himself, who three years ago criticized Bush’s idea of sending new military reinforcements to Iraq, the country suffering from the civil war, and that criticized him as “an irresponsible and catastrophic decision.”
The following months, however, proved that Bush’s strategy, based on the recommendations of field captains, was the only possible and successful one, so that today nothing about Iraq is talked about in the news.
Bush’s reputation did not improve, but it objectively left his successor in a much more favourable initial situation than expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama expects the miracle to repeat itself.
Field captains again asked him to increase the military contingent, especially the commander-in-chief of Afghan Operation General Stanley McCristal, who, even despite traditional subordinate relations, subjected the undecided gunmen in the White House to harsh criticism.
He asked 40,000 men to improve the situation.
The president wavered for three months, but he didn’t think of anything better, so at least he tricked the general over 10,000 military personnel.
He managed to get Europe to promise him another 5,000, although he himself had previously counted at least 10,000.
The most problematic part of Obama’s entire strategy seems to be his goal, to start withdrawing troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and finish this procedure in three years.
Many doubt that the increase will bear the same fruit as the procedure in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal wars in recent years, Iraq’s society is relatively well organized, its leaders respect the agreements.
The situation in Afghanistan is different: it is not possible to trust anyone and no agreement is fulfilled.
Under these conditions it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces, if they are used to changing the boss every day according to their needs.
The political institutions, although formally established, will remain only a people of Potemkin, after which patriarchal tribal relations will remain.
Balancing the interests of different ethnic groups is extraordinarily complicated due to confusing relations, even more complicated by Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Not even establishing a state that is “capable of action,” a minimum goal of the whole operation, seems very real.
The horizon of Obama’s strategy clashes with his voluntarism.
Over the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has continued to deteriorate and is now about to erupt.
Only a romantic soul, who knows nothing about reality, can believe that the military sent to war to “go home soon,” will do some miracle here.
From a political point of view, setting the date of the withdrawal of troops is purely irresponsible, as the Taliban will regard it as an indirect statement of American defeat.
The latest NATO summit showed that Europeans are increasingly less willing to participate in military operations in Afghanistan.
European politicians do not know, nor do they want to explain to their constituents, what the security of Germany or Italy has to do with the Hindu Kush war.
The other factor, capable of radically affecting the situation, is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the increased sanctions have no effect on the Iranians, the US will have to make a difficult decision: try to solve the problem with military force or not.
It will be necessary to look for the answers precisely when, according to Obama, America begins the triumphant withdrawal of the troops from Afghanistan.
However, any such solution will mean a dramatic setback for the Afghan situation.
The only positive point for Barack Obama is the fact that three years are missing for the presidential election and therefore there is still much time left to find another strategy, if this is a total failure.
Goldman Sachs bank executives will not receive cash bonuses again
Senior executives at U.S. bank Goldman Sachs will not receive cash bonuses this year.
The entity announced it to react to the harsh criticism of its wage practices.
The group of 30 senior executives will receive, instead of money, shares that cannot be sold within a minimum of five years.
In addition, the shares may be withdrawn if they have assumed excessive risks.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs thus became the leader in the effort to unite Wall Street bonuses with long-term power.
I guess Wall Street is fully aware of the longest path it has to take, said former JPMorgan investor Douglas Elliott.
The problem is in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs faced criticism after having allocated nearly $17 billion (nearly CZK 300 billion) for bonuses in the first three quarters of this year.
The total amount of bonuses in the entity for this year, according to Reuters, is likely to exceed, despite the measure announced today, $20 billion.
The high bonuses in the banking sector became, with the advent of the financial crisis, a sensitive issue in politics.
Britain announced on Wednesday that it plans to charge one-time, with a 50 percent tax, bonuses for bankers exceeding <0xC2><0xA3>25,000 (approximately CZK 712,000).
France is also preparing similar measures.
This year, women received the Nobel Prizes in all categories except Physics.
Five women, which is a record figure, received this year’s Nobel Prizes in literature and specialized categories at the hands of King Charles XVI Gustav of Sweden in Stockholm.
In addition to the four scientists, among the prizewinners was also a German writer of Romanian origin, Herta Müller.
The Nobel Prize in Medicine was awarded to two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, as well as her compatriot Jack Szostak for research in the field of chromosomes.
The Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded by Israeli Ada Jonath and Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishna and Thomas Steitz for explaining the structure and function of ribosomes.
The latest award, the Nobel Prize in Economics, was received by American Elinor Ostrom and his compatriot Oliver Williamson for the analysis of an economic report.
The only specialized category, without an award-winning woman, was Physics.
This award was received today by scientists Charles Kao for research in the field of optical cables, and George Smith with Willard Boyle for the invention of the CCD chip, which forms the basis of all digital cameras, faxes or telescopes.
Each awardee collected the diploma, the Nobel medal and the certificate of the money received.
This sum in each category is up to ten million Swedish crowns (approximately 25 million Czech crowns).
In the event that there are several prizes in each category, the prize is distributed to each other.
The long-awaited Nobel Peace Prize was held this afternoon in Oslo, Norway, by U.S. President Barack Obama.
In his speech, he acknowledged the controversy of having been awarded, as he is at the beginning of his career and is also at the head of a country that participates in two wars: in Iraq and in Afghanistan.
To defend his policy, he added, however, that in certain situations wars are essential to achieving peace, even if their price is high.
Minister Janota considers resignation. Klaus invited him to the Castle
President V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Klaus will receive finance minister Eduard Janota on Friday morning, who is considering his stay in the government, as he does not agree with the version of the state budget for next year, approved on Wednesday by the House of Representatives.
The budget, and perhaps Janota’s stay in the cabinet, is supposed to be the themes of his Friday meeting.
The budget is also criticised by Klaus.
According to him, the deficit is too large, which continues to deepen the crisis of public finances.
President Radim Ochvat's spokesperson reported on the appointment.
On his stay in office, Janota wants to negotiate with Prime Minister Jan Fischer on Monday.
Under the budget law, which Klaus is preparing to sign, the Czech Republic should rule with a deficit of SEK 163 billion.
The House of Representatives, however, on Wednesday approved the left’s proposals for transfers of funds and increased money for officials’ salaries, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government does not agree with the proposals of the Social Democrats, as they covertly increase the budget deficit.
Between the left and the government on the one hand, Klaus and the right on the other, there was a serious conflict of domestic politics, and because of this conflict, the future activities of Fischer’s bureaucratic cabinet, whose form was agreed in spring by the SDG, <0xC4><0x8C>SSD and the Greens Party, are beginning to be controversial.
Critics claim that the budget, in the version approved by the Chamber of Deputies, de facto liquidates the package of austerity measures, imposed in autumn by the Fischer government to curb public debt.
Klaus may but does not have to sign the law on the state budget; today he stated during a breakfast with entrepreneurs that politicians have long neglected “the serious problem,” i.e., “the unsustainable deficit” of public finances.
According to him, they no longer have a good solution.
Only a strong government, which can be supported by a broader consensus among political parties, could improve this situation.
SDG leader Mirek Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek mentioned that the budget is horrific and that the government should think about its future existence.
ODS Vice President Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as told <0xC4><0x8C>TK that the concept of the bureaucratic cabinet with the support of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, ODS and the Greens clearly no longer works.
Prime Minister Fischer reacted and called similar words "strong sentences".
The head of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Paroubek, reacted to Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek saying that the budget deficit is horrifying, prepared for this year by the former government of Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek.
On Wednesday <0xC4><0x8C>SSD said the approval of the state budget for next year was successful.
The people were happy too.
Mandela in Clint Eastwood's new film, starring Morgan Freeman
South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film, Invictus: Invincible, tells a lot about the country, its struggle and its victories, although some critics say the protagonist roles are played by American actors.
The story speaks of sport, racial relations, and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless fighter against the racist apartheid regime in South Africa and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, is played in his biography by Oscar-winning American actor Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said Mandela, 91, asked him to play him in the Eastwood film.
Matt Damon plays another important role.
I said, "When you interpret it, I'll have to have access to you.
The seventy-two-year-old actor, who received the award for his role in Eastwood’s drama about the world of boxing Million Dollar Baby, played the role of the leader of the movement for the abolition of slavery, which ended up as a slave, of the still-living, fictitiously important U.S. president.
The former South African statesman spent 27 years in prison for his activities to end apartheid in the South African Republic.
He was released in 1990 and for four years became president of the country.
In 1993 he received the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus - Invincible is a Latin word and the title of a poem by the English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him.
The film is a real story about Nelson Mandela, who joined forces with the captain of the South African rugby team, Francois Pienaar, to help unite the country. Mandela, the new president, knows that after apartheid his nation remains racially and economically divided.
He believes he is able to unite his people through sport, and that’s why he decides to unite the rugby players, who belong to the outsiders in the world.
The South African team managed to reach the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked for several years to get Mandela’s story to the cinemas.
I had no other goal but to play this role in such a way that it was as close to reality as possible, Freeman said.
Of course, the biggest challenge was to talk like him.
The actor said that if he and the world politician were from the same area, he would have tried to meet Mandela, have dinner with him, be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing was that I wanted to shake Mandela’s hand.
I found that by squeezing his hand, I receive his energy, it is transmitted and I had the feeling of knowing how you feel, he said.
It is important to me to try to become a different person.
Matt Damon plays the role of Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Pienaar, the captain of the national rugby team, in which white players dominated.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the tough world of rugby.
A big surprise for him was when he finally met Pienaar for the first time at his home.
I remember calling the door, he opened it and the first thing I said to Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Pienaar in my life was, "In the movie I look much taller."
Despite the obvious differences between the characters of the actors and their real models, and under the management of the Eastwood director, Invictus: Invincible received positive reviews and is also talked about ambitions for the Oscar.
Daily Variety film critic Todd McCarthy summed up his assessment with these words: "It was a very good story, a very well made film."
In movie reviews on the website rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received 76 percent positive reviews.
The secret of splendour about Norway solved: the Russians tested a missile
A special light effect of unknown origin was observed on Norway.
The Russian Defense Ministry finally acknowledged yesterday that near the borders with Norway it was testing an intercontinental ballistic missile.
The "Bulva" missile, previously intended to be the pride of the Russian army, is becoming the nightmare of the Russian generals and the Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Even his repeated presence in the missile tests has not had the desired effect on the success of test flights.
Bulava, in most cases, did not fly out or there was a failure in the air.
In the Russian newspapers they write of "Bulava" as of "a missile that does not fly".
A missile that doesn't fly, but shines.
During this, the 13th test, there was no problem at first.
At the end of the flight there were again technical problems in the aircraft.
Probably the engine exploded in the third stage of the missile.
This time "Bulava" was launched from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donskoy, which was floating submerged in the White Sea.
This type of missile allows launching from a ship that is moving and being submerged at the same time.
Therefore, it is likely that the mysterious light on Norway, caused by an unidentified flying object, was actually the failed "Bulav<0xC3><0xA1>".
The same Norwegians did not hesitate from the first moment that it was a Russian missile.
The generals defend themselves this time by asserting that one cannot simply speak of a failure.
The first two stages of the missile lasted and the failure occurred in the third.
In the above cases the engines were immediately broken in the first stage.
Although none of the launches went completely error-free, according to the Department of Defense management only six of the thirteen failed.
The success of almost fifty percent is full of optimism to the generals and therefore they continue to claim that “Bulav<0xC3><0xA1>” will one day fly smoothly and that it will even manage to carry up to ten hypersonic nuclear blocks, whose maximum total weight is 1.15 tons.
The legendary Fetisov signed at the age of 51 an annual contract with CSKA of Moscow
Legendary defender Viacheslav Fetisov will return at the age of 51 to a professional hockey match.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and winner of the Stanley Cup will help his CSKA Moscow team and possibly play on Friday in the KHL match against St. Petersburg.
Fetisov finished his professional career at the age of forty in 1998 and currently chairs the CSKA.
After Denis Kulyash is injured, we urgently need another defender.
Fetisov is constantly practicing and is committed to helping the team.
We just have to settle some formal issues, the AP agency quoted Sergei Nemchinov, the coach of the Moscow club.
It is not yet clear whether the return of the famous player will refer to a single game.
I think Fetisov is one of those who manage to lift the spirits of the other players, Nemchinov said.
According to AP, if Fetisov returns to the ice rink, he will become the longest-running professional player in Russian hockey.
Legendary forward Gordie Howe played in the NHL for Hartford at the age of fifty-one, throughout the season, scoring 15 goals and 26 assists.
The largest of the group of five famous players Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful hockey players in history.
Playing for the Soviet Union he won two Olympic golds, seven world championships, triumphed in the Canada Cup and the junior world championship.
In the second part of his career he also had success in the NHL: playing with Detroit he won the Stanley Cup twice.
Since 2001 he has been a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame.
Hyundai has met the requirements of the trade unions. It will cancel all additional work
The management of the car factory in No<0xC5><0xA1>ovice agreed with the unions to cancel all additional work.
Precisely because of the frequent additional work, the unions declared the emergency by strike on Monday.
The information was confirmed by Petr Van<0xC4><0x9B>k, the spokesman for the Hyundai car factory.
The management, however, wants to agree with the unions another Saturday shift for this year.
We cannot resign our manufacturing plan, as it is essential. That is why we proposed additional voluntary work for Saturday 19 December, that is, it will be worked in two shifts, Van<0xC4><0x9B>k said.
According to the server Sedmi<0xC4><0x8D>ka.cz, the company offered a bonus of 400 CZK to employees working the Saturday shift.
The bonus will also be paid for last Saturday, November 28th.
According to Va<0xC5><0x88>ka, the company decided to change the way to motivate its employees with the additional work offered.
Employees can charge the bonus for overtime or they can take a day off on December 28, that is, prolong Christmas holidays by one day, Vanek said.
In addition, all employees on Saturday shifts will receive money for the trip and food.
Because the additional work was the most urgent and problematic point of comments and complaints from trade unionists and strikers, who stopped manufacturing last week, the management yesterday afternoon immediately decided to cancel all the additional work for the month of December, Van<0xC4><0x9B>k said.
Employees of the car factory were forced to work two more hours in addition to eight-hour shifts and this situation lasted almost every day until last week.
After signing the agreement, the unions will cancel the strike emergency.
Another negotiation between the factory management and the trade unionists should take place on Monday morning.
Trade union chief Petr Kucha<0xC5><0x99> said on Wednesday that if they pledged to meet the requirements and the document is signed, they are willing to cancel the emergency by strike.
The situation at the car factory worsened last week, when about 400 employees spontaneously went on strike for frequent supplementary work.
They also protested against poor payment conditions and alleged harassment.
The management felt that employees had to work overtime to meet the requirements and be able to supply the cars.
The unionists in their statement of emergency by strike on Monday also demanded that none of the employees, who stopped manufacturing last Wednesday, be penalized in any way.
As far as supplementary work is concerned, unions demand that the company reduce it to a minimum.
In addition, this year they require a salary of 5,000 kroner for this work.
The car factory in No<0xC5><0xA1>ovice Hyundai currently has 2,000 employees.
The series production was started last November.
As of last September, it produced approximately 80,000 cars; its current production potential is 200,000 cars per year.
A Czech Discovery: An Effective Substance Even in 'Calched' HIV Viruses
The team of Czech and German scientists makes tests for new compounds capable of moderating the spread of HIV in the body
The main advantage of this enhanced substance is the fact that it is also effective against drug-resistant viruses.
In some cases this is more important than the fact that the compound is not as effective in a common variant of the virus, as some already accessible drugs.
AIDS cannot be cured so far.
However, the life of patients can be significantly prolonged thanks to a mixture of drugs that prevent replication of the HIV virus in the body.
However, its use has many side effects.
If the replication of the virus is not completely suppressed, so-called resistant viruses will be created; against them, the drugs no longer work.
The work of experts from three Institutes of the Czech Academy of Sciences, V<0xC5><0xA0>CHT Prague and the University of Heidelberg demonstrates the possibility of mastering virus resistance.
They showed that substances called metallocarbonates have an effect on albumin, which is responsible for the spread of the HIV virus.
Metalocarbonates are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the spread of the virus in a way different from all the drugs used today, and therefore can solve the problem of resistance.
In their work, scientists find new, ‘improved’ compounds, prepared by knowing the molecular mechanism of their binding to the virus’s albumin.
Metal carbonates have a single three-dimensional structure: two polyhedron cages composed of the boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms are joined by the metal atom, in this case by cobalt.
A traitorous and resilient virus
HIV protease is an albumin of the HIV virus, and is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without HIV protease, there is no fragmentation of the HIV virus and no mature and infectious corpuscles of the virus would be created.
If we stop HIV protease, we also stop the spread of the virus in the patient’s body, the scientists explain in a press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry at the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In an article published in the Journal of Medical Chemistry, scientists describe a series of compounds, in which two pairs of cages (see the table) are joined by a short organic series, which is still being systematically modified.
A little weaker, but more effective
The test of the effect of this series of substances against HIV protease was carried out in sample, and also against its resistant variants, obtained from HIV patients.
The effect of metallocarbonates on the common variant of the enzyme is not as strong as in clinically used drugs, however they do not lose their effect on resistant variants, in which drugs often do not work.
The mechanism of the unique effect, its other qualities such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical modifications does, that metallocarbonates are interesting compounds for research with the aim of proposing effective drugs against HIV, says Molequia Institute <0xC5><0x98>ez<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ov<0xC3><0xA1>, Biophysics Institution and Genetics Department of Genetics in the Institute of Structural Biology.
Struggles for the budget. ODS attacked Fischer, he defends
SDG chief Mirek Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek said the budget approved for next year is "terrible" and Prime Minister Jan Fischer's government should, he said, think of its future existence.
The ODS statements were pointed out by the Prime Minister as strong judgments.
They say it leaves time for analysis.
ODS Vice President Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as said that the concept of the bureaucratic cabinet with the support of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, ODS and the Green Party clearly no longer works.
According to Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as, the prime minister has to decide whether he wants to rely on the minority in the Chamber of Deputies, who is trying to fight the growing deficit, or whether he wants to stay in his position with the help of the parliamentary left.
The attitude of SDGs and social democracy towards the problem of the public deficit is completely different, Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as warned.
The House of Representatives yesterday approved the budget for 2010, however with the amendments proposed by the left, for more than 12 billion kroner.
The Chamber of Deputies raised money for state officials’ salaries, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government denounced the SDG proposals as they covertly increase the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should rule with a deficit of 163 billion kroner.
SDGs before the vote came out of the room and thus fulfilled the government’s wish, that the amended budget is better than a provisional budget.
Disappointment and uselessness
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and sense of uselessness; Prime Minister Jan Fischer mentioned that the government will reassess the current situation.
Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as is convinced that if Janota were to seriously threaten the resignation in the event of approval of the amending proposals, the situation could have been different.
According to <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xA1> TV Janota requested a meeting with the Prime Minister.
He pointed out that he is thinking about staying in the role.
The reason is his disappointment with the budget negotiations.
If Fischer agrees with another fight against the budget deficit, according to Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as in the government they have nothing to do with the nominees for the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, which imposed the changes in the budget.
The Prime Minister should also say clearly, if he resigns, if the House approves other laws that increase the deficit, such as those relating to sickness grants, income, or the amendment of the service law.
Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek: Ministers nominated by the SDGs are not to blame
It is a matter for Prime Minister Fischer and the entire government.
Ministers nominated by the SDG have done nothing wrong, Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek stressed in the US text news.
He recalled that in several ministries in the lieutenant posts there are people who belong to the TOP 09, who voted against the budget.
Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as stressed that if Fischer decides to resign the principle of struggle with the height of the public finance deficit, "it is absolutely logical and correct, which relies on the leftist majority, which is currently in the Chamber of Deputies".
However, it will not be able to count on the support and tolerance of the members of the SDGs.
I have not thought about that, when the time comes, I will deal with it,” Defence Minister Martin Bart<0xC3><0xA1>k, who was appointed to the government by the members of the SDG, told reporters in the Chamber of Deputies.
Prime Minister Fischer went to a meeting of the European Council in Brussels in the afternoon.
ODS resigned at the Prime Minister's request
Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as stressed that ODS would likely vote against the amended budget on Wednesday in the House of Representatives, if the prime minister does not explicitly ask ODS MPs to allow the budget to be accepted.
We do not feel like orphans, we are not young children, he responded to the question, whether ODS does not care about the absence of the head of the party in parliament and in the Czech Republic, during the budget negotiations.
I didn't realize my vote was missing.
When he resigned from office, he knew that in the next few months it was mainly about the Bolshevikization of the Chamber of Deputies and the destruction of everything positive, Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek himself reacted.
According to the new <0xC4><0x8C>D train schedule, there will be fewer trains for almost the same fares
<0xC4><0x8C>eské dr<0xC3><0xA1>hy (Czech Railways) from 13 December will cancel or restrict some less used fast and local trains and, on the contrary, will reinforce some links.
The total length of traffic will be reduced by two percent compared to today, after the new train schedule comes into effect.
Most rates including the basic and customer price will not change.
More possibilities of links to the capital will be gained for example by the inhabitants of the Ostrava region, dr<0xC3><0xA1>hy for this line will add a commuter carriageway.
The direct train, on the other hand, will not travel to Bratislava again.
On the line Prague - P<0xC3><0xAD>sek - <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice there will be fewer fast trains, the direct links Prague - Letohrad will be restricted.
In the regions, the largest reduction of planned transport by dr<0xC3><0xA1>hy is in the Hradec Kr<0xC3><0xA1>lové region, eight percent in total, on the contrary, transport will increase in Prague and surrounding areas.
Two night trains will also be cancelled on the Prague - T<0xC3><0xA1>bor - <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice route and some fast trains on the Prague - P<0xC3><0xAD>sek - <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice line will be reduced to just a few days of the week.
One of the biggest changes is the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague, the inhabitants of Milovice have to change in Lys<0xC3><0xA1> nad Labem.
It is the 15th line of the Esko system, in the vicinity of the cities, its opening is possible thanks to the electrification of the line from Lys<0xC3><0xA1> nad Labem to Milovice.
Long-distance connections to the capital will end at Prague Hlavn<0xC3><0xAD> n<0xC3><0xA1>dra<0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD> station.
<0xC4><0x8C>D will introduce more SC Pendolino links between Prague and Ostrava and trains to <0xC5><0xA0>umperk/Jesen<0xC3><0xAD>k will run every two hours.
From 13 December, travellers will no longer travel to Bratislava in Pendolino.
The count for this year’s regional railways: 200 million more than before
The fast trains are charged and paid by the Ministry of Transport, to cover the so-called demonstrable losses Dr<0xC3><0xA1>hy will receive next year four billion kroner in total, as well as this year. Local trains are charged by the regions, next year will pay eight billion kroner in total, and the state will help them three billion.
This year, regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
For the fast and local dr<0xC3><0xA1>hy trains have a new ten-year contract, so far the contract was always one year.
Dr<0xC3><0xA1>hy are happy with the system, and maybe that’s why they didn’t raise the prices of a large majority of the tickets.
The changes will only take place on the one-day tickets - <0xC4><0x8C>D Net and on the cheap eLi<0xC5><0xA1>ka internet tickets.
For travellers without a customer card, the price of <0xC4><0x8C>D Net will increase from 450 kroner to 600 kroner.
The price of eLi<0xC5><0xA1>ka will depend on the distance, so far there was the unique price of 160 kroner for travel between any two regional cities.
Philippine Armed Forces Still Detaining More Than 50 People, Children Released
The armed forces have kidnapped 75 people in the southern Philippines today, including several primary school students and their teachers.
This was reported by the AFP agency, which previously reported only 65 kidnapped people.
All 17 children arrested and a teacher were released after eight hours.
The kidnapping took place in South Agusan province.
They say about 19 armed men use hostages as a living shield in the escape from the police.
Local negotiators are trying to agree on the delivery of the remaining hostages.
According to the AFP agency, the armed forces belong to the New People's Armed Forces (NPA), an armed faction of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AP agency, police previously pursued the kidnappers because of the violence, the cause of which was the adjustment of accounts between two clans of local families.
In the southern Philippines in the province of Maguindanao was due to the recent massacre, in which 57 people died, imposed martial law.
Among the victims of the November 23 massacre, related to the election of the governor, were 30 journalists.
On suspicion of involvement in the massacre they arrested the governor of this province in the south of the Philippines and his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of an influential dynasty of the Ampatuan.
Muslim separatists also operate on the island of Mindanao.
On Tuesday, however, they renewed peace talks with the Philippine government.
RSA’s story is all about the world, says Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
In the coming days, a new Hollywood film, by Clint Eastwood Invictus (his official Czech title is Invictus: Nepora<0xC5><0xBE>en<0xC3><0xBD>), will be released in American cinemas, capturing a portion of the biography of former South African President Nelson Mandela.
The role of the world-famous anti-apartheid fighter is played by Morgan Freeman, whom Mandela himself chose years ago for the protagonist role.
The second role, that of the legendary rugby champion Francoise Pienaar, was played by Matt Damon.
With the premiere they are born from the reactions of critics and the public
Nelson Mandela
His full name is Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela. He was born on July 18, 1918 in Mvezo, South Africa.
In 1988 he received the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, in 1993 he received, along with Klerk, the Nobel Peace Prize.
He was President of the Republic of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
great hopes, as it comes to the public at the time, when in the Republic of South Africa the preparations for the world championship in football culminate. At the same time the media are shaken by alarming news about the increasing racial hatred and discrimination of the inhabitants by the dominant black majority.
According to the AP news agency, the reactions to this new film on RSA have been positive, despite numerous reservations against the distribution of the protagonist roles by the "uninteresting" Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman, however, says he is proud of the new film.
For many years I dreamed of the role and prepared myself well to perform it.
Many times I met Nelson Mandela in person, to - as they say - charge his energy, he mentioned in an interview after the festive premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it's good, if through the film we can remember Mandela's character and message.
It is a history of the Republic of South Africa, but it refers to everyone, he added.
In the costume of the national rugby team
The film is based on the book by British writer John Carlin with the freely translated title In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the game. Thanks to this game the nation was born. Portrait of the South African human rights lawyer during his first presidential term.
Morgan Freeman in the film is trying to unite two groups of inhabitants, racially and for long separate years. Like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he also as a protagonist puts on the costume of the South African national rugby team and enters the field of play. RSA won the World Cup at the time.
For entering the grass in the suit, which in RSA is considered something almost sacred, Mandela fourteen years ago won great ovations, especially from the white public and the recognition of the white inhabitants.
The football championship may be able to help people unite and form a nation, said rugby player Chester Williams, the only "black" on the national team in 1995.
It will still be seen, if the tense situation in the RSA improves.
White South Africans, however, are skeptical, as Christopher Dawson, a rugby fan who fled his country to Britain, said in a recent interview for LN.
The championship starts on June 11, 2010.
In Lounsko burns a transformer worth tens of millions of crowns
The fire in the morning caught a transformer from the company <0xC4><0x8C>eps in a switch box near the village of V<0xC3><0xBD><0xC5><0xA1>kov in Lounsko.
According to Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Marvan, the spokesman for the Usti region firefighters, the fire is extinguished by six groups.
Previously, firefighters wanted to let the transformer be destroyed by the fire, but later changed their minds and the fire is extinguishing it with a mixture of water, foam and special extinguishing matter.
The fire was caused by a technical defect, the short circuit of the transformer.
There were no injuries, according to Pavla Mand<0xC3><0xA1>tov<0xC3><0xA1>, the company’s spokeswoman, the failure does not jeopardize the safe operation of the distribution system.
The estimated damage is several million crowns, listing it exactly will not be possible before the fire goes out.
According to Mand<0xC3><0xA1>tov<0xC3><0xA1>, it will be necessary to replace the destroyed transformer with a new one.
During the ten years of <0xC4><0x8C>eps’ activity nothing similar happened, such breakdowns are sporadic, he added.
According to Sona Holingerov<0xC3><0xA1> Hendrychov<0xC3><0xA1>, spokeswoman for <0xC4><0x8C>EZ for the Northern Czech Republic, the electricity supply was not cut off, and the substation fire did not affect the operation of homes, offices or businesses.
A.s. <0xC4><0x8C>eps operated in the territory of the Czech Republic as the exclusive maintainer of the distribution system, of the 400 kV and 220 kV electrical conduction.
It maintains in good condition, renews and develops 39 switch boxes with 67 transformers, which carry the electrical energy from the transmission system to the distribution system, and maintains the electrical conduction of 4339 kilometers long.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura will file a denunciation for slander to three judges of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD
Student Agency owner Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura will file a denunciation for slander against three social democratic judges.
It is about Michal Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek of the region Jihomoravsk<0xC3><0xBD> kraj, Radko Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nek of Pardubick<0xC3><0xBD> kraj and Martin Tesa<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k of Olomouck<0xC3><0xBD> kraj.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura mentioned it in 20 minutes in Radio<0xC5><0xBE>urn<0xC3><0xA1>l.
Demand has to do with the company’s effort to maintain regional rail transport in some regions.
All regions, however, ended up signing long-term contracts with <0xC4><0x8C>eské dr<0xC3><0xA1>hy.
All three hetmans are attacking us and talking about the fact that we’re “taking the cake passes,” yet we only brought the offer for what they wanted.
They claim that we are more expensive than <0xC4><0x8C>eské dr<0xC3><0xA1>hy, which is not true. We know the prices of <0xC4><0x8C>eské dr<0xC3><0xA1>hy, which were fixed last week.
So we have nothing left to defend ourselves.
It is for the slander towards the Student Agency society, he told Radio<0xC5><0xBE>urn<0xC3><0xA1>l Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura.
At the same time, he said that he had the tests of all the regions, and that the necessary measures had not been taken in accordance with European law.
That is why he is preparing an incentive for the European Commission.
Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek considers this complaint for the continuation of Mr Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura’s media show, which serves as free advertising for his company and for himself.
Of course I am prepared to defend my good reputation and that of my region and I appeal to the other hetmans to do so as well.
I suppose, which will also be clearly demonstrated on this occasion, that Mr Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura manipulates the public in the matter of regional rail transport, and uses false and false arguments, Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek said.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura announced last week that it would invest several million kroner in advertising, whose goal would be to warn of these measures from the regions.
He told Radio<0xC5><0xBE>urn<0xC3><0xA1>l that he would interrupt the campaign after Christmas and wants to continue it after the New Year.
He said the campaign against corruption will be carried out as such.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura began the campaign after the regions agreed with <0xC4><0x8C>eské dr<0xC3><0xA1>hy to maintain regional rail links and for the order of approximately 150 billion kroner did not call for a tender.
According to Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, similar steps are at odds with the law and with the opinion of the European Court of Justice.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura claims to have been threatened by a <0xC4><0x8C>SSD MP, due to his criticism of rail transport in the regions.
The only threat was that if we didn't leave it, we could lose the bus licenses.
He presented himself as a member of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, I know, what lord it is about, I will not say his name, Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura said today to Radio<0xC5><0xBE>urn<0xC3><0xA1>l.
The pneumococcal vaccine will be free and voluntary
The pneumococcal vaccine from January will put an end to the usual habits.
As a first vaccine it should be free for families and at the same time voluntary.
However, there are already opinions that the mandatory vaccine would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of the free pneumococcal vaccine culminate.
The Institute of Medicine is already setting maximum prices for vaccines, which will be covered by insurance companies.
Experts also already have it clear in the vaccination procedure.
The new vaccine
Free Vaccines for Children Born in August
From January, children born on August 2 of last year will be able to receive the pneumococcal vaccine free of charge.
The condition is not to have received a dose of the vaccine before.
Those who started the vaccine last year or earlier have to cover other doses of the vaccine as well.
The first dose of the vaccine must be received between the third and fifth month of age of the child.
Last year, a quarter of families volunteered to vaccinate their children against pneumococcal disease.
The parents, however, paid for a dose of 1,600 crowns and more.
To vaccinate the youngest children, four doses are required.
Experts generally estimate that insurance companies will spend 300 to 450 thousand kroner a year on vaccines.
Without clutches they will save on treatment, which is needed for unvaccinated children.
So far, the state spent about 500,000 children on all vaccinations annually.
Covered vaccination was initiated by the so-called Janota package.
Pneumococcal disease is the cause of otitis media, but also of serious infections including meningitis and septicaemia.
Of the pneumococcal infections in our country every year, according to research in hospitals, 28 children no older than 10 years of age die.
In addition to the Czech Republic, the pneumococcal vaccine in children was introduced in approximately 40 countries.
Is the vaccine mandatory?
At the same time, however, there are opinions that this vaccine could be mandatory in the future.
As of January, it should be covered by insurance and voluntary companies.
The mandatory vaccine would be better, said Rudolf Kalovsk<0xC3><0xBD>, the head of the Nahlas civic association.
Their association has long propagated pneumococcal vaccines.
The experts at an international conference, in which our association participated, were not completely satisfied with the fact that we have the voluntary vaccine.
It's not completely ideal.
On the other hand, we are happy to achieve at least this.
I think this is the way we have to go now, Kalovsk<0xC3><0xBD> mentioned.
However, the Ministry of Health does not want to change the pneumococcal vaccination procedure.
At the moment we do not think about it at all, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sr<0xC5><0xA1>e<0xC5><0x88>.
Voluntary Vaccine Has Its Disadvantages, Doctors Say
La presidenta de la sociedad de paediatras The professional society of practical pediatricians Hana Cabrnochov<0xC3><0xA1> recognizes, that the voluntary vaccine has its disadvantages.
"In the situation, when the vaccine costs such a high amount, we relatively understand the political decision to have started vaccination as voluntary," says Cabrnochov<0xC3><0xA1>.
Experts expect that as of next year, more than 80 percent of young parents will leave their babies vaccinated against pneumococcal disease.
The pneumococcal vaccine is a big change too because as the first vaccination in children is covered by health companies, not by the state.
Insurance companies should spend more money on prophylaxis, to later save on treatment, Cabrnochov<0xC3><0xA1> explains.
Doctors will have to buy the vaccines themselves.
However, pediatricians are concerned about buying vaccines.
Previously, vaccines had to be bought by insurance companies and distributed to doctors, just as when the state gives them other vaccines.
Some MPs, however, feared that insurance companies could “take the money out of health insurance.”
Doctors will have to buy the vaccines and wait until they are paid by insurance companies.
It is estimated that pediatricians will invest in 40,000 vaccines per month, which is a remarkable sum.
It will not be easy, says Cabrnochov<0xC3><0xA1>.
The son of an American artist involved in “the theft of a museum”
The son of renowned American fantasy artist Frank Frazetta has been accused of trying to steal $20 million worth of paintings from his father’s museum.
Pennsylvania police say Alfonso Frank Frazetta was caught carrying 90 pictures of his vehicle and trailer.
They claim that Frazetta and another man used an excavator to break into the museum, in the Pocono Mountains region.
Frazetta father, 81, is famous for his portrayal of such characters as Conan the Barbarian and Tarzan.
The Associated Press news agency reported that the artist was in Florida at the time of the incident.
AP reported that an unidentified police official claimed that a family dispute may have motivated the young Frazetta.
The agency reported that Frazatta's 52-year-old son told police that his father had ordered him "to enter the museum by any means to move all the paintings to a depot."
The agency said Frazetta father denied granting such permission.
The Labour Party defends the tax increases in the budget
Ministers have advocated tax increases and spending cuts in the pre-budget report, against criticism from the opposition, companies and trade unions.
The Conservatives said Alistair Darling "wasted" an opportunity to show his seriousness about the deficit cut, delaying decisions until after the election.
The Minister of Finance also received harsh criticism for hurting low- and middle-income workers.
Its main proposals include a 0.5% increase in Social Security spending and a 1% increase in public sector wage agreements from 2011 onwards.
Anger for Social Security
Trade unions have lamented that low-wage workers are being punished with a recession generated by others, and warned of future “problems.”
The rise in Social Security spending, which will grow about <0xC2><0xA3>3 billion a year, has angered the business community, which claims this is a job tax, when the focus should be on economic recovery.
The increase, limited to those earning more than <0xC2><0xA3>20,000 a year, will affect approximately 10 million workers.
KEY POINTS OF THE BEFORE INFORMATION TO THE PRESUPUTED
Social Security with an additional 0.5% increase as of April 2011
Economy will contract more than expected 4.75% this year
New 50% tax on bankers’ bonds
The 1-point increase in corporate tax for small firms was ruled out
Tax deductions for electric cars and wind turbines
The state pension would increase by 2.5%
According to Treasury estimates, a person who earns <0xC2><0xA3>30,000 will lose <0xC2><0xA3>90 per year and a person who earns <0xC2><0xA3>40,000 will lose <0xC2><0xA3>190, while a person who earns <0xC2><0xA3>10,000 per year will earn <0xC2><0xA3>110.
Ministers said their goal of halving the deficit by 2013 involved "difficult decisions", but insisted that 60% of the additional tax burden would fall on 5% of the highest wages.
Finance Minister Stephen Timms denied that tax hikes and outlined spending cuts were a “sandwich in the desert” compared to what was needed.
"These are big figures. It will allow us to halve the deficit, which is absolutely essential over the next four years," he told the BBC.
Mr Timms said he was confident that the economy would grow again by the end of the year.
However, the Labour Party's forecasts for future economic growth, which will influence the amount to be borrowed and the speed with which the deficit is reduced, have been called into question after the Minister of Finance was forced to modify the first figures.
In his statement, he said the economy would likely contract by 4.75% this year, much worse than the 3.5% decline forecast in April, while the loan order would be <0xC2><0xA3>3 billion above what was previously estimated.
"Opportunity Wasted"
The Conservatives, who will launch a new advertising campaign on Thursday, warning of the Labour Party’s “debt crisis,” said the <0xC2><0xA3>789 billion loan application projection for the next six years was unsustainable.
Ministers had failed to present a credible plan on how they would return the money, they added, “cynicically” avoiding the difficult choices until after the elections to be held in June 2010.
"They haven't included anything significant about what they're going to do," Treasury Minister Philip Hammond said in the shadow of the Treasury Department. "They had the opportunity to do it and they've wasted it."
“All the important announcements will be made after the election, win the one who wins.”
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
The Labour Party insists that schools, hospitals and the police will be protected from future cuts, unlike conservative proposals, which would seek a further reduction of the deficit in the shorter term.
But the Liberal Democrats claimed that the money raised by tax increases and spending cuts would be used to sustain next year’s spending, not to reduce the deficit, arguing that the projects were like “sand castles.”
BBC political editor Nick Robinson said the timing chosen for the ads, such as the rise in inflation of some disability subsidies next April, mentioned above, would leave the Finance Minister exposed to allegations of electoral maneuvers, as the money could simply be recovered the following year.
However, the Labour Party insists that it is providing people with what they need most and the situation will be reviewed in September 2010.
"False assumption"
Although ministers did not publish post-2011 spending data, economists said it was clear that the adjustment of public spending would only be felt in the medium term.
The respected Institute of Fiscal Studies said the Treasury Minister’s figures involved substantial cuts in many areas, potentially including in the future transportation, higher education, science and defense.
“This is really delaying the pain for later,” said its director, Robert Chote.
“All the important announcements will come after the election, win who wins,” added Roger Bootle, Deloitte’s financial accountant.
"This has been the false report before the budget. Markets realize this."
FBI Investigates 'U.S. Arrests in Pakistan'
The FBI is investigating the arrest in Pakistan of five American men suspected of extremist connections.
The U.S. Embassy in Pakistan told the BBC that the men were arrested in a raid on a house in Sarghuda, in the eastern province of Punjab.
The FBI has said it is investigating whether they are the same men who disappeared from their homes in the U.S. state of Virginia last month.
The U.S. Department of State said it was also looking for information about the men.
Three of them are reportedly of Pakistani descent, one of Egyptian heritage and the other of Yemeni origin.
“If they are U.S. citizens, of course we’re going to be very interested in the charges they’ve been detained for and under what kind of circumstances they’re being detained,” said spokesman Ian Kelly.
FBI spokeswoman Katherine Schweit said the agency was aware of the arrests and was in contact with the families of the missing students.
“We are working with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identities and the nature of their business there, if indeed these are the students who were missing,” the spokeswoman said.
The Pakistani Embassy in Washington said the men were arrested in a house belonging to one of their uncles.
He said the house was already in sight of the local police and that no charges had yet been filed against the detainees.
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton declined to comment on the arrests, Reuters news agency reported; but said the U.S. had to “work more closely with both Afghanistan and Pakistan, to try to eradicate the terrorist infrastructure that continues to be recruited between people.”
The families of the five students reported their disappearance in North Virginia in late November.
Amnesty International condemns Iranian "abuses"
Human rights in Iran over the past 20 years have always been equally deficient, according to a report by the Amnesty International campaign group.
The report details "the abuse models" of the regime, before and after the presidential elections held in June.
One man cited in the report said he had been beaten and burned with cigarettes, another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran has rejected previous criticisms of its human rights record.
Officials have said such criticisms have a political basis.
Thousands of people arrested and dozens killed in Iran after the election held by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad sparked the biggest street protests since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Dozens have been convicted, and prosecutors say at least five people have been sentenced to death.
BBC correspondent in Tehran, Jon Leyne, who is now in London, says that during the protests, the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, acknowledged some allegations of abuse, ordering the closure of the detention center of Kahrizak.
But since then, authorities have shown very little tolerance for criticism, according to our correspondent.
"False Confession"
Amnesty International quoted 26-year-old computer student Ebrahim Mehtari as saying he was accused of “working with Facebook networks” and protesting the outcome of the election.
"They often hit me in the face" according to his words.
"They burned me with cigarettes under my eyes, neck, head... They threatened to execute me and humiliated me."
Amnesty said that after five days he signed a false confession and he was released and left on the street, still bleeding and semi-conscious.
In August, defeated presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi said some demonstrators arrested after the election had been tortured to death in prison, and others had been raped.
Iranian officials denied the allegations of rape, but admitted that there had been abuses.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former detainee, who said he was held in a container along with 75 other people for more than eight weeks, at a detention center in Kahrizak.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian parliament and the judiciary had set up committees to investigate the post-election unrest and the government’s response, but said the mandate and powers of the bodies were confusing and the parliamentary committee’s investigations had not been made public.
The group said at least 90 people had been detained in the past three weeks to prevent further demonstrations.
A ski slope was made in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow were used to turn a site of interest from Bristol into a racing track.
The Track at the Park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders who competed for cash prizes.
At the top of the slope in Brandon Hill Park there was a short jump ramp, opposite a 100-metre-long track.
John Hickman, a fourth-year medical student, said there was a beautiful view from the top of the track, but it was pretty scary.
It is seen below a beautiful view of the lights of the city titillating.
Here are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the county, real talent,” he added.
Awards were given to the best tricks or maneuvers performed on the track.
After the Thursday afternoon event, the snow will be melted.
Still them and us
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters have called for a ban on the construction of minarets and there is a widespread warning about the alleged Islamization of Europe, John Bowen, an American academic, has written a detailed and studied report on the possible integration of Muslims (who are actually integrating) into one of the continent’s most abier societies.
Some readers will come to this new book as admirers of the author's latest work "Why the French Don't Like Headcarves" (2006), an elegant and detailed study of a problem that divided and concerned the country for a decade and a half, and whose effects are still perceived today.
Mr. Bowen’s latest book has a broader and more ambitious perspective.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what the politicians and the media are saying about Islam in France, but what is really happening.
It has spent months in mosques, schools and institutes that now provide the 5-6 million Muslims in France what Mr. Bowen calls “Islamic spaces.”
He is a good listener who reproduces debates between teachers and students on the questions they are most interested in.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or in a town hall (or both)?
Should they teach young Muslims about the evolution and rights of homosexuals?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it legitimate for a Muslim to use an interest-based banking system to get a mortgage?
It is these seemingly mundane issues, he argues, things of daily life that concern the media more than political dramas.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, professors and intellectuals, none of them renowned, with the possible exception of Tariq Ramadan, an Arabic Muslim scholar and scholar born in Switzerland.
This new generation seeks to open the debate on how to be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They cannot fully disseminate this argument.
Conservatives doubt only the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists Mr. Bowen interviewed tend to disagree with his Salafi counterparts, supporters of the purist Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia, who currently have a small but influential presence among Muslims in Europe.
Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
Adaptation requires mutual concessions.
It questions the extent to which French political strategists (and the intellectual elite so fiercely defending secularism) are really committed to pluralism.
It suggests that Muslims probably have a more unfair treatment than Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who have also had to make their historic commitments to secular republicanism.
More than a growing pragmatism, he perceives “a value adjustment.”
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, one tends to say "Yes, but not yet."
The most devastating landscape in the world
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other habitat on the planet.
The ice that defines it is melting at an alarming rate, bringing with it life that cannot survive anywhere else.
The interests of oil, gas, transport and fishing have focused on newly opened waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now authors, as a result.
In "On Thin Ice", Richard Ellis, a writer and illustrator, paints a natural story of the northern icon, the polar bear.
Familiar with the complicated history and politics of whale hunting, he describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers, who gave evidence of value facing the white bear.
The encounter of Admiral Nelson as a valiant 14-year-old cadet, struggling only with the end of his musket, is surely a myth, but others are true.
The puppies, captured while swimming following the bodies of their newly exterminated mothers, were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
A circus performance in the early 20th century, it exhibited 75 polar bears at the same time.
Even today, zoos are still generally one-millionth of the area of a wild adult’s range.The climate is almost never adequate: a Singapore-based polar bear turned green because of the algae growing inside the hairless areas of its fur.

Ellis draws on stories from other writers and historians, and often returns to the threat that hunters pose to the survival of the species.
Although banned in Norway, the U.S. and Russia, slaughter continues in Greenland and Canada, where helicopter hunters and snowmobile Eskimo Indians use high-power assault rifles to take down their prey.
Ironically, it is in the waters north of those two hunting nations where the ice will last longer.
In his new book, After the Ice, Alun Anderson, a former editor of New Scientist, offers a clear and chilling account of Arctic science and a compelling look at how the future of that place can be transformed.
It’s not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can adequately explain the speed of change.
It is not because of lack of commitment.
Fridtjof Nansen’s pioneering travels in the late 19th and early 20th centuries gave clues for the first time about the displacement of the ice masses.
Then the submarines of the Cold War drew a map of the moving ice laces that circulate under the ice masses.
Satellite scans and extensive series of iceberg-mounted probes are a useful supplement, but resistant cold-camped individuals still perform many tasks.
Mr. Anderson looks into the extraordinary, tiny world of the tributary system within the Arctic ice, formed by squirrels of salt water that compresses as it freezes.
But from the bear on the surface to the microscopic wonders of the interior, they’re all doomed once summer ice is removed, which is believed to happen sometime between 2013 and 2050.
In a few months... these could be us
Marines among 6,000 who place crowns in Arlington graves
De'Angelo Robinson, 19, traveled seven hours by bus to place a single crown on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who traveled from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, N.C., to Arlington National Cemetery to decorate graves, it was a day to pay homage to men and women who once stood in their boots.
In a few months, from where we are boarding, these could be us, Robinson said of the fallen soldiers.
If it's us, I'd like someone to do the same for me, so I'm just trying to show respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who gathered Saturday morning to place crowns on veterans' graves in various sections of Arlington Cemetery.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, the owner of the Worcester Crown Company in Harrington, Maine, began the event when he and others decided to decorate several hundred graves in Arlington Cemetery.
In what is already an 18-year tradition, Morrill and his wife Karen make the journey every year stopping in different cities along the way, to officiate events dedicated to military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit organization, Wreaths Across America, which has extended the event to other states.
This year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 crowns in the tombs of Arlington Cemetery, areas at the Pentagon, tombs at Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, Battery Park in New York City, and on the memorial site for United Airlines Flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year, the Walmart Foundation donated more than $150,000 to buy and transport the crowns.
Charleen Hunt, 70, of Westminster, said she made the trip to Arlington in honor of her husband, a career-dead soldier.
While her husband was not buried in Arlington, Hunt said this was his way of giving a reward to those who made sacrifices.
This is a modest way in which civilians can support our troops, he said.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Wrapped in layers of warm clothing, the volunteers walked through the wide meadows and hills of the cemetery.
The volunteers went to older graves of World War I, World War II, and the Vietnam War, because they don’t receive as many visits as the new graves, the organizers said.
The atmosphere was cheerful as the children played and the couples took each other’s hand, as they carried the fresh pine to the gravestones.
Each circular crown was of a deep green, with a small red tie tied at the top.
Near there, Section 60, where most of the veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars are buried, remained virtually silent.
The United Service Organizations donated 1,000 crowns to decorate the section, but the gloomy atmosphere of the current wars invaded the area.
People wept openly, others prayed, and families and friends leaned on each other in the glacial air.
Some read aloud carved names on the stones, while others leaned to see small black and white plates placed inside the wet mud, for those whose graves have not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers who shed tears from her eyes in front of her son’s grave.
He drove eight hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the tomb of Sgt. David Shane Spicer, who died in combat in July.
No one should ever forget why we are free. . . my son paid for it, he said.
"Long after my death I want someone to remember it."
Cuban officials arrested a U.S. government contractor
The Cuban government has arrested a U.S. government contractor who distributes mobile phones and laptops in the country, State Department officials said on Saturday.
The contractor, who has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc, based in Bethesda.
The company works on projects for clients such as the United States Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular officers along with the U.S. Interests Section in Havana are seeking access to the detainee, who was arrested on December 5.
The specific charges have not been made public, although under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or foreign visitor may be detained for almost anything considered "dangerous".
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, including mild protests and critical writings, carry the risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and speeches are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has an incipient blogger community, led by popular commentator Yoani S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez, who often writes about how she and her husband are being followed and harassed by government agents.
S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez has requested permission on several occasions to leave the country to accept awards, but the permission has been denied.
The arrest of a U.S. contractor may likely provoke tensions between the Castro brothers’ communist government in Cuba and the Obama administration, which has been seeking a “slow-paced” approach to improving relations with the island.
The New York Times was the first to announce the arrest on Friday night.
The new U.S. policy emphasizes that if the Cuban government takes concrete measures, such as the release of political prisoners and the creation of more space for the opposition, there will be reciprocity on the part of the United States.
Mobile phones and laptops are legal in Cuba, even if they are new and coveted products in a country where the average salary of a government worker is $15 per month.
The Cuban government granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones only this year; they are mainly used for text messaging, as a 15-minute phone conversation would cost the daily wage.
Internet use is extremely limited on the island.
It is available in expensive hotels and for foreign visitors to the hotel, and in some government establishments, such as universities.
Cubans who want to connect often have to give their names to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
The arrest of an American in Cuba is unusual.
Gloria Berbena, a press officer at the U.S. Interests Section in Havana, said most of the handful of U.S. citizens in jail in Cuba are among the latches for crimes such as drug trafficking.
Berbena said she could not provide further information about the arrest.
The arrest and detention are clearly unfortunate.
An activity that in any other open society would be legal, such as distributing mobiles for free, in Cuba is a crime, said José Miguel Vivanco, director of the program of the Americas of the organization Human Rights Watch, who recently published a hard report on the freedoms in Cuba, called “Nuevo Castro, mema Cuba,” a reference to his placement.
Vivanco said the defendants are often arrested, prosecuted and imprisoned in one day.
He said any solution would probably be political, and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, just as the two countries begin to have more dialogue.
Pakistani officials unravel a plot to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, Pakistani authorities neutralized the alleged brains of a plot to send five men from North Virginia to Afghanistan to kill U.S. troops, saying they hoped the case could help unravel an extensive network of terrorist recruiters, who roam the Internet in search of radicalized young people.
The investigators said they were chasing a mysterious insurgent figure, known as Saifullah, who invited the men to Pakistan after discovering that one of them made comments approving terrorist attacks on the internet video site YouTube.
Saifullah addressed the men once in Pakistan, trying to help them reach the remote area in Pakistan’s tribal belt, which is a familiar place for al Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence official who had been briefed on the case said on Saturday that Saifullah could not convince al Qaeda commanders that the men were not part of a CIA plot to infiltrate the terrorist network.
Therefore, they were isolated for several days in the eastern city of Sargodha, away from the imposing mountains of the northwest, which have become a terrorist paradise.
They were considered part of a covert operation.
For this reason they were rejected, the official said, who spoke from anonymity due to the delicacy of the case.
The official said the men had not changed and were even trying to get the proper approval to access the al Qaeda camps, when Pakistani police authorities arrested them.
The case of the five men, who remain in Pakistan and are being questioned by the FBI, underscores the critical role recruiters play in identifying potential terrorists and, perhaps most importantly, determine who they trust.
Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, U.S. intelligence has set the top priority of trying to infiltrate people inside al Qaeda.
The recruiters of the organization act as guards, not letting pass those who do not demonstrate a serious commitment to the holy war, and those who could be spies.
Analysts said al Qaeda is analyzing aspiring U.S. recruits with special attention.
But for the organization they represent a huge appeal, because of their potential to have access to U.S. targets and because of their propaganda value.
But Evan Kohlmann, a senior analyst for the US-based NEFA Foundation, said terrorist groups have also become much more cautious in recent years about who they admit, because U.S. intelligence agencies have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you are trying to infiltrate someone in these groups, what better way than following the recruitment model how many have already followed?
It has become a much more web-based model.
Tens of thousands protest in Copenhagen, demand 'climate action'
On Saturday, tens of thousands of protesters marched here demanding negotiators working at the city’s Bella Center Convention Center, bolder actions for the climate.
Protesters said 100,000 people participated in the event, but police estimated the amount was closer to 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, though a handful of masked activists placed small explosives near a group of government buildings in the city center.
On a day when little happened in UN-sponsored climate talks, thousands of activists walked around the city holding banners in English that said “There is no planet B” and one in Spanish that declared, “The Earth says “it’s enough.”
Several celebrities joined the protest, including Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said the trips to Peru, her mother’s home country, made me aware of the distressing issues the country has to deal with due to the impacts of climate change that are already happening.”
This is part of the reason why I have decided to join the great demonstration, to spread the word and appeal to world leaders, to present a just, ambitious and binding agreement.
This is not an easy task, but it has to be done, there is no way to avoid it for longer.
Police prevented protesters from coming too close to the Bella Center, and said they had arrested 19 people, mainly because of wearing masks or wearing pocket knives.
Under Danish law, such activities are prohibited during demonstrations.
According to one witness, who asked not to be identified for being involved in climate talks, activists in sports masks and black outfits placed several explosives near the main Copenhagen canal, which is close to several ministries.
They were by the buildings, he said, adding that they started as flames, but that they were followed by "a couple of big explosions."
Inside the convention center, people gathered around television screens to watch the march throughout the afternoon.
But the protest didn’t seem to penetrate the consciousness of key officials like Su Wei, China’s chief climate negotiator.
When asked if he thought the demonstration was having a constructive impact on international deliberations, he replied in English, “I really wasn’t aware of the situation.”
Then he went on to say in Mandarin, "As the meeting place is great, I can't hear what's going on outside."
He noted that it was up to everyone’s perspective to define whether the march was being harmful or beneficial.
He said this shows the attention of the general public and from different sectors to the issue of climate change.
On the other hand, "it can also be said that they affect the negotiations, or the freedom of other people.
The data of a test reveals persistent racial differences
Last week’s federal grade book on math performance was very good news for the Capital District’s public schools.
Although the District is still far from the country’s best-performing systems, the rating booklet showed that fourth- and eighth-grade students have been slapped at a faster pace over the past two years, compared to the cities of Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what remains recorded in the recent figures of the National Educational Progress Assessment is the persistent performance difference between African American and white students, both locally and nationally.
The average scores of white fourth grade students in D.C. over the past two years grew from 262 to 270 (on a 500 scale), but their African-American peers increased only three points, from 209 to 212.
In fact, the performance gap grew between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of the eighth-grade African-Americans remained essentially fixed, dropping a statistically insignificant point, from 245 to 244.
The average scores of the whites were not included in the test results, because the sample size was not large enough.
Over a six-year extension, the picture is no more encouraging.
The difference separating fourth grade white and black students in 2003, when the first ENPE was released in the District, was 60 points from the scale (262 to 202).
Although the scores achieved by children in both groups have increased during this period, the difference has been barely reduced to 58.
Some education lawyers in the District expressed concern last week as the advances made by Rector Michelle A. El Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (Democrat), were driven largely by white students, who are already very good students.
This would suggest that we have improved the whole by caring for those at the top of the scale, which is problematic and conflicting, said Jeff Smith, executive director of D.C. Voice, a nonprofit organization advocating for educational equity in the District.
I’m not jumping in joy for a difference of two or three points, said D.C. Council member Kwame R. Brown, who has a daughter in the fourth grade of Eaton Elemental.
Brown, an assiduous critic of Rhee's administration style, said the message of the test scores is that the city's high schools have a desperate need for attention.
Clearly you always want to see the positive signs, and I respect it.
But what is worrying is that we are not devoting either the time or energy needed for our middle schools.
Rhee said the District needs to continue to find better ways to address the needs of low-performing students.
This fall, for example, some teachers are being trained to use a new reading curriculum, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at high school and middle school students, who did not master the foundations of early reading in their school courses and are considerably behind their peers.
Everyday Maths, a math curriculum from kindergarten to sixth grade, that emphasizes real-life games and experiences, which was introduced to the District under former Superintendent Clifford Janey, who is credited with some of the progress reported by the ENPE last week.
I just think we have to keep working to offer the best interventions to those students who are below the grade level, Rhee said.
Others say the ENPE results highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to increase the overall performance of the system and still provide additional money and resources for low-performing schools, which will be needed to reduce the gap.
Here’s a sort of dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, an education professor at the University of California at Berkeley, who studies urban test scores.
The solution of conventional policy is to allocate its resources and administrative reforms to schools located in the poorest sections of the D.C.
Then the goal can generate political repercussions that go against that important schedule.
But the problem, of course, is that, like other urban superintendents, she tries to cling to the black and white middle class.
Our focus is on ensuring that we build a system of excellent schools.
We need to strengthen our neighborhood schools so that all families, regardless of where they live, have confidence that their children can access excellent public education.
Janey, now superintendent of Newark schools, said in an interview this week that an essential element to end the performance difference is to lengthen the traditional public school year, currently 180 days in the District, to compete with autonomous schools.
It takes nearly 200 days to have the force of change, Janey said, who reached an agreement with her teachers’ union last year in a 185-day year, which she considers an “indicator” to seek a greater increase in the next convention.
Making Higher Education a Part of More Futures
The tourist bus arrived at the University of Gettysburg with a strong resolution.
Graciela Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez, 12, came down and flashed for a moment in front of the white columns, brick facades and emerald meadows.
Graciela’s parents had barely graduated from a high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a university campus.
Still, when she and the other eighth graders of the group explored Gettysburg, where tuition costs $38,690 a year, her attitude was less of that of impressed guests than that of enthusiastic prospective students.
“Yes! This is where I will be!” exclaimed Graciela, who would like to study medicine, when the guide announced that they had entered the science building.
Caray, seriously? said thoughtfully, when the guide talked about the school’s low teacher-student ratio.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh that the children had visited on their three-day trip, and had already completely absorbed their deliberate message: The question isn’t whether you’re going to go to college.
The question is which one.
While there is growing concern about the large number of children born in the United States from Hispanic immigrants who drop out of high school or become pregnant in adolescence, there are also hundreds of thousands who access college education they need to access middle class.
In fact, one in five of these “second generation” Hispanics graduates from college, a remarkable achievement given that many of their immigrant parents, especially Mexicans and Central Americans, entered the United States without finishing high school.
Their success stories are important, the researchers say, because they indicate the way forward for a generation that will play a major role in the country’s workforce.
Those who analyze the highest-performing say they often have a natural affinity for school and an innate tendency to succeed.
Many also have parents who set high goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
But mentoring programs can also play an exceptional role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her get to college, particularly if efforts are sustained in time.
Observing low-income children whose parents don’t have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, it turns out that any intervention at any time won’t solve it, said Patricia G<0xC3><0xA1>ndara, a researcher at the University of California, Davis, who has examined Latino students.
We need to think about providing a support network for these children, from kindergarten to high school.
The federal program that funded the Graciela University tour is a useful example.
Known as GEAR UP, it provides more than $300 million a year to local school systems, to run college preparation programs, which begin when low-income students are in middle school and continue until they finish high school.
Since 1999, the program has helped more than 10 million students, with more than 60 percent attending college, according to the U.S. Department of Education.
The Iraqi Oil Ministry reaches agreements with 10 foreign oil companies.
Despite concerns over violence and political instability, the Iraqi government managed to attract major oil companies to rebuild its fragile infrastructure, during two auctions that concluded on Saturday.
The 10 agreements the Iraqi Oil Ministry reached with foreign oil companies suggest that China, Russia and European oil companies are prepared to play a leading role in the restoration of Iraq’s oil industry, mutilated by decades of war and sanctions.
U.S. companies have moved away from just two of the 10 sites under construction.
Seven U.S. companies had paid to participate in the second auction, which began on Friday.
The only one who made an offer lost.
Two U.S. companies reached agreements for leased leases in June.
The poor representation of U.S. oil giants in the opening of Iraq’s oil industry surprised analysts.
Iraq finally opened its doors after six years of war, and instead of U.S. companies, there are Asians and Europeans at the head, said Ruba Husari, editor of Iraq’s Oil Forum, an online news center.
It will be a long time before something else is on offer in Iraq.
Security concerns, heightened by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday, and political instability as the U.S. military withdraws, likely prevented U.S. oil companies from risking more vigorously in Iraq, which has the world’s third-largest crude reserves, analysts said.
U.S. companies were at a disadvantage in some cases because rivals, particularly Chinese and other government-controlled energy companies, have considerably lower labor costs and are more likely to take risks because they do not respond to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only U.S. companies to reach agreements with the ministry.
Major U.S. firms, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have tightened ties with the Iraqi Oil Ministry and have provided technical advice in recent years, have moved away empty-handed.
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main protagonists in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The National Petroleum Corporation, owned by the Chinese state, offered in more contracts than any other company and made large investments in contracts for two major oilfields.
We know that China is on the verge of becoming a major economic and technological powerhouse, the spokesman for the oil ministry, Assam Jihad, said.
We are confident that the Chinese company will be on par with its competitors and will deliver on its commitments to Iraq.
The companies pre-selected to submit proposals made offers that were then confronted with the barrel subsidy that the ministry was willing to pay to increase production above the current levels in each site.
Al Qaeda's main planner has been apparently killed in Pakistan
An alleged U.S. missile strike on the Pakistan-Afghan border is believed to have killed a major al Qaeda operations planner this week, U.S. counterterrorism officials said on Friday.
If confirmed, this would be the second deadly attack on a high-ranking terrorist leader this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arab men believed to have died on Tuesday when a pair of missiles struck his car near the town of Miran Shah in North Waziristan province, according to U.S. sources and Pakistani officials from the region.
Local authorities said the missiles were launched by an unidentified aircraft of the type operated by the CIA inside Pakistan's illegal tribal zone.
They were driving a white car, heading towards the Afghan border, when the car received the impact, a Pakistani civil intelligence agency official said, speaking on the phone from Miran Shah.
The official said the suspected local militants rushed to the site and quickly confiscated what was left of the "totally destroyed bodies."
Local authorities were unable to verify the identities of the victims, but two U.S. counterterrorism officials cited unspecified evidence that Somali was among the dead.
Somali was described as a high-ranking al Qaeda military planner, who led the terrorist group's operations outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He devoted himself to conspiring around the world, said a senior official, who spoke from anonymity, citing the delicate nature of U.S. airstrikes within Pakistani territory.
Considering its central role, this probably included conspiracy attacks against the United States and Europe.
He had a strategic guide of al Qaeda’s top command and translated it into operational patterns for potential terrorist attacks.
The second U.S. official said Somali had quickly ascended the ranks of al Qaeda and was well-connected with other extremist groups in the region.
It may not be a known name for some Americans, but that in no way diminishes the threat posed to us and our allies, the second official said.
If his death is confirmed, Somali would be the second al Qaeda or Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant faction in the tribal area, and three other high-ranking agents.
The pace of CIA-led drone strikes has declined since the summer, from an average of about six operations a month to two, according to a count in The Long War Journal, a website run by a non-profit organization.
The decline may be due to improved tactics by terrorist groups, which have taken steps to limit their vulnerability while ruthlessly killing suspected informants, the site said.
UN envoy in Kabul to resign
The top U.N. envoy to Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday he would resign in March, ending a tumultuous mandate that was hurt by allegations of widespread corruption in the U.N.-backed Afghan presidential election.
Eid’s departure comes when the Obama administration has decided to send an additional 30,000 U.S. troops to Afghanistan.
The U.N. envoy said he supports the increase, but is concerned that the U.S. schedule for the military withdrawal that begins in 18 months prompts other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the preparation of Afghan security forces and send the right signal to Afghans so they can trust the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment has to be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also pressured the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civilian officials, who collaborate with Afghanistan’s political transition.
The increase in the military sector should be reflected in the civilian sector, he said.
Eide said he was not resigning, but simply fulfilling a promise he made to his family in March 2008, to spend only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to notify the Secretary.
UN General Ban Ki-moon, so he had time to find a replacement.
What I've said is that it's better that you start looking for a successor, Eide said.
When I arrived here, there was a two-month gap between my predecessor’s departure and my arrival.
Ban has started looking for a replacement, according to UN officials.
Officials say they have been considering Staffan di Mistura, a Swedish-Italian citizen who recently led the UN mission in Baghdad, and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who previously led UN peacekeeping missions.
Eid’s position in Afghanistan was put to the test before his former delegate, Peter W. Galbraith, who accused him in September of favoring President Hamid Karzai in the country’s presidential vote and of covering evidence of mass electoral fraud.
Eide denied the indictments, but said the accusations of Galbraith, who was fired, "certainly harmed the mission, because there was already a lot of skepticism about international interference" in the election.
Eide said he proposed the appointment of a high civilian representative to coordinate assistance efforts by U.S.-led forces in Afghanistan.
He also boosted UN leadership to allow his successor to hire more personnel from the United States and other Western countries, which lend themselves to the Afghan mission, saying this would increase his confidence that his money is being used properly.
Eide expressed frustration at the limitations to his powers in Afghanistan, arguing that the cumbersome U.N. hiring regulations impaired his ability to capture talent.
That is why UN rules allowed me to recruit only one person since May, he said.
That's catastrophic and it can't go on.
Gates: Iran will face additional sanctions
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said on Friday that world powers would soon impose "significant additional sanctions" against Iran for its failure to engage in talks on its nuclear ambitions.
Gates, addressing a group of about 300 U.S. troops in northern Iraq, during a week-long trip to war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, remained important to the prospect of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There are no good options in Iran, he said, in response to a soldier’s question about the likelihood of such an event.
One of the things that matters to me is that, if we have learned something from Iraq over the last six years, it is the inherent unpredictability of war.
The Obama administration is considering a package of sanctions aimed at Iran’s military and political elite, but Gates noted that some sanctions could also affect the Iranian population in general.
He argued that it would be necessary "a package of incentives and disincentives", "to persuade the Iranian government that they would actually be less safe with nuclear weapons", because "their people will suffer enormously" the sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the administration joined European leaders to warn that Iran will face “credible” consequences if its nuclear program does not fully comply with the directions of the UN Security Council and its nuclear control body, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists that it wants to develop nuclear knowledge only for peaceful purposes.
In talks in Geneva on Oct. 1, he said he would renegotiate the restriction of his nuclear program and agree to leave a substantial portion of his enriched uranium stockpile, in exchange for the fuel desperately needed for a medical research reactor.
The administration has pushed for such an agreement, as a way to build trust between the two parties and gain time for negotiations.
But since then, Iran seems to have moved away from tentative agreements, in part, experts say, because the Iranian command is divided in relation to the possibility of committing to the United States.
Frankly, I believe Iran’s hardening with the international community on some proposals they actually accepted in early October has united the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, in a way that has not been so in terms of significant additional sanctions against the Iranians, Gates said.
President Obama has set a deadline for Iran to respond to proposals before rethinking other options, including continuing what Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called “devastating sanctions.”
In a statement made in New York, Iran’s mission to the United Nations denounced what it called Thursday “unfounded and baseless accusations” by some members of the Security Council on Iran’s nuclear activities, and said it has the will to continue long-term talks with the United States and five other world powers, “to achieve one goal.”
Gates, who was to return to Washington last Friday, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al-Maliki in the morning before flying to the oil-rich Kurdish region of Iraq to meet with troops in Kirkuk and Kurdish officials in Irbil.
Tensions remain high between the Kurds and the Arab majority of Iraq, particularly with regard to borders, property rights and co-participation.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential for the conflict, to avoid any delays in U.S. projects, to reduce the number of U.S. troops from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also sought to alleviate Kurdish anxiety over the pending reduction. U.S. officials quoted Gates’ words to Massoud Barzani, the president of the Kurdistan Regional Government: “We will preserve their security, prosperity and autonomy within a unified Iraq.
We will not abandon them.”
In an aging China, a change of course
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters sermoning them about the fact that “Mother Earth is too tired to support more children” and “one more baby means one more grave.”
They learned the lesson so well that when officials of the Shanghai government, alarmed by the low birth rate and the aging population of their city, suddenly changed course this summer and began to encourage young couples to have more than one child, their reaction was instantaneous and firm: No way.
We have already given all our time and energy to just one child.
We have nothing left for a second, said Wang, 31, a human resource manager with an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years after China’s one-child policy was introduced, creating two generations of notoriously rude children, malevolent single children, affectionately dubbed “small emperors,” a demographic crisis is emerging in the country.
The average birth rate has plummeted to 1.8 children per couple, compared to six when the policy became effective, according to the Division.
UN demographic, while the number of residents aged 60 and over is projected to exploit from 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 percent by 2050, this is well above the global average of about 20 percent.
The imbalance is worse in the rich coastal cities with highly cultivated populations, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and over accounted for nearly 22 percent of Shanghai’s registered residents, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai Family Planning and Municipal Population Commission, said that fertile couples must have babies to “help reduce the proportion of the aging population and mitigate a future labor shortage.”
Shanghai is about to be "as old (not as rich, though) as developed countries like Japan and Sweden," he said.
Gradual relief
Written in the country's constitution in 1978, China's one-child policy is possibly the most controversial mandate ever introduced by the Communist Party.
Couples who violate politics face huge fines, up to three times their annual salary in some areas, and job discrimination.
Chinese officials have endorsed the policy for their contribution to avoiding critical pressure on their natural resources, while human rights defenders have denounced abuses in imposing the policy.
In rural areas, some officials have forced pregnant women with a second child to undergo abortions.
In addition, many couples have had abortions depending on the sex of the fetus, leading to a high unnatural male-female ratio.
In recent years, demographic officials have gradually softened their stance on one-child policy.
In 2004, they allowed more exceptions to the rule, including urban residents, members of ethnic minorities, and cases in which both husband and wife are single children, and in 2007 attenuated many of their hardline slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at Beijing University’s Institute of Demographic Research, said central government officials have recently been debating even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the spouses is a single child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage more births.
Nearly evening in the morning, posters ordering families to have a single child were replaced by copies of regulations detailing who would be fit to have a second child and how to apply for a permit.
The city government sent family planning officials and volunteers to visit couples at their homes and slide leaflets under the doors.
It has also promised to provide emotional and financial guidance to those who have chosen to have more than one child.
Family planning officials say the response has been very unsurprising.
Disappointing response
While officials from a rural city on the outskirts of Shanghai say they have seen a moderate increase in requests from couples who want a second child after the campaign’s launch, the more urban districts do not indicate any change.
The municipality of Huinan, with a population of 115,000, for example, is still receiving only four to five applications per month.
Disappointed Shanghai officials say that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city in 2010 is still expected to reach only around 165,000, slightly higher than in 2009, but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee of the Caolu municipality in Shanghai, said financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people don’t want more children.
They want to give their best to their first child, he said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they would love to have two children and are legally qualified to do so.
But like many Chinese, they only have insufficient health and life insurance provided by the government.
Without a social protection network, they argue, that option would be irresponsible.
People in the West mistakenly see single-child policy as a matter of rights, said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant from the couple's first child.
Yes, we're being robbed of the possibility of having more than one child.
But the problem is not just a political issue.
It's the money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons for their doubts.
Wang, the human resources manager, said he wanted a unique son because she was too: “We were the center of our families and we were used to everyone taking care of us.
We’re not used to taking care of others and we really don’t want to take care of others.”
Chen Zijian, 42, owner of a translation agency, explained it more strongly.
For parents with two middle-class careers that reduce the birth rate, he said, it’s about being successful enough to be selfish.
People between the ages of 20 and 30 grew up watching their parents struggle during the early days of China’s experiment with capitalism and don’t want that kind of life for themselves, he said.
Even a single child requires a lot of time from parents, he said.
A mother has to give up at least two years of her social life.
Then there are questions of space, “they have to remodel their apartment,” and the strategist “must have a resume prepared for the best daycares when the child is 9 months old.”
Most of his friends are willing to face this once, Chen said, but not two.
Ours is the first generation with the highest standard of living, he said.
We don’t want to make too many sacrifices.
A UN group outlines a plan to reduce emissions
The UN-sponsored climate conference, characterized so far by challenging postures and mutual recriminations, caught renewed attention on Friday with the release of a document that foresees ambitious greenhouse gas reductions over the next 40 years, with industrialized nations carrying the bulk of the burden on their shoulders.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, highlighted the remaining obstacles and highlighted the way forward.
But it was seen as a major breakthrough in a timeless negotiation, with more than 100 world leaders coming to Copenhagen next week.
Developed by an ad hoc UN working group, the text does not talk about how much money rich countries would give to the poor to cope with global warming in the short and long term.
And this offers a variety of options for key questions, including how developed economies and major emerging economies would cut their coal production, and what would be the limit of the global temperature rise that political strategists would be willing to tolerate.
This gives a lot of flexibility to the process, said John Coequyt, senior representative in Washington for the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who drafted the six-page document, summarized a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what top UN climate official Yvo de B<0xC3><0xB3>er described as “the great panorama.”
It shows the profiles for a possible deal, in which industrialized nations would collectively cut their emissions by 25 to 45 percent by 2020, compared to 1990 levels, while major developing countries would reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 percent during the same period.
Together, countries would cut emissions by 50 to 95 percent by 2050.
The European Union also spurred talks on Friday, promising to provide $3.6 billion annually over the next three years to help poorer countries adapt to the impact of climate change, from floods and droughts to deforestation.
However, the same class of verbal fireworks that dominated the conversations last week were presented on Friday.
U.S. climate special envoy Todd Stern rejected claims calling for mandatory greenhouse gas emissions cuts for industrialized countries, compared to volunteers from some of the major emerging economies, if not funded by the developed world.
The maneuver indicated that the Obama administration is taking a harder line with China, with respect to what the Bush administration officials did just two years ago.
The United States will not make an agreement without major developing countries moving forward and taking action, Stern said, who also lamented that the text did not do enough to ensure the cuts could be verified by external observers.
Stern made his remarks an hour after Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister He Yafei said the top U.S. climate negotiator lacked “common sense,” or was “very irresponsible” for saying earlier this week that the U.S. would not help China economically cope with global warming.
With the future economic trajectory of the world’s major powers at stake, fault lines have erupted both within the developing world and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current battle is both to save individual economies and to save the planet, with China and the United States facing their respective obligations, while the poorest nations insist that the twenty-four most influential countries in the world are ignoring the scientific imperative to take the most courageous action.
Ricardo Ulate, a Costa Rican delegate, said it is not surprising that major powers are debating who should be spending on limiting greenhouse gases, even as vulnerable countries have become more aggressive looking to contain the big emitters responsible for their actions.
This is clearly a game where a new economic hegemony is being developed, said Ulate, who also works as a regional climate change advisor for Mexico and Central America, for International Conservation.
Some of the countries most vulnerable to the impact of climate change indicated they would continue to push for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although most key participants say the talks will at least result in a political agreement.
The Small Island States Alliance, which has 43 members, drafted a 24-page preliminary treaty proposal early on Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who heads international climate negotiations on behalf of the European Commission, said the push by small island nations has “put political pressure on the entire political process,” in part because they are now unified and demand action from emerging economies such as China and India.
The talks took on a new urgency as delegates focused on the fact that they must resolve most of the exceptional issues before heads of government come to close a deal.
High-level officials, such as Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and Chinese Deputy Minister, came down from the planes and ran to the halls of the Bella Center, to closed-door meetings and press conferences, to be able to delineate the claims that will be arbitrated over the next week.
The absolute mess of the meeting (where 13,000 people enter and leave the convention center every day, guitar-playing activists present nightly shows mocking the countries they think are selling themselves, and preliminary proposals are passed hand in hand instead of via mail) poses a challenge.
The intensity only builds: almost all the key ministers are here right now, and on Wednesday 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We are entering the major leagues, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, vice president for the global policy of International Conservation.
The heavyweights are coming.
The first train 225 km/h from Britain redefines that feeling on Monday
At 5.13 a.m. on Monday morning, a whistle will pierce the darkness to signal a train departure that marks a revolution for travel in Britain.
The country’s first high-speed intercity train will reach 225 km/h, when passing as a ray from Ashford, Kent, to St Panrcas station in London, covering 93 kilometers in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Secretary of Transport, will then be joined by Lady Kelly Holmes, aboard the first Javelin intercity service outside London.
He expects the new service to finally connect Britain to an international network of fast, reliable trains and connect the major conurbations of the Midlands, the North and Scotland to London.
The neglected secluded areas would become prosperous suburbs, business travel times would be shortened, and changing planes and cars to the railroad would reduce national carbon emissions, as well as alleviate congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three main political parties believe in this vision.
But the tens of billions of pounds needed to build a new national rail network, the inevitable battle of planning and fears about environmental damage, can still curb Britain’s high-speed lines.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to provide the government with a feasibility study, will deliver its report to Lord Adonis on December 30, the Times reported.
This will provide you with a detailed itinerary of the next planned step for the high-speed network.
The new line linking London to the West Midlands will be drawn within a five-metre radius in urban areas and areas where the environmental impact may be controversial.
In rural areas, the plan will be drawn within a 25-metre radius of a definitive route.
HS2 is also expected to set three options for a wider high-speed network heading north.
Lord Adonis will respond in the spring.
The preferred option being proposed is a Y-shaped configuration, in which a single high-speed line would reach the West Midlands.
The line would be divided into or near Birmingham, with one branch heading west from the Peninsula to Manchester and Scotland, and another north-east to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would enter Scotland.
“It looks like this will be the most beneficial option,” said a member of the railroad.
Once completed, travel times between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 2 hours and 40 minutes.
The first section, which would not be opened before 2025, would allow passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to just over an hour today.
The proposals would allow the trains to travel at 402 km/h, making the British network the fastest in Europe.
The initial track is designed to support trains of 400 meters in length, capable of transporting 1,100 people.
At least 18 trains could operate every hour on a London-Birmingham line.
This means that a London terminal would be needed capable of receiving 20,000 passengers per hour.
Considering the capital’s space constraints, an existing station is expected to be expanded to fit the high-speed network.
Railway industry experts argue that only St Pancras International or Euston station offers that potential.
Lord Adonis will announce if he believes the scheme should proceed, but a broad public consultation and planning procedures mean that no final decision will be made until after a general election.
Even if it started the work, the network would have to be built into sections.
At first, trains would be forced to leave the fast lines on existing rails north of Birmingham, keeping travel times between London and Scotland above three hours.
This is considered the crucial point needed to ensure a change from aircraft to trains, a benchmark for the rail revolution.
Taxpayers Face Mortgage for <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 Orangutan from a Conservative
Alan Duncan, the Conservative Party spokesman, charged the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year for the cost of an orange tree he built in his constituency’s house.
The party’s prison spokesman, who was degraded by David Cameron for complaining that deputies lived “of rations,” raised his mortgage by <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 to build an oak-framed extension at his second home in Rutland.
They allowed the taxpayer to charge the additional interest, adding hundreds of pounds a month.
Authorities in the House of Commons approved the applications at the time and have not been consulted by Sir Thomas Legg, who leads a review of the expenses of the members. Last night Mr Duncan said that the applications "could not be clearer or simpler".
Mr. Duncan, one of the richest Members of Parliament, owns a two-storey house in a village in his constituency of Rutland and Melton.
The nearby houses have been sold for almost a million pounds.
The ground floor includes a kitchen, living room and dining room, but the fee office agreed that Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year he added a greenhouse to the house, described in the plans as an "orange".
Neighbors described it as "a greenhouse for entertainment."
Mr. Duncan was not asked to make any reference to the increase in the loan, during a recent investigation by the House Committee on Standards and Privileges into his previous mortgage agreements.
Last month, the committee acquitted him of violating the rules, following an investigation into his expenses.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan changed the legal guarantee for a mortgage of <0xC2><0xA3>271,406 from his London property to the house of his constituency, which he had bought in 1991, the year before he became a deputy.
The documents released this week show that Mr. Duncan was applying for approximately <0xC2><0xA3>1,400 a month in mortgage interest, until March last year.
In April, their applications increased to more than <0xC2><0xA3>1,800 per month.
Mr. Duncan’s mortgage interest rate did not change at the time, suggesting that the entire increase would fund the <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 loan.
The standard variable mortgage rate for the BRE fell from 7.94% in December 2007 to 4% in March of this year, the rate it is now.
The most recent document issued by the House of Commons authorities shows that Mr. Duncan was still applying for <0xC2><0xA3>1,250 per month in May.
Duncan lost his job as president of the opposition House in September, after a covert reporter filmed him saying deputies had to survive “rations” after the spending scandal.
“Basically this is being nationalized, you have to live by rations and be treated like shit.”
He stated: “I spend my money in my garden and ask for a small fraction based on what is appropriate.
And I could ask for much more, but I don't."
The MP, a millionaire for his former profession as an oil trader, was first questioned about his expenses in May, when it turned out he had requested thousands of pounds for his garden, before agreeing with the salary office that this “could be considered excessive.”
An activist dug a hole in Mr. Duncan’s lawn in the shape of the sterling pound symbol after it was revealed that he had claimed 4,000 pounds for three years.
Last night, when asked about the mortgage increase, Mr. Duncan said: "It was for primordial improvements, approved both by the salary office and later by Legg."
He added: “It’s not about avoiding and criminalizing or violating the rules or whatever.
This is absolutely within the limits, according to the rules, authorized and all.
It couldn’t be any clearer or simpler.”
Come those who have faith, to see the calendar of the Advent of the palapa of Brighton Beach
Brighton’s palates have found a new impetus for the winter months in an interactive Advent calendar.
In addition, an alternative religious group that encourages spiritual exploration through creativity, invited 24 owners to decorate their palapas for each day of December, using villains as their theme.
The event began on December 1, with guests who could see the last palapa from 5.30 pm to 6.30 pm every day, with cakes filled and punches served for free.
The villains chosen so far include Vi Tres Barcos, Oh Ven, Oh Ven, Emanuel and La Primera Navidad, where the palapa presents the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, a 50-year-old TV marketing assistant from Hove, is an unpaid clergyman from the Diocese of Chichester and the leader of Beyond.
He said, “We want religion to be more relevant to people, in a post-Christian society.”
“Why do we as a Church expect people to come to an old strange building? I think the Church should come to people and celebrate in exciting ways.
“The idea of the palapa advent calendar began as a conversation with some friends during a dinner.
Brighton is an incredibly creative and vibrant place and we are trying to prove and represent that through spirituality.”
Massive climate mobilization in Copenhagen and around the world
Tens of thousands of protesters on Saturday protested for an ambitious and binding agreement to fight global warming, worldwide and in Copenhagen, where police arrested several hundred people.
About 30,000 people, according to the police; hundreds of thousands, according to the organizers, paraded through the frozen Danish capital in demand of an agreement that the United Nations Conference on Climate Change should reach by Friday, which would come into force on January 1, 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, the Danish president of the Climate Conference, the growing global climate mobilization represented by these demonstrations contributed to the “political price” of a failure in Copenhagen being very high.
The incidents erupted shortly after the start of the demonstration in the Danish capital, when a group of 300 people, all dressed in black, broke counters with bricks and hammers, an AFP reporter reported.
The riot police intervened quickly and firmly.
Police announced the arrest of a total of 600 to 700 people, according to them, especially members of the "Black Blocs", ultra-violent groups that had already acted during the NATO summit in Strasbourg, east of France, last April.
The Climate Justice Action (CJA) coalition, one of the organizers of the demonstration, denounced the conditions in which hundreds of militants were detained “without distinctions,” stressing that a hundred of them “were immobilized on the street Saturday night, swollen and seated despite the intense cold.”
The rather peaceful demonstration left Parliament and headed for the Bella Center, the seat of the negotiations.
The protesters stopped about 500 yards from the building without attempting to enter.
The former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu, led a candle-covered vigil.
Most of the protesters arrived by bus and train from major European cities, but numerous Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, were also present as were some Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, most with celestial rainbows responded by forming a first morning concentration in Copenhagen to the call of Friends of the Earth to form "blue tides" for "justice and climate".
Today we take to the streets to ask for compensation for the ecological debt in favor of the South, said Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino activist of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We cannot continue to say: there is time, said Beninese singer Angélique Kidjo.
In Africa, there are rivers that dry up, watercourses that you can walk through like never before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, created in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the anti-globalization movement approached environmental organizations.
French MEP José Bové, a figure of anti-globalization, explained that he came to Copenhagen to "unite climate justice and social justice": "Today the fight against global warming is not opposed to the fight for another world".
The Asia-Pacific region, which brings together numerous islands very vulnerable to warming, gave the initial dots to the demonstrations.
According to the organizers, about 50,000 people took to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, more than a hundred people, mostly students, paraded red dresses and wearing sunglasses with slogans in favor of solar energy.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, as well as in Canada, there were concentrations of hundreds of protesters demanding to act vigorously against climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organized by the "350" network brought together hundreds of people, especially in Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (North), Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (East).
In Geneva, dozens of people were concentrated.
Separatist Abkhazia elected president, although Georgia denounces "fraud"
On Saturday, Abkhazia, a pro-Russian separatist region recognized by Moscow more than a year ago, elected president; however, Tbilisi denounces "fraud".
Some 131,000 people were called to participate in the first post-Russian-Georgian war election in August 2008 by the control of South Ossetia, another Georgian separatist region recognized by Russia.
The election tables closed at 5 p.m. GMT.
According to officials of the Abkhazia Electoral Commission, participation was 58% a few hours before the closure.
The first provisional results would be announced on Saturday night to Sunday.
The five running candidates, including outgoing president Sergei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which rejected the vote scrutiny.
These elections are a farce.
For his part, Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili "deplores that Abkhazia has fallen under the total Russian occupation," said his spokesperson, Manana Manjgaladzé.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela recognized the independence of this territory of 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world considers it part of Georgia illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After his separation from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict that ended with several thousand deaths, Abkhazia tries to prove through this election that he is ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage of our new life, our new era as an independent state, said Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian who claimed to have voted for Bagapch.
She was among the voters who headed to the electoral table at a school in the capital, Soukhoumi, a beautiful white building with palm trees at the entrance.
The theme of Russian domination is the central theme of the presidential election in this region with sumptuous landscapes, on the shores of the Black Sea.
Large paintings show Bagapch alongside Russian President and Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, in different places in this small territory of 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, in the west of the country, the head of the district, Beslan Archba, warmly welcomed the Russian officials who came to control the development of the scrutiny.
In a brief ceremony, he said: “We, the people of Abkhazia, thank Moscow’s support, and very particularly, the decision to recognize Abkhazia’s independence.
I hope his country will be quickly recognized by the United Nations, said Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian parliament, lifting his glass of vodka.
For its part, the opposition represented in the election by former vice-president Raoul Khadjimba and two businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticizes the agreements signed with Moscow last year, as one that cedes to Russia control of the abysmal railways for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, argues that he does not support the current power or the opposition.
It takes a 50% majority plus one vote to win the election.
If no candidate reaches this threshold, a second round will be organized two weeks later.
Climate: events in the world, incidents in Copenhagen
On Saturday, tens of thousands of people took to the streets of the world to demand an ambitious and binding agreement at the Copenhagen Climate Change Conference, where police, on alert, arrested more than 700 people around an imposing demonstration.
Some 30,000 people, according to the police; hundreds of thousands, according to the organizers, paraded in the afternoon amid the cold of the Danish capital, which hosts delegates from 193 countries until December 18, in search of an agreement that should come into force on January 1, 2013.
The protest, quite peaceful, left Parliament and took to the Bella Center, where negotiations are taking place.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the center, without attempting to enter.
The former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu, led a candle-covered vigil.
A few moments after the start of the demonstration, a group of hundreds of people, all dressed in black, broke counters with bricks and hammers, an AFP reporter reported.
The riot police quickly surrounded them and intervened firmly, dragging several of them to the floor.
Police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people, saying they were mainly members of the "Black Blocs", ultraviolent groups that had already acted during the NATO summit in Strasbourg, eastern France, last April.
At the end of the afternoon, a police officer was injured in the jaw with a pad, and four cars were set on fire near a busy house during the incidents that led to the arrest of about twenty people, according to police.
The extremist groups did not take their eyes off, police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen warned, as the helicopters of the law enforcement forces flew over the area.
Most of the protesters, who arrived by bus and train from the major cities of Germany, London, Amsterdam, even Milan, were of European origin.
But many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, were also present as were some Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, most with celestial rainbows responded by forming a first morning concentration in Copenhagen to the call of Friends of the Earth to form "blue tides" for "justice and climate".
Today we take to the streets to ask for compensation for the ecological debt in favor of the South, said Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino activist of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.

Oxfam, along with former UN refugee commissioner Mary Robinson, who was to lead the crowd, mobilized several celebrities, including Danish model Helena Christensen.
The Asia-Pacific region, which brings together numerous islands very vulnerable to warming, gave the initial dots to the demonstrations.
According to the organizers, about 5,000 people took to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, hundreds of people, mostly students, protested in red clothes and wearing handkerchiefs with slogans in favor of solar energy in front of the Philippine capital city hall.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, concentrations of hundreds of protesters were formed demanding action against climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organized by the "350" network brought together hundreds of people, especially in Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (North), Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (East).
In Geneva, dozens of people were concentrated.
The subject of history and geography is reinforced by the reform of secondary education, according to Chatel
The Minister of National Education, Luc Chatel, said in an interview that will be broadcast in the Informative of Sunday (JDD, according to his French acronym) that history and geography would be "strengthened" from the reform of general secondary education, despite being removed from compulsory education in the second year of high school.
From now on, all first-year students will have four hours a week and the same program for a shared common culture, Chatel says.
For the Minister, “it is enough with hypocrisy” because, according to him, “branch C is no longer a scientific branch”, but “in general, it summons the best students”.
The General and Literary Teaching branches cannot be sub-branches of the C, he goes on to stress even: "Neither did I hear that historians or intellectuals were outraged by having eliminated history and geography in second grade in tech schools."
An IFOP poll published Saturday in L'Humanité revealed that about seven out of ten (69%) French disapprove of the government's project to eliminate the compulsory teaching of history-geography in second grade C. Numerous intellectuals and teachers, the left and some elected representatives of this creed also believed.
Instead, the Minister added that "there is no talk" of eliminating philosophy from the C-Bachelor's Secondary Program.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform of teacher training, while 16 organizations (students and unions) called for a mobilization day on Tuesday to protest the project, which, according to them, sacrifices the pedagogical training of future teachers.
In Master 2 (M2), at the beginning of the year, they will give an admission test that will be aimed at their discipline, and at the end of the year, an admission test about their ability to teach, the Minister explained.
In addition, they will do real-life internships during the M2 year, after which they will be a first year in front of the classroom as internship teachers.
If you do all the proposed internships before the contest, you will already have a great experience in front of the classroom, that is, more than 300 hours, he added.
Finally, the Minister notes that he will propose "the individual right to education, which does not exist in national education".
He also confirmed the project to remove the school map "before 2012".
At the Normal High School, experts will have 15 minutes to explain climate change in a convincing way.
Fifteen minutes to talk about the challenges of the Copenhagen summit, a challenge accepted on Saturday morning by Jean Jouzel, vice-president of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IGEC) invited by the Ulm Higher Normal School.
Jean Jouzel, also Nobel Peace Prize laureate, inaugurated the Ernest conference wheel, a day consisting of a series of fifteen-minute expert presentations, filmed and open to the public, an AFP reporter said.
We wanted to do something that attracts people and conveys the desire to know more, explained Edouard Hannezzo, 22, in the framework of the conference, one of the organizers of this day called as the students baptized the fish from the school pond.
We selected about twenty participants from among the experts in their discipline and selected them on their charismatic side, he said.
About global warming, “we can talk hours, but we can also talk about key targets in a few minutes,” Jean Jouzel, who exposed without notes but with the help of graphics in front of about fifty people, told AFP.
It is part of our scientific role, he stressed, hoping that the public will understand that "the Copenhagen conference is based on a very serious scientific dossier."
The videos filmed during those conferences will be online on the school’s website from December 15.
The next "Ernest" day is scheduled for February, followed by other two-monthly ones.
Delay in payments: Disgust among prison guards, action planned
The prison guard unions called for a "general mobilization" on Friday to demand payment before the end of the year, premiums and overtime, which was postponed until January for budgetary reasons.
The Penitentiary Workers’ Force (2nd Guards Union) asked off-duty personnel to join the demonstration on Tuesday morning in front of the prisons and “block them” to report the theft of their possessions.
The CGT penitentiary (3rd trade union of the profession) invites them to "meet in general assemblies in the different prisons to achieve mass mobilization", as it calls "shameful and unacceptable" the non-compliance of payment in December of the "extra hours, night premiums, Sundays and public holidays" work.
And the first union of guards, the Federal Autonomous Union of Prisons (Ufap/Unsa), "calls for general mobilization (...) in order to increase discontent and anger".
The Penitentiary Administration Directorate and the Ministry of Justice explain that overtime increased significantly in 2009 and not all were accounted for, but they say the balance will be paid in January.
At the end of the day, the Chancellery reported that Mich<0xC3><0xA8>le Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to the guard unions guaranteeing that the payment would be made next month.
I have no doubt about the efforts made by the staff for the functioning and modernization of our prison system, writes the Minister of Justice in this letter.
I called on the Directorate of the Penitentiary Administration to immediately implement a set of measures to ensure that this situation generated by a poor assessment of the number of overtime does not occur again in the future.
The December salary will then be low, except for management staff who enjoy the benefit of the famous function and objective premiums, and who "always blame budget requirements," Ufap/Unsa lamented.
It’s a real scandal, Marseille’s interregional union FO said outraged, announcing its decision to boycott “all meetings and calls” to a new order.
Staff will not come to work on the corresponding Sundays and public holidays if those in October are not paid in December, the same will happen with overtime, also threatens FO Rh<0xC3><0xB4>ne-Alpes-Auvergne.
At a time when our tasks and missions are increasing without taking more effective, it is more than regrettable to dare to attack the salaries of the staff, estimates the CGT prison in Bordeaux.
According to trade unions, not all regions are the same, as some have more luck than others.
But anyway, the result is not the expected, said Ufap Secretary General Jean-Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Forget.
For Christmas, Obama says he makes “better gifts” than the ones he receives
U.S. President Barack Obama, who will celebrate his first family Christmas at the White House, confessed to the famous television host Oprah Winfrey, who came to a simple conclusion about the gifts: “I make better gifts than the ones I receive.”
During a special interview that ABC will broadcast on Sunday night, the President and his wife Michelle explain how they plan to celebrate the New Year's Eve parties in their new and prestigious residence.
Even Bo, the family’s small four-legged companion, will be on the move.
Santa also loves Bo, said Michelle Obama, clarifying that the dog will "of course" receive a gift, according to the program's excerpts transmitted in advance.
And Michelle Obama disagreed with her husband’s claims about the quality of the gifts she receives: “In no way, last year I made you beautiful gifts,” she said provoking the president.
True, he was forced to admit it before he humbly replied pointing to the First Lady’s pearl necklace: “Who gave you that?”
During the one-hour interview, in a relaxed atmosphere with the famous cheerleader who devotedly supported Barack Obama’s presidential campaign, the president and his wife also remembered his favorite childhood gifts.
Barack Obama recalled a two-speed bike, as well as a basketball that his Kenyan father, who he rarely saw, gave him for Christmas.
I remember that time when my dad came to see us at Christmas and gave me a basketball, the president said.
Only many years later, I learned that he had given me that ball.
For her part, the First Lady recalled her dollhouse.
I had no idea how to organize a house, so I put all the furniture online against the wall, instead of accommodating them around the house, however, I loved that doll house, said Michelle Obama.
Johnny Hallyday again operated, RTL claims to be in a coma induced
Johnny Hallyday was intervened again in Los Angeles due to major "injuries" stemming from an operation in France, but the situation is "under control" according to his supporters, while RTL claims the singer was subjected to an induced coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was again intervened on the night of Wednesday to Thursday at the Cedars-Sina<0xC3><0xAF> hospital in Los Angeles where some doctors checked for "injuries resulting from the operation" of herniated discs performed in Paris on Nov. 26, his press service in that same city noted.
However, the singer's press service tried to convey peace of mind stating that the situation was "under control", and reported that a new medical part would communicate within the next 48 hours.
According to RTL, sponsor of the singer's last tour, Johnny Hallyday agreed, however, to be subjected to an induced coma to avoid "pain and complications".
In less than 48 hours when the patient wakes up, we will be more sure about their condition, RTL adds.
The press service, interrogated by AFP, did not confirm or comment on the information.
RTL also claims that “according to some sources” no cannula would have been introduced to it after the first operation in Paris.
The rocker had been operated on at the international Monceau Park clinic due to a disc hernia.
The intervention, scheduled a few days ago, was practiced by neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known physician in the artistic environment.
On Thursday night, Delajoux refused to comment on the information transmitted by RTL.
Singer Johnny Hollyday entered the Cedars-Sina<0xC3><0xAF> hospital in Los Angeles on Monday for an infection derived from the intervention carried out by Delajoux.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, a close friend of Johnny Hallyday, explained Thursday on RTL that his friend was going through "a bad time," but said he was doing "no problem" because the rocker is "a fighter."
He called me just before I went to Los Angeles, and I told him that it was nonsense to get twelve hours on a plane after such an operation, it is not possible, said Eddy Mitchell.
On Wednesday night, the musician's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, sought to reassure by stating that Johnny Hallyday, "reacted satisfactorily to antibiotics" and that the infection was "controlled".
Camus said he had spoken to Laeticia, the musician's wife, and that he had not noticed any particular concerns.
But the singer's health problems have multiplied since July when he was interned for nine days following a fall on his yacht.
Two months later, to general surprise, Johnny Hallyday revealed he had been operated on from a "colon cancer", after a slight infection.
At the end of September, the singer resumed, as planned, his long "Gira 66", presented as his farewell tour.
But since then, every health problem has been overreported, and fans and journalists have noted the musician’s difficulties in moving on stage.
In mid-November, his associates even had to deny a new internment.
Euro-2009/short pool: Bousquet's first title in his favorite distance
Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, a triple medalist at the 2009 World Long Pool Championships, won an international title on Thursday in a distance for which he feels particular affection, 50 m free, during Euro-2009 in a short pool in Istanbul.
On the first day of this competition where polyurethane swimsuits were allowed for the last time, only three world records were exceeded when many more were actually expected.
One was improved by the Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto in 200 m 4 styles; and the other two, by the Russian in relief 4 x 50 m 4 styles (male).
A penalty for Bousquet, who coveted the world record in 50 m free, mark he owns in a long pool (20.94).
In one of the two queen swim distances, in the 50 m freestyle, the 28-year-old Frenchman scored 20''53 during a final where ten swimmers competed instead of eight as usual, an international first.
Bousquet went ahead of Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but failed to lower the world record (20.30), as he had planned.
We can always aspire to something better and, in that case, I already said that if the world record was within my reach, I would try to achieve it.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers wore polyurethane swimsuits that from January 1 will be banned.
These swimmers, originating from 238 world records since February 2008, end their epic in Istanbul, where they competed for the first time in 1999 for the same test.
This time the use of swimsuits did not help the German Paul Biedermann, double world champion in the long pool this summer in Rome, consecutive world records.
The young swimmer did not manage to drop his mark in 400 m free (3:32.77), however, he scored with the second best time of his career (3:34.55), against Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
I didn’t give in to this race.
I knew that this time I was not going to be able to beat a world record, but I managed to defend my title and fulfilled my mission.
Lobintsev will be a tough rival in the future, Biedermann explained.
U.S.: A sarcophagus panel owned by Zola sold for $1.5 million
A panel of Roman sarcophagus belonging to French writer Emile Zola was sold on Thursday for $1.5 million, well above the estimated price, Sotheby's art dealer announced.
This panel, 2 meters long by 63 cm high, dates from the 3rd century AD, and its price had been estimated at between $150,000 and $250,000.
The marble "representing four dionysian scenes, in a sophisticated architectural setting, surrounded by satirists and drunken women, is an unusual piece, as there are only four or five in the world," Florent Heintz, vice president of art auctions of ancient Rome and Egypt, told AFP on Tuesday.
It was sold between a hundred lots.
The sale continues, but so far, this lot was the most offered by buyers, no doubt, Dan Abernethy, a spokesman for Sotheby's, told AFP.
Only a few days ago, it was discovered that marble was an acquisition by Emile Zola.
For almost 300 years, the panel was part of the famous Borges family collection in Rome, then appeared successively in the house of the French actress Cécile Sorel, as an element of her bath in his private Parisian mansion, and in the house of Paul Raynaud, minister of the Third French Republic and president of the Council for a short time.
For about fifty years, his whereabouts were uncertain.
Reviewing the Louvre database, Florent Heintz discovered that this panel was part of an "Emile Zola succession" opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of "Thér<0xC3><0xA8>se Raquin" and the fresco of the "Rougon-Macquart".
Honduras aborted Zelaya's departure to Mexico
On Thursday, Mexico estimated that conditions were not given to move into its territory to the overthrown president of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, whom the coup government denied salvo conduct.
At the moment, after a phone conversation in the evening with President Zelaya, everything seems to indicate that there is no possibility of making the move, said Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa.
The Mexican government plane, which arrived in El Salvador on Wednesday to take Zelaya, returned to its place of origin, according to a source from the Directorate-General for Migration.
In order to grant him a bailout, the coup government wanted to force Zelaya to "resign" and seek political asylum abroad.
But the overthrown president refused because he wanted to come to Mexico as a guest chief of state.
The coup government “suffered a new defeat by asking me to resign from my post ... they wanted me to resign,” Zelaya said Thursday on Radio Globo, in which he has often made statements since the start of the five-month political crisis in the Central American country.
Here I can stay ten years, I have my guitar, added the deposed president, refugee at the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa for two and a half months playing a few chords.
The Mexican embassy has submitted a request for safe passage, but unfortunately we were unable to accept it because it did not contain an asylum request, Interior Minister of the coup government, Oscar Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l Matute, told Honduran radio HRN on Wednesday.
I will not seek asylum from any country, Manuel Zelaya replied in an interview on the Telesur chain, which is based in Caracas.
If I leave Honduras, I will do so as president of the Honduran people.
Rumors of Zelaya's departure on Wednesday mobilized supporters of the deposed president, who gathered around the Brazilian embassy, heavily besieged by the military.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim has criticized the coup government’s position.
That reflects the marginal nature of this government against international norms, he said.
Zelaya, who had approached the socialist president of Venezuela, Hugo Chavez, was overthrown on June 28, the day he had organized a referendum to prepare for his re-election, rejected by the Supreme Court, the army and Congress.
From his exile in Costa Rica, he surprisingly returned on September 21 and took refuge in the Brazilian embassy.
If he leaves, he will be arrested and will have to answer to the court for the crime of “high treason,” according to the coup government.
The de facto president, Roberto Micheletti, managed to organize a presidential election on November 29 to replace Zelaya.
In the controversial scrutiny, elected Porfirio Lobo. This election was recognized by the United States, but questioned by countries of Latin America, such as Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil.
Three days later, Congress voted massively against Zelaya's return to power until his term ended on January 27.
Wall Street rises, U.S. trade balance fuels optimism
The New York Stock Exchange closed up on Thursday, U.S. trade balance figures are a faithful witness to the economic reactivation of both the U.S. and its partners: the Dow Jones won 0.67%; and the Nasdaq, 0.33%.
According to the final figures at the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 68, 78 points to 10,405.83 points, and the Nasdaq, by technology component, 7.13 points to 2,190.06 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500 expanded by 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1,102.35 points.
We have received good news from different sectors of the economy, said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
But this is anecdotal, he clarified, considering that the market was focused “on the half-full glass.”
For Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors focused primarily on U.S. trade balance sheet figures, “reflecting an improvement in activity in the fourth quarter.”
The U.S. trade deficit fell 7.6% in October compared to September, to $32.9 billion.
Analysts, on the contrary, expected a deepening of the deficit.
Both imports and exports increased.
The big news is the growth of trade volumes, in particular, exports of goods, which reflect the growth of the major economies that trade with the United States, said Christopher Cornell, of the research firm Economy.com.
In contrast, last week, unemployment enrollments in the United States increased unexpectedly, 474,000 applications were filed.
But over the past four weeks, the average number of new job applicants “was the lowest in a year,” said Scott Marcouiller, of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market has fallen.
The yield of the 10-year Treasury bond rose to 3.482% versus 3.423% on Tuesday night, and the 30-year Treasury bond to 4.492% versus 4.408% on the night before.
Cuba: more than a hundred supporters of power abuse the "Damas de Blanco"
On Thursday, hundreds of supporters of Cuban power abducted the wives of political prisoners gathered in Havana for World Human Rights Day and prevented another demonstration to which a dozen dissidents were summoned.
About forty "Damas de Blanco", wives or relatives of political prisoners, were attacked in the street by supporters of the government of Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l Castro as they walked towards the center of the capital demanding the release of such detainees, an AFP journalist said.
The Yankees died, "Mercenarias!", "The street belongs to the revolutionaries!", "Viva Fidel y Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l!" the power militants held up the dissidents.
The latter were escorted by civilian-dressed agents who came to "protect" them.
A similar demonstration unleashed against the “Damas de Blanco” in Havana, with no injuries or arrests.
But in the Habanero neighborhood of Vedado, about a dozen dissidents who were also rushing to protest on Thursday for the international day of human rights, were arrested by police officers dressed as civilians, an AFP reporter said.
Agents forcibly drove vehicles up to dissidents who were abused by government supporters, according to the journalist.
In general, the arrest of dissidents in similar circumstances lasts only a few hours.
The "Damas de Blanco", awarded with the 2005 Sakharov Prize awarded by the European Parliament, had organized an unauthorized march to "request the release of all political prisoners", about 200 according to the dissent, one of its leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband, Héctor Maceda, is serving a 20-year sentence.
Maceda is part of the group of 75 Cuban dissidents imprisoned in March 2003, of whom 53 are behind bars.
The Cuban authorities call opponents “mercenaries” or “agents” for the wages of their declared enemy, the United States.
Rarely done in the media, Cuban television reported on Thursday's demonstration of government militants against the "counter-revolutionary."
Cuba, governed by a single party, the Communist Party, is constantly accused by European or American NGOs of stepping up the rights and freedoms, especially those of expression.
An alien kills an octogenarian with a knife and leaves 5 wounded in Clichy-la-Garenne
An unbalanced man with two knives killed an 80-year-old man and injured five others in downtown Clichy-la-Garenne (Highs of the Seine) on Thursday at the peak of the afternoon.
According to the first elements of the investigation, the 28-year-old aggressor would have struck an elderly man in the pharmacy or in front of him at No. 85 on Jean-Jaur<0xC3><0xA8>s Boulevard, police sources and witnesses reported.
Following the serious injuries, the man born in 1929 died in the hospital, according to a head of the Alliance police union.
Then in the pharmacy or in front of her, she attacked a pregnant woman who was with her partner.
The husband, about thirty years old, intervened and was injured.
The first two victims, seriously injured, were taken to the hospital where the elder died.
The life of the other injured, with the vital organs apparently affected, is in danger.
The pregnant woman then suffered a vomiting and was hospitalized “in a state of shock,” a police source said.
The gunman, who appeared to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, had escaped by the boulevard Jean Jaur<0xC3><0xA8>s.
Apparently by chance, he would have injured two more pedestrians: one thirty-year-old man, and another forty-year-old seriously.
At night, the scene of the crime was still unexplained.
He was armed with two butcher knives carrying crosses on his back, explained Arnaud Presse, head of the Alliance trade union in the Hautes del Seine.
Several passers-by, including young people, tried to control the alien, according to testimonies obtained by the AFP.
I saw a guy in his 30s wearing a green jacket.
Three young men tried to intercept him.
They didn’t do it because the guy was strong, explained Alberto, waiter at a nearby bar.
A crowd was thrown over him, including a police officer who broke his wrist, he added.
On the boulevard Jean-Jaur<0xC3><0xA8>s, at the height of No. 61, two municipal agents, including the chief, attempted to arrest the armed man and were beaten to death, according to police testimonies.
The events took place in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where numerous shops are located.
Some people came to tell me that there was a man wounded in the street.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old gentleman on the floor. When I put him in a safe position, I felt a very important wound in the abdomen, told AFP Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist.
Five minutes later, a second person, about 35, arrived, with knife wounds.
National police officers arrested the man without identity documents.
The Nanterre Prosecutor ' s Office submitted the investigation to the jurisdiction of the Departmental Service of the Judicial Police of Altos del Sena (SDPJ 92).
The madman was hospitalized on Thursday night.
During his interim detention, he did not say a word.
A police source does not rule out the possibility of interning him in a psychiatric hospital.
According to another police source, six police officers were needed to dominate him at the Clichy police station where he was transferred.
He was “in a state of over-excitement” as “any disturbance of this kind whose forces increase considerably under the effect of action.”
U.S.: Polanski's lawyer again calls for dismissal of case
The lawyer of the Franco-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski again claimed on Thursday in Los Angeles (California, Western United States), that he dismissed the case against his client, who is under house arrest in Switzerland, for a case of sexual abuse that occurred more than 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, attorney for the director of "The Pianist", reported to three judges of the California Second District Appeals Chamber serious procedural errors at the time of the facts, in 1977.
Hummel stated: “I complain that the charges are dismissed at the same time, as the conduct of the judge in charge of the case at that time, Laurence Rittenband, “was chilling.”
According to him, Judge Rittenband (who has since died) would have spoken with a prosecutor who would have told him that Roman Polanski deserved to go to jail before he ruled, which constitutes a serious lack of procedure.
This conversation was made public in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski, wanted and wanted), by the mouth of the prosecutor in question, David Wells.
But finally Wells declared at the end of September "to have lied" to the author of the documentary.
Hummel claimed a trial that would allow him to present evidence of his argument in case the court rejects the dismissal of the case.
The indictment, for its part, reiterated the argument set out in the first instance, that no dismissal of the charges could be seriously assessed as long as Roman Polanski did not appear before the court.
The 76-year-old filmmaker fled the United States in 1978 before his sentence for “illegal sexual relations” with a 13-year-old girl was handed down.
Since then, he has never stepped back into the United States.
Los Angeles deputy district attorney Phyllis Asayama said Roman Polanski "must be here to appear in the audience."
With this cause, we want to convey the message, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other defendants, that there is a possibility of fleeing?
For her, the filmmaker "applys a favor to the court, even if he despises his authority".
One of the three judges, who now have 90 days to pronounce his sentence, also stressed "that there were other alternatives to the decision to flee".
Hummel was not the only one who asked to dismiss the case against Roman Polanski.
Samantha Geimer's lawyer, the victim, also claimed, once again, to close the case.
She maintains that her client no longer tolerates being harassed every time the Polanski case resurfaces, adding: “No one in this room can say the procedure was fair.
Thirty-two years is enough.”
Roman Polanski was arrested on September 26 in Switzerland on U.S. arrest warrant.
After more than two months behind bars, he was sentenced to house arrest in his Gstaad cabin, pending a possible extradition.
Wall Street is losing track and slowing down the rise of the dollar
The New York Stock Exchange closed on Friday without a direction, in a market that is debated between better indicators than expected in the United States and the dollar rise: the Dow Jones won 0.63%, but the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the final figures at the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 65.67 points to 10,471.50 points, while the technology-component Nasdaq lost 0.55 points to 2,190.31 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500 expanded by 0.37% (4.06 points), reaching 1,106.41 points.
Honestly, the market is very quiet, said Mace Blicksilver, of Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains with narrow margins, the volume of exchanges is increasingly reduced and I think it will remain so until the end of the year.
The trend was sustained by the publication of better than expected economic indicators, which “helped to improve market opinion on the robustness of economic reactivation,” Charles Schwab’s analysts summed up.
In the United States, retail sales rose 1.3% in November for the second consecutive month and higher than expected.
In addition, U.S. consumer confidence visibly recovered in December, 73.4 versus 67.4 the previous month, according to the preliminary estimate of the University of Michigan index.
However, the indices were slowed by a new dollar advance that reached its highest level in the last two months against the euro, “bringing down sectors sensitive to the economic situation,” explained Owen Fitzpatrick of Deutsche Bank.
In this way, technological values have lost ground.
The bond market has fallen.
The yield of the 10-year Treasury bond rose to 3.540% from 3.482% on Wednesday night, and that of the 30-year Treasury bond to 4.497% from 4.492% on the night before.
The election of Miss World again in South Africa
After a month’s tour of South Africa, the 112 Miss World nominees are on the final line to fulfill their dream: to be chosen the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion viewers.
During this great celebration of beauty organized for the second year in a row around Johannesburg, five of them have already achieved their participation in the semi-final.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Pearl Beltran of Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo of Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino of Gibraltar and Yanbing Ma of Canada were chosen Miss Sporting or even Miss Top Model during their stay in Africa.
It was a real riot.
It was amazing to visit beautiful cities such as Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Town.
I saw a lot of things and lived countless experiences!, said Miss Sierra Leone astonishingly.
This event, which will be held for the ninth time in South Africa, will be broadcast live on Saturday from Midrand, North Johannesburg, starting at 5pm (15pm GMT).
It is impossible to imagine a better country to deliver my crown.
This experience was fascinating.
I am very happy to have lived twice, notes Miss Mundo Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the southern summer.
For the young Russian, her second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges with the candidates and by the possibility of rediscovering "African landscapes that take the breath away".
After a month of galas, rehearsals, press conferences and safaris, the Miss World candidates focus on the contest.
Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to be able to follow in the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, winner in 2000 and present in this election, as well as Aishwarya Rai in 1994, both of whom became Bollywood stars.
Every woman’s dream is to be crowned as the most beautiful in the world, but it’s not just about appearance.
We are the ambassadors of our countries, and I want to return to my country with the crown, says Miss India with a great smile.
According to the organizers, music and dance will mark this 59th edition.
Candidates will parade in traditional dresses and, of course, with a swimsuit.
Chinese presenter Angela Chow, former South African beauty queen Michelle McLean, and Miss World committee head Steve Douglas will lead the event.
South Africa has proven to be able to welcome the world with warmth and pride that are hard to match, says Julia Morley, president of the Miss World competition.
Like last year, the candidates went on a safari, visited the famous township of Soweto, but this time by bike, and tasted the local cuisine.
As an exceptional fact, they met the South African president, Jacob Zuma, who shook their hand.
Something unusual for a head of state, observes Miss Sierra Leone.
His best memory will undoubtedly be the draw in Cape Town (Southwest) for the June 2010 World Cup, a way for the country to further promote the event.
I've dealt with people I never thought I'd ever meet.
She’s probably back for the 2010 World Cup, says excited Miss Italia, Alice Taticchi.
News about Johnny Hallyday "is very positive", according to his son David
News about Johnny Hallyday is “very positive,” his son David said Friday when he arrived at Los Angeles airport to accompany his father hospitalized for several days.
The news is very positive.
Dad is strong and everything is going very well, David Hallyday told the press when he got off the plane that brought him from Paris shortly after 1 p.m. local time (21 p.m. GMT).
The singer's son, relaxed, said he would move "as soon as possible" to Cedars-Sina<0xC3><0xAF> Hospital in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday entered on Monday for an infection stemming from hernia surgery in Paris on Nov. 26.
The musician is “in a coma induced since that night in Los Angeles for reasons of comfort, to prevent him from suffering and thus be able to administer his treatment,” the press service said.
Johnny Hallyday had already undergone a coma induced by doctors at Cedars-Sina<0xC3><0xAF> Hospital in Los Angeles, where he entered on Monday for an infection, following a disc hernia operation on November 26 last in Paris.
The singer was operated once again on Wednesday night to Thursday due to serious injuries caused by the previous intervention.
His wife Laeticia was on Friday morning at the French high school in Los Angeles, attended by her daughter Jade, to witness a school event, an AFP photographer confirmed.
The head of Orthopaedic Surgery and Traumatology at the Pitié-Salp<0xC3><0xAA>tri<0xC3><0xA8>re hospital, Yves Catoné, announced that he would travel to Los Angeles on Monday to be with the singer.
The producer violently accused Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who operated on the singer last November 26 at the Monceau International Private Clinic in Paris.
We were told it was a massacre.
Surgeons in Los Angeles said they were outraged, Camus said.
We are talking about a possible lawsuit, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus claimed that Johnny Hallyday had "traveled too quickly to Los Angeles with the authorization of the Parisian surgeon."
I spoke directly to the doctor and was surprised when he assured me that there was no problem in making the trip, as I was operated on twice with disc hernia, he added.
Shortly before on RTL, he said that the singer had apparently "going without cannula, with nothing" after his Parisian operation.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the artistic environment.
She operated on actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before her death, at a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine where Delajoux was working at the time.
In 2007, she also intervened with actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to reabsorb a hematoma formed from a cerebral hemorrhage.
He is a doctor with a bad reputation, condemned by the justice system on several occasions for malpractice, as well as for tax fraud and fraud.
Olivier Metzner, a lawyer for the Medical Order, accused him of being "a ruthless man" sued "on a regular basis" before the Order Council, and he is "far from being recommended".
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux spoke on Friday through his lawyer, David Koubbi.
He indicated that the intervention was "without any inconvenience" and that the results of the postoperative studies were "normal".
The operation "could not cause hemorrhages and therefore did not need drainage," he added.
In any case, the singer’s tour, whose health problems have multiplied since the summer, entered a bracket.
Without a doubt, resuming the tour on January 8 (in Amiens, NDLR) as planned, it seems very risky to me, Camus said.
The UDF Association raises the tone and warns the New Center about the use of its acronym
The association UDF (Union for French Democracy), controlled by the MoDem (Democratic Movement) of Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrou, reacted this Friday to the attempt of the president of the New Center, Hervé Morin, to launch a so-called OPA (Public Offering of Acquisition) on the acronym of the former party of retiring to be a giscardist.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to recover the UDF acronym, as he considers that Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrou was not in a position to defend his political heritage after stretching his left hand.
On the other hand, the Minister of Defense, whose party is associated with the UMP, had planned to confirm the strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
In support of its management, it received the help of Deputy Hervé de Charette (formerly UMP, current NC), who claimed ownership of the UDF brand, as it was the first to register it at the National Institute of Industrial Property in 2004.
But on Friday night, the office of the association UDF, controlled by friends of Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrou who do not want to be deprived of it, broke the silence to launch a request to the Minister and the deputy intimidating them to renounce the acronym and transfer the ownership rights of the brand to them.
In recent days, you have made many statements insinuating that you were going to propose to your political movement to recover the UDF acronym, writes the association in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the office, including Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez of the MoDem, as well as Senator Jean Athuis of the Centrist Alliance.
They also believe it is right to continue using the name of the movement, the <0x2B>Nouveau centre<0x2B>, and the slogan <0x2B>l'UDF d'aujourd'hui<0x2B> in its militant material and on the presentation page of its site, the signatories of the letter argue.
As you already know, they have no right to use the acronym, explains the UDF office that requires the NC to "immediately remove the mention of the UDF name from any support, as well as from (its) Internet site."
He also asks Hervé de Charette "to transfer the ownership of the trademark to the legitimate rightholders".
If not, it will appeal to justice to enforce the law and the legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatories warn.
The letter states that the UDF "is a real political movement since 1978" and recalls that Morin and his friends "elected" to leave in 2007 "to create a new party, as others had already done in 2002 to create the UMP."
Therefore, the New Center does not, according to them, have any right to use the UDF acronym.
They also recall that the last congress of the UDF voted in 2007 to join the MoDem for three years and the creation of an office in charge of defending the "material and moral interests" of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, the office continues, "when he registered the brand", he was no longer a "member of the UDF for three years", but of the UMP.
In a scandalous and fraudulent way, he takes advantage of the lack of registration of the acronym UDF to do it on his own.
This indiscretion is turning into a crime, they denounce, before mocking the NC strategy: "We believe that in politics, as in life, it is more worthy to make your own name than to try to get out of anonymity by fraudulently taking a name that you are not entitled to."
Liliane Bettencourt case: Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois-Marie Banier will be tried for abuse of weakness
On Friday, the Court of Nanterre decided to sue the artist Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois-Marie Banier to determine whether, as the daughter of billionaire Liliane Bettencourt claims, she took advantage of the state of weakness of the octogenarian to expropriate her from part of her fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his photos of the show stars, will be tried on April 15 and 16, 2010 for abuse of weakness, a crime whose conviction consists of a maximum sentence of three years in prison and a fine of 375,000 euros.
This means that in this case there will be a process worthy of a saga about one of the richest families in France, in which mother and daughter are contested the reigns of the L'Oréal cosmetics empire.
But the No. 15 Correctional Court also ordered that Liliane Bettencourt, 87, be subjected to a medical examination by three medical professionals.
L’Oréal’s heiress and principal shareholder has always refused to undergo such examinations, even more so under the conditions proposed by the Nanterre Prosecutor’s Office during the investigation.
Doctors appointed this Friday will be required to submit a report before March 10, 2010 stating whether Liliane Bettencourt suffered from states of weakness and during which periods.
I think he'll accept it.
“I’m going to talk to her,” said Mrs. Bettencourt’s lawyer, Georges Kiejman, as she left the hearing.
Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise Bettencourt-Meyers’ lawyer, Olivier Metzner, was pleased with the court’s decision.
The expert will show that he (Banier) manipulated this older lady, whom we must protect, he said.
For the past two years, Liliane Bettencourt’s only daughter has started criminal proceedings against Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois-Marie Banier, a photographer and multifaceted artist, accusing him of taking advantage of his mother’s weakness for years to obtain billions of euros in donations, through checks, life insurance contracts or artwork.
Liliane Bettencourt has always denied being manipulated by the photographer, whom she considers a longtime friend.
On Friday, while the court was examining the origin of the action brought by Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers, the lawyers’ allegations resulted in, on some occasions, a major family confession.
In this way, Liliane Bettencourt’s lawyer took into account three letters her client sent (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to her notary in which she said she distrusted Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise Bettencourt-Meyers’ husband.
In the 2003 letter, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer: "I could explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier between one and two times a day for fifteen years.
Since his wedding, I’ve never been able to speak to Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise again.”
For its part, the Nanterre Prosecution once again held that the plaintiff was not in a position to appear, all the more so since a guardian judge in recent days refused to make room for her request to open a guardianship proceedings for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "has full capacity to appear before the court, is not under guardianship and has no tutor.
No other person will be allowed to appear in their place,” said Marie-Chrsitine Daubigney, the representative of the Public Prosecutor’s Office.
Finally, the Court decided that the judgment on the admissibility of Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers would be adjudicated after the hearing.
Management Revolution or the End of Business Intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of large French companies, our struggle for the development of business intelligence will have been in vain.
More than ten years ago, the attitude of the management of large companies with respect to their employees recalls the position of the companies with respect to consumers before the marketing revolution: it is that the collaborators adhere to "values" determined from above as previously it was about imposing to consumers products thought by factory technicians.
By putting the customer at the center of the company, the marketing revolution gave way to the strategies of conquest of the markets... although the authoritarian temptation to impose products that are not related to the factors of preference of the customers is repeated regularly.
A demobilization of employees can result in deadly demoralization.
Suicides in France Telecom, PSA or Renault are just the tip of the iceberg of a much more general phenomenon that particularly affects executives.
This demobilization seriously compromises the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, especially R&D and, even more so, business intelligence.
Indeed, BI (Business Intelligence) “requires all parties involved (...) to have proactive behavior and a prospective vision”; it requires a commitment on the part of employees that completely opposes the recommendations of an authoritarian management.
For this reason, we called for a management revolution, which would consist of putting employees at the center of the company’s concerns as well as the customer.
Internal opinion polls have a relative utility
Will internal opinion polls, such as Orange’s questionnaire among its employees, incentivize the management revolution in practice?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
-In principle, because I was able to verify that, in the face of a new situation, and after many turns, all companies end up doing essentially... what they always did!
Secondly, because authoritarianism, one of the pathologies of power, grows in proportion to the importance of its own failures.
-Finally, because most managers have a simplistic view of human behavior.
As they come from the great schools of engineers, they interpret psychology in a mechanistic way.
They adopt, for intellectual convenience, the ancient behaviorist theory that American “neurosciences” recently reactivated, and that the Institutes of Studies and the media widely spread behind them.
In this way, by suggesting that it is possible to handle the “commands” (sic) of executive engagement, a recent Ipsos research published in Le Figaro.fr reaffirms executives in a mechanistic management stance, unsuitable for today’s world.
Identify and measure mobilization factors
On the contrary, the management revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern companies involves adopting a finalist view of human behavior.
It consists in integrating into every reasoning or practice of business management, a fundamental fact: for employees, engagement with the company is only possible if it clearly appears as a means to make part of their dreams, ambitions and projects.
Today, only the studies from the Motifunctional Analysis adopt this conception of the motivations of employees.
The studies showed that they judge their company based on a predetermined doxa that allows them, through the image they have of the company, to evaluate what it offers them to achieve their own life projects.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of mobilization factors, company managers can control, predict and anticipate their "social performance" and relocate human resource management "on the spot".
In this way, they create a favorable ground for the organized development of a strong and effective business intelligence.
Oslo speech: for the "fair war" Obama receives praise from the right
On Friday, the American right, satisfied that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize has defended the concept of “fair war” against U.S. enemies, hailed the speech Obama had delivered on Thursday.
The Conservatives, who had discredited Obama’s award on Oct. 9, this time applauded the presidential speech, as did Sarah Palin, a former vice presidential candidate during the 2008 election.
I loved what she said, said Ms. Palin, the Republican party’s top right wing figure in the USA Today newspaper, and added that she herself had addressed the issue of “sometimes necessary” war in her recently published memoirs.
In my opinion, war is, of course, the last thing Americans want to be forced to do, but it is necessary.
We have to stop the terrorists, he said.
Obama, who inherited the two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, on Thursday in Oslo, dedicated himself to justify the use of force, a way to explain his decision to send 30,000 more troops to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another Obama opponent, Newt Gingrich, said the president had done “a very good job” in Oslo.
I think the speech was really very good, the former Speaker of the House was delighted, who particularly appreciated the mention of "the existence of evil in the world" in the presidential words.
For a moment, the speech seemed very historic to me, Gingrich said, during an interview on the radio show "The Takeaway".
The former elected representative, who some consider to be a potential candidate for the Republican nomination for the 2012 presidential election, was pleased to hear "a left-wing president" when he reminded members of the Nobel Committee "that they would not be free nor be able to award a peace prize if the use of force did not exist."
According to Michael Gerson, author of George W. Bush’s speeches and current columnist in the Washington Post, Obama delivered “a very American speech.”
In addition to presenting himself as a “citizen of the world,” as he “always does,” he “speaks as an American president” by reminding Europeans “to live in a security bubble that they did not create and that they do not do much to preserve it,” Gerson said.
Among the few unconvinced right-wingers, a Bush-era hawk, former UN ambassador John Bolton, called the speech "monotonous, pretentious and lack of inspiration" on the National Review Online website.
To the left of the president, Democratic representative Dennis Kucinich was alarmed when he saw Barack Obama justifying the use of force.
When we cover the war with the notion of justice, it is easy to justify the massacre of innocents, he warned.
However, the center-left press praised the president.
Los Angeles Time, although it continues to believe that Obama received the Nobel Prize prematurely, called his speech "superproduction" especially for a speaker known for his talent.
Oslo’s speech “should serve as a roadmap to guide international decisions in the fight against conflict, poverty and oppression,” the California newspaper said enthusiastically.
Obama “pronounced the speech that was necessary,” the New York Times said, judging it as “shadow and uplifting at the same time.”
Road Transport: Three Marathon Negotiations to Ensure Christmas Supply
After three sessions of marathon negotiations, the trade unions of the road sector and the TLF (Transport and Logistics of France), the only employer organization that remained until the end, reached an agreement on Friday afternoon that ends the slogan of the strike and the threat that falls on the Christmas supply.
During Friday night's signing session, State Secretary of Transport Dominique Bussereau was "joyed" by the deal, following several negotiating sessions that began Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussions, negotiators fired at dawn on Friday in the hopes of quickly signing the text by late morning.
Even though three employer organizations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) withdrew giving a goal.
But a meeting of more than six hours that began at 11 a.m. was necessary for everyone to agree and the text was signed at 6 p.m.
The conflict "would have been very damaging to businesses" and "was feared to disrupt the end of the year parties," Bussereau said.
The text foresees an increase of 4% for the lowest wages (in local and regional road transport), and 2.9% for the highest (international transport).
The hourly rate rises from 8.72 euros to 9.06 for low wages.
It’s not much, but we started with a lot of disadvantages, Patrice Clos (FO) explained.
If so, we are going to order our militants that there are no more cuts or blockades in the supply centers.
But there can always be some disconforming rebels, he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of the TLF, acknowledged that this was "a good deal", although it was "difficult to grant increases to high wages given international competition".
According to him, the increases will be in the order of 170 euros per month for the low wages and from 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
It is a common-sense agreement that respects wage earners, Maxime Dumont (CFDT) said, while Thierry Douine (CFTC) recognized it as a “historic agreement.”
For Richard Jaubert (CGT) it is “an acceptable commitment.”
The agreement also envisages an increase of 3 per cent in travel expenses and the holding of general meetings of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will make it possible, above all, to address the issue of extraordinary pay and the modernization of the collective agreement.
Bussereau recalled that "a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million drop in employer burden" was the subject of a government amendment to the 2009 correction finance bill, which the National Assembly voted on Thursday night.
The government will ask the Senate to vote “under the same terms.”
The signature of TLF allows the agreement to apply, firstly, to the companies affiliated to this organization and, secondly, to the entire profession, in the event that the Minister of Labour makes an extension.
It will be done “as soon as possible,” Bussereau said.
The opposition of employers’ organizations could only delay the process.
The FNTR denounced it was a “naive business”, as the 100 million euros “were already promised to the sector to offset part of the CO2 tax.”
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate in an emergency situation, not as a conclusion to an analysis discussed by the parties, but not to oppose those who wish to eat turkey at the next Christmas dinner, lamented Unostra.
For OTRE, the agreement puts at risk "the stability of many SMEs in the sector over the next 12 months".
RER A: Conflicts over the weekend, trade unions inconsistent with RATP proposals
Conflicts in RER A, France's largest public transport line, will continue over the weekend, because at Friday's meeting, the 2nd day of strike between unions and the RATP leadership, there was no agreement and the unions were dissatisfied with their premium order.
For this important weekend of Christmas shopping, on Saturday and Sunday only trains will run between 10 a.m. and 8 p.m., due to one train every two in the central section (between La Défense and Nation) and one train every four in the other lines.
Interconnection with the SNFC will be suspended in Nanterre Prefecture, forcing passengers to change trains.
The Lafayette Galleries, which expect 200,000 customers every day, were delighted that "RATP strives to provide service to the big stores."
The RER A cross from West to East the Parisian city.
The RATP section runs from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
This Friday, about one in two trains ran at peak hours, and almost no trains at valley hours, as expected.
On Thursday there was no disorder on the sidelines thanks to the organization of the inhabitants of the Island of France.
In this way, at dawn, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less busy than usual, especially due to the absence of students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, a 29-year-old engineer, explained that he had "an hour and a half earlier to get to schedule."
The Saint-Lazare station was not saturated, the SNCF said, which had envisaged supervision of police and law enforcement.
The RER A that operated the SNCF from Cergy-Le-Haut or to Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or departed from Saint-Lazare station to join the subways.
New general assemblies of workers on strike will take place on Saturday and Sunday. The results, "unsatisfactory" according to the trade unions, will be analyzed, a meeting with the management held on Friday afternoon.
The Director of RER proposes to negotiate a specific protocol in all aspects for RER A: working time, professional development, etc.
That’s not what drivers want to claim a premium that is owed to them, according to Thierry Garon (South).
The RATP even puts its premium proposals in parentheses, the CGT commented outraged, noting that the management "was not able to solve a problem that the SNCF and the road sector had already solved."
A new meeting is scheduled on Monday to carry out “a more extensive analysis of the conditions of exercise of the profession,” the RATP said.
This also led the unions to say that the company “didn’t care about weekend users.”
In the morning, about 150 drivers invaded a committee at headquarters in Paris.
Then the management, who until then refused to dialogue during the strike, suggested the meeting "to calm the waters".
The conflict could extend to RER B on Tuesday, after the Unsa and the Independents have filed a notice.
The unions demand a premium of 120 euros (Una) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud, Indépendants) and complain about the degradation of working conditions in this line that has one million passengers daily.
RER drivers, all in the second grade of their professional career, charge from 2,200 to 2,700 euros gross and from 600 to 650 euros premiums, for shifts, Sundays and holidays.
Turkish Justice Dissolves Procured Party, A Decision With Serious Consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court ruled on Friday in favour of the dissolution of the country’s main procured party, a decision that immediately sparked outrage in the Kurdish community, in the country’s southeast and in Istanbul.
This decision could greatly complicate the task of the government, which has just given a hand to the Kurdish community trying to put an end to 25 years of conflict.
The Democratic Society Party (DTP) was dissolved because it had become the “focus of activities that undermined the independence of the state and its indivisible unity,” Court President Hasim Kilic told reporters after four days of deliberations.
The ruling by the 11 judges was unanimous, although only a seven-vote majority was needed to get the dissolution, Kili<0xC3><0xA7> said, adding that 37 of the party’s leaders, including its president Ahmet Türk and MP Aysel Tugluk, are ousted from political life for five years.
The judge also announced the cessation of parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Türk and Tugluk, and the confiscation of the party's assets by the Treasury.
The DTP has 21 banks in Parliament (550).
Its leaders warned before the verdict that deputies would leave parliament before they became MPs without a party label.
The decision comes as a result of a procedure launched by Supreme Court prosecutor Abdurrahman Yal<0xC3><0xA7>inkaya in 2007, which accuses the DTP of obeying the “principles” of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and many other countries.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political showcase of the PKK rebels.
However, the party says it has no “organic ties” with the PKK, but refuses to classify it as a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The Court’s verdict intervenes as the government lends a hand to the Kurdish community proposing a series of measures to strengthen their rights, so that the Kurds stop supporting the PKK and end the conflict.
DTP leaders said a resolution could lead to a escalation of tensions in Southeast Anatolia, where a large number of protests against the detention conditions of PKK chief Abdullah <0xC3><0x96>calan have degenerated into clashes with police over the past few weeks.
Since the announcement of justice, thousands of protesters have gathered in front of the DTP premises in Diyarbakir, the large southeastern city mostly populated by Kurds.
The Order Forces threw tear-throwing grenades and used water cannons, while the protesters threw Molotov bombs or stones with sledges.
In Istanbul, about one hundred people were also concentrated.
After the verdict, Türk said the justice decision was going to “deepen the discouragement.”
Turkey cannot resolve this issue (Kurdish, NDLR) by dissolving a party, he told the press.
The government, formed by a party from the Islamist movement, also regrets the decision.
In principle, we oppose the closure of parties.
This is not the case, said Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
This decision completely boycotts the democratic opening launched by the government, said political analyst Ahmet Insel.
We can expect, of course, a reaction from the PKK, he added.
On Thursday, the PKK was awarded an attack in which seven soldiers died three days earlier in northern Turkey, one of the bloodiest attacks in recent months.
The snow can start all of a sudden.
A truly cool winter is what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
It is absolutely something with which you want to make life impossible for citizens, says the director of road maintenance in winter of the FES
But with this, your employees can learn to test and master the entirety of vehicle technology.
Meteorologists may announce it for the first time this weekend.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to deal with snow and ice.
In this case, the EDF shall act in accordance with a detailed plan.
As soon as heavy snow in Frankfurt and temperatures drop below zero degrees, 20 of the so-called A-strokes come out with large salt-powered vehicles, Brauburger explains.
These include, for example, the main arteries and avenues such as the Neue Weg and the Hanauer Landstraße.
But also access to the fire department, public transport routes, pedestrian zones and sloped sections, such as the Atzelbergstraße.
The FES service starts around 3 a.m.
Approximately 1,040 kilometres should be covered, as necessary, in a maximum of three hours with wet salt, which is better adherent.
That’s why the FES starts around three o’clock in the morning, “with this the roads are free until the traffic of peak hours begins.”
The hard part is when it starts to snow around 7:30.
“Then we have a problem,” says the road maintenance director in the winter, “because then nobody is ready to clear space to the salty vehicles.”
Immediately after that, when it is no longer snowing, it is on the secondary and private roads, to which also belongs the Rat-Beil-Straße.
The last priority is the side and secondary streets.
That’s where the inconvenience comes from, Brauburger knows it well.
Around five in the morning, the FES infantry is launched, mainly dangerous points and cruises are cleared.
Generally, the FES could not take over all bicycle lanes.
In Frankfurt there is a special service, which from 22 to 4:30 hours does not lose sight mainly of the bridges, says Brauburger.
As these become slippery quickly, the salted vehicle starts up as soon as the temperature drops below two degrees.
In the event of an emergency, the police can also call them.
The Cradle of the Dinosaur
The Tawa findae looked the same as many other carnivorous dinosaurs: an animal two meters long and 1.50 meters high that ran over the two strong hind legs, had an elongated head with sharp, curved teeth, short arms with lance-shaped claws, and a long tail.
If the species had lived a few million years later, it would not have been anything special.
But the Tawa findae was one of the first dinosaurs with these body characteristics, reports Sterling Nesbitt of the University of Texas at Austin and colleagues in Thursday’s Science magazine.
The species lived about 215 million years ago in what is now New Mexico, which was then in a dry area of the supercontinent Pangea in the equator.
Tawa opened a new window to the early evolution of dinosaurs, Nesbitt says.
It shows us a lot about the genealogical relationships, propagation and characteristics of the early dinosaurs.
Nesbitt and other paleontologists began an excavation in 2006 at Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico.
Sometimes, we’ve found a dozen dinosaur bones in one day, this is unprecedented for Triassic sediments, reports Randall Irmis, a team member at the Utah Museum of Natural History.
The researchers quickly identified some bones as belonging to a new species.
In the course of the excavation, the remains of five specimens were collected in total.
Finding Confirms Theories About the Ancient History of Dinosaurs
The name "Tawa" comes from the Hopi Indian sun god.
For Sterling Nesbitt it is an exceptional finding: "Triassic dinosaur fossils are extremely rare, usually only individual fragments are found."
Other experts in dinosaurs do not fully share such enthusiasm.
This finding is not particularly spectacular, but it confirms some theories about the ancient history of dinosaurs, for example, says Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
According to current opinion, dinosaurs first appeared about 230 million years ago.
But many of the older fossils are incomplete, so the classification of these early dinosaurs is quite controversial.
Thus, experts debate, for example, when the saurians were divided into their three most important genealogical lineages: the carnivorous theropods among which are the Tyrannosaurus Rex, the Velociraptor and also the birds, the avocados pelsaurus, the quadrupedal sauropods with the herbians known as the "long neck" and their paris.
According to the analysis of Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa findae is a primitive theropod.
This shows an interesting combination of primitive and progressive properties, Nesbitt comments.
For example, in the skull of Tawa, researchers found traces of air pockets, such as those also owned by theropod descendants, the birds.
Thanks to air bags, the breath of birds is more efficient than that of mammals.
In the case of Tawa, the bones of the spine were also evidently partially filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and primitive airbag theropod, says Randall Irmis.
Because the related line of the later giant sauropods also possessed air bags and light bones, it was likely that the common ancestors of both groups would already produce this useful innovation.
At Least Three Waves of Migrants to North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs known to date lived in South America, researchers deduce that saurians first emerged there.
Therefore, the three genealogical lineages were separated at first and spread from South America to all corners of the Earth, which at that time still formed a single terrestrial mass, the supercontinent Pangea.
However, the facts say that the team found together with Tawae find the remains of two other not very closely related theropods.
The three cannot descend from a single related ancestor, the researchers argue.
We believe there have been at least three migratory waves to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, co-author of the study Science.
Of course, there are opponents too.
An even older species, Silesaurus, belonging to a sister group of dinosaurs, lived in present-day Poland, says Bonn paleontologist Martin Sander.
Their opinion could give a distorted image, because simply in South America many dinosaur fossils are still preserved, while in other continents there is hardly anything to discover.
The question of how dinosaurs managed to evolve from a relatively rare collateral line of reptiles to the dominant terrestrial vertebrates of the Mesozoic remains an enigma.
Meanwhile, in the Triassic, dinosaurs still shared their living space with many other reptiles, for example, with the ancestors of modern crocodiles and pterosaurs and many other sauries.
Towards the end of the Triassic the dinosaurs expanded around the world and developed many new species, while the kinship became extinct at the Triassic boundary towards the Jurassic.
Successful stories were not eternal.
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There may have been a massive extinction that the dinosaurs survived by chance, but the other reptiles did not.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted, so they were able to beat the opponents in the area.
Success stories are not always eternal.
150 million years later, a meteorite impact slowed the rise of a group of species, which had also evolved in the Triassic and since then had a miserable existence: mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to S<0xC3><0xA3>o Paulo
The list is long and the international signatories.
Professors from the University of Toronto, Cambridge, Vienna or Berkeley, California, participate.
Teachers from Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, S<0xC3><0xA3>o Paulo, Berlin or Bremen take part.
The police eviction of the busy casino at Goethe University in Frankfurt has repercussions all over the world.
278 professors and professors from Goethe University, although also from higher education centres throughout Germany, Europe and North and South America, are in solidarity with protesting students at the Westend Campus.
In a statement written in German and English, they “reject” the police eviction promoted by the board of directors.
Werner Müller-Estler, president of the university, evacuated the building occupied by students and teachers on educational strike last week because the walls and works of art were covered with propaganda.
As a result, five students suffered injuries.
The material damage, the signatories say, does not justify “the violent dissolution of the courses organized by the same students and professors by a police command.”
The eviction represented an “unacceptable attack” on freedom of research and learning.
The exclusive approach to vandalism served to “delegitimize and criminalize the protest” and diverted attention from the content.
The Governing Council has refused to initiate the necessary negotiations.
Teachers demand the immediate withdrawal of the legal claim.
Most occupants have not caused material damage, it is said.
Legitimized protest
Also the young people of the Verdi union and the German Federation of Trade Unions are in solidarity with the students.
The protest is a legitimate expression of growing concern for the future itself, said Verdi’s national youth secretary Alexander Klein.
Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU), Minister of Science of Hesse, however, defended the performance of the rector of the university and the police.
We are grateful to the Rector of the University.
The destruction and occupation are totally unacceptable means, he said in a broadcast of Aktuelle Stunde on Thursday in the Wiesbaden province parliament.
We are sympathetic to the protest, but we are not sympathetic to the vandalism, said Peter Beuth, delegate to the provincial parliament by the CDU.
The opinion of the opposition factions, the SPD, the Greens and the left, is different.
The CDU used the painted walls as a pretext to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (Left).
Instead of thoroughly studying the students’ arguments and demands, they are evicted.
The Left has tabled a motion requesting the Minister of the Interior to submit a report on police intervention.
The New Silicon Valley
For many years, it was considered a secret city, inaccessible to Western visitors.
Selenograd, one of the ten districts of Moscow, was in the Soviet Union a heavily guarded site for secret arms research.
Today, the community of 216,000 inhabitants, located 37 kilometers from the center of Moscow, is considered the "Russian Silicon Valley".
Here are important research and production centers for micro and nanoelectronics.
Since September 2008, representatives of Selenograd have contacted Riedberg’s scientific headquarters in Frankfurt, university institutes and companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Center (FIZ).
Several mutual visits were made and now, on Wednesday, Selenograd and Riedberg sign a "Protocol of Close Collaboration" in Frankfurt.
Moscow Deputy Mayor Juri Rosljak and the Mayor of Selengrad, Anatoly Smirnov, headed the Russian delegation; by Frankfurt signed the head of planning services Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010 they will travel to a seminar in Selenograd representatives of the FIZ and directors of small and medium-sized enterprises of the natural sciences research center.
SCIENTIFIC EXCHANGE
This is a continual scientific exchange.
It also deals with trade relations.
FIZ companies will have the opportunity to set foot in the growing Russian market.
In return, Russian scientific companies want to have access to contracts in Germany.
Selenograd is home to major Russian companies and research institutes.
Among them are, for example, the Moscow Institute of Electronic Technology, the large consortia Sitronics and Rossijskaja Elektronika.
The community was founded in 1958 as the so-called "Socialist Planning City" for armament research.
Selenograd (literally translated as "Green City") got its name from the forested mountain landscape, in which research facilities were set up.
Brakes of Stuttgart
The Stuttgart 21 dimension is not set high enough for anything.
For the supporters of the project it is simply and flatly "the new heart of Europe".
S21 is much more than the reduction of a railway station, more than a monstrous construction project, which will precipitate the capital of the Banden-Württemberg region a decade of chaos of irreparable construction sites.
Stuttgart 21 emerged from the spirit of the 1980s.
Rail terminals, which end in the middle of the city, were then considered 19th-century engineering fossils, which acted as brakes for modern rail traffic, as it used to take a huge amount of time to hook up the locomotives from the back to the front.
Rotate, stop dry continue the journey; but so it must be done.
And that’s why the terminals had to disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a transit station, which is approximately halfway between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava; hence the slogan "Heart of Europe".
The S21 will actually be launched, even though the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even the most ambitious designers have known that in the Hessian and Bavarian capitals it is almost priceless to implement the reduction.
Rail terminals, of course, also have no more input and output problems, since there are reversible locomotives with tractor unit and driver's carriage at both ends.
However: Stuttgart 21 including the newly built ICE stretch to Ulm will already be started.
Federal and municipal politicians have arranged it that way.
The railway follows, also because the risks of large individual infrastructure projects of the Republic are borne by the taxpayer and not by the State.
From an urban point of view, the project is still justified to some extent.
New urban space is created, equipped with many green areas, probably the computer-generated graphics of the designer.
For the rail transport system, the S21 is harmful.
The passage station and road support are designed for the transportation of people, which was attributed to the huge growth typical of the 1980s.
At that time, there was no competition for low-cost flights.
But modern transport policy must first focus on strengthening the transport of goods, since rail transport is considerably more environmentally friendly than that carried out by trucks on the roads.
However, the new sections under construction are good for freight trains due to the intense gradients.
Even more serious is that the S21 also indirectly affects many other railway projects.
More than six billion euros must be buried in the Zuavos.
That's the official figure.
Experts consider it to be more realistic between ten and fifteen billion.
It is certain that in the next decade the money will be missing at other crossings and narrow passages on the network.
A total of sixty major projects are listed by the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the extension of more than 180 kilometers of long rails through the Rhine valley.
Since 1987, the slow-moving route has been built.
It would be urgent here to step on the accelerator properly.
However, the S21 acts as a brake.
The stretch of the Rhine Valley will be the bottleneck for international freight transport: through the heart of Europe.
The government is examining the ruling on the airport.
The federal government is pending in the Wiesbaden Autonomous Parliament, if it will appeal the ruling on the prohibition of night flights from the administrative court of Hesse.
The CDU/FDP coalition appears to have commissioned experts with the legal investigation of the more than 400-page VGH ruling, Economy Minister Dieter Posch (FDP) said.
The administrative court in Kassel had substantiated in writing on this date that in the case of the construction of the planned northwest runway at Frankfurt airport, the federal state would have to re-regulate the ban on night flights.
The admission of 17 flights between 11 p.m. and 5 p.m., as envisaged by the federal government, would not be compatible with the mandatory legal protection of the population from noise due to air traffic.
The coalition has to decide by January 4, whether to appeal against this ruling.
The opposition criticized this postponement and pressured government representatives to relinquish the appeal to the nation’s Administrative Court in Leipzig.
The head of the SPD group, Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel, urged the CDU and the FDP to respect their promises to ban night air traffic, which they had made before the elections.
It is quite difficult, if one is allowed to fulfill his word, said the head of the Greens Tarek Al-Wazir, referring to the FDP slogan "We keep our word."
Minister Posch rejected Schäfer-Gümbel’s recrimination, which the federal government would be trying to get its night flights by way of legal misrepresentations and tricks.
A thorough legal investigation would take quite a bit of time.
The coalition would not want to act on the basis of a "quick first impression".
We need a legally intact decision, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
As represented by the opposition, it would never have been the group’s claims about the prohibition of night air transit.
The U.S. banks are repaying the aid.
The big U.S. banks shaken by the crisis are stripping themselves of their state ties.
The "Bank of America" returned all the aid it had been given by the Tarp bank rescue fund of a total of 45 billion euros (approximately 30 billion euros).
And also the Citi group plans to return state aid, according to a report by CNBC.
With this, the institutes intend to get rid of the restrictions that had gone hand in hand with the acceptance of money, such as the limitation in the payment of bonuses to directors, as well as the payment of high fees.
The “Bank of America” had achieved approximately 19 billion cash through convertible bonds.
The rest of the sum took it from the box itself, which had quite a few means, among others for the sale of items.
Banking director Kenneth Lewis thanked U.S. taxpayers especially on Wednesday night: the financial injection helped overcome very difficult times.
The banking house had miscalculated the investment bank’s effort to absorb the climax of the financial crisis.
The Citi group also intends to raise money in the capital market in order to be able to free itself from its obligations to the state.
CNBC reported from a source of well-known circles that the U.S. bank could announce a $20 billion capital increase by Thursday.
A representative of the Citi group did not want to comment.
In June they had already returned their aides Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley.
Quick Election
In the end, everything was faster than I thought.
Just two weeks after the board of directors of the ZDF (German television channel) pressured editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender to leave his post, the channel can introduce a successor.
Last night, the guild wanted to vote on the candidate.
The favorite was Peter Frey, director of the ZDF’s main studio in Berlin.
There was no confirmation of this by the broadcaster, officially not to anticipate the procedure.
But it certainly also influenced not to harm ZDF director Markus Schächter any more, if this proposal would not also be approved in the board of directors.
Frey, Schächter’s candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 members of the guild.
The result of the vote was not yet concrete at the close of the drafting of this edition.
Two weeks ago Schächter failed on the board of directors with his proposal to renew Nikolaus Brender’s contract for another five years.
Only seven members supported Brender, seven voted against him. Brender's dismissal was a bitter failure for Schächter, but a failure that could be expected.
Why the majority of the Union in the board already weeks before the election had indicated, that they were not going to support Brender in his position.
The opposition against the editor-in-chief had been organized by the president of the Hesse government, Mr. Roland Koch.
He declined another mandate of the prestigious head of editorial staff with the argument that under Brender’s direction the ZDF news reports would have lost audience indices.
Until shortly before the elections there were protests due to this, in which political influence over the ZDF flagged.
In the end, 35 public law specialists had been involved in the debate, who called Koch’s conduct unconstitutional.
But it didn't help.
About the person
Peter Frey was born on 4 August 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and Romance philology.
He then worked for the broadcaster "Südwestfunk" and the newspaper "Frankfurter Rundschau".
In 1983 it was switched to the ZDF, initially to the "today-journal" news.
Following stations: 1988 to 1990 personal reporter of the editor-in-chief; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 director and conductor of the morning program "Morgenmagazins"; until 2001 director of foreign policy of the ZDF; since then director of the study of the ZDF in the capital.
The Greens' political party announced a constitutional lawsuit following the dismissal of Brender, who was still elected as a journalist of the year by media magazine "Medium Magazin".
Koch's counterpart on the board, the president of the Rhineland-Palatinate government, explained last week that the federal states should change the ZDF state agreement in such a way that the director's staff proposals cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
A withdrawal of partisan politicians from the ZDF control guilds was discarded by Beck.
Brender's probable successor, Mr. Peter Frey, was recommended to the board with a smart move: he strongly criticized the guild for Brender's dismissal.
Thanks to this test of journalistic independence both Schächter was able to appoint him to the post of editor without losing his face, as the board of directors was able to vote him, without falling under suspicion of giving the post to a supportive six-year-old.
In the calculations of the parties Frey is nonetheless awarded to the liberals of the left.
College careers are cleared
Partial success for students: after a year of education-related strikes, the Ministers of Education and Culture of the federal states finally surrendered. In a meeting of the Ministers of Education and Culture with university directors, both sides agreed to try to improve study conditions and more license cases.
Students in the future should be able to overcome their careers.
For example, they agreed to reduce the exam burden: basically every module of the career should end with a single exam.
In addition, the aim is to examine the workload of the students, and a "real and justifiable measure" is to be guaranteed.
The policy and universities also want to simplify the recognition of exam results between universities inside and outside Germany.
The federated states are committed to making structural rules more flexibly for Bachelor and Master careers.
Regulations of the federated states that diverge from this, should no longer exist.
Less Exams
Since the start of the student protests in June, the Ministers of Education and Culture and the Rectors of the universities are constantly talking about improving the ability to successfully complete and complete a career (studyability).
For the first time, a specific content has been discussed.
The so-called accreditation board agreed to drastically reduce the number of exams: “Each module ends with a single exam,” says a 30-page document, which aims to partially regulate the approval of university careers.
The "sensible reduction of the exam burden" is intended to prevent development in the wrong direction, which would significantly affect studentability, explained the director of the accreditation board, Mr. Reinhold Grimm.
In addition, in the future "studyability" should be the decisive criterion in the configuration.
The modules and contents should be thoroughly examined as to unnecessary restrictions of the students in the choice of..
the courses.
Students would have "the right to get more spaces, which enable and encourage self-initiative."
These rules would apply to new races, but also to the examination of existing races.
These must be "re-credited" again every five years, but this would mean, that it would take until 2015 to examine all races.
Those responsible for this would be nationwide 10 accreditation agencies, which are under the supervision of the accreditation council, which is set up by the federated states.
Ministers of education and culture urged the federated states in October to influence agencies in such a way that the amount of subjects and exams are not too strict or demanding.
In some federated states, universities and technical schools have already agreed with ministries to take such measures.
Until now, only Rhineland-Palatinate ensured to provide additional means for the subsequent development of the Bologna process.
With this money, universities must implement tutoring and student counseling programs, as well as strengthen examination offices and abroad.
The federal state and universities intend to have 10 million euros for these purposes.
In early 2010, the government wants to bring a novel of university law to parliament.
According to her, a single exam should be sufficient for the completion of a career model.
The career setting should be made more flexible, it also wants to ensure the recognition of assessments at other universities and facilitate accessibility to the Master.
By the end of next year it is intended to examine all races about their "studyability".
On Thursday, the government and the opposition again discussed the conditions for studying in the federal state.
Apart from the praises, there were also criticisms about the decisions.
In the federal board of directors of the Juso (Young Socialists) university groups, he said that the configuration of the educational policy should no longer be carried out "behind closed doors" of the ministers and university directors.
At the latest after the education strikes, now the students as principals involved should be able to comment as well.
The president of the board of university directors (HRK), Margret Wintermantel, gave her support to the students: “We need the experience of the students,” she said Thursday at a meeting with the Ministers of Education, with whom the HRK deliberated on a joint reform document.
For the Education and Science Union (GEW) the Bonn agreements were not entirely sufficient: the union requires a legal right for each student with a Bachelor’s degree to access a subsequent Master’s career.
In addition, the federal states have to ensure that for the current generation of Bachelor students there are in the future enough places to study for a Master with the best possible study conditions, according to a GEW member, Mr. Andreas Keller.
The federal states have to hire quite a few more teachers.
But about greater access to the master's degree, the Ministers of Education did not comment.
More than a footnote about Herta Müller
"Enter and exit from Germany is made virtually uncontrollable" says the first line of a poem by Werner Söllner in unbalanced linguistic fragments, in which it themes the experiences of arrival in Germany by a dissident, who gained his freedom but lost the environment of his language.
Werner Söllner, who was born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, initially worked as a German and English teacher in Bucharest, and then as a reader at a children's book publishing house, before moving to Frankfurt in 1982.
Söllner was awarded several literary prizes, in 1993 he gave the memorable lectures or poetry lectures in Frankfurt at Goethe University, and since 2002 he is director of the Hesse Literature Forum at the Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
God spoke quite a bit last Tuesday during a meeting in Munich about "German literature in Romania in the mirror and the disfigured mirror of its Securitate files"
Visibly insecure and embarrassed, Söllner read a statement in which he admitted participation as IM in the Romanian secret service Securitate in front of German-Romanian fellow writers, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer.
Together with some of those present in 1989, Söllner had received the German Language Award.
Attempts to recruit had begun slowly, in early 1971.
“I am therefore someone who has not defended himself sufficiently against attempts to provoke security fears,” Söllner concluded.
The lyricist Werner Söllner is IM Walter.
Almost at the same time that the Nobel Prize in Literature was awarded to Herta Müller and her unparalleled literary controversy with the mechanisms of dictatorial domination, the literary scene and especially the community of German authors from Romania are shaken by a case that proves the depths and evil of a political system that is based on control.
Werner Söllner is, so far known, not only an author, but also a victim.
In his Securitate IM file Walter had played a role, said the literary scientist Michael Markel after Söllner's confession, and emphasized the positive influence for him of the IM Walter.
I had excused or defended him in all the hard points for him, Markel said.
“I feel the moral need to make this statement,” he said.
Söllner’s statement in this form and in front of this public was unexpected, the confession of a former dissident and his work with the Romanian secret service, however, is not so surprising.
Germany would have been a comfortable refuge for the Securitate-Spitzel spies, Herta Müller wrote as early as July in the weekly "Zeit", after reading her own 914-page file.
Those involved probably have speculated and in some cases have known what names were hidden behind the pseudonyms of Sorin, Voicu and also Walter.
Unlike the revision of the Stasi files with a controlled procedure in Germany, the handling of the control files by the Securitate is still quite widespread.
A systematic clarification was boycotted and difficult in recent years.
A National Council for the Clarification of Security Records (CNSAS), belonging to the Birthler authority, was formed in 1999, and the delivery of the records has since been rather traced.
Since 2005, there has been a law regulating the administration of records.
An interview, after the Nobel Prize in Literature was awarded to Herta Müller, proves that the influence of former members of the Securitate in Romania is still quite large. In this interview a former head of the Securitate of Temesvar spoke disdainfully about the award.
“She has psychosis,” she was eventually only questioned once.
The infamy of power seemed to show itself without turning in the form of freedom of opinion.
Of course, unavoidable questions arise with the Söllner case, as so often when there are silent culprits.
The calm reaction of the listeners to Söllner’s confession leaves hope that the continuation of this story will be governed more by the cravings for knowledge and not so much by the admission of guilt and shame.
For the Genesis of Herta Müller’s work, which accepted the Nobel Prize in Literature yesterday, it is more than a mere footnote.
The Champions League as a garrison to fill the stomach
When the new coach of the Stuttgart VfB football team, Christian Gross, accompanied by an orange plastic bag from the supplier of his team, boarded a C-Class cab a quarter of an hour after midnight, it made the impression that a parting member of the outdoors service elegantly dressed was holding the rejoinder from a very navy.
The man of calva characteristic had hired a driver, because he did not yet know the city.
By the way, he could also have driven the car himself: after all, there was no alcohol at stake, and neither was the 55-year-old man drunk of joy.
It had been a nice evening, but tomorrow the work would start again.
It would start for the first time.
In the words of the Swiss, who had been hired just three days before: "It is true that we have reached the eighth final", namely, in the Champions League, thanks to the 3:1 victory against Unirea Urziceni, of Romania, "but we cannot let ourselves be blinded by success: we will have to fight brutally against the descent."
The "much more important task" awaited them next Sunday, he said.
Then, it will be necessary to repeat the success of the "real classes" in the daily life of the league.
And eliminate the weaknesses, which have been clearly proven again, after the quick three goals of Marica (5), Träsch (8) and Pogrebnyak (11).
Lottery
The Champions League finals (departing games on 16/17 and 23/24 of February/turning games on 9/10 and 16/17 of March) will be drawn on 18 December in Nyon.
So the joy was limited by the fulminant entry of Babbel’s successor.
Not only in the supposed savior, who in a short time had inspired the confused Stuttgart professionals self-confidence, willingness to surrender and taste for the game.
I went with the players and told them that they had to focus on their strengths, I urged them to be more pitched, explained the soul repairman Gross his recipe for success that sounds so simple, but that with the therapist Babbel had no effect anymore.
He deployed a certain magic, accepted Babbel's supporter, Jens Lehmann, "when a new impulse emerges in football, sometimes things happen that would not have been believed possible."
And Sami Khedira, who after a several-week break due to an injury immediately advanced to become the best local player thanks to his dynamism, tried to describe the "phenomenon" perceived with the proverbial "fresh wind" and the way the new boss works: "He is a man who intervenes thoroughly and thoroughly,
This is what we need in the current situation.”
And this is what was missing, obviously, when Babbel was.
VfB Stuttgart has not yet passed the test, sports manager Horst Heldt warns
But the VfB Stuttgart needs above all constancy.
Like Gross, the players and the manager abstained from overestimating the victory against a weakened defense due to a lack of relays and totally outplayed by Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow, before four days later in Leverkusen with the 0:4 had arrived the sad awakening, Khedira thought.
And manager Horst Heldt warned that while one goal of the season had been achieved, the other was still far away.
We have not overcome the problem yet.
That Heldt did not want to celebrate on his 40th birthday, even after the first victory at his headquarters in three months, was due to the events of the weekend, which were re-updated in the form of a television interview, broadcast just before the start of the game, which had been granted by goalkeeper Jens Lehmann.
There are decisions others make, and not Jens, Heldt faced Lehmann’s harsh criticism.
He had blamed weakness in the direction of the board of directors, who had decided to change coaches due to pressure from teenage fans.
Also that his free day had been eliminated after the games Lehmann called it a sign of lack of sovereignty and hostility.
Lehmann's statements were "marked by pure selfishness," Heldt rebutted, and announced consequences for the backpacker.
They probably won't be friends forever, the two quarantines.
But at least they agreed with all the others that, without the previous efforts with the replaced coach’s team, the spectacle of great game and battle force would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants had “an important part in success,” Heldt and Lehmann told the unison; and the man in the plastic bag also agreed.
Category: World Heavyweight Championship fighter
Burning duel in Bern: over and over again the retard Kevin Johnson was provoking world champion Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures.
But after twelve hard rounds, the Ukrainian defended his heavyweight title in the WBC version.
The judge's judgment was unanimous.
Hamburg: Vitali Klitschko remains world heavyweight champion.
The 38-year-old WBC version champion beat American Kevin Johnson on the night of Friday to Saturday in Bern by unanimous decision by points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Klitschko it was his third successful defense of the title since his return in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian was already twice world champion of WBO and WBC associations.
Unfortunately, it was not possible to carry out the knockout that everyone had been waiting for.
Klitschko extended his balance to 39 wins in 41 professional fights, twice had to give up due to his injuries.
The retard Johnson had to accept the first defeat in his 24th fight.
In front of about 17,000 spectators in the Bern Arena, Klitschko, with a height of 2.02 meters, wanted to dictate the fight especially with his left hand.
But Johnson, eleven inches lower, who before the duel had proclaimed the end of the Klitschko era, was evading the world champion’s blows again and again, so Klitschko could not decisively bring his dangerous right to his goal.
In general terms, the passive Johnson did too little for a retard, and only tried to pass the rounds.
While he was provoking Klitschko with words and gestures, his blows rarely reached the world champion.
However, he is now the second boxer, after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who lasted twelve full rounds with Klitschko.
Before the fight, the retard had already produced a certain scandal in the Swiss capital.
He had insulted Klitschko as a "horrible zombie", who "knows nothing".
While weighing, the champion was allowed to challenge Johnson on Friday to remove the sunglasses from his nose "to be able to see his eyes."
Fourth victory after Klitschko's return
Also in his fourth fight after his return on October 11, 2008, Klitschko remained invincible.
After a break of nearly four years, he defeated then-Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin, and had recovered "his" belt from the WBC, which he had previously had to surrender without fighting.
That year, he defeated Juan Carlos G<0xC3><0xB3>mez of Cuba and Chris Arreola of the United States in September.
In this fight I only received one blow, and I am in very good physical condition, Klitschko had explained his quick return to the ring.
But his dream remains to gather all four important titles in his family.
His brother Vladimir is the world champion of the WBO and IBF associations.
However, the belt belongs to the British David Haye, after he dethroned in November Nikolai Valujev, 2.13 meters tall.
The previous summer, Haye had canceled a fight against Vitali Klitschko scheduled for September.
Presumably, the company that promotes it is already planning the fight against Klitschko at London’s Wembley Stadium.
The Kunduz case
Frontal attack by the opposition: The head of the Greens group, Jürgen Trittin, called the Minister of Defense, Gutenberg, a liar, because of false information on the Kunduz case.
The SPD and the leftists demand an explanation from the Chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin – Following the latest revelations about Kunduz’s airstrike, the opposition has accused Defence Minister Karl-Theodor zu Gutenberg (CSU) of knowingly cheating.
In Saturday's "Tagesschau" news broadcast on the ARD television channel, the head of the Greens' group, Jürgen Trittin, said the minister had "not knowingly told the truth" about the deadly bombing of two convoys.
In such a case, it is usually said: he lied.
The killing order would have been given without taking into account the rules of the International Protection Troop for Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the essence of the report that NATO had, and that Mr. Gutenberg has read, Trittin said.
On Friday, it was announced that the attack was not only about destroying the hijacked trucks, but also about intentionally killing two Taliban leaders.
In the U.S. airstrike, requested by the German commander of Kunduz, Colonel Klein, according to the NATO investigation report, up to 142 people were killed or injured.
The Greens, the SPD and the left on Saturday urged Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to speak immediately before the federal parliament and clarify what Gutenberg really knew about the incident.
Ms. Merkel has to clarify whether a strategy of intentional murder is part of the federal government’s Afghanistan policy, and whether the chancellery, the army and the intelligence service have approved this new strategy, demanded Jürgen Trittin and her Green colleague Renate Künast.
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm resolutely rejected the criticism.
The chancellery did not exert any influence on specific actions of the German army in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, doubts had also been raised about the Ministry’s presentation of the reasons for the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert.
According to the SPIEGEL, both had informed Gutenberg correctly and completely about the background of the attack on the convoys.
Officially, it had been said that they had denied the existence of NATO reports and had concealed sensitive details from the Minister.
However, from the background of the two high-ranking officials it was transcended that they had even pointed out to the Ministry of Defense the existence of several reports, including a two-page document from Colonel Klein, who was in command, and a report from a field patrol.
Wichert, meanwhile, had requested in a letter that the matter be clarified, reports the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung.
No response has been received so far, he said.
The ministry did not speak on Saturday about the accusations made against it, and noted that this would be clarified in the Federal Parliament's investigative committee, which will be constituted next Wednesday.
Dream worlds
In a state of alertness, some people see images and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
Not only in the case of mentally ill people and drug addicts, the boundaries between imagination and reality are blurred.
As long as it happens during sleep, everything is in order.
When we are lying in our dark rooms with our eyes closed, we can surrender unhindered to the wildest imaginations and creations of fantasy.
However, those who experience sleep-like states during waking, or see and hear things that others do not see or hear, are often considered to be crazy or drug addicts in the modern Western world, or at least as maniacs.
But such images and voices do not only arise in the mentally ill or in the drug addicts.
Guilt is our imagination: the same neural processes that allow us to design houses, paint paintings or write novels, sometimes blur the boundaries between sleep, madness and reality.
The dreamically modified states of alert consciousness can appear in the most diverse forms, at best we call them visions, and at worst, madness.
Although the triggers and effects can be distinguished, the visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the psychedelic experiences of the New Age prophet Carlos Casta<0xC3><0xB1>eda, the states of shamanic possession, and psychoses and hallucinations can be referred to similar processes.
Hallucinations or delusions arise when the balance of neuronal communication substances in the brain — especially dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, and acetylcholine — has been disrupted and the interaction between different parts of the brain is disrupted.
During schizophrenic psychosis, complex hallucinations and crazy thoughts often occur.
Gravity no longer has power over him.
The relationship between madness and sleep has occupied philosophers and physicians since ancient times.
Aristotle conceived hallucinations as a form of waking sleep, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, noted in 1861 a "great similarity of the state of madness with the dream states", for Sigmund Freud, the dream was even "a psychosis, with all the disproses."
It is the fall of 2001, when Henning T. becomes a comic figure.
His body is two-dimensional and scandalously colored.
Gravity no longer has power over it, it is floating near the ceiling of the room.
He feels a kick.
Behind him, figures of demons with wings, with red cheeks like blood, deformed, smearing teeth.
They are chasing him, kicking him with heavy and flaming boots, throwing him against the walls, he feels the pain all over his body.
Sparkling and malignant voices resound from the walls and the radio.
He can no longer stand them, voices that insult and offend him.
Henning T. pulls out two stereo cables, ties them to form a hanging knot, and attaches them to a hook on the ceiling.
It rises in a mouthpiece and puts the knot around the neck.
- Jump.
The rope is loosened.
What a lesson for you!, the voices shout in a choir that turns the timpani, "Come to the clinic and get healed!"
Now, Henning T. is 40 years old and has experienced six acute psychoses, the last two years ago, the first almost 20 years ago.
The cause that caused it was LSD.
His diagnosis is schizophrenic-affective-paranoid psychosis, he is also manic-depressive, taking medications, against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, for three years he is married.
In psychosis I have experienced the most terrible anguish and the deepest despair, he says.
Hallucinations are a cruel reality
Approximately one percent of the population falls ill at least once in the life of schizophrenia; in psychiatric clinics it is treated as the second most common disease after depression.
In acute schizophrenic psychosis, most of the time those affected can no longer distinguish between the outside world and the inside, and they fall into a state of over-excitement that can lead to hallucinations, delusions of grandeur, relationship disorders, or persecution mania.
Especially widespread is the hearing of voices: voices that give orders, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are also common.
The affected person is no longer able to distinguish what is important from what is not, the brain can no longer filter out disturbing signals, consciousness is flooded with impressions.
Like sleep, psychosis opens the door to a torrent of ideas and fantasies that come from the deepest layers of consciousness.
Perception of reality in psychosis is centered on the subject, says professor Thomas Fuchs, chief physician at the general psychiatric clinic at Heidelberg University Hospital.
The schizophrenic is at the center of events, everything has a meaning directed at it.
At the same time, he enters into a passive role, as in a dream, feels overwhelmed by events and cannot actively organize them.
This is why schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled, and manipulated.
In general it is not possible to adjust reality to them, hallucinations are a cruel reality, awakening, impossible.
Having experienced a hallucination once in your life
Unlike in a dream, Fuchs says, “the spatial and sensory structure of reality that is perceived in psychosis remains in principle as it should be.”
Paranoid thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the distancing of experience takes place in reality.
For researchers still an unknown why our brain makes cabriolets.
According to Fuchs, states of exception can lead anyone to temporarily lose contact with reality.
But not everyone develops a psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic disposition for schizophrenia, but studies in twins have shown that in addition to genes, there are also other determining factors.
Researchers assume that those affected suffer minimal brain damage.
We suspect that the brain’s neuronal maturity is affected at an early stage of development, such as through a mother’s viral disease during pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
But it remains an unknown how this alteration of the neural system occurs, which also does not manifest itself at all for many years.
The influence of the environment also plays an important role – stress or a traumatic experience can be the triggers of a psychosis when a previous disposition already exists.
Similarly, hallucinogenic drugs can cause psychosis, as they interfere with the brain’s transmitting system.
When the brain warms up
The illogical thing about all this is that psychotic people suffer from their hallucinations and take very expensive medications to get rid of them, while others pay for drugs that allow them to experience some, says Lübeck professor of psychology Erich Kasten.
Perceiving a hallucination as pleasant or does not often depend on the point of view.
Kasten has been collecting reports on hallucinations and visions for ten years and has analyzed the results in the book Die unreale Welt in unserem Kopf, published last year.
Hallucinations are among the typical accompanying symptoms of psychosis, but also surprisingly, of many other diseases.
Among them are, along with psychic disorders such as personality limit disorder or depression, often also diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's and cranial trauma.
Surprisingly and under certain conditions, the brains of healthy people also suffer from hallucinations.
Hallucinations, according to Kasten, are composed of memories that are usually suppressed.
They arise when the areas of the brain in which sensory perceptions are processed are hyperactive or are poorly inhibited; when our brain is heated, but also when stimuli are lacking.
Drugs can cause this condition in the same way as brain damage or a psychosis.
But also restriction of stimuli, stress, bad love or other brain states of exception.
In recent studies, up to a third of respondents reported having experienced hallucinations at least once in their lifetime.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. was 16 years old, living in a small town in Mecklenburg-West Pomerania and attending a secondary school.
An ordinary girl.
If it wasn't for those pictures and voices.
Sometimes, during recreation, it happens that a dull boy with long dark hair directs the word to him.
When she answers, the other students look at her surprised; no one but her hears or sees the boy.
They think the shy girl is a little strange dreamer, but Sarah K. knows she's not dreaming.
She is awake and comes and hears that boy, just as she sees and hears the girl sitting on the next bench.
You may even feel his presence, at least for a few moments.
It's a nice feeling, he likes the guy.
Sometimes you wonder if you’re crazy.
He also knows that the boy and the rest of the visions are not real and disappear.
At night, apparitions are alarming.
Visions are often a burden.
When he is in class sometimes he cannot follow the lesson because the teacher – to his eyes and ears – is presenting a new companion, while for the rest he explains the mathematical equations in a visible and audible way.
At night, apparitions are alarming.
While waiting in the dark room for the sleep to arrive, which often comes late and is scarce, he does not know whether he is awake or dreaming, whether the images he sees, the cheeks or the girl with bloody cuts on her arms and legs, appear in front of her eyes open or closed.
Leave me alone, he yells at the figures.
He hasn't told his parents and friends anything, they'd think he's crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
She passed selectivity last year and lives with her boyfriend.
A year ago, the hallucinations disappeared.
Since she has come into contact over the Internet with psychologist Kasten, she knows she’s not crazy.
Madness is also a work of art by desperation.
According to Kasten, when a person is socially isolated or suffers from a restriction of stimuli, it is very likely that after a while they will begin to have hallucinations.
I think the brain is out of work and is in charge of looking for entertainment.
Sarah K., only daughter, was little afraid of the other children and often played alone.
His hallucinations began when, at the age of 13, he learned that the man he calls dad since he uses reason is not his biological father.
Since visual and acoustic hallucinations are active in the same areas of the brain that also process real impressions and noises, those affected like Sarah K. find it difficult to distinguish between visions and reality. "Every experience," Kasten says, " takes place in the brain, reality is projected there.
Hallucinations are also images that the brain produces, which is why they seem so real.”
Kasten also classifies nocturnal fantasies as a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people do not differ fundamentally from those of acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenics, mentally healthy people are able to recognize their visions as unreal.
Kasten therefore recommends that patients appreciate their hallucinations as a special skill.
The boundary between sleep and hallucination
In this overly conscious world, imaginary experiences usually pathologize, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor at Heidelberg and chief physician at the psychiatry and psychotherapy clinic at Florence-Nightingale-Krankenhauses Hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a hard and painful disease but it also entails something positive and creative – madness is a work of desperation.
Schmidt-Degenhard has researched so-called oneirism, a special form of consciousness, which is perceived as a dream.
Dream hallucinations are almost very complex and detailed dreams that the person who experiences them considers real and that can subsequently not differentiate from being awake.
Dream conscious states arise in extreme situations associated with trauma or disease, such as in patients with polyradiculoneuropathy, who experience motor paralysis being fully conscious. die bei vollem Bewusstsein erleben eine motorische Lähmung.
According to Schmidt-Degenhardt, when a person is threatened by a loss of himself or the world due to a total and permanent motor disability, it replaces a very dangerous real situation with a self-imaginary world that is decoupled from reality.
A form of situation boundary between sleep and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to overcome a situation in reality, a world change occurs, although the real situation is still present in the imagination.
An intensive way of giving meaning and interpretation to a situation in itself that our own ability to create allows us not to sink into the nothingness of loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in memory
Also the art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen of Zurich describes his dream experiences in his book Herzenwechsel as an action to save the soul.
He was 49 years old, when his conscience embarked on several-day trips after a heart valve surgery with a heart transplant included, while his body was doomed to immobility at the intensive care station.
Claussen dived into a world created by him and visited strange places of other times: he was seen lying in bed, an older man aboard a sanatorium on a train, a robot was watching over his health.
It was seen in the High Middle Ages, surrounded by nobles who produced narcotics from blood.
A Greek man on a motorcycle kidnapped him in his home country, surfed his hospital bed in the Alps with firn snow and met a Korean mobster.
It gives everything in these imaginary facts, everything is real, even later in the memories.
For Claussen, these inner journeys are fundamentally different from any dream.
Dreaming is a different state, thus describing your experience.
On the contrary, the memories of mental journeys are, many years later, much clearer, even in irrelevant details.
Clearer and more intense even than real experiences.
The intensity of this experience dilutes the horizon of the rest of our daily experiences, adds psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Finally, oneirism, psychosis, hallucinations, and drug use show how fragile the inner reproduction of outer reality is, even when we are awake.
Each modification of the state of consciousness, summarizes Kasten, "can lead to a deformation of what we call reality."
An experience that, on the other hand, can be completely enriching.
The snow can come
Here.
The children will take over the editorial office at 27 years old.
The new editor Kallen has come to a provisional solution: Hubert Burda wants to leave his company in the future in the hands of his two children, he told SPIEGEL.
100% of the holding will also be in the hands of the family.
Hamburg – Editor Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children in the future.
The two sons become heirs at the age of 27 and have a strong desire to enter the company, Burda, 69, confirmed to SPIEGEL.
The details have been arranged as a precautionary measure.
The next question is whether they will actively participate in the company.
Also, if they are trained for it.
One cannot put 7,500 workers in front of one’s children if they are not sufficiently trained to do so.
That would end the children and also the company.
Burda announced on Thursday that he will retire from the chairmanship of the board in January and that Paul-Bernhard Kallen has been appointed his successor.
This 52-year-old member of the Kallen family has been a member of the management of Burda since 1999.
At first he was responsible for the technology.
After the departure of Jürgen Todenhöfer, he also took over direct marketing, foreign marketing, printing and finance, and was responsible for the company’s assets.
For the first time, no member of the family occupies the cusp of the editorial board.
The children of Burda are 19 and 17 years old, and their son Felix, who would now be 42 years old, died a few years ago.
Kallen's designation also serves to, "save the differences of 10, 15 years," according to Burda.
100% of the holding will also be in the hands of the family.
Looking at the Schickedanz and Schaeffle cases, Burda stated that family businesses are also not safe from decadence: “This has always affected families who are let down by the desire for capital, who have misjudged and thought they could rise as well as the biggest player.
That has never been my strategy.
I’ve never had “great delusions of grandeur,” Burda says.
I don’t see myself as a political predator of this country, as Springer was, and I don’t want to play with Time in the World League either; those businesses have become too big.
Integral Beauty
Everything you can wish for – in terms of beauty and well-being – at your fingertips.
This seems to have been proposed El Corte Inglés, which has just opened in the shopping center of Callao (Madrid) a multidisciplinary space of more than 1000 m2 dedicated to the care and care of the body.
The spa, located on the eighth floor, has prestigious signatures such as Hedonai - who is in charge of laser hair removal-; Spaxi<0xC3><0xB3>n, with relaxation rooms and aesthetic treatments; Luis & Tachi hairdressers; Marina d'Or, which has a gym, or L'Occitane and its natural cosmetics, among others.
There is also a feeding section, where the teapot stands out, with more than 130 different classes of this infusion.
Enjoy a relaxing massage with your partner while you contemplate the stunning views of the capital, or rent the relaxation area for two hours to set up your own 'beauty party' with eight of your friends and relax with a jacuzzi session, massages and a glass of champagne are some of the possibilities Spaxi offers.
In total they are 250 m2 distributed in 12 rooms to perform the latest and most novel facial, body and hydrotherapy treatments.
For example, cavitation to combat cellulite or vibration platforms.
The gym also has these machines, as well as virtual 'trainers' who guide the steps of the customers, offering them a fully personalized treatment.
It all starts by entering your personal key on a touch screen, located in front of the machine.
So, several videos show us how to properly perform our exercise table.
Your director assures that 15 minutes (including warm-up and stretching) are enough to exercise all the muscles in the body.
And, if after exercising our body, we want to go through the hairdressing, the firm Luis & Tachi has a room where rituals of hair recovery, luminosity or nutrition are offered in a personalized way.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to have been the premises of this urban spa, which will be open every day of the year, from 10:00 a.m. to 22:00 p.m.
Varied necklaces
Christmas is approaching and it is never too late to review the looks of the stars to adapt them to our party outfit.
The shape of the neckline, very important to enhance the silhouette, is one of the variables that we must take into account.
Here are a few suggestions.
The singer Fergie chose an exaggerated and very complicated neckline. It is not very advisable.
Endesa and Barcelona, with the electric car
The electrical company Endesa, together with the City Council of Barcelona, have created the 'LIVE Office'.
It is a project to develop and promote the electric vehicle in the Catalan capital.
The ‘LIVE Office’ (Logistics for Electric Vehicle Implementation) will define and coordinate the roadmap for the deployment of the electric car in the city and will reach agreements on mobility, managing, coordinating, presenting grants, etc.
On the other hand, it will develop the MOVELE project, promote the electric car, collect the opinion and work of the sectors involved.
In short, it is intended to drive what will be the transport of the future.
3 'Electric cities'
But Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the implementation of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville join the project.
These are the three cities chosen by the government, within the MOVELE Plan, to boost the deployment of the electric vehicle.
The electrical company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Generalitat of Catalonia.
The aim is to promote research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
Among these would be activities related to energy and in particular to energy efficiency.
It is not the only initiative in which Endesa participates in the promotion of the electric vehicle.
The company participates in standardization groups at European level and has assets in a number of complementary projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees 'a calm horizon' for the engine sector
The president of the government, José Luis Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Zapatero, glimpses "a horizon of tranquility" for the Spanish automotive industry, which, he recalled, is the main export sector of the country.
In the presentation of the 2009 Economic Report of the President of the Government, Zapatero reviewed the measures the Executive has put in place throughout the fiscal year to support the automotive sector.
“Without the Automotive Competitiveness Plan, today we would have a landscape of abandonment, closure of some of our main production plants,” the president said.
"Thanks to this plan and the availability of brands to follow in Spain, in a very competitive sector, we can have a calm horizon for the future of this industry, which is our main export sector," he added.
In this regard, he recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, included in the Comprehensive Automotive Plan (PIA), allocated 800 million to projects from 19 manufacturers and 137 auxiliary companies, which mobilised an investment of more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3 billion.
The Chief Executive explained that this investment was committed both to the development of new models and to modernizing existing products and processes.
Zapatero also emphasized the governmental demand support measures, in reference to Plan 2000E, implemented in collaboration with the autonomous communities and automotive brands.
According to the president, this plan has allowed to reduce the average emissions of new vehicles marketed in the Spanish market by 6% and has led to a "strong increase" in registrations, which grew "40 percent" in November.
20,000 square meters of classic vehicles
The first edition of the International Classic Vehicle Show will be held in Madrid, a meeting place for professionals and motor mounting enthusiasts.
This initiative will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 at the Crystal Pavilion of the Casa de Campo de Madrid.
It is an exhibition area of 20,000 square meters in which there will be more than 200 national and international exhibitors.
Not only will it be possible to find motorcycles and classic cars, but at ClassicAuto Madrid you will find articles of all kinds related to the world of the engine.
Thus, among the exhibitors of the pavilion, you can find accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, accessories, publications, miniatures, etc.
Hundreds of articles related to the world of the classic engine that will delight collectors and curious.
Among the participating companies will be, among others, Mos Classics and Good Old Times, car sales; Juan Lumbreras, restoration; Coupe-Francisco Pueche sale and restoration of cars; or Cochera Cl<0xC3><0xA1>sicos, specialist Mercedes Benz.
Evidence of Ability Outside
In addition, the commercial activity of this Hall will be completed with parallel activities: holding concentrations, sports exhibitions, skill tests, presentations and competitions.
Skill tests with classic cars and motorcycles will also be carried out on a circuit enabled outside the fairground.
Mazda3 i-Stop: sustainable sports
Mazda wants to show that sportsmanship is not tainted with respect for the environment.
Therefore, the Mazda3 has just incorporated the engine stop and start system – dubbed i-Stop –, a device that at least for the moment is only available with the gasoline 2.0 engine with 150 horsepower.
This second generation of the Mazda3 stands out for the good score achieved as a whole.
The finishes, the finish of the vehicle, the habitability, the behavior, the mechanics, the i-Stop system...
All these aspects are outstanding in the new Mazda3.
Starting with the driving position, we check that the front boots have excellent ergonomics and grip.
The touch of the steering wheel is also exquisite.
Continuing with the set formed by the box of instruments and the console we see how Mazda has continued the Japanese trend of creating a futuristic interior design, with a lot of buttons and controls and striking colors in red and blue.
This style reminds us, in part, of the one that the Honda Civic also presents.
Therefore, we can say that both the Mazda3 and Civic, both Japanese, contrast with the sobriety of German products, and more specifically the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to beat.
Continuing with the cabin, this compact Japanese features more than enough habitability for four adults to travel with a high level of comfort.
In addition to this, there is a large luggage compartment with regular shapes.
The engine’s automatic stop and start system, at least for the moment, is only available with the two-liter, 150-hp petrol engine and the six-speed manual transmission.
This engine is a true delight. It excels for its fineness, for its reduced noise, for its performance and for achieving a contented consumption.
Although the most sought-after Mazda3 will be diesel versions, those who do not make a high number of kilometers a year should not rule out this i-Stop with gasoline engine, both for its high driving comfort, and for its content consumption.
As for the level of equipment, the version chosen for the test is called Sportive, that is, the one that incorporates a greater number of serial elements.
Particularly from the standard equipment stands out the rail change assistant (RVM) which eliminates dead angle, traction and stability controls, speed control, photosensitive interior mirror, on-board computer on a large screen, pullantoo parking sensors, independent air conditioner and bluffs, rain and rain sensor.
In addition, if its equipment was small, this version was equipped with the Premium Pack, which adds for 1,500 euros: adaptive headlights benzene and BOSE sound system with disk charger, among other elements.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact cars in the category.
It stands out especially for the quality of the materials used, for their behavior and for the high level of equipment.
In addition, those who do not drive many kilometers a year will be able to opt for this version i-Stop, associated only with the gasoline 2.0 engine of 150 horsepower.
The only drawback of this model is its high price, which is between the 21,770 euros of the Luxury finish and the 23,270 euros of the tested version -Sportive-.
In exchange for this high figure, the Mazda3 will offer us every day large doses of satisfaction.
"Premier" of luxury
L.A. covers the red carpet of sensuality by the hands of Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars dazzled more than ever wrapped up in models as elegant as 'sexys' at the premiere of 'Nine'. (Photos: Gtresonline).
Our 'Pe', as sophisticated as usual, opted for a dark 'lady'.
The Promise of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, a device that only serves to view mail, without even being able to see certain types of attachments or browse the network.
He enjoyed his five minutes of fame in the U.S. when Time magazine named him one of the products of the year.
Seeing it on the street is harder, actually, but the idea can be interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek has a very low price and a very low monthly fee, less than half of what is paid for, for example, by the iPhone’s data plan.
Given the success the company has brought out two new devices: one exclusively designed for Twitter, the other with a free lifetime data service in exchange for paying six times more for the Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the Le Web event, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
It is just as limited as its American counterpart, but comes with a surprise.
The monthly maintenance price, around 12 euros per month, includes roaming throughout Europe.
Those traveling with a smartphone already know what it is to have to give up data when crossing the border or desperately look for a cafe with WiFi (or a Fon connection) to be able to check the mail.
The idea of a fixed price roaming is incredibly attractive and has long been going on.
Yes, some operators have special arrangements and travel plans, but in my experience it takes a PhD in physics to understand them and good glasses to read the small letter.
The European Commission’s repeated earbuds to achieve affordable roaming rates across Europe have barely had a noticeable effect.
Outside of the country of origin there is fear of using the data, and rightly so.
That an appliance like FonPeek (it is curious that it bears the name Fon when it lacks Wifi) gets this type of fees means that operators start to think differently and study different proposals with which to amortize their data network.
Kindle is another good example, including book download traffic and other Internet queries.
No contracts and no loopholes.
It’s a connected device and you pay for it when you buy it, not month by month.
And that’s what I hope to see someday with FonPeek, a lifetime-access buying option like the one Peek already has in the US.
Not because you're going to buy it.
I look at my email on the phone, thank you.
I hope so because I believe it is a fairer model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with this same system.
Michelle's fetish color
Yellow is, without a doubt, the first lady’s favorite tone.
If he has already come to the possession of Barack Obama as President of the United States in a dress and a coat of this color, he has chosen the same to accompany him on, undoubtedly, the second most important moment of his life: the collection in Oslo of the Nobel Peace Prize.
Michelle Obama has worn a very similar model on both occasions: in addition to being a similar color – greenish yellow with bright reflections – the two times the outfit consisted of three pieces – dress, jacket and coat of the same fabric – and was adorned with a large embroidery or necklace.
So much so, that at first glance it seemed that the first lady of the United States followed the footsteps of the Princess of Asturias and had chosen to repeat dressage.
But the fabric in which the two suits are made makes them very different.
If for the possession I was dealing with a fat lace, in Oslo it is a velvet with print.
The complements have also varied: half-heeled green shoes again, and a similar model, but in gold, now.
And equally different is the hairstyle: a collection this time, melena releases the previous one.
75% of working mothers have had work problems due to their maternity
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for women of younger generations who want to be mothers.
This is revealed by the study 'Fecundity and work trajectory of women in Spain', developed by the CSIC in collaboration with the Institute of Women.
The survey of 9,737 women aged 15 to 75 leaves no doubt: 75 per cent of working mothers have seen limited opportunities in the workplace due to maternity.
The study points out that there are many differences in the start of coexistence in a couple and the number of children, depending on whether they work or not and the type of work they develop.
Those who do not have an out-of-home activity, work part-time, or have an unstable job, start cohabitation as a couple earlier, advance first maternity, and have more children.
On the contrary, women with stable employment, mainly in the public sector, delay cohabitation and maternity, and have fewer offspring.
“Women aged 35 to 49 with a fixed job have their first child, on average, 3.7 years after starting cohabitation, a figure that increases to 4.1 women with a fixed job have needed more time to achieve them, which has led them to postpone the union and the arrival of children.
In addition, the type of work performed exerts a lot of influence on maternity, albeit less on the timing of mating,” explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of study is another factor that differentiates the age of women when they get married and when they have the first stem.
According to the survey, the higher the educational level, the higher the age at which they marry and have the first child.
The difference is also maintained between women of the same generation.
For example, in the 35-49-year-old group, those who have elementary and higher studies have been mothers for the first time at 25.1 and 32.1 on average respectively.
“There is also another division among women based on their level of study.
While those who have elementary studies get married and have their first child before getting a stable job, those at middle or higher levels invest in this sequence and give priority to getting a stable job as a precondition for marriage and the arrival of a child,” Delgado says.
Diane Kruger is worth it.
L’Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its envious list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will become the image of different products of the brand, tuning the universal motto of 'Because I Worth It'.
The protagonist of 'Joyeux Noël', one of the most elegant actresses on the international scene, joins other famous L'Oréal Paris outlets, such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penelope Cruz.
Before her, the last to enter such a select club were actresses Evangeline Lilly ('Lost') and Freida Pinto ('Slumdog Millionaire').
In the men's section, the cosmetics brand also features luxury ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey ('Grey's Anatomy') and Matthew Fox (Evangeline's partner in 'Lost').
Category: British Fashion Awards
The British have a lot to say in the fashion world.
Their top representatives – designers and models, yesterday and today – met at the annual awards ceremony, which was held in London, at the Royal Court of Justice.
No one was missing at the meeting.
Former model Jerry Hall and her daughter, Georgia May Jagger, voted Best Model of the Year.
Manuel Vicent's Poker
Manuel Vicente gives in 'Poker de aces' (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente) thirty x-rays of writers who have gone through his literary life (and, in some cases, also by the other).
It does not do so in predictable and fearsome genres (biographical resemblance, life and work), but rather looking for something similar to the ignition nucleus of the creator character.
The journey has its excitements and Vicente does not spare fears or illumination.
In addition to exquisite pleasure, the book is a moving invitation to reading and reading.
Let me give you a few moments.
Albert Camus: “In his pages I discovered that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual impulse, almost physical, the same that I felt without giving it a name: pleasure against accusative destiny, morality without guilt, and innocence without any gods.”
“Nihilist, allegorical Christian, wrote what he had in his blood, not in his intellect, between impotence and ignorance, with a dazzling poetic humor, meaningless, like the blade of the knife that was about to kill him.”
Graham Greene: “Our man was abducted by this woman with a passion that lasted thirteen years, in whose flesh he combined the emotion of adultery with the pleasure of remorse, a spiritual privilege that consisted in reaching heaven through the path of perdition.”
About James Joyce: "The 'Ulyses' was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the eight thousand-meter peaks of universal literature, which must be climbed by the north wall, from which the best climbers are detached again and again."
About William Faulkner: "He was a rare guy.
Of himself, he sometimes said that he was heir to a county landlord and others that he was the son of a black woman and a crocodile.
Both of my dreams were grandiose.”
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer picked up the demented scream thrown from a bridge by that Munich character to take his echo to the bottom of the twentieth century in his literary form and did so on a journey fleeing from himself and invoking posterity with a violent discourse to worms."
Dorothy Parker once said, “One day she got down on her knees and prayed, ‘Dear God, I beg you to stop writing like a woman.’
About Joseph Conrad: "On his tomb were engraved the following verses of Spenser: 'The dream after the effort, / after the storm the port, / the rest after the war, / after life tired pleases death."
About Virginia Wolf: "In the suitcase she also brought her depressions.
The husband accepted with all normality that she would tell her that Edward VII was spying on her among the azaleas or that the birds were singing in Greek.
There has never been a case of a man so patient and in love with a neurotic whose literary talent was ahead of his madness.
About P<0xC3><0xAD>o Baroja: "What did Mart<0xC3><0xAD>n-Santos do but try to inoculate Joyce in Baroja?
What did Benet try but pass to Baroja for Faulkner's weapons?
What did Cela do but abduct that man’s fame so that he could serve as his own pedestal?”
Cowardly Aggression
Last week, my mother, about 70 years old, was walking through our neighborhood in the municipality of Fuenlabrada when a group of young people between 15 and 18 years old passed by her and our dog, a specimen of mestizo breed, rescued from the kennel and with no more than six kilos of weight and, without a word, they gave him two paws.
Our outrage is capital because we do not find the fun in a free assault on a small, defenseless animal, which by the way, was tied up.
To this must be added the suffocation that caused a lady who was walking quietly and who, when he incredulized these individuals, came to fear for their physical integrity, since an energetic man who attacks an animal, is able to do the same with a woman, a child, an old man or, ultimately, with anyone who is weaker than himself.
The event occurred at five o’clock in the afternoon of any Tuesday by a traditionally quiet neighborhood.
The dog was crying all day.
By the way, we put a complaint at a nearby police station that we doubt that it will serve for a long time and not generate susceptibility, only to clarify that the cowards murdered were Spanish.
The outrage has led us to denounce this fact.
We don’t understand what’s happening among young people to consider it fun to treat a defenseless animal for free that gives us love, companionship and friendship.
We do not know where good education and respect for animals and people have been left.
Michelin and Fesvial together for helmet use
The tyre manufacturer Michelin, with the collaboration of the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to promote the use of the helmet, mainly among the youngest drivers, both entities reported today.
This initiative aims to raise awareness about the importance of wearing the helmet, as it is the only protective element capable of preventing head injuries or even death in the event of an accident while riding a motorcycle.
Michelin said the campaign is part of its commitment to road safety, which “goes beyond designing and manufacturing products that are safer every day” and that it also contributes to this goal through other pedagogical and informational actions.
This new campaign to promote the use of the helmet on motorcycles, under the motto 'To be or not to be', will have a first phase in which posters will be distributed in more than 500 motorcycle workshops, with the aim of achieving maximum dissemination.
Lastly, Michelin stressed that road safety “is a constant concern” for the company, since as a manufacturer of two-wheeler tyres, one of its main goals is to develop increasingly safe products.
Increases the sale of light commercials
Almost two years later, the light commercial vehicle market begins to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9,425 units registered in November in Spain represent a 12.6% increase over 2008 and, most importantly, the first increase after 22 consecutive months of declines, according to figures from the employers of Anfac manufacturers and Ganvam sellers.
The good, not obvious, data should be put in quarantine since the reference with which the comparison is made - November 2008- was particularly bad, with a decrease of 60% compared to the previous year.
As a consequence, despite the rebound of the last month, the registrations accumulated in these 11 months are 40% below those of the previous fiscal year.
Since January, 95,853 units have been sold, together with all the vehicles that make up the tailor-made drawer of light commercials: passenger cars, pick-up products, vans, light vans and light trucks/chassis.
Also, the clouds that most affect their demand have not disappeared, because although they are also purchased by individuals, the majority of purchases are made by small and medium-sized enterprises, which pay in almost 100% of cases through external financing.
Thus, to the restrictions imposed by the closed tap of bank credits, other factors such as the increase in unemployment levels or the persistence of the poor economic situation must be added.
In the face of this panorama and unlike the cars, the aid to purchase the 2000E has little benefited.
They can be accommodated, in addition to individuals, self-employed and SMEs who are going to acquire a light commercial of up to 3.5 tons with a level of CO2 emissions not exceeding 160 grams per kilometre, but the number of operations has been testimony.
Yesterday, from Ganvam they recalled the need to pay special attention by the Administration to these vehicles and also to the industrialists (trucks and buses).
The association of sellers predicts a 2010 similar to the year that ends, for which it calculates a drop in sales (of cars and 4x4) of 19%.
Emergency braking assistance is now mandatory.
As with ABS anti-lock brakes and ESP stability control, emergency braking assistance systems will have to be a mandatory element in European cars.
In fact, they are already in all new registered cars and light commercial vehicles, while for the rest a period of deficiency is fixed until the end of February 2011.
The measure, imposed by the European Union, aims to increase the protection of pedestrians, although, because of their way of working, it can also help to avoid many collisions within range.
The emergency braking assistant does what it does is to increase the pressure on the brakes in case of an emergency, which the system detects by the pistol that the driver gives.
But it does not always hold that pressure until the end.
According to a study carried out by car component manufacturer Bosch, one-third of drivers involved in an accident had not come to the brake before the collision and half of them did not take full advantage of the force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The intervention of the aid, on the other hand, requires the maximum to the braking system, reducing the distance that the car uses in stopping.
According to an EU study, if all cars were equipped with these types of elements, up to 1,100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be prevented per year.
The reduction will be even greater – it is estimated that one in four accidents with damage to people would be avoided – when so-called intelligent emergency braking systems become popular.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system that (via a radar or camera) detects obstacles and alerts the driver, in addition to acting lightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, it helps by increasing the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
In case it does not react, and even if the collision is inevitable, the device exerts maximum effort on the brakes to minimize damage.
General Motors delays plans for Opel until January
While the workers at the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) have already been notified by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, that production of the new Meriva will begin in the first week of April - probably the 8th - according to reports Javier Ortega, the opt-out time needed to warn the plant will go.
What Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, wants is that each of the points in the plan has been previously agreed by the affected party.
And this may cause the final document to be submitted to workers first and then to the governments of the countries where there are factories, to be delayed until the beginning of 2010.
Instead, GM ensures that a decision on the sale of Saab should be made in the coming days.
This is not surprising that the Swedish government has increased pressure on the US manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to having contact with some new potential buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who is also aspiring to acquire Volvo, but it takes the pick of the Dutch sports car maker Skyper, which is backed by the Russian Converg group.
In case there was no agreement with either of them, GM could sell some of Saab’s assets to China’s Baic.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year is maintained if it is not sold.
At the wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
To develop its latest, and expensive jewel, Porsche engineers took the Boxster S as the basis and managed to lose no less than 80 kilograms, which has left the scale at only 1,275 kilograms.
This led them to dispense, first of all, with the automatic ceiling that has been supplied by one of canvas with manual drive, thus saving 21 kilos; using aluminum doors like those of the GT3, 'fall' another 15; removing the air conditioner, 13; removing the air conditioner, 13; reducing the fuel tank with other pulleys by 12 kilos, the fuel tanks were increased from 64 to 54 liters.
Finally, giving up the CDR-30 audio system added another six kilograms and changing the door handles for some fabric, the remaining kilograms.
Although also offered with the dual clutch PDK gearbox, the test was carried out on a unit with the six-speed manual box, mainly on California secondary roads, in mountain stretches with really reversed tracks.
Their behavior can only be described as intact.
Weight reduction does not mean that the car does not pave the asphalt with aplomb.
Rather, quite the opposite: for a long time we had not tested a model so small and light that, at the same time, it conveyed so much safety in the curved passage, even at high speeds.
He is a small athlete, able to warm his muscles in a short stride for the necessary time, until we order him to squeeze, to brake, to recover and to repress his motor...
Thanks to its direction, as communicative as it is, what we point with our hands on the steering wheel is what the car will do.
And it will do so with surgical precision.
Sound of the engine at will
The sound of its V6 boxer, with 320 horsepower (10 more than the Boxster S) is very successful and can be enhanced with the option 'sport' and through a system that modifies the engine tinkering, already previously released in the Panamera.
The acceleration capacity is brutal, either from standstill or in recovery.
The suspensions are firm, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt of the roads we crossed with the Boxster Spyder was quite punished, but the car digested the bumps well.
The electronic aids barely made a presence throughout the journey; and that in some of the curves we found ice at dawn and gravel, already in the morning.
In short, an ultra-light car, one of the most fun to drive that one can on the market and that is more than just a simple modification of the Boxster S.
The car will go on sale in February 2010, at a price of 70,831 euros.
"Bag Girl"
Intimate of Karl Lagerfeld, image of the Coco Cocoon line and occasional 'starlette' of the 'maison' parades, the singer prodigies her bag face with as emptiness as her Chanel bags.
More than 'Bad Girl' or 'It Girl', it's a 'Bag Girl'.
Baskonia wins victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral achieved a brilliant victory by 82-91 in his visit to the complicated field of the Maccabi Electra, despite the numerous lows that the team of Dusko Ivanovic had, and thus he is in the leadership of his group, after the great performance of Mirza Teletovic (who was his best team of eight years).
The Victorian team was able to supplement the important absences of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with large doses of involvement and collective work although it had to suffer to the end to make up for the victory.
In addition, the big hit from the perimeter, with 16 triples scored had a lot to do in the final triumph.
The match started face-to-face for the bluegrans, who put themselves from the start ahead on the scoreboard.
That the first four baskets of the Victorians were from the perimeter was already presuming that they had jumped into the Israeli field with hot dolls.
English and Teletovic were the main artists from 18-20 at the end of the first partial.
The second quarter was more of the same, but the alavés team opted for Barac's inner game and Eliyahu's work, which was greeted with pits and applause on the return to his home, to continue expanding his lead to rest (34-43).
Teletovic was already starting to stand out as the best of his team with 13 points, although the 'minus six' rating of Splitter already presumably was not going to be the best night of the Brazilian.
But the party, despite being in charge of the rest, was not decided much less and the Maccabees wanted to remind the Victorians that no one wins in their field, and with 'the hand of Elias' squeezing they managed to get into the party.
Eidson and Pnini contributed decisively to the 'yellow' turning the luminous (50-49).
More inconveniences
Those of Ivanovic, wounded but not much less dead, needed to shove a couple of strokes with success to catch air, and in those came the machine gun of Mirza Teletovic, who with three almost consecutive triples and the help of English and Ribas returned the marker to a reassuring rent third (they-on-end the locals, 54-67).
The Alaves went out to leave their skin in the last partial and English and San Emeterio (60-75) already warned that they were not going to let anyone take away what they had deserved during the first thirty minutes.
However, Pnini and Eidson, the best of their team did not resign and tried to keep their team alive from the three-point line (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter eliminated due to fouls, Ivanovic's did not rush, defended well, and although the Israelis approached in the final minute (80-85), the match already owned and the victory escaped Tel Aviv for the first time in the season.
Injuries Prevent Battle for Unicaja
The Unicaja lost sharply in Greece to Olympiacos and gave him the lead of group B of the Euroleague, in a game marked by the lows of the boxers, especially in the domestic game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
The Malagasy team was not frightened by the atmosphere of the pavilion of Peace and Friendship and also by the entity of the rival, perhaps the most powerful in Europe and with a large budget.
The game shown in the first quarter allowed the Andalusians to dream. An aggressive defense and three consecutive triples, two from the base Omar Cook and one from Guillem Rubio, darkened the locals 12-18, minute 9.
The Olympiacos were surprised by the intensity of the Unicaja, although the locals' arsenal in the indoor game with Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, turned the scorer 22-20, minute 13, at which point an action, connoted fighting, between the two American bases the Beverley and Williams suppification the playoffs.
The Greek ensemble began to function by showing its superiority within both zones, where the low by injury of the English pivot Joel Freeland and the three personal flaws of Carlos Jimenez, were burdening the cashiers.
Between insiders and Lithuanian forward Linas Kleizas, with their triples, increased the lead 44-32, minute 19.
An Impossible Resurrection
The third period was very offensive with Olympiacos, who despite 19 losses, showed superior and even came to equal the difference of the match played in M<0xC3><0xA1>laga 66-48, minute 27, which made the group's leadership tumble.
The Unicaja attempted to overcome the absences and the last downhill of the Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, injured during the encounter.
Despite all the drawbacks, the Unicaja for Cook's direction and triples, and Lewis's contribution, left some hope 66-57, minute 31.
But it was practically impossible because the Olympiacos when he squeezed and given his superiority in centimeters within the area was unstoppable.
Croatian pivot Nikola Vujcic managed to climb the basketball average 81-62, 37th minute, and the Unicaja went off, handing the lead to Olympiacos.
How much should you charge for your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can know the salary they deserve according to their profile, thanks to a new application of Trovit, the search engine with the highest number of classified ads of real estate, employment and engine in Spain.
The How much should you charge? tool calculates the salaries of users from the more than 140,000 job offers that Trovit has in Spain, from a form available on Facebook, where they should enter their profession, years of experience, age and city where they want to work.
In the week the app is running, the search engine has detected that in general the Spanish worker "feels poorly paid," Trovit's product manager, Albert Ribera, said in a statement.
According to data from Trovit’s search engines in the UK and France, Spaniards are the worst paid.
A British computer programmer charges 45,226 euros gross annually and a French one, 31,059, compared to the 24,000 that a Spanish receives.
Similarly, a driver charges 34,247 euros net per year in England, 25,751 in France and 16,420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the worst paid job in Spain is that of waiter, with 11,592 euros net per year; followed by dependent, with 14,725 euros; and operator, with 15,667 euros.
The most sought-after jobs on the network in the last three months are those of the driver, the part-time jobs and the social worker.
Brazil sets a date for Zelaya’s departure
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya’s stay at his embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The deposed president must leave the diplomatic legation no later than January 27, 2010, when he officially concludes his term.
Francisco Catunda, head of business at Brazil’s embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that “Mel” knows he must leave before that date at the embassy, where he has been a refugee since September 21.
“He is aware that he has to leave on January 27, when he finishes his term, he has to look for another destination.”
The broadcaster also cited the former president, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the deadline: "My position is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the support of the Brazilian government," Zelaya said by phone.
Following the November 29 election (which resulted in Porfirio Lobo being elected), Zelaya said he would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, this same week he tried to seek refuge in Brazil.
The operation was ultimately frustrated by Zelaya’s rejection of the political asylum status that the de facto government chaired by Roberto Micheletti intended to impose on him.
Thank you very much
After the days of wine and roses since last spring when asset inflation has been the dominant tonic in the markets, again uncertainty reappears in the markets, which should not be surprising since it is their natural state, in an environment where agents make decisions about the future by nature uncertain.
The medicine used by central banks to stabilize markets was to monetize debt by directly buying assets and indirectly giving free cash bar to near-zero rates for financial institutions to buy assets to discount.
Central banks have already confirmed that direct asset purchases are almost over and, without questioning their heterodox liquidity policy, they are starting to throw some sand into the gears like the ECB did with its year-to-year auction next week.
Therefore, investors are doubting the ability of the global economy to maintain economic recovery without such heterodox measures and we are witnessing a reversal of risk premium reduction.
Exchange volatility and corporate bond differentials have rebounded, although they are still far from the paranormal levels they reached earlier this year.
The states were forced to socialize private risk and public debt was again affected.
Once again there is a flight to quality and the US, Japan and Germany have been the haven chosen by investors, causing an expansion of the differentials of the eurozone countries with respect to Germany.
Spain had hardly been affected by this episode of instability but Standard & Poor's came in and threatened with a further downgrade of the Kingdom of Spain rating.
On the other hand, some uncertainty is not bad enough to appease the moral risk advocates who were trying to recreate a position of consciousness on those responsible for world economic policy for having curbed the destructive effects of the credit restriction on job destruction, when what would have to be done is to decree a new day of reckoning.
However, Dubai paints a tribal struggle between the emirs to recompose power in the emirate and Greece we have already seen it before.
A government that hides public deficits, elections, and a new government that pulls the blanket.
Prodi did it in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Dur<0xC3><0xA3>o Barroso.
It makes no sense for the Ecofin to save Hungary from a breach of its external payments at the beginning of the year and for it to allow a member of the euro to breach its commitments.
What makes sense is that the Ecofin has forced the Greek Government to be transparent and to make its citizens co-responsible for the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we expect, we are faced with an episode of transient risk premium normalization, after some excesses in leveraged positions, it would be within what is expected.
In the case of Spain, while our public debt differentials widen as well as European corporate bonds, we should not worry.
If European differentials decrease and ours continue to expand, then it would be a Spanish idiosyncratic risk.
Standard & Poor's is an anecdote. When our advanced indicators are forcing most of the study services to anticipate their recovery scenarios and revise upwards their scenario for 2011, including the OECD and the European Commission, they hope to come back to life with a Japanese advent scenario for the non-Spanish economy.
Again, it has all the pint that will be an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish assets, although for the time being "prudence, friend driver".
Related Sectors
The president of Iberdrola, Ignacio S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Gal<0xC3><0xA1>n, was the first to speak yesterday before the subcommittee of the Congress of Deputies in which the energy strategy of Spain in the next two decades is being debated these days.
Following his intervention, followed by that of the president of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Gal<0xC3><0xA1>n gave the press some brushstrokes of what he had raised in the closed-door subcommittee.
For the president of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>50 billion by 2020 and another <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60 billion between that date and 2030, as long as the nuclear power plants remain open today.
If not, the necessary investments will not be 60 billion, but up to 95 billion.
However, Iberdrola believes that in the next decade, investments should not be aimed at increasing capacity in generation, but in distribution networks and international interconnections.
From 2020, the issue changes and the power will already need to be increased.
Its focus is on both gas and coal plants with carbon dioxide capture mechanisms and, above all, renewable energies.
In this case, it considers that it takes 18,000 new MW, that is, with other "support energies".
Gal<0xC3><0xA1>n, who believes that the government’s recently passed Sustainable Economy Bill is in line with what his company has been claiming, did not want to make blood with the royal decree to encourage national coal consumption, which contradicts policies to fight climate change.
In his opinion, there is “a clear long-term bet” in this regard, despite the “point-to-point” measures, as the president of Iberdrola called them.
Either way, Gal<0xC3><0xA1>n considers that investment decisions, although they are long-term, should be taken as they are already late to mature and a stable pay framework is needed to address them.
Ferrovial wins 'handling' of Aer Lingus at ten airports
Ferrovial’s on-shore airport services subsidiary, Swissport, will play the role of preferred partner of the Irish airline Aer Lingus for cargo services at ten European airports where it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are some of the most prominent.
The agreement, of which the economic terms have not exceeded, has a duration of five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Board of Castile-La Mancha and the University of Alcal<0xC3><0xA1> de Henares signed yesterday a protocol of collaboration to create the Center for Innovation of Intelligent Infrastructures
The alliance plans an investment of 20 million by 2012, of which 50% belongs to Ferrovial.
One of the work of the center will be to investigate energy efficiency in highways and airports.
Australia’s first motorway races with Hochtief and Bouygues
Acciona struggles for its first concession highway in Australia, a market in which she already works as an energy company and water manager.
The work at stake is that of a tunnel valued at 1.7 billion Australian dollars (about 1.047 million euros).
France's Bouygues and Hochtief are their rivals.
A 5-kilometre tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the East Coast, has become the closest option for Acciona to settle in the country as a highway builder and concessionaire.
The City Council wants to get it ready by the end of 2014
After opting for public-private collaboration (PPP) to move the project forward, in a business plan sponsored by Ernst & Young, the Administration already has a final list of candidates to do the work and exploit the toll.
Expecting their bids to be presented next May, the planned investment amounts to 1.7 billion Australian dollars (1.047 million euros) and in the final phase three consortia with a notable presence of European builders compete.
The group named Transcity is led by Acciona, the only Spanish in liza, and its teammates are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of the largest Australian builders, while the second, based in Italy, is one of the largest European specialists in underground works.
Against the Acciona team plays the Northern Direct consortium, with the presence of the British Laing O’Rourke, the Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and the French construction group Bouygues.
The third and last consortium that has passed the screening is the so-called LBRJV, where the Australian Leighton (subsidiary of the German construction company Hochtief, in turn participating by ACS), also the local Baudlerstone (owner of the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the gala firm specializing in civil works Razel share capital.
The Australian infrastructure market promises big works and privatizations, but brings with it a clear difficulty of entry if not through the acquisition of a local construction firm.
A strategy that has been followed by the aforementioned Hochtief or Bilfinger, in addition to Asian references, and which continues to be a pending subject for the Spanish giants of the sector.
Only ACS has achieved a position in that market through its 30% stake in Hochtief, owner of the aforementioned Leighton.
Millionaire Assets
It is committed to a geographical area of the utmost importance for the sector, in which it already has a prominent presence through its activity as an energy supplier and in the desalination business.
Among other assets, it has its largest wind farm, Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria, and leads the group of companies in charge of lifting and managing the Adelaide desalination plant, with a budget of 700 million.
Its intention now is to consolidate those two areas and leverage synergies to enter the fields of infrastructure construction and operation.
The Underground toll road, promoted by the Brisbane City Infrastructure Office and called Northern Link, is called to connect the Toowong Western Highway with the Kelvin Grove Circulation Road (see map) along the 5 km long narrow tunnel tunnel.
The schedule set by the Administration sets the award for the summer of 2010 and the start of the works in December of the following year.
Although this payment step would open to traffic in the last months of 2014, the work is not expected to be completed until 2016.
The tunnel began to be constructed in 2005.
It will include two lanes per direction, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Queensland Government will contribute 500 million Australian dollars (308 million euros) to its funding.
Brisbane now offers business to Hochtief
Australia continues to bear remarkable fruit to Hochtief, who announced yesterday the acquisition of a contract with the government valued at 154 million.
The participation of ACS will enable, through its local subsidiary Leighton, the infrastructure of the national broadband network with fiber optic cable.
This performance will provide fast internet access to 400,000 people and give German work for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has moved the 27-story King George Tower construction project to the Australian city of Brisbane, with construction still underway, and Hochtief has closed the sale at $129 million.
Already in the UK, specifically in Manchester, Laing O’Rourke will share the construction and operation of two schools for 25 years.
The initial investment will be <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>75 million.
FCC awarded a tunnel in Slovenia for $64 million
The FCC, through its subsidiary Alpine, has been awarded the construction of a 2.1-kilometer-long tunnel for a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>64.5-million motorway in Slovenia.
This contract is signed days after the construction of the Bosruck Tunnel (Austria) was completed for 130 million.
In this way, Alpine reinforces its expertise in tunnel construction.
The start of the works is planned for the beginning of 2010 and its implementation period will be extended for 32 months.
Ms. Rushmore is awarded Renfe's advertising
Renfe has awarded advertising and marketing services over the next two years to the agency Ms. Rushmore for an amount of approximately three million euros per year, the railway operator said.
Ms. Rushmore has been chosen from among the 16 agencies that presented themselves to the competition convened by Renfe, of which four were finalists, including TBWA who was responsible for creativity in the last three years.
From now on, Ms. Rushmore will be in charge of the design and production of the campaigns.
$63 million fine to France Télécom for curbing competition
France’s competition regulator has fined France Télécom <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>63 million for anti-competitive behaviour in its Caribbean regions.
According to this institution, the operator limited competition in landline and mobile telephony with the signing of exclusive agreements, pricing plans and loyalty programs to consumers outside the scope of regulation.
With this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state-owned company has accumulated more than 560 million euros in fines since 1994 for blocking its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday has indeed been increased because the competition authority considers that France Télécom has committed similar offences in the past and that it is therefore recurring.
App Store <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
On the other hand, the mobile subsidiary of the French company has followed the footsteps of other operators and has opened an online app store, with the aim of increasing revenues that do not come from voice transmission.
In principle, the Orange app store will be active in France and the UK.
It will have to wait until 2010 for it to arrive in other countries, such as Spain.
Playing the Champions has reported 476.4 million to Madrid and Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a since its origin
The Champions League has become a source of revenue for clubs since it was born in 1992.
So much so that Real Madrid and Barcelona have entered 476.4 million since then, making them the third and fifth club that have won the most money in the competition.
The leader on the list is Manchester United.
The leader on the list is Manchester United.
Winning the UEFA Champions League not only provides glory. It is also one of the main sources of income for the big clubs.
So much so, that the competition has distributed 5,362.5 million euros to the 105 teams (12 of them Spanish) who have participated in the event since the tournament was created in the 1992/93 season, according to UEFA data.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona have been well-placed in this division.
The white club has been the third in the continent to have the most money pocketed for participating, and the only, alongside AC Milan, who has won the trophy three times.
The Catalan, the current champion and the last winner of the extinct European Cup in 1992, is the fifth in the standings.
The list is led by Manchester United and Bayern Munich, the two teams that also charged more money for participating in the last Champions League.
And that, despite losing both in front of Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country that has achieved the most money through the Champions League, despite having achieved more titles than any other (five, by four in Italy, three in England and two in Germany).
Distributed
This apparent paradox is explained by the complicated money-sharing procedure applied by UEFA.
For this exercise, the body chairing Michel Platini expects to enter 1.090 million for the Champions League.
Of this money, UEFA will devote 413.1 million for the fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the previous qualifying round (including Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who managed to participate received 3.8 million just for being there, plus another 550,000 euros for each match they competed.
There is also a bonus for winning (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>800,000) and for winning (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>400,000 for each team). The octave finalists will receive three million each; the eight fourth finalists, 3.3 million.
The last four will be pocketed 4 million each.
The champion will win 9 million, compared to the finalist’s 5.2 million.
Thus, in terms of fixed payments, a club will enter at least 7.1 million, and a maximum of 31.2 million.
Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a, on the other hand, bagged $2.5 million for winning the European Super Cup in August.
But there are also variable payments, to which 337,8 million are allocated.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each television market.
Spanish is one of the main, and has four seats allocated.
The champion of the previous year remains with 40% of the money allocated, 30% for the second, 20% for the third and 10% for the fourth.
The other party will be paid according to the number of matches played in this year’s edition.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million euros for 29.9% of Sos
The Nueva Rumasa group yesterday outlined the details of the offer to buy shares with which it seeks to acquire a cap of between 25% and 29.9% of the capital of Sos.
A percentage that does not oblige you to launch a public bid to acquire (opa) all of the securities.
In particular, Nueva Rumasa offers 1.5025 euros per share that would be disbursed in 10 years and that would be paid with an interest for such a postponement of 1% per year
Yesterday the shares of Sos closed at 1.85 euros; therefore, the offer of Nueva Rumasa values the company 18% below the market.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the actual valuation of Sos.
The offer is conditional on the appointment of eight of the 15 advisors.
The Georgian group gives a 15-day deadline for shareholders to announce their interest in selling securities.
The CNMV said it had not been informed of the offer, although the company of the Ruiz Mateos claimed that it had contacted the regulator.
If implemented, the disbursement would reach 611.7 million when the capitalization of Sos is 254.27 million.
In the meantime, Sos continues to restructure its address.
In an attempt to stay out of possible purchase offers and the judicial repercussions of its former directors, the Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s brothers and Jaime Salazar, announced the election of Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Luisa Jord<0xC3><0xA1> as director of internal audit.
A decision that makes her the first woman to hold a high position in the food company.
It is a newly created post that will depend directly on the group president.
And it is not exempt from controversy, as the company remains immersed in the legal battle for the alleged diversion of more than 230 million from Sos to Salazar companies.
In fact, it cannot be ruled out that over the next few months Sos reveals new diversions of funds
Regarding the credit to the Salazars, yesterday in the National Audience the former councillors Ildefonso Ortega and <0xC3><0x81>ngel Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez Noriega (representatives of CCM and Unicaja) declared that they approved the diversion of 212 million without knowing their fate.
The CNMV approves the opa of exclusion of Paternina presented by Investora Mer
The National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) authorized yesterday the opa of exclusion submitted by Investora Mer on Federico Paternina last October 9.
The supervisory body has explained that it authorizes this operation on the understanding that its terms comply with current rules and consider "sufficient" the content of the explanatory leaflet submitted after the amendments introduced last December 2.
The CNMV has specified that the offer is aimed at the acquisition of 550,08 shares of Federico Paternina at a price of 7.65 euros per share, representing 8.95% of its share capital, which is composed of 6,142,786 shares admitted to trading on the Madrid and Bilbao Stock Exchanges.
He also explained that 5,592,778 million shares have been immobilized, which cannot be transmitted in any way until the completion of the offer, of which he specified that the price has been fixed by Federico Paternina, in accordance with the provisions of the current regulations.
New Tools for Periting Cars
In these days of temporary and accidents, not only car workshops win.
Every day thousands of cars that have suffered a disaster are towed to a workshop, where an expert must assess the damage suffered and what the repair cost will be.
No sinister is the same, and calculating part costs and labor time can be a long and complicated job.
Manually calculating the cost of a repair of between 20,000 and 30,000 euros, including parts and workmanship, can take two or three hours.
Instead, with the support of the latest computer tools would be a matter of minutes
That’s why almost 100% of experts use these types of systems.
Service providers and solutions for damage assessment and maintenance are dedicated to collecting the information supplied by manufacturers, and then developing it and offering it to their customers in the form of a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, from the American group Solera, is the leading firm; 80% of the ratings are made with its products.
The other firms competing in the field of valuation and information-making tools on the sector are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data supplied by manufacturers is far from simple.
According to Eduardo Vel<0xC3><0xA1>zquez, Sales Director of Audatex, in Spain they work with 63 manufacturers and importers, and each of them provides them with the information in different formats.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed continues to increase, to the extent that more versions, variants and engines have been released in the last five years than in the previous fifteen.
As soon as a new car enters the market, these companies start to work.
It is a very hard work, because you have to catalog each of the thousands of parts of the vehicle and enter their price.
In addition, from each model is made a "smart" graphic image where you can "paint" different parts of tourism.
If it’s a windscreen model, the work can be done in a week if the process goes too fast.
If it is a minority car, it may take three or four months. Currently, Audatex has complete information about 99.2% of cars sold in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models have information about Porsche, but not Ferrari or Lamborghini, for example.
As for the mobile park that circulates, they exceed 99%.
To do the documentation work and the elaboration of the databases, Audatex has eight centers spread around the world (Spain, France, Germany, USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), and each of them specializes in specific brands.
The national headquarters is in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (usually mechanics experts) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audatex invests <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>90 million annually in developing these databases.
2.5 million data are included every month, and customers receive updates every two days.
The elaboration of this huge flow of information allows these companies to give them different uses and offer various products.
The most frequent use focuses on repair and maintenance, but depending on which countries there are also tools for the management of detachment parts or to calculate the venal or residual value of a car.
The only company that has a guide that informs about the value of used ones in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer it in our country, but in the United States.
In view of the products offered by Audatex it is easy to get an idea of the type of support they can provide to professionals in the sector.
This company offers ten different tools, the star product AudaPlus, the standard accident assessment solution, intended for experts.
It includes cars, motorcycles and light or heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it includes the estimated repair times by the manufacturer or the paint bars.
This tool is paid according to usage, for each valuation.
The highest cost is 5.75 euros, for customers who use it little, a maximum of ten times a month.
Then each insurance company, which conducts thousands of expertise, negotiates its price with Audatex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow the full identification of a vehicle and the equipment with which it exited the assembly line only with its frame number.
AudaGlass focuses on the moons of vehicles, and AudaSubistas is an open service to the professional online sector that allows you to bid for vehicles declared total sinister.
Its statistics service is very useful for identifying trends, conducting geodemographic analysis or knowing the deviations by model brands.
It is possible to study, for example, how many models of a particular brand have gone through the workshop due to malfunctions or how many have suffered serious injuries in a given period.
GT Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of tools.
It markets, among others, Gt Estimate, which is also intended for experts and also provides digital images, access to parts or prices and official times of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa group founded in 1971 as a provider of services and solutions for valuation of damages, failures or maintenance of the car.
The Gt Estimates Guide is your historical reference product on the market.
They work with 24,000 users in workshops, 3,100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Its turnover has grown at a rate of 20% annually in the last three years, and in 2008 they made <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>10.8 million.
At the beginning of last year they began their process of internationalization, with the installation of an office in Paris.
Audatex was born in Germany in 1966 and was established in Spain in 1979.
According to sources of the company, 62% of its business is generated in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38%, in North and South America. They work with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 workshops, 3,000 of them in Spain.
The global turnover of the Solera group (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will reach $557 million, up 3.3% from 2008.
In our country, the company will earn 19.1 million euros, a 7.2% increase from the previous year.
In 2005, the Solera group was worth $1 billion on the stock exchange, and now its shares are worth a total of $2.4 billion.
Since 2007 it has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange and is included in the Standard & Poor's benchmark index.
Internet Auction of Accident Cars
Last October, the Solera group bought Autoonline, an online platform for the sale of cars such as motorcycles or special vehicles.
The transaction resulted in a disbursement of 59.5 million euros for 85% of the company’s capital, which could be extended next year to the remaining 15%.
The goal of the acquisition was to offer more value-added services to its customers, with the possibility of accessing an immense international market.
This valuation and sales service is exclusively aimed at industry professionals, such as insurance companies, experts, rental companies, workshops, dealers and professional sellers who need to register before they start performing operations.
This platform was established in 1996 in Germany and manages more than 650,000 operations across Europe, 500,000 of them in Germany.
Among its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
The website currently has more than 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 experts.
3,000 ads are managed daily and about 100 new ads are included in the Spanish market every day.
According to Spanish law, a car whose frame number has been given off cannot be re-circulated, but certain parts that are not damaged can be used as a replacement.
Cars with historical value can give up even if they have been given up after some strenuous actions.
Workshop budget in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, the company Audatex guarantees that the user gets a budget in just four steps: identify the vehicle, search for the spare parts, create a budget and generate a budget.
Ease of use is an essential conditioner for these systems, especially to convince older professionals that they are more or less reluctant to use new management techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, which are 666 cars, 109 off-road vehicles, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Of course, to use it, you need a computer with an internet connection.
Once the model to be repaired is identified by its frame number, a real graphical image of the model in question appears and then the necessary replacement is selected.
The user can include variables such as labor price, surcharges or discounts, and then can print the budget to deliver to the customer.
AudaTaller is not a valuation tool like AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalog.
The main difference between the two systems is that the workshop-oriented does not include estimated labor times.
The cost of using this tool for the workshop is 350 euros per year, which the customer can finance.
Currently, the company Audatex is working on making these images three-dimensional.
This is an innovation that mechanics see with very good eyes, as it will allow, for example, to select a door and turn it to see the inner face.
