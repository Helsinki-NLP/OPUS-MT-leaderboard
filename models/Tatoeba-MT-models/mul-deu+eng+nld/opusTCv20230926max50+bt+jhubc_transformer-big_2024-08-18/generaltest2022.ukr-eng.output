Good morning, I agree with the course.

Thank you in advance.
In Kherson, people went out to the rally again, the Russians did not manage to disperse
As the participants of the event told the agency, the Khersons managed to hold a rally before the military RF with equipment arrived on the spot.
"We managed to hold a rally. Now the equipment of the RF has arrived," one of the participants of the event said.
Previously, citizens traditionally gathered for protests in Svoboda Square - near the ODA building and the district.
This area, like the building, is now controlled by armed Russian troops, who use weapons against the participants of the rallies and kidnap people.
It was reported that on April 3, armed Russian occupiers used weapons against peaceful demonstrators in Kakhovka.
As Ukrinform reported, residents of Donetsk regularly conduct peaceful protests against the Russian aggressor.
The Russian military uses force and weapons against the people, they are wounded and detained.
Russian invaders also kidnap the residents of the region.
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy awarded Kherson the special title of "Hero City".
On February 24, the President of the Russian Federation began a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
Russian troops are shelling and destroying key infrastructure facilities, carrying out massive shelling of residential areas of Ukrainian cities and villages using artillery, reactive systems of salvo fire and ballistic missiles.

Sasha was not in school today, I wrote to the teacher in the mail.
Hi, I'm sick, so it's better to postpone our meeting for next weekend, sorry.
I can cook, the main thing is to have a recipe, but I like to bake a cake.
In Ukraine, there are traditional borscht, varenice, others.
I have no favorite dishes, I love to try a variety of dishes from different countries.

I want to be busy.
There is a train and there are no places.
I'm sorry, but we're a little late.

Zelensky: Mariupol – the heart of war, will stop fighting – we will have weak positions
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy believes that the battles for the east of Ukraine and in particular for Mariupol will determine the course of the war – and if the Armed Forces are defeated there, the Russians can leave the negotiations and again occupy the de-occupated territories.
"Mariupol is, you know, the heart of this war for today.
We fight, we fight, we fight.
If it stops fighting, we will have weaker positions.
They (defenders of the city – ed.) are people who have drawn on themselves a large number of enemies.
The stronger our position in Mariupol, the stronger our position will be in the east of the state, in the OAS, and if they are stronger, the negotiating table will be closer to us and we will have advantages in dialogue with the Russian Federation.
If we have a weak situation in all these directions, then we may not wait for the meeting.
Because then Russia will take all these steps that can lead to the return even to those cities that we have now de-occupyed.
They can go for it too.
Then our situation in the negotiations will already be weaker and, perhaps, not even interesting for the Russian side.
Unfortunately, we find out.
We believe in our results, in our victory.”
Zelensky also said that it is difficult to negotiate after the torture of Ukrainians, but "we should not lose the opportunity for a diplomatic solution if they are with us".
“People will accept peace in any case, because people want this war to be over,” he said.
On our terms, on the terms of Ukraine’s independence, but ... every family has lost something – and I don’t think they will be satisfied by any peace on any conditions.
But if we say not emotionally, the war must end in peace, or it will end in the millions of victims.
And even where a million victims, everything comes to the end of the war.
Yes, we have to fight – but for life.
You can't fight for the dust when there's nothing left, there's no people."

Due to the change in the aesthetics of Ukrainian literature, new concepts were needed to describe its new quality state.
It is the analysis of the metaphorical space of Ukrainian literature, the study of the state
Ukrainian poetic metaphor in modern literature allows to analyze the postmodernist context as such, where metaphor plays the role of an axiological criterion

The main intelligence department of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine has published a list of Russian military personnel who participated in the commission of military crimes in the town of Buch in the Kyiv region.
As Ukrinform reports, the Main Intelligence Department of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine reports on Facebook.
“Every Ukrainian should know their names! . . .
The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine has obtained a list of military personnel of 64 separate motor-fire brigade, who are directly involved in the commission of military crimes against the people of Ukraine in the city of Buch.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs states that for crimes committed against the peaceful population of Ukraine, all war criminals will face trial and will be held accountable.
You can view the list at the link.
Ukrinform, Irpin, Bucha, Gostomel and the entire Kyiv region were released from Russian invaders.
In the liberated cities and villages, mass murders by the Russian military of civilians have been recorded.
On April 1, the mayor of Bucha Anatoly Fedoruk said that 280 people were buried in the fraternal graves.
Prosecutor General Irina Venediktova said that on April 3, 410 bodies of killed civilians were taken from the territory of the Russian invaders of the Kyiv region.
On February 24, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the beginning of a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
The troops of the Russian invaders are shelling and destroying key infrastructure objects, carrying out massive shelling of residential areas of Ukrainian cities and villages using artillery, reactive systems of salvo fire, ballistic missiles.

We promised you that when you go to school, we'll bring you a surprise.
Bulob is great , I have money for two months rent, in Olomouc district does not matter, I will be very grateful.
Most of my acquaintances are deeply shocked by the news of the brutal harassment of the civilian population north of Kyiv.
Photographs of blackmailed and shot people confused the entire civilized world.
Dozens of people question each other how this could have happened in the 21st century?! How?!
And I wasn't surprised at all. It's exactly what I've been waiting for with sadness...
I took my children and elderly parents out of Kiev on the second day of the war.
Then the girls-colleague with the children, and only then returned to the capital to work.
Since 2014, I have been consistently helping the Army and for no moment did not doubt that in the event of the occupation of Kiev, my family will not be spared.
For I was and remain absolutely certain that the essence of the rotten communo-KDBist regime has remained unchanged since 1918.
Without terror, it simply cannot exist, it is built on terror.
In 1937, one of my grandparents was shot in a prison in the city of Zhytomyr.
A few years ago, the Zhytomyr SBU was given a copy of the shooting case of the grandfather: the whole case is more than a hundred pages, and from the sentence of execution is very simple and even more terrible.
The accused was illiterate, denied the guilt.
An ethnic Pole, a Catholic, had five children, was of free people, a poor "one-yard" nobility, never walked in the crevices.
The fact that they lived in the huts and had several cows was enough to convict the pahar and the feeder of the minor children to death.
My parents didn’t even know about the funeral.
Grandma said that almost a hundred people were taken from the village and killed all but two who agreed to give false testimony.
In the case of Karnataka there is the name of the striker Sharii.
Our former Speaker of the Verkhovna Rada comes from a neighboring village.
I believe in genetics and I am not surprised if his relative was a KDBist informant.
The apple from the apple tree is not far, as you know, falling...
The firing squad that led to the killing of peasants were ethnic Russians.
Analyzing the case of the grandfather, he was interested in various information resources.
There are in Russia wonderful (without sarcasm) information resources such as "Immortem Barak", which are qualitatively reminiscent of the events of those years.
Thus, in modern Russia, descendants of NKVDists have found ways to punish and exterminate almost everyone who seriously investigated the crimes of their ancestors 70-80 years ago.
The people who found mass graves of victims of Stalin’s repression and publicly wrote the names of the killers, the system initially discredited and then destroyed.
It was as if files with child pornography were found on the computer, she was put in prison, and there she died quickly.
The KDBists are still killing those who are trying to find out the truth about the crimes of the last century.
So why are you suddenly surprised by their actions now?!
It focuses on the most gruesome traits of human nature.
On top of the millennium Ordinary tradition, slavery and imperial chauvinism of the 16th-19th century were imposed.
And then over what came out, they did a monstrous genetic experiment, cutting off the intelligence during several waves of red terror.
Watch the semi-French film "Chekist" in 1992, so it was.
Zoe, you saw my picture in the swimsuit.
Can you ask your wife what I can buy from a cough?
I'm sorry, I don't have anyone to ask.

When girls come back from school, what do they do?
We arrived at the place where we were settled from the center in the pardubice, the conditions were good.
But there is a big but here live men like drinking alcohol and smoking in the room, loud music is the very minimum that "stirred", the smell of cigarettes drunk men and us with children ... scary to sleep if honestly.
Please help with the housing ,for the money ,please .
But where it will be safe and not smoked.
The smell of cigarettes in the room is like that, not exactly here they smoke.
I ask you very much, one of them barely stands on his feet, something screams, something he doesn't like. Very scary.
I'm just asking if you can help

Yesterday everything went very well.
We talked about children with special needs you and their education system in Ukraine.
When Ms. Shahov introduced me as a Fpoint employee, the first question was how to find the dog, how to find the mop.
They are all following the page on Facebook.
Asked to send you greetings and say that they are very interesting to read about the news.
They also talked about people of Roma nationality, which they have privileges in Ukraine.
And we agreed that if the child and parents will not understand Czech at all, then after work I can help them in the phone mode.
I need to change the bed linen, 2 sets.
That’s what makes me happy on holiday.

The main thing is that love is real and reciprocal.
I don’t know how in Europe, but in our country people get married for a variety of reasons, mostly useful, mercantile goals.
And I have a problem with that, if I don't love someone, nothing will work out.
Yes, we took it home and took my aunt away right away.
She was very grateful, she was crying.
I told her about you and how you are helping the Ukrainians.
Tears were in her eyes.
She said if it was possible there could still be some old blanket and pillow.
But it's not necessarily. Only if it is. I'm very grateful to you too.
I feel sorry for him.
My best friend was killed in front of him.
I had a lot of questions to God about why there are situations in my life that just made me disbelief in everything.
And the small grocery stores work? I need to buy bread and other products.
I just decided to go and you did the meetings.
It is so but we do not yet orient in the area and do not know where everything is located.We today were looking for a supermarket an hour and back came the foot.The two boxes are not suitable,so two and need a large size
Even now, I thought about you, and you wrote to me.
Is your father only able to communicate in Russian or someone else in the family?
You can have the kids come to the valley and play in the hall.
Well, let's take the risk. :)
I'm glad I met you too.

Some of their questions I didn’t even know the answers.
It's good on Thursday, if you can.
I can't call the doctor because I haven't done a food license exam yet.
But I can't call him because I ended up with the money.
I can’t charge my phone because I don’t understand the Czech online banking and the Ukrainian bank card is not charged.
In the app vodaphone I can not change the rate so that I have normal calls and the internet does not fill the number.
I'm out of my mind now.
Where the price is not the cheeks, but the face... the headline sounds wrong, what did you mean?
I’m ashamed to be without a job.
I just wrote that in school in class
I'm sorry to bother you, I'm just very worried.
But this is closer to when they leave the borders of Ukraine to know for sure that they are coming.
That’s because it’s in question in all my life.
Yes. Size for 10-11 years. But our sizes do not match. Everything needs to be measured
I'm looking for everything for home and kids.
Thanks to the people I was taken alive in the chapel they always ask if I need a shoto and I am embarrassed to say I ask myself to find.
I just got home and now I’m having breakfast. :)
Don't explain anything, please do what I don't have
Unable to respond without a resume sent
I can't tell my mom that :)
And I really don't have a bit of myself right now that I couldn't hold back from the feelings before we left the apartment....Like tonight....

As reported by "European Truth", about this writes Welt with reference to sources in the governmental circles of Ukraine.
According to the publication, the corresponding proposal was sent to the German Ministry of Economy on Saturday.
The cost of 100 howitzers, including the training kit and spare parts, is 1.7 billion euros.
As well as the owls are offered in the variant on the BTR Boxer for 1.2 billion euros.
While tanks in combat have to pick up relatively close to the enemy's targets, the Panzerhaubitze 2000 can fire at a distance of more than 30 kilometers.
As reported by the Ukrainian government circles with reference to the proposal of KMW, the supply of self-propelled hooligans will take place according to the circular scheme.
In the shortest time, the Bundeswehr will provide Kyiv with 100 of its hooligans, and the gaps that have formed will then be filled by the industry at the second stage.
The first new howitzers can be delivered 30 months after signing the contract, i.e. before the second half of 2024.
Full delivery will not be completed until 2027.
Are we in the first half of the day, or in the second half of the day together?
Thank you we will find how to replenish ryahuno and naberkmo. I will unsubscribe. Thank you

For me, marriage is a mystery of two people who do not discuss each other with their relatives or friends.
A man and a woman solve the issues themselves in their family, especially without the participation of relatives.
Can we be together?
It will take some time before we get there.
Why not try it this way?

I was disappointed that Cole and I had a bad time translating the test yesterday.
I will ask whether Gregory Denysenko or maybe Jonashek)) to help me at least a little with mathematical concepts.
Could I be able to do something useful for them?
If that's the case, I'd like to raise the math deadlines for the weekend.
Geometry is difficult at all, but Cole and I have to work together to make sure it is error-free.
Thank you for the test tasks.
We are very hopeful of this too.
She is very happy with any gift.
Apple wanted to connect to its Czech number to the Internet
Yesterday at the bus stop 402 I met a Ukrainian woman - Victoria.
This girl is a child, but here she is herself... her eyes are full of tears and sorrow...
I couldn't stay away.
Now we have agreed to be friends.
And last night I thank God for this girl, because this is the first person in Ukraine where my heart felt reciprocity.
The branch in Hall No29 is specially designed for the submission and processing of applications for assistance
I found out I ordered a spare card.
No, I'm just a human being.
So that she was not afraid that no one came.
I didn't walk. Yes, I cooked myself. That's what I can do! The main thing is that you taught me how to turn on the oven.
Have you been out of town for a long time?
Five years ago in the memorial center of the "Babin Yar" Holocaust in Kyiv we celebrated 80 years of mass shooting by German soldiers of Ukrainian Jews in Babin Yar.
I had the honor of speaking after three heads of state, including the President of Germany.
He spoke of “the common foundation of international law and human dignity, the freedom of people to choose their own path and life in a territorial integrity, a peaceful and secure Europe.
We have to defend this foundation – it’s also part of our responsibility to our history.”
“If the evil demons of the past appear today in a new garment,” he said, “for us Germans, there can only be one answer: never again!
The fight has to go on.”
Today, Russia has attacked a peaceful country, bombing and killing thousands of civilians, starving residents of cities blocked by it and lets them die of diseases.
Russian troops carry out mass shootings of Ukrainians, even visually it resembles the shootings in Babin Yar.
Over a month the Germans see it in the news in real time.
Thus, Germany is imposing sanctions, providing humanitarian aid, as well as weapons, which not so long ago was impossible to imagine.
Germany is delaying the delivery of the heavy weapons necessary to Ukraine.
But "Never again!" means not only to oppose swastika.
This means fighting with all possible means against mass murder, genocide, war crimes and atrocities.
There is no easy way without risks and victims to defeat evil and stop the atrocities that are taking place in Ukraine.
I'll sing to you one night
We agree, arrange for the tour, and write when to be collected
All sick only Lydia did not get sick in them was omikron a new kind of covid

Sergei Sidorenko: Our NATO membership has ceased to be a distant prospect
Nine years ago, Ukrainian sociology showed that 67% of Ukrainians were against joining NATO and only 18% of those surveyed were in favour.
After the Revolution of Dignity, the escape of Victor Yanukovych, the annexation of Crimea and the beginning of the war in Donbass, the number of NATO opponents began to fall, and supporters, on the contrary, began to grow.
After the start of the full-scale war with Russia, Ukrainian sociologists recorded a record level of support for Ukraine’s accession to NATO among Ukrainian citizens – more than 75%.
Despite the support of Ukraine’s accession to NATO and the assistance that NATO provides in conditions of war, there is now a lot of criticism at the expense of the Alliance and members of the countries – for the lack of timely supply of weapons, the refusal to close the sky, the unwillingness to do so.
In addition, there is a great risk that Ukraine will be forced to renounce the desire for membership in the Alliance because of the position of the Russian Federation, if it can stop the war, and Ukraine will receive reliable security guarantees, including military.
In the new episode of the podcast "Sworn Questions" together with the editor of "European Truth" we talk about how exactly helped Ukraine Alliance since the Russian invasion, for which NATO should be criticized in the near future, and for which the Alliance is criticized in vain, why in our perspective.
What do you think is here

Yes, he had a heart disease.
I had sincere feelings for this person, but he did not do very well and I left him.
After a while, he came back and apologized to me.
I refused him.
Then, after a while, he called that he had a heart surgery.
I just asked him to talk to me, I was sorry.
I psychologically supported him for almost six months.
During that time, we communicated a lot.
I started having problems at work at the same time.
His support also helped me at the time.
That's mutual help.
And I was wondering, maybe we really need to look at him differently.
And he offered me to get married, and two days later he died.
That is why God has decided our destiny.
What does it mean to you to be ready for marriage?
He speaks only in Czech.
I wanted to say that I was able to find housing, and I am very glad that <0xE2><0x98><0xBA> now I have where to live and where to be with the baby.

I don't remember the schedule.)
Russian army threatens to launch missile strikes on Kyiv: say "have not done this before"
Konashenkov's direct language: "We see attempts of diversions and tasks of strikes by Ukrainian troops on objects on the territory of the Russian Federation.
If such cases continue, the armed forces of the Russian Federation will strike at the centers of decision-making, including in Kiev, from which the Russian army had previously refrained.
The Russians launched missile strikes on Kiev from the first days of the full-scale invasion of the occupying forces of the Russian Federation into Ukraine.
On February 25, the remnants of Russian missiles, which crashed the Ukrainian air defense system, fell on a multi-apartment house in the capital Pozniak.
On February 26, a Russian missile hit a multi-storey building on Valery Lobanovsky Avenue.
On March 1, the Russians were involved in the TV show at Dorogozhich near Babiny Yar, as a result of which 5 passers-by died.
On March 2, Ukrainian air defense systems shot down Russian missiles flying in the direction of the building of the Ministry of Defense over the Southern railway station.
On March 14, the pieces of the rocket shot down by the occupants demolished the house and trolleybus on Kurenivka in Kyiv
On March 18, a Russian rocket hit a residential complex at Vinogradar, of which one person was killed, another 19 people were injured, including four children.
On March 21, Russian missiles destroyed the modern Retroville shopping mall at Vinogradar, killing at least 4 people.
The mayor of Kyiv Vitali Klitschko again said on April 13 that the residents of the capital, who were evacuated from the city, so far early to return.
The military explained to the local authorities that the Russians can still carry out missile strikes on Kiev, and in addition on the outskirts of the capital a lot of mines and indissolubly ammunition.
The main intelligence department of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine warned on April 12 that the Russians plan to eat the first series of attacks on the territory of the Russian Federation in order to blame the Ukrainians and justify the cruelty of the Russian army against the civilian population.
On April 1, an oil base exploded near Belgorod in Russia, allegedly as a result of an air attack by Ukrainian helicopters.
At the beginning of April, the local authorities of Belgorod said that near the city was supposed to have fallen "Ukrainian projectile".
It is obvious that the elites in both Washington and Berlin are throwing in the cold sweat of the very idea that NATO fighters will shoot down Russian bombers in the sky in Ukraine.
But Zelensky speaks not so much to them as to their constituents and societies in general.
With his speeches in parliaments and in front of thousands of crowds in the squares of Europe’s largest cities, the Ukrainian leader is doing something that was inaccessible to any of his predecessors.
Zelensky does not convince European politicians to do everything for Ukraine, he convinces the European peoples who choose those politicians.
And these speeches, this refined alloy of strength, agitation, and sometimes disappointment, are gradually reaching their goal.
While the same Biden is categorically against closing the sky, 70% of his fellow citizens already support this idea.
Although Paris or Brussels are against the acceleration of Ukraine’s accession, this process is already underway.
I understand you, so I don't want you to think we're scammers.
The money you’re going to raise is better to give to people in need.
I can come to you and we will decide on the spot. Still I to help

Contact: ------ I would like a letter so that the Czechs can write to you through the translator, SMS here does not go, they do not have a Ukrainian keyboard, and if they call, do not agree.
You really don’t want that price?
It helps people to see what they are worth and what they have for it.
If you don't need a price list, I won't post it.
Tell yourself how you want it, and I'll do it.
You didn’t want to write to me today, for some reason.
Don't worry, I'm not here to ask for anything.
To be honest, today I'm just asking for attention.
I have a lot to say today, so I ask you to be patient.
Are you all right with your imagination?
You live your normal life, go to work, plan shopping, vacation.
You have a dream.
You are planning to buy here the dress you saw yesterday at the mall.
Tomorrow night, after work.
Your brain can’t perceive it.
He's sniffing out the old reality.
You call to work, find out whether to go out to work today or not.
You decide to leave the children at home.
Until something becomes clear to me.
There's hope... it's not all for long.
Now... let's make a deal... something will happen.
The brain refuses to accept...
Where to go ?? I have no one and nowhere.
I've got $50 in my pocket, everything we've spent at home.
Many of those who were hired by the managers did not pay salaries on our jobs.
Where do I go ? ? Who do I need ? How do I provide for children ? Where do I live ?
You can't take a lot of things.
You didn't take anything out of the house... you drive a thousand miles.
You don't know what to feed them tomorrow or not.
Every day, from morning to evening, you draw children all over Prague.
What's next ? I don't know. How much ? I don't know. Kids ask for sweets. And you can't . You're expensive.
And with every tool, we don't have that.
We have a choice - to stay there and call the children in danger, or try to save themselves here

Good morning.We lack personalities.So it would be very good to know a person from Ukraine

You're busy tomorrow, don't you want to meet after 4:00?
What are your general impressions from the first week?
Karina brought us the medicine the other day, and we drink them.
I can work with lying sick and disabled children.
But it is necessary to specify that I speak only in Russian and Ukrainian.
I don't have that.
I can get you some soap for the grocery store.
Because there is only antibacterial gel
I'm not sure, 'cause I'm not really in town yet.
What services/activities do you think are needed/missing for older people?
I don't know because there was no SMS from the bank yet and I didn't take the bank card and the children removed the bank attachment with it they really upset me

Today we have the joy - our city of Bucha was liberated from the occupiers, our troops came.
There is clearance from the enemy - looking for Russians in basements and apartments.

It's tractors that actually go out in the field under shelling because it's time to sow.
These are the bus drivers who agree today to go in rubber convoys to the temporarily occupied territories to bring help there and pick up people from there.
These are heroic leaders, who without fear go to the area of combat, calm and help refugees in the carriages, and at the peace stations help volunteers to load into the carriages humanitarian.
These were the tankers who stood on the Zhytomyr road in the first days of the war and patiently served the frightened and nervous people.
These are communal workers who take out the rubbish under shelling, repair the water lines and power lines to provide the people needed.
These are the doctors and nurses who save people 24 hours a day, without complaining about anything, and in the free minute, they still volunteer, collecting pharmacies on the front.

Please tell me, little children, what age do you mean?
My daughter is 8 years old, is this acceptable?
I am looking for accommodation for me and my daughter for 3-4 days to come to the Czech Republic and transfer passports to Canada.

The head of the President’s Office, Andrei Yermak, said that Russia is starting a “fake operation” about the weapons that the allies are handing over to us.
The direct language of Yermak: "They understand that they are losing the war, they see their backwardness, and they seek to "kill" the supply of weapons by any means.
For example, one of the last blunders is the blunt destruction of the S-300 air defense system handed over by Slovakia.
This information has already been refuted by Prime Minister Edward Heger.
What will happen next? We know Russian scenarios. Name one of them.
They can launch fakes that the Ukrainian soldiers are ruthlessly surrendering with weapons from the allies, and it is massively switching to the armaments of the Russian army.
I'd like to warn you of these fakes right away.
Because the weapon in the hands of the soldiers of the Armed Forces exclusively sends the enemy to that world.

The international community continues to express shock and outrage after the emergence of evidence that Russian forces committed atrocities against the peaceful population in Ukraine, and Moscow rejected these messages as “provocation.”
“The news of the killed, raped and seriously wounded by the Russian troops of Ukrainian civilians is worth condemning,” New Zealand Prime Minister Jassid Ardern told reporters in Wellington on April 4.
“Russia must answer to the world for what they have done,” she added, noting that her government will discuss additional measures to support Ukraine in its fight against the Russian invasion.
Japan’s Prime Minister Fumio Kisida called the incidents a “violation of international law.”
The statements came after reports that hundreds of civilians were shot and thrown into the fraternal graves or left on the streets in the outskirts of Kyiv, in Bucha by Russian troops who left the area after the occupation for several weeks.
The photographs, which allegedly depict the bodies of the executed civilians with their hands tied, shocked many and led to calls for increased sanctions against Russia and criminal prosecution of the culprits.
French President Emmanuel Macron said in a radio interview on April 4 that there were signs that Russian troops had committed “war crimes” in Bucha.
“What happened in Bucha requires a new round of sanctions and very clear measures,” Macron said, adding that additional sanctions should be aimed at Russian exports of coal and oil.
Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez said Russian troops could go so far as to commit a “genocide” in Bucha.
"We will do everything possible to ensure that those who have committed these war crimes do not remain impunity," Sanchez said in Madrid.
Speaking on state television late on April 3, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova dismissed the accusation as “provocation”.
She stated without evidence that the United States and NATO “ordered” the image to discredit Russia.
“In this case, it seems to me that the fact that these statements were made in the first minutes after the appearance of these materials, does not cause any doubt as to who “ordered” this story,” Zakharova said.
Earlier, the Russian Ministry of Defense also stated without evidence that the images of Buchi are “another production of the Kiev regime” and that all Russian troops left the city by March 30.
Moscow asked the UN Security Council to meet on April 4 to discuss what it called a “provocation of Ukrainian radicals” in Bucha.
The Investigative Committee of Russia published a statement on April 4, in which it announced an “investigation” on the charge of Ukraine’s spreading “deliberately false information” about the actions of Russian troops in Bucha.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyi spoke on April 3, accusing Russian troops of committing “genocide” in the city, and told the Kremlin leaders that they should come to Bucha to see what their military did.
“I want all the leaders of the Russian Federation to see how their orders are being obeyed,” Zelensky said in a video address, switching from Ukrainian to Russian.
And there is a shared responsibility.
For these murders, for these tortures ... for shots in the backyard,” he said.
He said that Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Russian military should be responsible for the actions of the troops in Ukraine.
“When we find people with their hands tied behind their backs and beheaded, I don’t understand,” he said of the scenes of the victims scattered on the streets of Bucha, a city about 35 kilometers northwest of Kiev.
On April 2, a correspondent of the Ukrainian service Radio Freedom saw the bodies as civilians on the streets of a small city.
Only in one place the correspondent saw up to 10 bodies on the street.
AP reporters have seen the bodies of at least 21 people in different places in Bucha.
The bodies of one group of nine people – all civilians – were scattered on the ground near a place that, according to local residents, used Russian forces as a base.
Apparently, the victims were killed from a close distance.
In general, the Ukrainian authorities said that the bodies of at least 410 civilians were found in the area of Kyiv, which until last week was controlled by Russian troops.
Thank you, we’ve got it all on the list.
"They were told: Kyiv is not there." As the occupiers of the floor exported Ukrainians to Russia and Belarus
The Russian invasion of Ukraine is accompanied by terrible things: robbery, rape, murder, torture.
In this list there is another item, about which there is currently much less information – the export of the local population to the territory of the enemy.
Since about mid-March, Russian occupiers have been “evacuating” Ukrainians from temporarily occupied settlements to their territory and territory of Belarus, which the self-proclaimed President Lukashenko has actually surrendered to the Russian military base.
"Ukrainian Truth" sought out expelled Ukrainians and their relatives to ask how the same "evacuation" is taking place and whether there are ways to return to Ukraine after it.
Heroes of this text agreed to a voluntary forced evacuation outside Ukraine under psychological pressure and from impasse.
Fortunately, they are alive and maintain a relationship with their relatives.
However, given the statements of the Ukrainian authorities, many citizens were exported to Russia and Belarus under strict coercion.
Thus, in Melitopol, the Russians kidnapped the staff of the second maternity home, took out children without parents, among them 12-year-old Miroslav, daughter of the dead champion of Ukraine on swimming Yosip Zakhepinsky.
The family of Alexander, Marina and their 10-year-old daughter Vali moved to Gostomel a few months before the war.
Alexander got a job at Antonov Airport, which is located 2.5 kilometers from the village.
The family settled on the territory of a military town, although it was civilian.
As true plastunas, Denis and Marina collected their alarming suitcases in advance, but on the morning of February 24, they were unable to evacuate.
They didn’t have their car, and the suburban buses didn’t take anyone anymore.
At about 12:00 on February 24, they saw helicopters with the Latin letter V, followed by the first projectiles.
One of them came into the neighbouring house.
The family then descended into the basement and stayed there for three long weeks, until March 17, until the Russian military took them to Belarus.
In total, about 40 people were hiding in their basement.
Not everyone decided to go.
“At 6 p.m. on February 24, people entered the entrance, who spoke neither Russian nor Ukrainian.
They ask, "Is anyone there?" I say, "Get out!"
They searched me, asked who was in the basement, if there was a weapon.
All the men were asked if they were serving in the army.
The women were told, “We have come to protect you by Ramzan Kadirov’s instructions.”
It was the Chechen OMON, not even the troops, young boys aged 25-35.
They said: "From us Ukrainians helped in the war, Sashko White (commanded by the team of the nationalist movement UNA-UNSO "Wiking", who fought on the side of the Chechens in the first Russian-Czech war - UP), now we help you".
On the third day, they asked us what we lacked.
We say that the water had a big problem with it.
They broke down the store, took the goods from there under the slogan "all the same Russians will take away" and brought us 6 bottles.
There is also a video on the internet where children thank Kadyrov for his food.
So, after looting the store, they brought a sausage and said, "We understand that this is wrong, but we really need a video for Ramzan Akhmatovich."
No one really wanted to talk, but they made a beautiful cut.
Our child there says, “You have 7 days to give back our phones” – they smiled.
They were constantly separating themselves from the Russians.
They said how good it was that they came, because they did not want war, the Ukrainians are supported and in general good: "Putin is a bastard, Kadyrov too, but we can do nothing, because there are our families."
And mostly they did not fight, but went to rob shops, marauding.
Kurey was brought in, one tied to one leg of Georgia's tape, and to the other - his white scotch and called it "military".
They came to Ukraine not at all prepared.
I don't know how their reconnaissance worked... when they were beaten up in Bucha, so that they didn't even pick up the dead, they asked us, "What, do you have an artillery?"
What’s more, we had narrow teams – Chechens did not know each other, in the first days asked for passwords to find out, their own or someone else.
They were in us until March 13, after which came the Russian OMON, and after them – the Omsk landing.
They placed 30-40 units of equipment between the houses – ours constantly fell into it from the "Bayractars".
But these came and told us that the U.S. Army no longer exists, but there is "Azov", and, according to them, "Azov" so 100 thousand in Ukraine.
The narrative "Kyiv has already surrendered" has been progressing since the beginning of March.
One day a Russian came to us – either a landing officer, or a representative of the FSB – and said there would be an evacuation.
And we listened to the radio – there was about Butch, Gostomel, thought, maybe we were given a "green corridor".
From the very beginning we handed over our lists to the Chechens, they promised to contact the Ukrainian command.
But they tell us, "You will be taken to Belarus, and then maybe to Rostov."
We say we don’t want to go there or there.
To which they replied, "Sorry about your children's psyche!"
How it worked: They dragged us into the basement and started shooting from under the house – either by the "Cities" or by mortars.
And then it flew back... Neighboring houses just burned down, some of them collapsed.
Our house had a direct access to the third floor.
Later they agreed to take us only to Belarus, promising to hand over to the border guards and the Red Cross.
The part did not go, saying that it is for the traitors of the homeland – saying, "you are shot there, to the organs will be sold."
We were transported through Chernobyl, on both sides of the road there were burns, broken equipment, although the Belarusians told us that the Russians would export the equipment immediately to them.
A lot of bonnets, buried equipment and soldiers.
At the Belarusian point of passage "Comar" we went through improvised control, many were without documents at all, because they burned.
We were placed in the tents of the Red Cross, given tea.
And here we hear the shots! The missile is shooting, and you can see – it worked "Iskander" in Kiev.
Although those from the Belarusian Red Cross said, "Yes, no, it's the planes that fly, they turn at the border."
But we're from aviation, we have education, we understand it.
Then we were taken to the bus and taken to the sanatorium "Chonky" near Gomel.
His manager, Wenger Vasyl Stepanovich, came and said: "Here I am a hohol, I am from Chernihiv.
But I understand that Putin and Lukashenko will not stop until these thieves are caught.
The poor people are suffering.
And we have Lukashenko so good!
As he says, it will be.”
They offered to give interviews to Belarusian journalists, but no one wanted to.
The sanatorium administration told us: "You are already traitors!"
And the people of the Red Cross and the UN (at least they were so called) spread disinformation that men cannot go to Poland.
Many believed in it and were afraid to leave Belarus.
But we decided to leave, although we had a problem with the documents – my daughter did not have a foreign passport.
We were supposed to receive it on Monday, and on Thursday the war began.
In the Ukrainian consulate we were not helped at all, and in Minsk at the station said that without passports no one will take anyone to the bus.
I would like to say that the Belarusian volunteers have helped us a lot.
We were settled in Minsk, and the escort was carried out.
There was no force in the sanatorium.
Our second group migration representative said that you can live here for a maximum of a week and a half, because Belarus is not Europe, there is no payment here.
We found an in-house carrier who agreed to take us to Warsaw.
Driving near Mozyry (about 50 kilometers from the Ukrainian border – UP), we saw the launches of ballistic missiles in Ukraine: the missile first takes off, brightens beautifully, and then goes out.
People who were sitting on a bus in Mozira told me that the Russians were constantly shooting from the shelves there.
But I can say that the Belarusians absolutely do not want to fight.
Generals are liberated from the army.
One woman told us that she would break something for her son if they called him.
However, the northern part of Belarus, where Minsk, does not believe at all.
They say, “You are lying, we are a people of peace.”

On April 1, the mayor of Bu<0xC4><0x8D>i Anatoly Fedoruk announced the glad news that the Ukrainian military liberated the city from Russian invaders on March 31.
The next day the occupants were expelled from the entire Kyiv region.
However, the joy that Ukrainians should feel at this moment overshadowed the horror and hatred, because at the same time it became known that in only one Bucha the Russians shot at least 280 civilians.
They were killed just on the street, some of them were tied up and shot in the back, some of them were minors.
Killed and with traces of torture found the elderly village of Motyzhyn Olga Sukhenko, her husband Igor and son Alexander, who were kidnapped on March 23.
The bodies of Olga and Alexander were in the fraternal grave, Igor – in the sewer.

President Volodymyr Zelenskyi said that certain types of weapons provided by Western partners came too late.
He said this in an interview with the Associated Press, which was published by the Office of the President, writes "European Truth".
“All the equipment they already send, for some types of equipment, it’s done late.
So when we talk about Mariupol, for example, when you lose thousands of people, and what now?
I see 100% support from the leaders of some countries, that’s really true.
And some European leaders have changed their position, but you see the price of these changes," Zelensky said.
Asked whether Ukraine had enough weapons to make a difference in the war, the president replied: “No, not yet.”
The president also said that if Ukraine were a member of NATO, this war would not be, or it would have a different look.
“It would have unfolded differently, we would have had the shoulders of close neighbors, we could have fought together.
But I'm sure there wouldn't be a war anyway," he added.
The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom has promised Ukraine new military assistance, including armoured vehicles and anti-shipping weapons.

"I'm telling her that TV and radio repairs were delayed due to import details, and friends and acquaintances were warned not to sneeze when calling."
"We've been hiding from the Inf's mother-in-law about the war for a whole month.
So far it has succeeded.
However, in the spots (cat – UP) on the chin and hind legs licked the fur – it can be from stress, changes in food and a lack of vitamins.
The last two reasons have been eliminated, but the stress does not depend on me, unfortunately.
The spot, unlike the mother-in-law, is not deaf, it hears both sirens and explosions.”
Due to the fact that Olga hears badly and spends most of the time in her room, her fiancé for a month lived in an apartment with her "incognito".
On April 1, 93-year-old Oksana Polova took up arms for the first time in her life.
"For 33 days, as a partisan, I lived with her in an apartment.
There was war hidden from her, and the fact that I was around formally came as usual for a few hours.
But when her girlfriend spoke, I gave her the receiver – she listened for 4 hours, then sang for 2 hours.”
The radio has always been near the bed.
The mother-in-law spends most of her time in her room.
It felt so bad that it made me feel invisible to her.
When I heard the sound of her "walking," I was hiding in my room.
First of all, she hid the receiver and the TV from her.
Then I called everyone who communicates with her. It's 6-7 people.
She asked me to talk to her about anything, except the war.
I ask my friend, she was there from the beginning to the end
It's April 17th - I have cleaned 2 apartments :)

The British, who in the ranks of the Armed Forces defended Mariupol, says that they are ready to surrender in captivity to the Russians
The British, who is a soldier of the brigade of the navy of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which participates in the defense of Mariupol, told his friends and family that they would put up arms and surrender to the Russian invaders.
Source: Twitter page Aidin Eislin, a British soldier who has served in the Armed Forces since 2018, the Air Force with reference to family members and friends of Eislin, Atlas News with reference to the words of a friend of Eislin who spoke to him
We received a message from him: "It's been 48 days, we've tried everything possible to protect Mariupol, but we have no choice but to surrender to the Russian troops.
We didn’t have any food or ammunition.
Thank you all, I hope that the war will soon be over.”
Details: Eislin served in the 36th separate naval brigade of the U.S. Navy, which participates in the defence operation of Mariupol.
Air Force journalists contacted the mother of a military serviceman, Ann Wood, and she confirmed that her son had reported on the phone that they were planning to surrender in captivity.
A friend of the military, Brennan Phillips, also confirmed to reporters that in his last phone call, Islin spoke about plans for their surrender unit.
According to him, the brigade ran out of ammunition and food.
Journalists of the Atlas News publication contacted his friend, who said that the unit of Eislin intends to surrender to the Russian units in order not to get without weapons and bullets in the hands of the so-called "cadarovets".
Also on social media was broadcast an audio recording of a telephone conversation, in which it is alleged that Eislin is talking to his familiar American friend, who is planning to go to Ukraine.
In an interview, Eislin said they tried to get out of the city in civilian clothes, but they failed.
Earlier, the British said that on Instagram he was threatened by representatives of the private military company Wagner.
Eislin was a social worker in the city of Newark-on-Trent in Nottinghamshire, but in 2015-2017 he went to take part in the fight against the so-called Islamic State in Syria.
In 2018, he officially joined the ranks of the Armed Forces and took an oath.
Eislin's friends and loved ones were called Johnny, and in social media he is better known by the nickname Cossack Gundi.

The Bolsheviks for their losses in the battle played out to the full.
The teacher Dmitry Pavlytsky, his unknown name relative, Boris Oleksiyenko, was shot.
Their bodies were thrown into a “deep sinking pit, which they had laid to rest on the ground.”
“There was a dead silence in the city.”
Rarely, one of the residents ran from house to house by fire.
On the streets there were always the bodies of the bolsheviks.
And maybe I'll go after you. I need you. I can't do it without you.

I want to be able to thank everyone who helped us, because that was the last hope, right?
I am not afraid of work, as I also lived in the village, so I can and I love to work physically.

You have a very interesting tradition, we go like this for Christmas
Last week, the Verkhovna Rada adopted draft law 7176, which is entitled “On the implementation of monitoring of potential threats to the national security of Ukraine in the sphere of the economy”.
Surprisingly, in essence, the only potential threat to the national security of Ukraine in the sphere of the economy was ... the place where the members of the Supervisory Board of State Companies and State Banks hold meetings.
The initiators of the bill believe that the decision-making of the supervisory board of the state company in conditional Kiev can somehow solve the problems of national security of Ukraine.
We know about a large number of new dangers for state-owned companies, but it is not yet known about any company that had a need to physically hold a meeting of the Supervisory Board at the address of the location.
The potential threat from such a law is understood to be a great basis for "carrying" all the gains in the heavy reform of state enterprises after the Dignity Revolution, including independent supervisory boards, and then establishing manual management.
It was the same as before 2015.
Why do state-owned companies have supervisory boards and who should join them?
What is more, if under patriotic slogans one harmful bill "flyes", then tomorrow others can also fly - for example, you can remove the system of public procurement through ProZorro or the independence of the NBU.
There is so much to write about war.
By the way, this initiative appeared before the beginning of the war and Bill 7176.
Thus, on February 22, this norm was added to the comparative table of Bill 5397.
And in general, the desire to disperse supervisory councils in one way or another has been circulating among some popular electors for a long time.
Not for the sake of criticism as such, but in order to show the possible consequences of the bill, we will analyze the arguments that explained the need for its adoption.
And then we will provide our suggestions on how to solve the issue of management of state enterprises during the war.
First Deputy Minister of Economy Denis Kudin explained the need for such innovation risks of loss of internet and other means of communication, which will prevent remote work of supervisory boards.
In other words, the risk is that the supervisory board will not be able to make the necessary decisions, in connection with which the work of the company can be paralyzed.
We agree that such a risk exists, but will it be able to prevent the transfer of members of the supervisory boards to Ukraine?
Imagine a rather cynical situation, when independent members of supervisory boards (which make up the majority of the total) will provide their personal security above the interests of the company and refuse to come to Ukraine.
In this case, according to the bill, they will be released.
And then, most likely, this will lead to the loss of the quorum required by the supervisory board to make any decisions.
Instead, it will not be possible to quickly appoint new independent members of the Supervisory Board, as the law provides for the need to conduct a competitive selection, which lasts on average 3-4 months.
Therefore, the decision proposed by Bill 7176 will most likely not be able to protect the supervisory board from the loss of the opportunity to make a decision, rather it will lead to the opposite!
The People’s Deputy, author of the bill Dmitry Natalukh provides other arguments for his support.
In particular, he notes: "many enterprises, in particular the defense-industrial complex (OPC), now need relocation" and therefore "it is difficult to imagine that a person can, for example, from Vienna to Zoom discuss addresses and other sensitive information".
To begin with, in Ukraine at all, there are almost no state enterprises of the OPC, which have supervisory boards.
The Supervisory Board is except in "Ukroboronpromi", which in fact carries out the management of almost all state enterprises of the OPC.
But even in "Ukroboronprom", according to the legislation, the Supervisory Board has quite limited powers, and all its members perform duties not on a free basis.
All power in "Ukroboronrom" belongs to the Director General, who, by the way, will make a decision on the need to relocate this or that enterprise of the OPC that is part of the group.
Moreover, such an argument does not withstand criticism even because Bill 7176 does not make any changes to the legislation regulating the activities of state enterprises of the OPK.
Mr. Dmitry on his Facebook page also gives arguments that can be attributed to the category of "emotional".
Such arguments of the Ukrainian soybeans have nothing to do with the improvement of the efficiency of the work of state companies and state banks, but let us try to disassemble some of them: "respectful experts-foreigners at the first word "war", in 2021, leave Ukraine to this.
First, this is manipulation – most of these supervisory board members never lived in Ukraine and only came here periodically.
Therefore, to say that they are “leaving Ukraine” is, to put it mildly, unfair.
Secondly, as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, both foreign and Ukrainian supervisory board members have long resorted to the practice of online meetings.
This tool has long been common in world practice, and in absolutely different areas: business, education, medicine, etc.
You should also not forget that membership in the Supervisory Board is not a full-time job.
As a rule, such people have a different occupation, and it is the means of electronic communication that help them in this.
Thirdly, all these statements are read as claims exclusively to foreigners.
I wonder why Mr. Dmytro does not express identical claims to the members of the supervisory boards who are Ukrainians?
They are also not located in the location of their companies.
By the way, this is not the first populist attempt by deputies to remove foreigners from supervisory councils, and war is just a new convenient opportunity.

In total, over the past six years, Serbia has invested more than two billion euros in the modernization of the army, the modernization of military equipment and the acquisition of modern systems, rising to 22 places in the list of the most powerful military powers in the world.
After the full-scale aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine, the Western countries took the predictions of a possible escalation in the Balkans very seriously.
For Ukraine, this means that the diplomatic solution to the Russian-Ukrainian conflict is complicated and globalized.

The forces of the Lukashenko regime detained three Belarusians for 27 and 28 years, involved in the destruction of two relay cabinets of the signal installation near Osipovich, which ensures the movement of railway trains.
Source: "Radio Svaboda", human rights center "Viasna", head of the criminal police of the Ministry of Internal Affairs Gennady Kazakhevich, quoted by the state intelligence agency "BelTA"
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Belarus reported that on the night of March 30, three residents of Bobruysk were detained, one injured, due to the force support of the special envoys of the SOBR.
According to "Vyasna", when detained, the men made active resistance and tried to escape.
The security forces were using weapons.
One of the detainees was injured and is in a medical facility.
Others were provided with medical care on the spot.
The head of the criminal police of the Belarusian Ministry of Interior Gennady Kazakhevich said that "acts of terrorism on the railway of the RB will stop hard" by the security forces using weapons.
On April 6, it became known that on March 30, the police arrested another employee of the Belarusian railway, an employee of the Baranovic branch "BZD" and the administrator of the thematic resources "BZD" in "VKontaktie" and "Odnoklassnikh" Valentina Sanmas.
Where he is now and in what state is unknown, reports <0x40>belzhd_live.
At the end of March, at least 40 railwaymen were detained in Belarus for the diversion.
Recall: The formation of BYpol, declared by the Lukashenko regime extremist, continues to call on Belarusians to carry out diversions on the facilities of railway transport and infrastructure of Belarus within the framework of the plan "Peramoga".
Belarusian “Reich guerrillas” are thus trying to resist Russian aggression against Ukraine.
As you know, through Belarus, the Russian Federation transfers to war, living strength and technology to Ukraine.

U.S. bans investment in Russia and imposes sanctions against Putin’s daughters
The United States, along with the G7 and the EU, are introducing new sanctions against the daughters of Russian President Putin, the largest banks of the Russian Alpha Bank and Sberbank, as well as banning all new investments in Russia.
This is stated in a statement on the website of the White House.
Sberbank is the largest financial institution in Russia, owned by the government, and Alpha-Bank is the largest private bank.
The sanctions will freeze any of their assets related to the U.S. financial system and prohibit U.S. citizens from doing business with them.
In addition, the States will introduce a complete ban on new investments in the Russian Federation.
To this end, U.S. President Joe Biden will sign a new decree that includes a ban on new investments in Russia by U.S. citizens regardless of their location.
“This step is based on the decision taken by more than 600 transnational companies to withdraw from Russia.
The exit of the private sector includes manufacturers, energy companies, large retailers, financial institutions, as well as other service providers, such as legal and consulting firms,” the White House said in a statement.
The third step of the new sanctions from the United States has become restrictions against large Russian state-owned enterprises of the critical sphere.
This will prohibit U.S. citizens from conducting operations with these organizations and will freeze any of their assets in U.S. jurisdictions.
A detailed list of the Ministry of Finance will be published the next day on Thursday.
And the last part of the package is a complete blockade of assets of the adult children of Putin, the wife and daughter of the Minister of Foreign Affairs Lavrov, as well as members of the Security Council of Russia, including the President and Prime Minister of Russia Dmitry Medvedev and Prime Minister of Russia.
Sanctions exclude them from the U.S. financial system and freeze all assets they hold in the United States.

Good evening, I can't help but share with you. There is a message from Mariupol for my son - alive and well.
Advice to read Joe Dispens, he is conducting scientific research on the influence of external factors and the formation of new neurons of connections
Journalist of the TV channel "1<0x2B>1" Natalia Nagorna released a video on the morning of April 12, which was transmitted to her by the military 36th Brigade of Marines from Mariupol.
In it, the soldiers say that they have no weapons left to take part in the battles, and the mountains of the wounded.
They said, “The bill goes for hours.”
Before this, on April 11, the 36th separate naval infantry brigade, which participates in the defense of Mariupol, published an appeal to the Ukrainians in Russian.
The statement said that April 11 could be the last battle for the defenders of Mariupol, and the Ukrainian military command did not contact the fighters for two weeks.
On social media, there was skepticism that the statement was published in Russian.
Chief Commander of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Valery Zaluzhny assured that the command relationship with the defence forces in Mariupol is there, and details of the defense operation should not be the subject of public discussion.
The Russians threatened to block Ukrainian fighters on the territory of the factory "Azovstal" in Mariupol and to use chemical weapons against them.
On the evening of April 11, Russian invaders dropped on Mariupol a toxic substance of unknown origin.
As told the leader of "Azov" Andriy Biletsky, the army of the Russian Federation used chemical weapons over the factory "Azovstal", which is held by soldiers of the regiment "Azov".
Thank you, I will adapt to you. That would be very good
The situation is the same as we remain here.

Two Transcarpathian and two Czech brothers “birds” were sent to Ukraine the day before thanks to the deputy of the Mukachevo City Councillor Volodymyr Labutenko.
Today, because their intermountain friends, headed by the head of the village council and coordinator https://www.facebook.com/examplehere101/ Vasyl Shchurom, delivered drones on purpose: they were received by special units of Ukrainian troops in different cities.
In order to make the most efficient and safe use of helicopters - the place of their location will now be left in secret.
Four friends, who help the Ukrainian army from the Czech Republic on the made stop do not plan, say: in the coming days will send many more interesting "gifts" that will serve to the crooks of the Russian occupier.

Today I had a lesson from a lady who is the director of the economy department of the country of altitude.
She was very pleased with my work.
I've behaved very well in the nurseries.
On Monday I have to bring confirmation of employment as well as cash payment for nurseries.
I’ve been running since Friday.
I don't do anything but a lot of them and I sleep <0xE6><0x9F><0x98><0x82> (and drink a lot of water <0xE2><0x98><0x9D><0xE6><0x9F><0x8F><0xBB>)
If you go to the doctor tomorrow I will go with you if you can.
I need to get another analysis.
You won’t have to go again.
The drain tank works very badly, washes badly. You need a master. You need to set up.
That's all there is to it.
Can you send me the correct e-mail address?
I want to send you an invitation to the Czech language course for which you have registered.
Do the children need to be fed there or should they be brought with them?
And now for a moment you can come up with one question
If you need help, write.
If I'm not mistaken, you're celebrating Easter today, right?
From the very beginning, we didn’t want you to raise money so that people didn’t think we were speculating on it!
But for online filling, I didn’t have enough of two points:
I will lie down to rest. Gain strength and energy. Thank you for today's gift. Overnight
<0xE6><0x9F><0x98><0x84><0xE6><0x9F><0x98><0xE5><0x8D><0x8D>aka great idea. Now the video will look. It will be good, because the whole family will draw.
Karazin University encourages employees and students to carefully check any information, not to trust anonymous sources in messaging and social networks, rumors, and gossip.
Focus only on the official information . . .
You can count on me, thank you!
My other brother, who stayed in Ukraine, also helps the army
I've collected a few works for the portfolio.
After the holidays, they have to use the internet.
I would like to be your backup designer.
How to count the day that I was not at work is a pass
Headquarters: Russia is preparing a provocation in Transnistria to blame Ukraine
The Russian army may resort to provocations in the Transnistrian region of Moldova to accuse Ukraine of “aggression against the neighbouring state.”
Literally: "It is not excluded that the armed forces of the Russian Federation carry out provocative actions on the territory of the Transnistrian region of the Republic of Moldova with the aim of accusing Ukraine of aggression against the neighbouring state."
Details: The enemy continues to create an offensive grouping of troops for action in Slobozhansk direction.
In the coming days, the occupiers will probably try to recapture the offensive.
In addition, the enemy continues to train and send personnel, weapons and equipment to participate in hostilities on the territory of Ukraine.
Weapons and military equipment are being prepared at the point of permanent deployment of the 60th Separate Motor-Shooter Brigade (Monastirishte) of the 5th General Army of the Eastern Military District.
It is likely that these weapons will be moved to the temporarily occupied territory of the Donetsk region.
Also to recover the losses of the personnel of the units of the battalion tactical group from the 36th separate motor-fire brigade (Borsya, Zabaykalsky Krai) of the 29th General Army of the Eastern Military District.
The enemy feels a special problem when completing the positions of drivers and mechanics-drivers.
The departure of the selected personnel from the point of permanent deployment is planned for the second half of April of this year.
It is likely that the enemy, in order to disrupt the supply of cargo to the sites of hostilities, will continue the strikes on the facilities of transport infrastructure on the territory of Ukraine with the aim of destroying or dismantling them.
Determined units of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Belarus continue to carry out tasks of strengthening the protection of the Ukrainian-Belarusian border in the Brest and Gomel regions.
In the Slobozhansk direction, separate units of the 6th General Army and the coastal forces of the Northern Fleet continue the partial blockade of the city of Kharkov, artillery shelling of certain areas of the city continues.
In the Izyum direction, air reconnaissance of the area is ongoing with the aim of identifying the positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
For this, the enemy uses the UAV "Orlan-10".
Forces to two battalion tactical groups the enemy tried to carry out an attack in the direction of the settlements of Dovgenyka and Dmitrovka, had no success and withdrew to previously occupied positions.
In the Donetsk direction, the enemy's main efforts continue to focus on taking control of the settlements of Popasna, Rubizhne, Nizhnye and Novobahmutivka, as well as establishing full control over the city of Mariupol.
The enemy tried to carry out assaults in the area of the Golden, had no success.
In the city of Mariupol, with the help of artillery and aviation, the occupiers continue the assault operations in the areas of the factory "Azovstal" and the sea port.
By forces of separate enemy units carried out artillery shelling of the positions of Ukrainian troops in the areas of the settlements of Vysokopyly, Trudoliubivka and Maryanske.
On the territory of Donetsk and Luhansk regions, the defenders of Ukraine over the past day repelled four enemy attacks, destroyed five tanks, eight units of armored vehicles, six units of automotive equipment and eight enemy artillery systems.
Don't understand your thoughts?
We'll try to make it, of course, but I doubt it.
How can you sleep? You want to sleep and I'll hold you back.
Are you sure you don't mind me coming?
Maybe you just don't want to see me today, so tell me, I'll understand)
Thank you. We did not watch TV at home and more than 1<0x2B>1. We do not have to set up :)
I turn on the TV here only in order to listen to the Czech language
I have a month-to-month plan out today :)
Can we do this on the phone today?
Buy fabric for embroidery, canvas, threads for embroidery
I understand, then I can prepare the material in this field.
I'll ask her. I'm a little embarrassed to ask, she's giving us so much cake.
We'll meet with my father later, be sure to <0xE6><0x9F><0x99><0x8F><0xE6><0x9F><0x8F><0xE5><0x8F><0xBB>
I read an ad on facebook that maybe Google wrote something about me <0xE3><0x80><0x8C><0xE3><0x80><0x8D><0xE3><0x80><0x8D>, I think the phone number is enough
Hello, we have the things that you have brought, but are there things that little ones can bring you in 10 minutes?
I thought about the job.
If the director agrees, then I can start to go to work from next week because tomorrow before lunch I plan to go to the office to submit documents (if it works, because the lines are very big) and on Saturday the rain :)
I am looking for a brigade in the beginning, I liked it very much in the school of chemistry, I study the Czech language, to know perfectly, I dream to work at Tevi
Friends are old and not very, friends with whom I do not know personally, friends in spirit and mind.
There have also been difficult times for you.
Over the past month, I have been communicating with many of you.
Your life, which has never been easy before, has turned from head to toe, as does the life of every Ukrainian.
Many of you are fleeing Russia.
And many of you have confessed to feeling guilty and ashamed of your country’s actions towards your neighbors.
That's why they're subservient to Ukraine on your behalf.
Some of you, activists, have long been threatened, and you are preparing for a decisive blow.
In early March, I wrote to Alexander Cherkasov, my very old friend from Memorial.
Let me tell you a little later, – as usual, Sasha answered laconicly. – Now after the search we walk through the ruins.
Others – cultural figures, artists, critics, writers – are impressed by the sudden collapse of your fragile world.
None of you like Putin and his regime of thieves and fascists, most of you hate them.
But let’s be honest: with the exception of very few of you – those who worked at Memorial, New Gazette, Echo of Moscow, Medusa, Navalny and a number of other places – did many of you do anything to oppose this regime?
Except for taking part in the rallies when they were still taking place.
Read also the column of a Russian journalist "It's too late to hide, it's too late to be silent"
And if so, are you sure that your sense of shame and guilt is not just an abstraction?
Perhaps they are caused by your long-standing indifference to what is going on around you, your apathy and your passive sympathy, which is now probably a great burden on your soul and heart?
It wasn't always like that.
In the 1990s, there was a short period of time when you had to some extent freedom and democracy – disorganized, even bloody, but real.
But the year 1991 was no better than the year 1917.
Why is it that every time you finally have a revolution, you end up with such a strong fear of sadness that you seek salvation behind the king, let his name be Stalin or Putin?
No matter how many people he killed, you still think he's safer around him.
In fact, mistakes have been made.
Instead of capturing and publicizing the archives of the KGB, as the Germans did, you took your soul to the Dzerzhinsky monument – and allowed the KGB to lay down, to renew, to reshape and to seize power over the country.
When you were placed before the choice between robbing the country and returning the Communists, you did not start fighting for the possibility of a third option – and humbly resigned to the robbery.
In 1998, your economy collapsed, and this marked the end of mass rallies for great social justice or against the war in Chechnya.
The main concern was survival.
Then Putin appeared. Young, enterprising, aggressive, he promised to deal with the terrorists and raise the economy.
Few of you bought it, but you either voted for it, or preferred not to vote at all.
When he began to compare Chechnya with the earth again, most of you closed your eyes to it.
I remember those years well.
At the time, I was working in Chechnya, helping those affected by Putin’s “anti-terrorist operation”, and I saw with my own eyes the ruins of the Terrible, Qatar-Yurti, Itum-Kali and other cities.
Sometimes on the weekends I went back to Moscow and had fun chatting with you, my friends.
We drank, danced, and sometimes I tried to tell you about the horrors that I witnessed: the torture of civilians, the killing of children, the soldiers who sold the bodies of the dead to their families.
You said to me, "Brady, we're tired of your Chechen." I remember these words very well.
In response, I was angry: "Friends, this is not my Chechnya, this is your Chechnya.
It's your country, damn it, not mine.
I'm just a stupid stranger here.
It’s your government bombing one of your cities, killing your fellow citizens.”
But no, it was all too difficult, too painful, and you didn't want to know anything.
Then came the economic rise of the middle of zero, caused by rising oil prices and Putin’s willingness to look through the fingers at the fact that part of the stolen money will remain in the pockets of the middle class.
Many of you have become well-earned, some have become rich, and even the poorest of you have bought a new home and found a better job.
Prices are rising, but is that a problem?
Moscow festively glowed and shivered from chic.
When several opponents – Yuri Shchekochihin, Anna Politkovsky, Oleksandr Litvinenko and others – were killed, many of you were shocked and expressed horror about what happened.
However, the case didn't go any further.
When, after two terms, Putin handed over the post of President Medvedev, and himself took the place of prime minister, you, as I see it, barely paid attention to it.
When, after a few months of Medvedev’s rule, Russia invaded Georgia, most of you ignored it or were silent.
How many of you have I met in the following years on the mountain slopes of Gudauri, in the outskirts of Kazbega or in the cafes and Turkish baths of Tbilisi, while part of this country was occupied by your army?
I have to admit that it is unlikely that we in the West did a lot of things if we did anything at all.
A little outrage, a little sanctions; but what does it mean that Russia is blatantly violating international law when Russian oil, gas and the domestic market are so tempted?
Living in Russia was good.
After the 1990s, it was the most important thing.
However, at the end of 2011, you, my Russian friends, still woke up.
When Putin again switched seats with Medvedev and sat in the presidential chair, as before, many of you decided it was too much, and you massed out to protest.
Navalny's name became provocative, you didn't walk out of the streets for half a year, and the regime eventually felt horrified that it was losing ground under its feet.
After that, he struck in response.
At first, alternative actions were organized, then more repressive laws were adopted, and the prisons were filled with people.
Thousands were behind bars.
Some of them got a lot of deadlines.
"And what could we do?"
I’ve heard it so often and still hear it.
“The country is so strong, and we are so weak.”
Well, look at the Ukrainians.
Look at what they did two years ago.
Angry at the pro-Russian president, who fooled their European hopes, they once captured Maidan – and never left him again.
They set up the camp entirely on their own and prepared for a decisive defense.
When the police arrived and tried to destroy it, they began to defend themselves with the help of Molotov’s sticks, armatures and cocktails.
In the end, the police opened fire.
But instead of fleeing, the protesters went on strike.
Many have died, but they have won.
Yanukovych became a fugitive, and Ukrainians returned to democracy, the right to choose leaders themselves and expel them if they do their job badly.
Maidan did not like Putin very much.
That was a bad example.
Therefore, taking advantage of the general unhappiness, he seized Crimea.
Some of you have been against it, but there is little benefit to it.
And how many of you were excited!
As far as I know, 91% of Russian citizens supported the annexation.
Somewhere a new myth was born, and many of you, who despised Putin and his sheikh, suddenly returned to 180 degrees and began to adore him.
It was hard for me to find a reason, because immediately after that we stopped talking.
The rest of those who remained my friends were mostly silent.
“We don’t care about politics,” he said.
And you’re new to hiding in books, movies, IKEA catalogs and parks, as new after the restoration started by the mayor of Moscow in 2012 – with their bins, public wi-fi and hipster cafes.
In fact, Donbass is far away, and Moscow is so beautiful – and only gets better.
You have just turned your attention to Syria.
There were terrorists, right?
ISIS or something there... Even the Moscow editor, who published my book on Syria, criticized it at the time in an interview because I barely understood anything about what was happening in Syria.
Well, at least I went there and saw myself on the streets of Homs, state snipers shooting cold-blooded at my children's peers.
Among all the citizens of Russia there were only your soldiers, who in 2015 began bombing thousands of civilians, gaining experience for the next serious war.
Of course, many of you know the words of Pastor Martin Nimmeler:
“At first they came for the socialists, but I kept quiet because I’m not a socialist.
Then they came for the members of the trade unions, but I was silent – because I am not a member of the trade unions.
Then they came for the Jews, but I kept silent, because I was not a Jew.
Then they came for me, but there was no one left who could say anything in my defense."
How many of you talked about Chechens, Syrians or Ukrainians?
Some of you did it.
But the vast majority remained silent.
Some are really talking now – like, for example, Dmitry Glukhovsky, Mikhail Shishkin, Mikhail Zigar, Maxim Osipov and others.
Most allow themselves to speak from abroad, some – from the middle of the country, like Marina Ovsnnikova, risking to get into the new GULAG or form a company Navalny.
As far as others are concerned, you know best what country you live in.
So, I’m sure you understand: when Putin deals with the Ukrainians – or, which seems very likely, if he doesn’t do it – he’ll take care of you.
For all of you, my friends: for those who are brave, but mostly alone went out to protest and still took place in a small amount of time, but soon will get more serious.
For thousands of you who signed the petition, who expressed disagreement on social media (even if only a black square on Instagram) or spoke in private conversations with colleagues at work.
The times, when 10 or even 25 years of deprivation of liberty were given just for an anecdote, are not in the distant past – and now they are, most likely, waiting for you in the future.
Who will speak for you then? Who will lose?
The example of Ukrainians – even more than in 2014 – scares the Putin regime: they prove that you can fight it.
And that reason, motivation, and courage can stop him, no matter how overwhelming the paper of his advantage.
After all, few in Russia are aware of this, as is the fact that the war is going on in general.
But you, my friends, know very well what is happening now.
You read foreign news on the Internet, you have friends or even relatives in Ukraine, with whom you are in contact.
And Putin knows what you know.
So be prepared.
You know what it's all about.
A good life in exchange for your silence has come to an end.
Your choices are just a hog, your laws, if you do not take into account the repressive ones, are not worth more than the paper on which they are written, your latest free media no longer exists, your economy is crumbling faster than you are in the past if you are in the past, you no longer have credit cards to buy.
Now Putin will not be satisfied with your silence, he will demand your consent, your humility.
And if you don’t give him what he wants, you can try or somehow go, or you’ll be disappointed.
I doubt you’re seeing any other option.
And yet there is one more.
Which, in the end, will break this regime.
And, perhaps, under the conditions that have arisen, you will need less than you think.
Think about it.
The spark will not come from you: due to the economic collapse that is heading towards Russia, it is most likely to burn in the province, in small cities.
When prices go up and wages are not paid, those people who voted for Putin all these years, because they wanted bread and peace, will go out on the street.
Putin knows this and is afraid of these people much more than he is afraid of the intellectuals and middle class of Moscow and St. Petersburg, that is, you, my friends.
But if each city goes to rallies on its own, as it already happened periodically, it will not be difficult to suppress them alone.
Organization and coordination will be needed. The crowd will need to be transformed into a mass.
You have this great magic tool – the internet, which mode can limit, but which still works and which can be set up in almost any circumstance.
Navalny's organization was crushed, but it is possible to create other, more informal, more decentralized.
There are so many of you, millions of you.
Moscow police can cope with 30,000 people on the streets of the city, possibly with hundreds of thousands.
If it's more than 300,000, she'll be shocked.
We will have to use the army, but will this army fight for Putin when it comes to business?
After all, what did he make them in Ukraine, all that he made them go through?
Of course, the danger will be very great.
Many of you will feel obvious fear; but those who have children will fear for them.
And that's natural, that's normal.
I'd be scared if I were you too.
On the example of Syria, and now of Ukraine, Putin wanted to show you what happens to those who dare to neglect their master, who dare not only to demand freedom, but really try to gain it.
But even if you do nothing, the lives of many people will still be lost in vain.
Your son will make a joke in a computer game chat – and will be arrested; your daughter will express outrage on the internet – and will be arrested; your close friend will make mistakes – and die in a raw camera under police dungeons.
This is what has been happening for many years – and will only continue to strengthen, gaining ever larger and larger scales.
So you don't have a choice. If you don't do anything, you know how it ends up.
Act cold-bloodedly, think strategically, and make it a reality.
We were in class on Friday, we were told that we could come on Monday
We'll be home in the evening.
What do you think of me as a secretary?
How often do you go out to dinner in an expensive restaurant?
Once on a date, I go to dinner at an expensive restaurant.
I'll try to explain everything to her.
So we liked it very nice and we wanted something shine so it's the best option
I was in a room where there were a lot of people. I got tired energetic.
I feel bad, cough, fever, voice disappearing, weakness and head spinning
I have to go to the government.
We have already done it, but said who registered in April will receive the money only at the end of the month
On Thursday we need a pass, we go with the children to the doctor.
But at night I was writing to a lady who liked your work, and she would like something from you in her house.
I look forward to hearing new news from her and will be sure to report it.
While working at the prosecutor’s office, I thought I was building a career that took a lot of time and effort.
I had a complicated psychological, responsible, mental work in which I was completely disappointed.
It’s a shame that you’ve lost your time, but it’s a life experience.
In my personal life, I am communicative, but I take same-sex marriage seriously.
There was one man I was supposed to marry, but he died of heart problems.
I believe that in order to create a family, people have to love, respect, trust each other.
I haven't seen this before.
Good day. Where in the Head can you buy forms for baking a paste(paper or silicone)?
All right, thanks for the advice, I'll put a certificate on Vali's profile now.
She has a DCP in a lying state, she has now a broken leg in a plaster, a wheelchair in a lying position, the food is all rubbed in a blender
Mr. Reyhardt, I'm sorry to bother you in your spare time.
But I have an important question for you.
I went to Natalie's playroom today to say hi to her.
She was in an unpleasant situation.
Because when the children went home, one mother refused to pick up the child, because she said that she came to look at things and put them in that room with clothes and Mr. Valerie yesterday opened our children's room until 7:00 p.m.
Is that really possible?
Working hours of the room are until 16:00.
In the end, it is our responsibility.
But I do not load does not open the page very weak internet
Good day, we are all well) Kolya works, yesterday we filled out the invitations, and I took care of the seniors before the exam in the gym.

Mom's been standing there since 4 a.m.
Maybe the hostess will leave her phone for communication.
So far, I think the best option is this house in Prague-8.
The director didn’t tell me anything about the possibility of sponsoring a child’s lunch.
I was given this information to pay.
For part of March and April I have already paid for food.
If you had the opportunity to help me pay for May and June?
What should I do?
Do you want to talk to the principal of the school about this?
Is it better to go on Mondays or come on Wednesdays?
All your friends will know that you are communicating with me.
