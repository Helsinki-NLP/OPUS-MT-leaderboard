UKIP survivors who refuse those who live with HIV are a perfect example.
You talk about when Nigel Farage says the NHS should not be used to pay for those who come to the UK to do health tourism, and when, with that in mind, he answers yes when the interviewer specifically asks him if people living with HIV are included in the unwanted ones.
First you use special arguments, then you discredit them by barely veiled homophobia.
Whenever I or my family need the NHS, we have to queue up for chronic hypochondria intolerant people who think everything is due to them.
I think you're the one who's using special arguments.
Health tourism, as defined by the right wing, practically does not exist.
I think that's what we call democracy.
Then no one would be affected by UKIP’s measures against health tourism, so there is no problem.
It is only in the parallel universe of UKIP that Carswell can appear as a revolutionary.
A quote drawn from a towel is not evidence.
So, shoot the messenger.
The Mail did not write the report, it just commented on it.
Those who control the majority of the media in this country should be shot for propagating such populist propaganda as if it were the reality.
I don't think you know what a special argument is.
You also don’t know anything about my personal situation or my identity, so you should be careful when you try to kill the debate by accusations of homophobia.
Farage's phrase surprised a lot, but only because we talk so rarely about this problem.
He made absolutely no homophobic remarks.
You're gonna have to be able to get it back.
I’m not sure where you want to come from, but I guess you don’t like it when the media talk about what you don’t like.
We talk about it so rarely because unlike Farage and his clingy followers of Thatcher who think that AIDS and floods are a sign of God and not a reflection on their own inability to understand that the complexities of humanity are something good, so no.
In the end, the situation is as bad in Ireland as it is in Spain.
With the new crisis coming, the period of austerity will not have arranged anything.
Expecting almost 5% growth in 2015 is a big joke.
Ireland, the ''Tiger of Europe''', was a few years ago.
We've met the sequel!
It begins to read the article.
We are trying to make Ireland believe that it is a virtuous country and that a ''NEW ECONOMIC MIRACLE'' is taking place.
With the Brussels Agreement, imposed on the lowest societies in Europe, a very flexible labour march, an emigration that continues.
With these ingredients nothing to ''pavoir'' for the moment with the arrival of the Poles.
In the 1980s, Ireland was one of the poorest countries in the European Union, with Portugal considering a constant perimeter, without the new countries, the situation is always better than it was.
Greece was ahead of us.
That their development was not a long quiet river, it is in view of recent events.
The lowest tax rate in Europe?
That's wrong!
Latvia has a tax rate of 0% on businesses.
Now there is a real hypocrisy in France on the part of the policies on taxes actually paid by multinationals.
If we believe a report released in 2008 or 2009, they pay in France less than 5% in general.
Only small and medium-sized businesses pay full.
Now I’m confirming that road traffic has become huge again, and there are new (and expensive) cars on every street corner, just like before the 2008 crisis.
I have been living in Dublin for 14 years, the recovery is evident in the daily plugs since the return.
Is this supposed to be economic news?
Don't worry, I'm sure the comments will come off soon.
In another article they are writing, 2 Vauxhaul Astra are involved in an A140 hookup.
Does Ryanair now plan to transfer passengers from one flight to another in this way?
I believe that Mr. O'Leary will soon buy a whole new fleet of aircraft, so some bumps and scratches on the old ones will soon be forgotten.
That said, I’m flying with him next week, so I hope it won’t be on one of those two once refueled.
So it would be entirely the fault of the other pilot.
Did Ryanair make passengers pay a surcharge for the additional fear that we wanted to provide them?
But without this kind of Irish business, you couldn't afford to go on vacation, young man
I never took Ryanair and the last 3 times I took the plane was with BA.
I prefer when the airline offers a quality service.
No, but it's Ryanair, so they can be happy about it.
Any article on Ryanair triggers dozens of comments from people who would never take Ryanair instead of those who like to take Ryanair and think that those who pay something other than the base rate just have to take care of themselves, etc.
It's pretty transparent.
Ryanair will not be satisfied with the additional costs due to the incident.
I wonder what the delays will be and whether passengers will have to be compensated and, if so, whether Ryanair will be able to avoid paying by saying that it was a mistake of the airport's air traffic controllers.
Passengers were put on another plane in less than an hour, they are not entitled to any compensation.
I'm sorry to disappoint you and your dreams of compensation.
Welcome aboard this British Airways flight that takes English ISIS to Syria, not true as you say.
Good trip
Last Sunday in Paris, rue des Francs-Bourgeois: the Marais is largely pedestrian, and literally crumbles of the world.
People do not come in bulk for the quality of the restaurants (any, for the most part) nor for the Salon de la revue <0xC3><0xA0> l’Espace des Blancs-Manteaux (hyper-intellectual and slightly dusty).
The reason for this crowd is that the shops are all open and the neighborhood is incredibly lively and lively.
With a lot of foreigners who spend .....
Do you think Sunday’s opening will create jobs?
Go to Paris Rue des Francs Bourgeois where shops are open on Sunday, crowded with 50% tourists.
<0x40>Aloe is wrong.
The only argument that would seem acceptable to me is that of the areas receiving a large number of foreign tourists and it is nuanced by the fact that they buy in detachment.
The tourist areas lose a considerable volume of turnover each year for the same reasons.
It remains the industry where expensive equipment, operated on Sunday, allows to lower prices.
Sunday rest is a right for employees, except for exceptions.
This is why it is envisaged and regulated by the Labour Code.
Neither the Minister for Economic Affairs nor the Minister for Foreign Affairs have the slightest competence to reform the Labour Code.
As they curl it up.
What's the law for?
To satisfy a part of the population and companies that want to work on Sunday .
In Montreal on Sunday, I take my little children to the municipal library.
In my town of 30000 inhabitants where I live in France the municipal library is open 4 days a week but not the we!
This is the access to culture...
And this is also the regulation of working time.
the way of life he defended tenaciously against fascism
the way of life that he stubbornly defended against fascism and Bolshevism
What if his daughter's succession was, against his will, used to pay the succession fees?
There are paintings.
Some are good, some are not terrible.
Without a doubt, his succession would want his share of the cake, if you give me the expression.
his preference for a victory of the nationalists/Franco in the Spanish civil war...
And his hostility to the independence of places like Ireland and India and his fascist ideas as a whole and also add his well-known hatred of the Jews.
Churchill was not perfect.
Neither do I.
But for 5 years, and only for five years, it was perfect.
In 1940 he led other government aristocrats who wanted to discuss an “agreement” with the Nazis and he won very skillfully.
Thanks to his magnificent rhetoric and energy, he united the country in the idea that fighting fascists was the only way to win.
The people of the United Kingdom, and France, and Belgium, and ultimately the whole world, can thank God for having had Churchill at the bar and no one else during these five years, just those five years.
The greatness of Churchill has nothing to do with this discussion.
That his descendants sell the paintings on the free market to collect the money from the succession fees, they could even make a profit.
If the public wants to be able to admire one in a museum, let them gather the money to buy it.
It's as simple as that.
But we could use the tax money.
No one can deny that when it was “the moment of truth,” Churchill’s personality was a positive advantage for his country during World War II.
A resurgence of the internal market through public works will only benefit large companies, which will increase their dividends by avoiding hiring, as infrastructure construction sites are by definition unrenewable.
As for the social reforms advocated by the minister, they well reflect the real evil of France: the distrust of dialogue.
Return to the Princes.
A reform of unemployment insurance is not inconsistent.
May the weakest of us not be in need!
Either we come to his aid in solidarity, or he has the right in exchange for the services he provides or has rendered to a minimum of resources.
The SM40H I prefer to smic corresponds to this vision.
There is also the landlord who lives on income from his properties.
There is a need to differentiate between the one who invests for a return at the time of his retirement and the one who lives on his pensions.
A property to rent or even two for a couple on top, it's vice
The little genius of Finance is singularly lacking in imagination.
The new deal was a policy of great work, but at a time of shortages in large infrastructures.
Today, in Europe and France, this is not the case.
Developed countries are over-equipped.
The need for infrastructure is marginal so in no way a new deal could be a solution.
Especially at a time when the question of decline arises in response to a recession that is only a wild and therefore brutal decline.
You would have been right 30 years ago: no more need (or possibilities) for dams, coal mines, highways...
But if we want to make the future climate-energy shock less harsh, then the need for investments is screaming: isolation, renovation of the railway network, urban transport, transport and energy storage etc...
A taxation that promotes high incomes and pensioners.
Who is in power?
Obsessed with smartphones.
Charles Arthur is a gallop.
Samsung’s profits are being undermined by the iPhone 6 and its competitors of the same range
Apple’s mid-September introduction of larger screens for iPhone 6 and 6 Plus may have seduced buyers who would otherwise have bought a Galaxy
I tested all these phones and decided on the LG G3.
So Samsung lost me as a customer, but not for Apple’s benefit.
I believe it is imperative that we have an alternative.
When Microsoft introduced this philosophy, we experienced a decade of stagnation that was finally broken by Google, Apple and the open source community.
We need to have several dynamic platforms, to stimulate competition and development.
In addition, we all have different needs and they cannot be met by a single manufacturer, because they are not compatible.
For me, I tend to buy Apple, because I like their underlying philosophy and I like the design.
Some people don’t attach any value to design, for them the options, the functionality and the price matter.
There's nothing wrong with that.
Let’s stop looking for a “better platform”.
Is there "a better car manufacturer", not really, they are different, but similar.
I would like to see a thriving laptop industry, with radically different approaches for different people and markets.
It is healthier and should be encouraged.
This is in our interest to all.
I’m glad you found exactly what you were looking for and that it’s not an Apple product, even though I made a different choice.
Most of the people I know have iPhones.
Our umpfrontist friends who, according to one of them, are fighting ideas and not men (on the contrary, on Parisian fools) could tell us what author(s) they are fighting ideas about gender and tell us the works they mean to fight.
Or do they just attack the genre as described in Le Figaro, Minute or Current Values?
Is it Judith Butler or Eric Zemmour?
Well, Jean, I love you very much, and you're a smart and cultivated person.
I said this about Judith in the vein of Furusato evoking Holopherne, a closeness that had not come to me (I do not have his vivacity of mind).
Otherwise, deep down, since you are referring to it, this topic does not interest me, and honestly I do not see where the problem is: I was hoping that you and your friends could get me out of my back, because I am slow but I understand well...
<0x40>Jean: Recognize that, culturally, sending Judith back to Holopherne, it does.
Who is afraid of the world?
But what are we afraid of those who are afraid?
Furasato and <0x40> give us answers.
The first by invoking the Judith of the Bible, the second by calling Judith Butler a very symbolic throat cutter.
We can see how much these studies affect the most intimate in their home.
Obviously, we are no longer in the idea debate.
It's something else, much deeper.
Did you read, John, that the World has published an article on the necessity of theology?
<0x40>: As for an idea debate, I thought it was appropriate to go to the sources.
To pretend to fight ideas from the only statement their detractors make (Cardinal Ratzinger, inventor of the Theory of Gender or X Lacroix, theologian) does not seem very rigorous.
But, as I explained to our umpfrontist friend, it is all the difference between having an enlightened opinion and a simple opinion.
I'm not sure he understands the nuance.
I did not read Judith, the very symbolic throat slicer, I was content with the "Second Sex" (it was more of my time) which I believe is the source of "the source" according to Lo's wishes.
As I watched the eclipse from Melbourne, I saw red lights when the moon briefly showed up when the clouds opened.
This sudden appearance of the red moon had its charm and somewhat offset the disappointment of sometimes having the view blocked by the clouds.
It was fabulous here at FNQ.
Yes, the cloud of last night would really close the coast of Victoria and NSW, while most of the rest of Australia had clear weather.
Flash special blood moon.
Tony Abbott / Joe Hockey make Labor responsible.
But if Labour accepts our unjust budget, we will return it its true color as soon as possible.
It obsesses you, doesn't it?
I was in Melbourne so naturally I only saw clouds.
Melbourne has also managed to cover itself throughout the week of the Perseus meteor shower and for virtually all the important astronomical phenomena of recent years.
I'm starting to think that there's a bad genius whose only purpose is to prevent the people of Melbourne from seeing anything from the sky.
Melbourne is really not the best place for an observatory, even though things are getting much better on the other side of the Cordillera.
There were periods of 10 to 20 minutes where I could not see the eclipse because of the clouds above the suburb of Melbourne.
I'm going to put a tax on this eclipse.
Anyone looking at this eclipse should pay a fee.
I bet your first thought of the day is for Abbott, just like the last one before you go to bed.
Who or what will obsess you when it will end up disappearing?
It seems that you spend a lot of time reading the discussions looking for messages in which people criticize the Abbott government and then accuse them of being obsessed with EUX.
Beautiful photo of the moon above the Harbour Bridge in Sydney.
It looks like Mars is going to collide with Earth!
Nothing about stock market and real estate speculation.
There is nothing about the inequalities between labour and capital incomes.
Nothing about tax fraud.
Ultra-liberalism is killing Europe.
Nothing about the gardens of Babylon...
The article says too much or not enough.
The details and arguments of these recommendations are not given.
There is no hyperlink to the original documents so that one can make an opinion.
Today, Tuesday, October 15, the results of the miracle revenues: in Spain, exports are at their lowest in five years.
In Greece, the stock market collapses.
However, it seems that these are the examples to follow.
The reform of the notaries would generate a claim for compensation of the order of 8 billion euros.
The Ministry of the Economy states that these claims for compensation are not justified.
What if the Ministry of the Economy made a mistake?
Will decision makers who have squandered the political gains resulting from the courageous attack of notaries have the same courage when presenting the bill to the state budget?
The sequel in its time.
Okay, thanks, JYL....
<0x40>lol No The state is not comparable to households in terms of managing its budget because the time horizon of the state is theoretically infinite while that of the household is limited by the lifetime of its members.
In addition, unless public expenditure is considered unproductive, it contributes to financing material and intangible investments that are a guarantee of tomorrow's growth and therefore future revenues.
Some elements of the answer.
A regrettable decision.
But remember the sacred oath of Hippocrates: the health of the profits of global pharmaceutical companies must be preserved above all else.
It's a nice conspiracy theory.
Unfortunately, the truth does not correspond to your imagination.
The medical staff would like to be able to use it, but they have the hands bound by the law as written by the policies.
This is the same situation as for the product that causes medical abortions rather than having risky surgical interventions, safe shooting rooms for addicts rather than having them on the streets, etc.
On these issues politicians want to please the uncultivated masses.
By the way, doctors don’t make money with medications.
That's why there are pharmacists.
Doctors don't make money with medications Since Liberals want our health care system to look like the U.S., you should find out how it works.
Everywhere in the world doctors are courted in the same way, but it is more or less visible.
It may have been wrong to blame the toubibs, but the reality is that many countries, including Australia, give priority to corporate profits and “research.”
So read the few rare reports on our Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme spending and on negotiations with pharmaceutical companies compared to other countries.
Compare global prices of medicines present everywhere, as well as differences from one country to another on what is over-the-counter or prescription only.
This reinforces it is a political and economic process, not a medical or scientific process, direct or indirect.
In fact, some companies are even testing marijuana inhalations against oncological pain, despite the laws that curb them and the necessary permit costs.
Although manufacturers of certain drugs may not be happy that alternatives such as marijuana are being used, those who come up with a version that offers good quality products at known doses will benefit greatly.
Sorry to tell you, ma'am, but you're wrong, there's a lot going on behind the scenes for doctors and pharmacy.
As for this hospital, they were happy to use it until someone put the chip in the ear of a head of that hospital.
You can't have patents on grass.
If “researchers” in the social sciences were doing research instead of doing politics and networking, one could be using their “work”.
One researcher investigates, he does not compare one fact to another.
Comparing is not looking.
Comparing is making pedagogy not research.
One cannot say “research is done, it must be applied” and then in the same jet “it must be experimented at all”.
If your research is done, why experiment?
If your research is not completed, why are you asking for it to be applied?
Can one explain to me how a “researcher” can deduce that a student who cannot assimilate mathematics alone could more easily assimilate mathematics and other subjects?
New technologies make it possible to learn on the condition that students learn how to use new technologies, but how could they learn new technologies if they don’t know how to learn?
Pisa tests are just an indicator we make an indicator that allows us to find indicators that are satisfactory to us.
What’s the point of building an indicator that informs you of what arrangs you, a will to self-promotion, a deception?
There is only one way to train teachers: to keep sophists and ideologues away from training and what practitioners teach to practitioners.
factory read the paragraph on the internships (which unfortunately is not very argumentative) and you will see that your conclusion pushes us to the most ineffective conservatism: "It is a device that leads above all to the reproduction of the practices in force, and that does not allow the system to progress".
Given the general consensus on the state of the French system, it cannot be desired that practitioners only teach practitioners, even if they have their full place in a modern teacher training.
Educational theorists should have no place.
Practitioners must have one.
Would you like to be operated on by a surgeon whose training is purely theoretical, and who has never set foot in a surgical block before?
There is no consensus on the causes of the problems of the educational system.
To give more weight to the theorists of education would be to destroy it definitively.
Your analogy is totally fair: if I didn’t want to be operated on by a practitioner who has only a theoretical training, I would even less like to be operated on by a surgeon who has no theoretical training and who has learned about the pile.
Mike Weatherley, the Conservative MP in charge of combating copyright infringement by David Cameron
Why don't he just tell Cameron to stop?
Someone should make a popular arrest.
MDR exmaiers thank you.
If one day I start to feel guilty about violating copyright, I will just read an article like this.
In an information economy, copyright infringement <0x3D> theft.
It is the same since they must cite their sources correctly.
Often, obtaining a license costs nothing.
No, it's a copyright infringement.
Not at all the same.
By using content without the right license, you deprive artists of their breadwinners.
You can always debate pedantic assumptions - but it's theft.
And you can repeat it as much as you want, it won't be true.
This is a violation of copyright.
Come on, repeat it again.
If one day I begin to feel guilty of violating copyright
Apparently you don't mind depriving artists of their income.
If they think they should receive money for images used in school chores, an almost perfect definition of what should be a reasonable use, then I'm happy to deprive them of that fictitious income.
Lesson <0x23>1 should be to show how, if the children themselves create anything and publish it on their favorite social networks, they abandon any intellectual property to the site under the general conditions that they have gone through with a click.
Perhaps if they share the headphones of their mp3 walker with a friend in the school bus, they should be expelled for violating the law in such a way.
Ah, if we could export that resource from which we are flooding, the rabble that says that everything is going wrong....
If it's a PS MP who says it, then we have to believe it.
I have 2 children and when they will be of the age of choice, I would advise them to leave France if nothing has changed by then.
France pulls people down by constantly assisting them.
I don’t want my children to bear the debt that this policy has created.
What pulls France down are speeches like yours.
<0x40>gus I have always worked in a private company.
I have had the chance to work in companies led by excellent business leaders: it exists in France but it is rare.
I’m employed because I know I don’t have the skills to run a business and this choice allows me to shoot red balls at the zero bosses I meet frequently.
At ease in my sneakers I totally share the post of Jean-Pierre Bernajuzan: he says the terrible truth!
<0x40>gus, if we compare with German companies that French business leaders constantly cite to ask for reforms in France, in Germany companies have managed to structure their industrial fabric to make it competitive, especially by ensuring the link between large and medium-sized enterprises - What do French employers expect to do about it?
Is the state holding their hand?
The state they're accusing of empire?
<0x40>Jacques L.
Always this anti-company couple on your part!
Remind me, what did you create as a job, as an added value, to be so severe?
<0x40>Pat I understand your reaction.
In reality, France is faced with an insoluble problem: the incompetence of French business leaders unable to create jobs and who are building and undermining while waiting for permanent state assistance!
It's terrible!
But they have solutions: abolishing the Labour Code, employer charges, taxes, working 45 hours/week paid 35, and some, walking on eggs, dare to demand the reduction of wages or their abolition!
I look forward to seeing all the “negative” comments on this topic.
Which is ironic given the way people always complain about First Group.
From what I see from where I am, Last hasn't really been an investment for us taxpayers.
They tried to keep themselves floating rather than transforming themselves.
This does not mean that the Scottish railways have not improved since Last took care of them.
But they had also improved with their predecessors, including British Rail.
Unfortunately, we do not have the power to do this.
I tried to have them recently, but I didn't succeed.
But, well, Labour is going to get us bored, isn't it...
It is an international subsidiary.
They already operate trains in Germany.
Nothing prevents people in the UK from setting up a more moral business and taking part in tenders.
But it seems that we are not very good at managing, most of our privatized services end up being managed by a foreign operator.
I still remember the scandal and criticism when First won the Virgin contract, all so that the decision was finally canceled.
And better yet: MTR, a Hong Kong company won Crossrail’s operating contract for 8 years.
Well, Labour, as they told us during the referendum campaign, is totally in favour of sharing and sharing and believes that all workers must help each other across borders.
So we can assume that they will be happy with this decision ;)
This may be because the Dutch management is on good track while the British management is not.
What ScotRail needs is not just a change of ownership, but above all new ideas.
Abellio is perhaps the least bad choice possible, but the real problem is the ridiculous franchise system, not the franchisor.
“She was a beating girl.”
God, I hate it, but I really hate that kind of expression.
To assume that being "butt" is a superior quality than many others, the concern of others, intelligence, listening, for example, being "butt" has nothing to do with surviving a disease: cancerous "butts", who are not less than dead, i
Getting out of a disease has nothing to do with merit.
Let's start over too.
I'm not telling you it's the condition to manage, I'm telling you it helps.
It has nothing to do with any merit...!
When it comes to the examples of your life, there is only you to judge them.
I'll start over.
To insinuate, even for a moment, that one may have the merit of getting out of a disease or that one may be deprived of not getting out of it is simply monstrous.
The body follows or does not follow.
A body that loosens, from everywhere, despite the will, despite the confidence in medicine, do you have a vague idea of what C?
To think otherwise, if having a strong morale makes it easier to accept and prepare for heavy treatments, to try experimental treatments like this woman did, and not to refuse them out of fear.
Someone who is battling in medicine is, above all, someone who trusts in medicine.
But if you prefer to turn to the "Lord" it's something else..
Not with dignity, not with courage.
These considerations are specific to moralists.
When you catch a real dirt, you get stripped away to the point of becoming just a zombie.
Personally, I caught two of them, dirt, big ones, and if I "fighted" as these psychologists say, it completely escaped me.
Unless this fight consists only of squeezing the teeth, suffering from hell and collecting the punches.
I thought that the indictment against Milosevic had been decided and finalized about a decade ago.
I haven't seen that name in the papers since at least that time.
What's going on?
It's a birthday.
A Forgotten Anniversary.
His trial was conducted “quickly” and then swept under the carpet.
Is this the story that was told at the time?
The communist who became a nationalist who triggered three wars in the Balkans over the last decade?
The Communist President of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia?
So please ask yourself what we’ve voluntarily left out: 1.
How could NATO bombings be legal under the MONDRE rule of international law?
Which country has Serbia been attacking?
About RTS (Radio-Television-Serbia), why not mention that NATO destroyed the same building by killing civilians and then considered it a valid target.
Milosevic had no way out of it: if he did not defend his country against NATO attacks, he would be crucified as a traitor.
And if he defended it, it would be swallowed by the Western compressor roller.
The Westerners used a smoke screen to detach part of a sovereign state that then unilaterally proclaimed its independence and was presumably recognized by Western states who then lied end-to-end about the situation on the ground.
The Serbian population has now completely disappeared (ethnic cleansing).
Vojislav Kostunica, who is mentioned here, died politically after his first term for not understanding the situation that had developed.
Zoran Djindjic was one of the most controversial figures in the political world of the time.
Ultimately, the Guardian should not call Milosevic a tyrant (even if we didn’t like him).
To my knowledge, there is only one method of predicting earthquakes in Greece that works roughly by measuring the piezoelectric level in quartz.
This type of study is undeniably useful and thank you for letting us share the results.
This water has nothing to do with that of the exoplanet named HAT-P-11b, located about 124 light-years from Earth in the constellation Cygnus which would be "the smallest and coldest planet in the constellation of Cygnus" in the United States.
A method to follow.
Just like those that involve animals feeling a threat to happen.
Thank you, Science Passer, for enjoying, often, these experimental prowesses that are realized in the world.
How do animals know (in advance)?
No doubt by the perception of other elements whose rate changes in the event of an earthquake.
Like radon, for example.
A gas a priori odorless to man but perhaps detectable by animals.
All these methods are undetectable to man, but not to the instruments of measurement at his disposal.
But we don't have a reliable result on these tracks...
It has been observed many times (and for centuries) that some animals act strangely for a few hours with an earthquake, including chickens, cows, dogs but especially fish and snakes.
I had seen an art report about the struggle of two teams of scientists, one from California and the other from Japan, to recognize the validity of their work on the sensitivity of animals to terrestrial magnetic fields, and more particularly their modification before an earthquake.
I’m not a scientist, but their assumptions convinced me.
Or is it about this research?
Why so much contempt for this track?
We should learn to listen to nature again.
If we examine things calmly and rigorously, we publish it in a serious journal, and nobody despises it.
As soon as we talk about the “signs” given by the animals, we come across the same way: everyone will remember that 5 minutes before an earthquake, the red fish was bizarrely spinning around.
I don't understand how one can think that Boris would make a good leader for the Conservatives.
He did too much as Mayor of London.
When you listen to LBC's program, you can't help thinking that this man knows nothing about it and that he's always trying to make fun of it with a joke.
He never responds directly to anything.
He also said he agreed with Farage, and then Nick Ferrari the presenter asked him about what.
He couldn't name a single point.
He made so many promises to be elected mayor, and he didn't keep one.
It just points out how much the rest of the Conservative Party is just a bunch of shit, right?
Because he's popular.
Because he's funny.
He was in “Have I Got News for You.”
Because it's a celebrity and we've instilled in people the worship of celebrities.
The Londoners voted for him and it will be the same for the rest of the country.
When (and not if) he takes the leadership of the party, the Tories’ popularity rating will climb the ceiling I’m sure of it.
May God help us.
I’m not so sure: people like jokes, but they don’t want their prime minister to be one of them.
That's exactly what we said about Londoners.
He should have brought with him his friend the flickering, smarter than him
In many ways, I think he's trying to copy R Branson
The Americans had one as president.
The French were truly and always disinterested in the history of the Pacific War.
For all those who have struggled to read a few books (there is one, including a French and excellent B.
Millot), the "Solomon" and the "Ferraille Strait" speak, as unfortunately as the dead who remained there.
It is understood that the Australians, who know (one of their heavy cruisers, Australia, must always be there at the bottom since the Battle of Savo) do not want to return there.
We actually went past the island of Savo, in the “Iron Bottom Sound”.
Even if the mission is over.
It's the little ones.
But the ecolo side is a total smoke.
Calculate the kerosene consumption to achieve the objective totally discredits the concept.
All you have to do is browse the list of sponsors than philanthropists.

I look forward to the web series!
Your recital makes me re-read, identifying me a bit at the passage (I also learned to sail with the Crocos from L'Elorn to the Moulin Blanc in Brest!).
Hat also for the ecological message, although some criticise the impact of the displacement.
The end justifies the means.
Keep reviewing us, and proudly show that the Bretons are great travelers!

Good evening I think the red cape that protested against taxes is happy to know that this trip is sponsored by the Bretagne Region and the City of Brest.
More seriously, it seems to me that local authorities and public bodies of all kinds should not dedicate a penny of our taxes to financing the dreams of some adventurers even as friendly as these!
Are there any players in the current Serbian formation who are of Kosovo origin?
I know that Dusan Bajevic in Lyon and Milos Krasic, once at Juventus and now at Fenerbah<0xC3><0xA7>e, are from Mitrovica, but I don’t know if they are still on the team.
This is Bisevac the defender of Lyon, not Bajevic.
Bajevic was midfielder or forward in the 70s and 80s and has coached many teams in Greece, but I don't know where he comes from.
Bajevic is from Mostar, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and has played as a striker in Velez's big team, which, under the tutelage of legendary Suleman Rebac, finished in second place twice in the Yugoslav league (and also had scorers such as Vahid Halilhodzic and the faithful Weacompany.
Well, thanks Mole!
Of course I know Halilhodzic and Primorac.
Just out of curiosity, what happened to Krasic?
It was said that he was going to become a great player when he was at Juve, he is currently in Turkey, but the last time he appeared on my radar screen he was related to Blackburn *frisson*
There, I can't help you.
I know he lost his place when Conte arrived, then he went to Fener and as far as I know there is no holder.
Maybe he can still do something, maybe in the Indian Super League?
Seriously, Serbia.
Seriously, Albania, don't be afraid.
You should love Albania because you are neighbours.
The thing is that the flag of this drone is not the flag of the real Albania of today.
Apparently it was the flag of Greater Albania, which encompasses all regions where there is a significant Albanian presence.
A little bit of nationalism, actually.
Fortunately, there wasn’t too much damage (I know).
In fact, it was an Albanian flag with the map not of what is called Greater Albania, but of Albania before 1913, when the great European powers decided to give ends of the country to neighboring countries.
How could one have felt “an explosion of joy” when two towers collapse knowing that women, men and undoubtedly children are inside?
How ???
What bothers me a little in this "witness" is that the only fact of having been able, even once, to spontaneously rejoice in the horrible death of thousands of people, testifies to my eyes of a personality "border line" whose all the "witnesses" should be taken with the greater.
Without a doubt, in the short moment of "joy", we will not have thought of the dead or the reality of the horror inflicted.
One will have just thought, for a moment, that, for once, Muslims had succeeded in really and apocalypticly hurting the great evil Satan in his very heart.
Make qqch powerful.
The grandiose.
It seems that this feeling has been shared by thousands of Muslims drowned by their sense of humiliation.
With testimonies filmed in Palestine.
Classic Harm Pleasure.
We were a little hesitant.
The “Christian/White/Gaulian” West cannot measure the degree of frustration, anger, hatred of the Muslim when he contemplates the general misery, the social and cultural under-development of today’s Arab Muslim world.
I'm talking about the suburbs of Cairo or Algiers, not the towers of Dubai.
The splendour of the past, certainly magnified, is not a consolation, on the contrary.
How to get the Muslim world out of this diabolical funnel?
Totally in phase, 2 major poisons irrigate the Arab world: the bigoted conservatism of the powers in place and the fascist nihilism.
The common point, the freezing of thought and the excommunication (soft or armed) of its critical expression.
That we have understood before, must not cause the Muslims to retreat.
It's the only way.
Who is the author of this article?
I suppose this is true in many countries.
But in Britain, autumn marks the beginning of six long dark, humid and depressing months that affect the well-being and mood of many people.
In addition, everyone gets sick.
Seasonal depression.
I'm suffering from it myself.
When the light goes away, it becomes hell for me and those like me.
A dose of vitamin D should help a little for mood and well-being.
Autumn is beautiful in Great Britain, with or without rain.
The campaign in particular is breathtaking in autumn.
Not as much breath as the summer green when everything is alive instead of being about to die.
In Britain, if you are lucky, summer falls on a weekend.
We had a nice summer this year, don’t make your snippy clichés radot!
Not everyone.
I rarely get sick in the winter.
But now I’m retired and I’m no longer developing immunity to outside germs, it can change, I guess.
It's not about dying, it's just a step in a cycle...
A wonderful stage full of intoxicating smells, with a feverishness that culminates with festivities like Halloween, Guy Fawks, Christmas, the risks of snow and plenty of other wonderful words.
It is enough not to stop doing things!
Here are my recommendations for the holidays for you.
Yes, these dark and gray months actually make me much happier and more relaxed.
For the taxation of child allowances , it is the amount collected by the State that comes mainly from deciles 8 to 10 .
But with regard to the number of households that have seen their taxes rise as a result of this measure , it is mainly the deciles 4 and 5 that are concerned ( median income ) according to graph 2 .
The deletion of the half-part concerning especially widows is not dealt with at all in the article or rather its impact is comprehensively underestimated: 230M euros is a joke that does not take into account the impact in 2012 and 2013 and implies that it is painless.
And he's not ready to settle down.
Well, we're not on straw, of course, but singers
Once the PS makes a rather left-wing policy, we won’t cry...
It is clear that those who are among the richest 20% must bear much more than 75% of the increase in taxes, why not 90%?
So let’s keep going and you’ll encourage these 20% unless you work or leave.
Well, I know it's not politically correct, but I'm still saying it.
Long live the Trots and the recycled OCI in the PS: they have understood everything.
Adam, you don't see what you're looking at.
The proportion is always the same, here or in Bahrain: 20% of the population owns 80% of the wealth.
A fair tax is when it prohibits anyone from collecting as much as he can.
Beyond a certain limit, money loses all its usefulness.
And once the usefulness of money is exceeded, money is only used to make money, that is, to make the misfortune of the greatest number.
We are one of the richest 20%.
Probably also the 20% of the households that work the most (and create wealth some of which is logically redistributed).
A fair tax should allow these households to benefit from some of their efforts.
Or just as much lower your arms and live social minima, especially if you have social housing.
The utopias of red Khmer head cutters have fortunately lived.
I did two AirBnBs in Norway recently.
It's all right.
In one of the two, we had things we wouldn't have had in a 5-star hotel and we didn't have to show up at the reception or face the least trouble.
All you have to do is go to someone's house, sleep there, store behind you, and leave.
This will be my first choice when I travel.
The logo has changed, people...
Check your insurance before renting your home.
In most cases, you will need some kind of homeowner insurance.
Be sure to use a service with the right logo!
Ah, six o'clock too late.
I love airbnb.
“It’s very dangerous and highly risky” No, it’s not true.
You've just really missed luck.
According to the link provided in the article:
At his dismissal, Airbnb’s response to Teman was quick, almost absurdly quick.
Within 24 hours, according to an email provided to Gawker by Teman, Airbnb had sent a locksmith to change the locks, made arrangements for him to spend a week at the hotel and transferred $23,817 (for which Airbnb is insured, but still).
So why does this article quote Teman complaining that he didn’t get any support from Airbnb?
I LOVE AIRBNB, to receive as to travel
Hello I am looking for people who have already used air bnb just to reassure me.
I plan to pay a down payment and a month’s rent all at once but I’m a bit afraid to send <0xC2><0xA3>1,600 to a site I’ve never really heard of.
But where are we going?
“Supporting the troops,” the Bu$herie chanted in every tone.
Weapons are harmless.
I am sure it will be a pleasure for families and relatives of thousands of Kurds killed in Halabja to learn that their relatives and friends have succumbed to anything other than the chemical bombings of Saddam Hussein.
Unless the content of the article has been radically modified by the author, your comment is inappropriate (to remain polite).
In addition, how would this mass crime committed in 1988 prove that the chemical weapons discovered almost 20 years later were still usable?
It is not hyper-clear the style of the author: "in search of weapons of mass destruction.
We're in agreement.
You think it's time to weaken the army to strengthen education.
This is never the time to strengthen education, because we are always at war.
Alternative: Is it ALWAYS time to strengthen education, because we are still at war?
Education would already be much strengthened if we had "them" worked 35 hours instead of 17.
At present, our teachers are earning more than engineers.
And don't let us think that teachers spend 18 hours a week preparing their program.
But this is not to be seen since National Education does not have the means to provide an office to its college/lycée teachers so they work at home.
A kind of forced telework in sum, except that the employer pays neither the computer, nor the internet connection, nor the supplies.
By the way, it is so much the board at 17h per week and 4 months of vacation that you can not get to fill the CAPES of maths, come on, we are waiting for you.
How come you don't want to pick up bad-educated pricks whose parents sneeze on you by treating you like a scoundrel?
I think the priority in this area is to disarm the jihadists so that the Kurdish population can thrive.
We see that the Bush administration has done absolutely everything wrong.
My first graduate job was in sales, in London, to earn three times nothing and yet it was a job for which a degree was needed.
A year later, I saw an ad to be a worker for the London Underground, it was paid <0xC2><0xA3>5,000 more a year and we didn’t even ask for the patent.
I've never regretted it.
Don’t worry if you don’t find a graduate job, try to find something that pays well, or you like to do.
If I had stayed at the graduate jobs, I would still have to pay my student loan
I don’t like working in a company so I hope to end up either in the public service or in the academic world.
LOL LOL LOL This article is really late!
Exactly, when I graduated in 2011, there was already a three-year-old behind-the-scenes.
The best way to reduce the number of unemployed graduates?
To get rid of bikini chains such as art/letters/theatre/media/philosophy/political sciences, that is, what are called the degrees of unemployed.
I have one of these degrees and I have finished production manager.
It turned out that what was important was not the degree but, as the article above says, a good career path, starting at school and throughout the university.
The starting salary was lower, but we climb the ladder quickly because in the real world what counts is the results more than the knowledge.
This debate of engineering studies/artistic chains has lasted for years.
Scientists can’t solve all problems, it’s more important to be able to get up in the morning, get to work on time and interact with people in order to get results.
Letters, philosophy and art are chains of bisouneurs?
That's ridiculous.
I guess you’re talking about the media studies kind of diplomas or whatever the absconse sector where you went.
Letters, philosophy, political science and art are real chains.
We need people who can explain the big questions to high schoolers, who understand the importance of the basics of culture such as literature, art, etc., and highlight them.
Wouldn’t it be better for a real territorial policy to unleash Paris and dynamise the rest of France?
Personally, I hardly see the inhabitants of the bottom of the Essonne and Val-d'Oise making 80km round trip every day by bike to come to work in Paris.
Intra-wall and small-belt residents already have many otherwise more convenient means of public transport (metro, bus, tram).
<0x3E> Several secure and locked parks, as already in the cities of northern Europe, Dijon or Lyon, will be installed on the road.
That's a good idea.
On the surface, the space is cannibalized by the 2RM.
Incidentally, it is hoped that the City of Paris will work with professionals from the Netherlands and Denmark.
Benefit from their extensive experience in the field.
Well, we haven't found a place for A SEUL bicycle hooking device.
The motivation seems stronger when it comes to finding an office for Bertrand Delanoë....
Well, it's not going to work at all.
When we are talking about driving cars and other road users, we are talking about driving cars, we are talking about cars, we are talking about cars, we are talking about cars, we are talking about cars, we are talking about cars, we are talking about cars, we are talking about cars, we are talking about cars, we are talking about cars, we are talking about cars, we are talking about cars, we're talking about cars, we're talking about cars, we're talking about cars, we're talking about cars, we's are going to people, we's are going to people, we's are going to people.
The bicycle paths are apartheid, you have to live together but rebalance the occupation of the urban space.
Nothing on the bike in the big Paris?
Not a word about the bicycle space in public transport?
EELV is right.
The goal of 15% of velo travel is ridiculous.
I'm starting to believe that Anne Hidalgo rolled the greens in the flour.
Moreover, according to the report of OR, the EELV assistants seem sceptical.
I prefer to be optimistic.
Before the racket starts, it would be better to find out who is really hiding behind this massacre.
Indication: This is not Russia.
I'm not sure I like the way the world is changing.
That's awful.
My children are not a financial asset.
A lawyer expressed his intention to bring the case before the ECHR, but I did not hear that a complaint was actually filed.
In addition, they should first file a complaint in Germany or Ukraine.
I also expect these cases to be postponed pending the outcome of the investigation report on the accident and the resulting criminal investigation.
Yes, but Libya didn't blow up Pan Am 103 either.
Malaysia Airlines is not wrong, the fault lies with the authority responsible for airspace security, in this case the Ukrainian government.
Was the accident predictable?
Other planes had been shot down previously, Ukraine launched air strikes on the rebels and any aircraft could of course be considered a possible and immediate threat.
Has the Ukrainian government taken reasonable precautions in view of an obvious threat, or has it chosen to play with the lives of innocents in order for airlines to pay for the rights to fly over the territory?
Where are all the pro-Kiev trolls who defend their usurping government / the ultranationalists of Western Ukraine - and who want to show in bulk that Putin shot down flight MH17.
As far as I know, there is already a complaint against the Kiev government because they are responsible for what is happening in their skies.
The previous: a 1986 judgment of the International Court of Justice which concluded that the CIA's supply of weapons to the Contra rebel forces in Nicaragua did not mean that the United States was responsible for their actions.
There is no chance that Russia will let this case go to the ICJ.
It’s funny to think that Abbott means to Putin that Australians were murdered by Russian-backed rebels.
I hope he can present evidence to substantiate his allegation.
So far, the investigators haven't said anything like that.
To be Ricardo and to be such an eco-beaten is distressing!
To be called Polar is to lose the north is joyful.
There is only one Beotiaanse question: is today’s poorer than yesterday’s poorer?
I can’t help but notice that the most virulent critics of Piketty’s book have not read it!
It's easy to read, I took a few days.
It shows the statistical evolution of income-production, income-capital, inequality-concentration, income inequality of labor, ownership of capital, merit and inheritance in the log term.
It shows that the concentration of capital today joins that of the beginning of the 20th before 1914, it shows that it was the 2 world wars that brought down the concentration of capital, from 1914 to 1945, then how the concentration resumes after 1914.
Bernajuzan: You say no to what.
I ask you how long it took you to read this pavement knowing that an individual’s ability to concentrate has some limits.
The question is not whether it is easy to read.
The question is whether the summary of the central thesis given by the press is correct or not.
If it is right, it can be debated without having read the book, the main thing of which is to argue in one way or another in favour of it.
No, it's easy to read...
Bernajuzan: How long did it take you to read it?
Is the central thesis of his pave summarized by the press false?
I have not read and will not read it.
So I trust the summary of his central thesis and this is what seems pure fumigation to me.
The difference between rich and poor is subsidiary.
Hasn’t humanity been enriched as a whole?
And this enrichment added to an increase in the population is the real political issue today.
Malala Yousafzai is an impressive personality and deserves the award without a doubt.
But remember, she is only 17 years old.
An age at which most people are just beginning to find their place in the world.
I hope that this award will not be a burden for the girl and that she will find her way to a happy life.
The problem is not the price but the political capital of Western governments who want to prove the old adage that colored perverts are the embodiment of evil.
All my best wishes to Malala, but she must realize that she is being used and that nothing will be done to educate girls in Pakistan or elsewhere - not even in the popular neighborhoods of Great Britain!
Did someone think his speech was a bit strange?
She thanked her father for giving her a lot of freedom but mentioned that if she wasn’t where she is now, she would have been married at the age of 14.
Is Malala herself not one of those “colored perverts”?
You should not have any “antenna time” on this site.
You yourself are a terrible pervert.
It's absolutely revolting.
No, her father wasn't going to marry her when he was 14.
She was 15 when we shot her.
His father runs a school where girls are educated and he is in favour of equal rights for women.
It is, and has always been, for her to receive a higher education and to have the right to decide her own marriage.
However, he is unusual in Pakistan, insofar as he thinks that women are equal to men.
What she said is that an average Pakistani girl often has to get married at the age of 14, without having her word to say.
I'm sorry she didn't say it eloquently enough for you.
This may sound contradictory, but perhaps it means that if her father had not given her freedom, she would have been married at the age of 14.
Rather disappointed with this entry into season 4 and especially by Jessica Lange who apparently has a little trouble finding her societal character of Marlene Dietrich.
I just watched the last two seasons that are quite different but I have to admit that this is one of the best horror series, one of the most successful!
A fascinating first episode.
The realization is close to perfection and the show of Jessica Lange singing Bowie’s anachronistic Life on Mars is simply upsetting.
I haven’t watched this new season yet (which will be the last for me, without Lange bof bof).
In the case of American Horror Story, I’d rather have it all at once than watch 13 episodes spread over 3 to 4 months.
But one thing is for sure, apart from the extraordinary Jessica Lange, it’s especially the risks of staging and editing that sit me down.
There is an avalanche of original plans in AHS that makes the acceptance of today's productions quite ridiculous.
It makes me a little bit off to see you throw the sponge in advance for the coming seasons without even waiting to be able to measure the quality of it.
Jessica Lange is certainly a pillar of this series, but, as you say, there are many other things.
It’s not just that for me Jessica Lange (and especially her path and the way she uses it) is really ONE of the pillars of the series outside of technical qualities.
I look a lot at her.
Then I find that the series sins by writing, it wants to do too many things at the same time.
Season 3 was slightly below, in season 2 it was too dispersed despite some excellent episodes.
I don’t see them doing 10 seasons of American Horror Story or it’s going to end up like 24 hours.
But good everyone does what they want!
It’s by saying “I won’t watch again” that everyone is forced to do the same!
I just share my point of view, nothing more, nothing less.
With the loss of Jessica Lange, I think she'll be fatal to him.
But after that, that's just my opinion.
Let's talk less about tax increases, please - coupons rather in state spending.
No, let's increase the expenses, please.
Those who wanted to save money have failed.
<0xE2><0x80><0xA2> Triggering controversy over relatively small spending posts, such as development aid
The problem is that this represents less than the margin of error in government spending in the UK.
The truth is that we are all talking about nuances rather than the change of orientation that voters seem to call their vows and all this time some in each camp make it seem that these nuances are far more important and substantial than they are - and voters see clearly in their game and find them wrong.
Less than 1% of expenditure.
“Debt” is assets held primarily by financial institutions in this country.
“Debt” is nothing to worry about.
I would see no problem for the government to take over a third of my income (before even talking about consumer taxes) if I thought it was going to use it wisely.
But this is not the case, and many taxpayers feel the same way.
It is said that Nigel Farage has not been quite honest about how to cut taxes but good, if you add our net contribution to the EU, development aid, High Speed 2, almost useless wind turbine subsidies and nuclear power plants that cost them more than twice what they should be worth.
Your first <0xC2><0xA3>10,000 is not taxable.
This means that someone who earns <0xC2><0xA3>35,000 a year will pay around <0xC2><0xA3>5,000 (a seventh of their salary), someone with <0xC2><0xA3>50,000 would pay around <0xC2><0xA3>10,000 (a fifth), etc. and someone with <0xC2><0xA3>200,000 pays around <0xC2><0xA3>70,000 (a little more than a third).
What about social contributions?
The more social contributions, the more local taxes, the more parking fees and the car vignet, and this is before VAT.
Almost exactly 30% of my money is collected from the source before the local taxes and the car vignet.
I am paid decently, but not extravagantly.
Not that it’s a problem, of course, I’m happy to pay my taxes.
But let us not pretend to believe that money falls from the sky, or that it is not important to know where billions of pounds of tax pass.
How can an unemployed person who is looking for a door-to-door job prove it?
Even though 20% of the unemployed would not search, it means that 80% are looking and not finding.
Since I am unemployed myself, am I more interested in what others are looking for or not?
If a potential recruiter gets 10 or 20 CVs, that increases my chances.
Indeed, I haven't heard from Pole Jobs in months, which means that agents are more busy with checks than really getting job ads in?
I don't see any interest.
Because it is not up to the state to provide work.
If Pole Emploi does not provide enough jobs, then Pole Emploi should be avoided.
What is a Sensitive Topic?
We all have rights and duties, in which case we make sure that the unemployed perform their duties well in return for their rights.
Just as a controller requests their transport licence to the users of a means of transport, a service manager or employees of their work, etc.
No one shouts scandal in these cases, right?
It is indeed good to recall that the unemployed have rights: the only two times I had to deal with P<0xC3><0xB4>le Emploi, my rights to the ARE had been poorly established, and on one of the files, amputated by 40%, there had to be a firm fight.
It takes time!
I am not an expert in law.
The filing and control is currently taking over, while statutoryly Pole Employment is close to being, in fact, an insurance company.
I would add that the issue of compensation should only concern employees, it is they who pay the coastlines.
Politicians and non-employees in France give themselves rights that they don’t actually have!
It's not normal.
I would add that a decent unemployment insurance contributes to the valorization of wage labour.
More than waiting for killer tweets in Arabic...
In reality, there must be a direct military response in Iraq/Syria that will stop ISIS so that this virus does not reach this conflict zone.
The situation would then resemble the spread of the Black Plague in 1348/9 in connection with the war and the displacement of populations at the time.
The Saudis had the spirit to ban Hadj in Mecca this year from Muslim pilgrims from the three affected countries.
El Pais reports that 7,400 have seen their visa application denied due to their country of origin or recent travel.
In fact, there was the case of a pilgrim from Bosnia who contracted smallpox in Mecca during the Hadj in the 1980s, probably contaminated by a pilgrim from Somalia, where the disease still exists.
I hope the rest of the world will have the same mindset.
Is it to be heartless to propose to prevent Ebola sufferers from taking a plane to Europe?
I thought it was just common sense, but apparently those who “know” decided that one could risk the lives of tens of thousands of people...
Those West African countries where Ebola is out of control should be put under strict quarantine.
No one's out.
Only health workers can enter.
21 days of waiting after treating patients before they can leave.
If they contract the Ebola virus while they are there, they stay there until they are healed.
These are not draconian measures.
Just last week, people were contaminated after having contacts with people in West Africa although they took “all the necessary precautions.”
We can stop the progression of this disease.
It is mainly spread by airlines.
Let us forbid them from offering to fly to these countries.
In addition, customs officers at airports should be trained to identify people with typical Ebola symptoms, so that they can be quarantined immediately.
Let him pass the message of the first individual and the second group (including religious) and he will have earned the Nobel Peace Prize.
I doubt that he is able to erect in dogma the image of God characterized by the total cortex of the planet in operation.
It is still far from that conception there.
It's only been 20 years since information emerged as humanity's given prime, while religion, coming from the brain, has led our actions since Lucy perhaps.
What is the purpose of becoming a Protestant church?
For those who have not noticed, Catholicism is largely a minority in France today, no one is forced to adhere to it.
Those who criticize would not set foot in the Church anyway, there is only a small number of Protestants in France.
What is the next step, removing the notion of sin, too “anxiety”?
<0x40>louise: Sorry the church does not have a limited vision for France.
And in the world, maybe it will touch more people...
<0x40>Martine E, to be honest (as usual) the respect of others as you imagined it pre-existed in Christ.
Hillel once said, “Don’t do to others what you don’t want them to do to you, that’s the whole Torah, and the rest is just commentary: go and study!”
Christianity goes well beyond mere reciprocity but introduces agape.
Your "progress of justice, peace, fraternity" but without God?
Is it a return to communism? :-)
The next step is to remove the incarnation and resurrection.
Jesus will remain that hero who has upset the moral laws by redefining the respect of others.
Christians will then be ready to take on their role in the ethical debates of our societies and advance justice, peace, and fraternity.
Not very Catholic?
I remember that the low number of Protestants in France is mainly due to the fact that their ancestors were exterminated and then converted by force and pushed to immigration a few centuries ago.
I'm too hesitant to buy this, the new Alien game, or Wasteland 2.
And the new Elite game is coming out soon.
It's not an invention.
Personally, I would choose SoM.
I like Wasteland 2 (I even participated in its fundraising campaign) but I don't think it's worth <0xC2><0xA3>30.
If you are interested in the PC version, Green Man Gaming currently sells SoM for <0xC2><0xA3>30 and also offers a 20% discount voucher.
Green Man Gaming currently sells SoM for <0xC2><0xA3>30 and also offers a 20% discount voucher.
I'll check it out.
Obviously not at work.
The joy flap of the computer department block all the nice sites.
Hello, is it <0xC2><0xA3>30 then 20% discount, or does the <0xC2><0xA3>30 include the 20% discount?
Please note that the PC version is only available for DX11.
It took me by surprise, I bought it, but I can't play it.
In addition, I bought it on Steam, so no refund, it's zero.
It's time to buy a new video card *make your mouth shut*
It’s a Brazilian site, but you get a valid Steam ID, I think.
Caveat emptor and all that: I didn’t use it myself.
Amazon <0xC2><0xA3>30 for PC, <0xC2><0xA3>35 for Xbox 360 and PS3, <0xC2><0xA3>44 for Xbox and PS4
Thank you, I'd be afraid that one day they'll erase it from your library if they decide to take it seriously against the people who buy it there while they're out of the area.
So join the beta version of Elite: Dangerous.
So was the 1940s France a “rotten earth”?
So tell me, this Nobel Prize looks like a poisoned gift to me.
Should we love the France of 40, that of the "strange defeat"?
When we see who gets the Nobel Prize in Literature, we wonder if Proust or Dostoevsky would have it today.
The Nobel is not even an event, you don’t even want to read the award-winning authors.
Will Brazilians, Chinese or Australians read Modiano, which is already difficult to read in French and which describes a universe so limited and so egocentric?
I hope the other Nobels are more credible, but frankly I doubt it.
Modiano, Levy, Musso have only a distant relationship with literature.
Did you at least read it?
Or another Nobel Prize?
It would be better to judge.
As for Chinese, Brazilians and others, don’t worry about them.
Foreigners are very sensitive to French literature and culture, they.
They will appreciate mr.
Modiano at its fair value, if they don't already know him!
For your part, continue to visit Lévy and Musso.
I share your opinion.
Marc Levy and Guillaume Musso keep their chances.
So let’s see who won the Nobel Prize in Literature: H.
Pinter in 2005, D.
Hello to the terrible.
Since I’ve driven one in Iceland, I don’t stop to see Kia Sportage everywhere.
I think this thing has followed me so far.
Maybe she's trying to crush me?
Or smother me like the terrible computer of Superman III?
Hello Dantra, still hate?
Hello DQ - no, not today, I took my meds.
It's Wednesday!
I had a few days off.
That was cool.
Last weekend I went to the Nottingham beer and cider party.
It was borderline.
I managed to taste 19 different beers, Wobbly Weasel being one of my favorites.
I was pleasantly surprised by the mix of people there, there were not only CAMRA fanatics (not to be confused with the camera fanatics).
Driving back on Sunday was really hard.
On Monday night we went to a friend’s grandfather to play the nine card brag.
Thanks to a real beginner chance I was able to go back with several decent bets.
I hope that if I get to 95 I will be as vivid as him.
Last night I went to a chic cocktail bar in Farringdon.
One of my drinks arrived with a slice of lard on it.
I admire M.
Read a little Buddha and you will understand how wrong you are, dear Christian.
That said, without wanting to upset you, I think you're moving a little bit away from the subject.
This famous totality, it prohibits quests for jihadists at the exit of mosques.
It reports the arms trafficking without delay.
Either we have big eyes open like Meddeb and Ta<0xC3><0xAF>a or Boubaker or we have big eyes closed.
We have to choose.
It is not by keeping your eyes closed that you access the light.
Forgive me, dear Christian, but once again you make a monumental counter-sense: all the authorities, organizations or representative associations, Muslim or not, having formally condemned ISIS and its crimes, French, Muslim or not, have nothing to add to these official condemnations.
Who doesn't say consent.
The problem is that people like you first see them as Muslims, Arabs, or Africans.
Not like the French.
Unfortunately, dear Kentoc'h Mervel, doubt exists for everyone.
As I have said a thousand times, some doubt the approval by the French Jews of the Israeli massacres in Gaza, but it would be stupid and indecent to accuse them a priori and to demand that they manifest publicly to prove to the rest of French society that it is wrong to doubt it.
This principle is, in my view, the denial of the republic and can only contribute to the delinquency of French society.
If there is no doubt, so much to say.
Who doesn’t say consent, but consent to what?
Consent to closeness with ISIS or to ISIS conviction.
Silence is very practical, it is the main weapon of those who want to house the goat and the cabbage.
Your position is intellectually honest but pragmatically unsustainable.
Alex Salmond predicted that Scotland could, in elections, “revenge” from the parties represented in Westminster because a huge gap has broken between their decentralization proposals and what they promised on the eve of the independence referendum.
Cameron must be petrified at the idea of losing all those seats in Westminster...
Cameron's got to laugh.
What are these threats? !
The Conservatives don't care about Scotland because they don't have a seat.
They can do whatever they want with impunity.
I don’t think even Cameron is stupid enough to believe that the Labour losing seats in Westminster in favor of the SNP is a good thing in the long run for him and the Conservatives.
Who is going to shed a tear for the Labour Party.
They will be completely eliminated in Scotland by the SNP and UKIP who will cut their heads in the north.
Ed Miliband joined the PROMESSE, thinking he was saving his party but not realizing that he was signing the death warrant for his Scottish MPs.
Not surprisingly, some Labour MPs are asking their leader to be accountable.
If the SNP wins 20-25 seats and there is no majority in parliament, even if the seats do not come from the Conservatives, then they will be in a very good position to negotiate any coalition and they will be able to force both the Conservatives and the Labour to do what they promised maximum for a decentre.
I think that's what's important.
Not if the Labour or the Conservatives want to be re-elected someday in England.
Washing the pumps 8% at the expense of 85% is not a super electoral strategy.
In addition, once Scottish MPs are no longer able to vote on issues pertaining to England, the Conservatives will win all the votes.
Oh, I think he is.
Cameron may not have much to lose, but Miliband does.
Maggie did it with the Ulster unionists, and it worked.
However, he is still in competition to be prime minister in 2015, ever since he won the leadership of the Labour Party.
So basically, these boxes will be virtually behind each reader to look over his shoulder and see what he reads, how he reads, and to the end.
It's "Life of Others" from East Germany or the KGB applied to the FRIC world...
Always the same fascination for surveillance techniques.
In the long run, this will have at least a sterilizing effect.
I’m waiting for the next ticket: Amazon manufactures YOUR book according to YOUR profile and automatically thanks to an algorithm of its secrecy!
It's as gay as the world.
Strongly stimulating.
Thanks for the article.
As under this system, the management of DRMs is not implemented, I still have to read pirated files, public domain books or purchased from a few publishers who have the intelligence to offer files without a doll.
Given the price I paid for the Kobo, it's unfortunate.
I am ahuri of the widespread abdication of users to the widespread appropriation of their privacy.
At your general public bookstore, you will systematically notice that everyone gives their loyalty card (fn*c, d**itre, ...).
There are also demanding masterpieces whose opening and completion rates are arguably ludicrous.
Finnegans Wake by James Joyce.

Be careful not to put all the literature in the same tray.
The collection of anonymous data when there is a profile.
The harvest is not anonymous.
It is the data published by Kobo that is so, that neither the readers nor the authors can be identified.
But Kobo has all this information, he does.
There have been so many exaggerated, erroneous and contradictory statements by the Turkish government in recent days that the country seems to be headed by a kindergarten class full of children with acid schizophrenia.
It’s even worse than that if you take into account Erdogan’s religious fundamentalism.
It is interesting that some supporters of Erdogan think that Islamist is such an insult that they delete your comment, but not mine. ;-)
Well seen :-P But Turkey doesn’t want to shoot a bullet in the foot unless it wins something.
If it attacks ISIS, ISIS will respond, so it is actually shooting itself in the foot.
A retired diplomat wrote on his blog: “The PA reports that Iran has warned the United States that it would be a mistake to seek to overthrow the law of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad because it would endanger Israel’s security.
It is not clear in the article whether Iran was sending a serious retaliatory warning there or whether it was simply advising caution.
This second option is more likely and, in any case, what really surprises me is that today’s Iranian and US diplomatic engagement concerns Syria, Israel and the security of the region.”
The reading of Indian Punchline is highly recommended to anyone who pays attention to details rather than to c*neries balanced by the traditional media. The short article you link to is important and should be read keeping in mind the realistic observations/previous warnings of 1980 from Iran.
Who are these “moderate” who are seriously fighting the terrible secular Assad and at the same time the perverts of ISIS?
Pipeline policy pushes the world to the abyss, and I would suggest to those who refer to non-existent “moderate” people to pay more attention to facts and alternatives before sending the children of others to fight in World War III.
“It’s even worse than that if you take into account Erdogan’s religious fundamentalism” Are there other religious fundamentalists in power in the Middle East?
I have one in mind.
It would take a Nuremberg trial for the Armenian genocide committed by the Turks.
Is it “needed”?
Do you realize that neither the criminals nor the victims have the slightest chance of being alive?
A little late for that, my friend.
Wouldn't criminals be barely old now, like 120 years old?
It's a little late for that, isn't it?
Particularly concerning the CUP triumvirate that planned and directed the genocide, Talaat and Djemaal were killed just after World War I by revenge by the Armenians, and Enver was killed by the Bolsheviks in a turbulent place in Central Asia there was a turmoil about the same time as there was.
That's crazy.
An impressive mastery of the sophistication of the fatal slope, but apart from that, one seeks in vain the contact with the real.
What a cliché without an argument.
The fetus will always hear a heart beating even in the womb of a pregnant mother.
Lesbian couples may simply be a desire for a child and not a desire to be accepted.
The heterosexual couples are sterile too.
As for the children!
What a shame to designate them as future psychological imbalances.
One day they will have the age to defend themselves, to say that they are happy to live, to earn their lives and to pay the pension of this lady (?)
GPA is probably a temporary “solution” in the evolution of medicine that our world knows.
It doesn't date today.
Many women brought and gave birth to children who were not their husbands.
This is how we are made...
The important thing in this regard is that this practice is framed so that the "marketing" of the body is limited.
But cosmetic surgery, cosmetics aren't they just as commercializing the bodies?!
Anachronistic danger unit...
It is certainly more elegant to make a good one thicken in a distant country via the internet and Pay Pal than to dodge its responsibilities and or to avoid the scandal in another century near home without yelling at it at that time on all the rooftops! ...
These practices were no longer done in the name of the church! ...
There are not only Christians and believers who refuse these practices.
Still, the exploitation of the bodies is a real problem.
Oh shut up, this man is passionate about something.
In the late '70s in the Midlands, I only saw this from a distance.
I had to go there during the day because I had no right to go there at night!
But if you loved that and you listen to the music - this music today it still touches you as much.
I don’t know why there are so many contemptuous comments here about what Paul Mason is saying, maybe they are posted by people who have never been cool, even for a few years!
I think in the sports section there is an article about football waiting for your comments.
Great article, very true.
Since Tony Parson’s film, there has been a shortage of reporting that really reflects the reality of Northern England’s culture.
No wonder Paul Mason has grasped the social and political context well, he understands things well.
The Northern soul still lives, but it has been vampirized by capitalism and today it is essentially a surface phenomenon.
That said, you can throw an ear if you’re in the London area in November: 99psoul will again go through soul vinyls, including full of Northern soul, on Saturday, November 15 at Betsey Trotwood in Farringdon.
I also thought “always the same story”, but here is a small well-written and well-thought-out article.
Your critics really need to be more constructive.
Great article.
I loved your documentary.
I guess you're glad you escaped to Newsnight.
Last train to Wigan from Victoria/Exchange and get off at Wallgate.

Business is becoming more and more toxic.
The Palestinians have no partner for peace.
Unfortunately, Netanyahu never misses an opportunity to miss an opportunity to negotiate peace.
<0x40>Jonathan: Netanyahu does not seek peace since he wants to continue to occupy-colonize (by the way, Rabin was also the case).
It is obvious that Rabin, Netanyahu and their constituents all preferred occupation-colonization over peace.
He took off his clothes, put them on the rock and went into the water.
An Israeli man stole them from him.
The Israeli representative stood up in anger and shouted, “What are you talking about?
The Israelis weren’t even there at the time!”
The Palestinian (UN) representative smiled and added: and now that things are clearly established
Israel and the majority of its population have no confidence in the bipolar government of the Palestinian Authority and will not lower their guard.
That it dislikes the anti-Israeli is obvious, it is not the goal sought ...
Anti-Zionist: But I answered you, I translate: the global geopolitical report ...
And this has always been the case since politics has been globalized...
Avoidance, avoidance...
In the Israeli-colonialist conflict, for the creation of the Palestinian state, it is certain, it lasts!
For the creation of Israel you do not answer.
What relationship of strength allowed the creation of Israel?
Anti-Zionist: The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is still a force!
Do you doubt it?!!
Besides, it’s not just about Russell Brand, but the Guardian reporters seem to have a hard time going beyond anything he doesn’t have to say.
A lot of what he says are just pseudo-chomskyist billows not written by others.
This proves that you don’t understand what Russell Brand is saying, or what Noam Chomsky is saying.
It’s just a series of personal attacks and insinuations (my 13-year-old daughter likes it, which would mean it’s a matter of immaturity).
A really vicious burden, with just a suspicion of awareness that Russell Brand is telling certain truths, perhaps truths that one prefers not to think about.
Hang on, this feeling is going to be more and more widespread!
I can understand why Brand horrifies some: he sometimes speaks pretentiously and after all the absurdities of the tabloids he actually gives the impression of being a beginner populist, but the whole story of not voting has been completely misinterpreted in my opinion.
The general consensus would seem to be that, in other words, in other words, in other words, in different ways, in different ways, in different ways, in different ways, in different ways, in different ways, in different ways, in different ways, in different ways, in different ways, in different ways, in different ways, in different ways, in different ways.
I do not say that I necessarily agree with his solution (because I think that being politically active in presenting his requests can go hand in hand with the fact of voting, since the politicians are girouettes who will change their minds if they really risk to lose the elections), but it is outrageous to see all these answers condescend.
His solution is extremely questionable and it would be good if people debated what he is actually saying rather than simply labeling him as irresponsible and putting aside the concerns of him and a large number of people left behind.
Yes, thank you.
The thing about the vote has been completely deformed.
The uselessness of dragging a bulletin into a poll every 5 years makes me deeply upset since my vote really doesn’t matter.
I want more referendums, electronic voting, direct democracy and members who report locally to their constituents.
In addition, I challenge the idea that Russell Brand’s words are not his own (written by others).
He is intelligent enough to have his own words and ideas, even though these are heavily influenced by the kind of anti-establishment thinkers and academics from the counterculture that Suzanne would like to group under the label "pseudo-chomskyist bellows".
I am rather convinced that in a debate he would succeed in convincing Suzanne.
Maybe that’s what the Guardian could do, let Suzanne do like Polly Toynbee and interview Russell on a veranda, with even the head crochets added to the assembly!
Like Max Keiser, who initially attacked Russell but eventually became one of his fans and invited him into his show, it’s too easy to attack him without really understanding where he wants to come from.
It draws on a political discourse that has existed for generations but has been marginalized by traditional media – including the Guardian – for generations.
This “foolishness” reveals to me above all that the intellectual debate has long been held in the DDRs of History, where business historians have become minorities and where the exchange of specialists have weakened to the benefit of ready-to-think condensed Sciences Po for press files.
For my part, I had seen in the intellectual attitude of Pierre Bourdieu as well as that of Michel Foucault, a need to deal with a culprit, an emissary.
They develop one and the other very rational reasonings, but this rationality rests on these emissary loops which are the vault key of their thinking.
Rather, I believe that for Foucault the state was indispensable as a culprit.
This is part of a very archaic thought, the sacrificial thought, which is also the magical thought.
We solve the problem of the relationship to the other by eliminating it.
There is an anarchist, neo-lib and/or/libertarian slope (of the two terms the second marks a hardening of the desire to eradicate the state, the first knowing to go for state aid for its markets) in the sense of at least State/not State at all at Foucault.
The old dream of the base that self-organizes beautifully.
Her thought is built on the guilt of the state: without this guilt she does not stand.
Who says guilty, says elimination, murder, sacrifice.
This is not a stance against the three intellectuals cited here.
No support, by the way.
The totalitarian left remembers the good old days, that of its god then, Stalin, the little father of the peoples.
Oulala, you probably read a chouya too quickly if you took Foucault’s texts on the Iranian revolution for an apology by Khomeini.
Today, even Pierre Manent would no longer have fun attacking Michel through this...
Left puts a deep reflection on the contemporary individual and the collective, on the difficulty represented by the mechanism of membership in our advanced liberal societies.
Whether we agree with him or not, he is an original and respectable thinker.
To see this cabal orchestrated by hard-left human science researchers who can't stand the passing of allegiance to their mantras is quite ridiculous.
The narcissism and authoritarianism of these people is limitless.
One important point to add seems to me to be the posture of these "rebels", which is only intellectual and theoretical.
The treatment of the Chinese and other “yellow” people I have witnessed in Russia is absolutely incredible.
You didn't have the pleasure of hearing our Australian friends about this, then.
And where was it in Russia that a Russian could meet a Chinese and have a personal opinion?
I don’t remember the last time I saw a Chinese.
In London and they were friendly to me when they learned that I was Russian.
In Russia here - in the 1990s last time, in a market.
The Chinese think the same as the whites.
My family lives in Australia after coming from Hong Kong and Guangzhou a long time ago, in the middle of the 20th century, and I still hear some of them hold violent anti-White speeches.
My father is not happy that his eldest daughter is dating a white man.
I also believe that attitudes have changed in Russia since the 1990s and especially in recent years: they are getting richer, prosperity spreads outside the big cities, and thanks to this prosperity people travel abroad and see how others live.
As I have been told, the Russians mainly have prejudices against unqualified temporary workers from the Caucasus and Central Asia, who work in trades and in areas where they are very lucky to be exploited by their employers or faced with high crime and violence.
Although I have lived on the banks of the Ienissei River in Siberia.
Unfortunately, I heard the Australians' opinions about the Chinese and Aboriginal people.
It’s really weird that a stranger tells me that I don’t support the Chinese, while I’ve met two of them in my life (one of them abroad), I haven’t kept bad memories, all people are worth it, and, in fact, those in London were very nice.
Otherwise we don’t remember who we meet, everyone is worth it, how to remember who was who.
Do you know what's weird?
That you and the other Russian here spoke of the Chinese as a kind of unique fascination, as if they were an attraction in a zoo.
And yet you always go out with said white.
How many Chinese men are with Whites, by comparison?
None, because there is a lot of chance that the parents of these Whites would physically assault them.
There is no measure of the impartiality of justice.
Yet it is the mother of all battles and justice in France remains manipulated by groups strongly marked on the left like the judiciary union...
<0x40>Marabout: Sorry, but the judiciary is frankly right.
When it comes to the judiciary, it represents only 25% of the judges.
If a measure of its bias can be made from the relativity of law enforcement in the courts, it orders to remove two obstacles.
That of the political vision of the observer as that of the actual interpretation of the magistrate.
It remains the required tool of the law to refocus the assessment on the fundamentals.
The measure of its non-observance in all judicial acts of magistrates, including prosecutors, forces to make a distinction between the error and the bias of the magistrates.
It would be in vain to claim that the acts of justice are not divided between these three groups.
Pretension and ignorance are not subject to objective analysis.
And if all this is not analyzed, then how can we say that justice is improving in France?
If it is only by stats implicitly revealing that it is starting from a very low point.
The previous preamble makes it possible to write well what follows in the third ratio.
The Corruption of the Judiciary.
Sensitive subject in proportion to the power of nuisance* that is given to the judicial institution capable of such a heresy.
The domain in question is that of the expropriation* of heirs committed through fraudulent procedure* by successive genealogists appointed by notaries.
This profession earns 150 million euros a year or less while benefiting from the coverage* provided by the quasi-judicial impunity* of the French notary.
In order to understand their mechanism, a part of it was reported in the comments following the first publication.
Where this joins the said statistical improvement* moderated by the previous commentary, it is that the judicial institution has produced, in the course of many disputes between genealogists and heirs who are reluctant to make themselves thus spoiled, a whole set of jurisprudence contrary to all laws favourable to heirs.
Is not the presentation of European statistics ignoring these sorts of rational criteria an elaborate form of lies?
Certainly totally prohibitive prices.
Still some equipment to swindle disabled people.
You can say that, but my brother has one of these all-terrain tricycles, custom-built to his size and weight and it really allowed him to enjoy the outdoors like never before a normal wheelchair, with wheels and bulky tires, could not.
As they say, the tastes and colors...
The Tankchairi looks like what Jeremy Clarkson could invent for a challenge in Top Gear.
The tank chair looks epic.
I think the Whill inventor never had to clean a dog crotch on a stench.
I'm sure my sister would love the all-terrain tricycle, but it's just too expensive.
The ultra long-distance wheelchair would be perfect for a disabled person with a slope for longboarding.
There are hills here that they would like.
Prices seem really high, but there are really people who put that kind of price in a bike, so “you see.”
The all-terrain tricycle seems particularly useful to me.
Not all people with disabilities are poor, however.
Many of them have at their disposal insurances of a reasonable amount.
Only if they have become disabled.
The thing is that the wheelchair market is a niche, so they can afford to practice high prices for things they know we need.
We can’t really say that Whill is minimalist.
This is an example of excessive design.
Unfortunately, it is just a draft, it is not planned to manufacture it.
I'm CONTENT that the "long-distance" wheelchair doesn't arrive on the market, because apparently there's no way to drive this shit.
Nearly 20,000 homes were destroyed by the Israeli army in Gaza, during intensive bombings of densely populated residential areas.
Two million human beings have been prisoners of the Israeli blockade of Gaza since 2007 (Israel is the occupying power of the Palestinian territory, not Egypt).
Half of them are children and young people under the age of 18.
The eight-year-old children have lived their entire lives under Israeli blockade!
Unique situation in the world, unacceptable situation, illegal situation as well, since this blockade inflicts a “collective punishment” on all civilians in Gaza.
“Entrepreneurs working on their projects are diverting a little bit of their cement to the black market.”
Ah, it's not wood tongue, rather concrete and armed the lady...
References are there to support an argument or fact.
The anti-Zionist...
Good cement goes into the tunnels!
There is a black market, that’s for sure, and recognized.
Two million human beings have been prisoners of the Israeli blockade of Gaza since 2007.
Unique situation in the world, unacceptable situation for anyone who has a heart and a moral sense.
The United States has a well-kept territory: Saudi Arabia.
Morsi did not have the time to rule because the dictatorship (supported by who you know) excluded him!
Also remember that after lifting it, Morsi had restored the blockade!!!
And I'm a Westerner, so I approve...
Jonathan...
The blockade is Israeli-Egyptian.
The children of Gaza live on an underground fortress, built against the back of the people who chose their masters!
Having a boat is a lot of work, Alex.
I hope you've thought well.
Couchsurfing is much cooler than Airbnb.
This is the very definition of the sharing economy, not for profit.
A lot of people are just looking for a one-night stand on Couchsurfing.
So it’s getting paid (or at least hoping for it) in a different way.
It is always much cheaper than a hotel, if you have to look for the right addresses.
In addition, self-confident owners and tenants often stop using Airbnb and deal directly in cash, thus bypassing Airbnb.
Where is the community in all of this?
“What’s she renting?”
No problem with the verb, what's the problem with your grammar?
The verb "to let" is not used in the United States.
The author simply used an American expression.
It's an international newspaper now, in case you didn't notice.
It would be better to have the right insurance for the boat, make sure it is 100% compliant with all safety rules and ask those who manage canals and rivers for permission to do business there (which they will definitely refuse to do). I have a boat and I tried to read it.
Have you thought about the fact that boats can be moved, stolen and repainted, sunk, etc.?
The pimples are so slow that if someone tried to steal it it would still be near where you left it.
Or diverted by pirates...
All these Somali immigrants who come here and attack our peniches...
Where are you going to hang him?
No Marine Le Pen is wrong!
Populism?
There is no truth other than that which exposes the facts!
Poverty is increasing in France.
More than 150,000 young people leave school without training.
The increase of wealth in the hands of the richest is a reality.
Who defends who?
Who is defending what?
In 2017, the Mass will be called!
Capitalism is not going to collapse.
The high finance, speculative, plays with our companies, so our jobs, with our raw materials, so our purchases, so our food, so our food, so our health care structures, so our debts, so our institutions.
They are a threat in our daily lives by the same and by our money they hold.
All this to the benefit of some hyper-mega-obese of the fric.
To the contrary, FH said, “My enemy has no name, my enemy has no face, my enemy is finance.”
It was 2012.
In 2014, he appointed a former Rothschild Bank Minister of Economy, a story of better defending the interests of banksters, solely responsible for the 2007 crisis.
Was there anyone else who was competitor?
What do you call it: turn her jacket down, put her pants down?
Primary and populist reaction
In fact, we don’t know what Marine Le Pen thinks.
Where'd you see that?
Because the Germans refused to help the survivors.
I’m not sure Spee really “refused” to rescue the survivors.
One aspect of this battle is that none of the parties seemed certain of the exact strength of the enemy.
Robert Massie in his book Castles of Steel suggests that Spee quickly left the area because he had received a report indicating a British battleship in the area.
The sea was shallow at the beginning of the day; I do not know if it was still so at the end of the battle.
Similarly, the fight ended after sunset, making any rescue operation more difficult.
Compare this with the next battle, the battle of the Malouines, where, in the photos showing the survivors being rescued, we see a calm and sunny sea.
In addition, the rescuers knew that at this stage there were no more German fighters in the area.
Hmm, it doesn't really match what I remember reading about this battle, so I did a quick search on Wikipedia:
“There was some confusion among the German ships about the fate of the two armored cruisers, who had disappeared in the dark after they stopped shooting, and a chase-race began.
Leipzig saw something on fire, but as he approached, he saw that it was just a wreck.
The Nuremberg, slower than the other German ships, joined the battle late and saw the Monmouth, sloping and severely damaged but still in motion.
After pointing his projectors on the ship's flag, the proposal to go was refused and he opened the fire, eventually sinking the ship.
Without reliable information, von Spee judged that the Good Hope had to escape and stopped the search at 10:15 p.m.
Worried about reports indicating a British battleship in the vicinity, he headed north.”
So if this is true, the Germans, in the dark before the invention of the radar, did not know that a ship had sunk, and therefore could not search for survivors.
They also thought that there was a larger Royal Navy corpsman in the area that could have seriously damaged them, so in confusion they disengaged to take advantage of their advance.
They were far from their base and Spee was well aware that they should make their way through many Royal Navy ships.
Cradock's sacrifice had already harmed them and sewed them about half of their ammunition, thus condemning them when they were finally taken.
Several votes are cast at the UMP to request that it be enshrined in the law that a definitively convicted elect is thus definitively ineligible.
This is a bold position, which would also affect the electorate on the left.
But nooon, it's a joke.
FOR THIS IDEA I PROPOSE AN INSPIRATION TO THE MUR OF THE CONS OF THE MAGISTRATES
When is the ban on trade unions in already protected sectors?
How long will this distortion of equality between citizens be tolerated?
Maintained by politicians whose vision of society is limited to these sectors, always quick to tame those who will take advantage of their immobility to impede the actions of real politicians, who really try to make things move, not the beautiful speakers whose immobility is measured by their sufficiencies.
I met them in the subway about noon with their small banners "of the sous pour la justice" they came from the province and did not make the difference between Bercy and the POPB.
It supports the existence of politicized unions whose members put the enormous power they hold at the service of its party.
It would not defend the same theses if right-wing, even far-right, trade unions were targeting personalities on its side and leading a legal-media war against them.
Your claims are totally free of charge.
If, at the moment, the right detracts from the judiciary news, it is simply that it has committed the facts that fall under it!
There is no example of a left-wing personality who has had so much to do with justice, but all those who have been the subject of his attention have not received favourable treatment.
On the other hand, it must be recalled that the judiciary union on the left is not the only judiciary union and is a minority.
That a minister supports unions with so much commitment shows how useful they can be.
<0x40>MCR The union you’re quoting may be a minority among the magistrates, but its influence is great at the Chancellery, it’s no secret.
We now wonder if the "mission" of some judges is more dirty than instructing.
<0x40>Gus - You should be satisfied, the SM is a minority.
What are you complaining about?
<0x40>Pivoine: You forget that the magistrates are not civil servants like the others: they are the only ones who have the power to indict and incarcerate everyone else.
Jade Goody?
What if none of the participants ever came back?
Hello, Katie Waissel.
I believe that even the most starving fool of glory realizes that X-Factor can only mean the end of a career, so I would be surprised if someone accepts their offer.
Many have used it as a stepping stone to start a successful career.
One Direction fills stadiums around the world.
Others then sold a lot of records or left for West End.
Popstars, the precursor to all of these programs, launched Chris Cole, who, in fact, is part of the jury.
Even ABBA, Olivia Newton-John, Céline Dion, Cliff Richard, all competed at the Eurovision, like so many others.
While others like Frank Sinatra and the rest took part in contests in the United States.
In the 1970s and 1980s, New Faces and Opportunity Knocks launched most of the light entertainment stars of British television.
Of course, some have fallen into oblivion.
But that’s what happens anyway to most of the stars who don’t participate in the contests.
There are few who, after a tube, manage to make others.
Anyway, most singers/groups can at best hope for three albums and a best of.
Yeah, but now Cole, or whatever his name is, has fans only in the UK.
His fame comes in part from his marriage to a footballer who breathes through his mouth.
Most Americans know who Jeremy Clarkson is.
It can only mean the end of a career.
In fact, it's more likely to lead to a career than the typical rock walk, even if in your dreams you think that all the guitar shakers who smoke grass in their father's garage and swing three chords on a high school level album out will certainly even become stars before it's a big question.
And worse than ridicule: it establishes a completely artificial distance between the Western public and the studied peoples – a distance that turns quite quickly to racism, because the ethnologists of the sacralists present us with these people who are far from us as infinitely superstitious and practicable, who are inspiritious and inspiritious to the ritual bigotery, while the most of their ways.
Except you're interpreting recklessly in the opposite direction.
That is, but rather than saying that the drum is devoid of a sacred character, is it not better to admit that our Marianne and our Moli<0xC3><0xA8>res do not also have a somewhat sacred character?
Our bias is as recalled to see the sacred as a sort of well-defined and circumscribed object in the religious sphere.
Very interesting article, whatever it is.
It's ephemeral deco to furnish the vacuum.
Nothing more than that.
Great article, thank you.
The recent Pantheonization of illustrious figures of the Republic is an illustration that the sense of sacred still lives on.
Who still believes in the interpretations of archaeologists!
Any other discipline would throw unscientific interpretations that last the life of a mandarin, rarely less.
When is a comparative critique of disciplines for a little laughter?
Because what applies to archaeology also applies to the interpretations given by other disciplines.
This would bring a healthy dose of modesty.
Your contempt for archaeologists is completely unjustified!
It is thanks to them that we constantly discover treasures, valuable testimonies to reconstruct history, understand societies, and the example here of comparative archaeology is exciting.
This method is not very old and before, archaeologists relied on their “instinct” and knowledge, and could be wrong.
Nowadays we have technical and scientific means so powerful that the interpretation of the excavations is better but can always be challenged by other discoveries!
There is a full (and old) controversy over the shamanism advanced by the prehistoric Jean Clottes (cf. his book "The shamans of prehistory", particularly the increased re-edition of the scientific controversy, published in the editions La Maison des Roches).
Thank you for this very informative article
Do straight men like anal sex?
For you, Mike, I could get into it.
So it's over between us?
I don't really understand why we can't go on three?
This paper is supposed to be serious, made for adults.
Do you really need to fall into the ditch?
No, but we're not against a play on it.
We couldn’t watch a musical about it, it would be too gay!
We could expect to have that kind of comment from you.
Looks like Mary Whitehouse came back from the dead.
Since your rehearsal offer is almost over, I can suggest you move on to the Catholic Times.
I'm sure you'll feel more at home.
He prefers Mikedow.
Can I suggest that we were all looking for a newspaper that pays for real, brave journalists to write about the Middle East, Ebola, etc. at their own risk.
Instead of making fun of those kid-ass jokes.
Not very clever.
Then get out of here.
If these “pussy ass jokes” shock you so much, you don’t have to participate, do you?
Do you also know that this newspaper also covers the Middle East and Ebola and that it is quite possible to do both and publish an article on anal sex?
Is this the subject that shocks you, or the fact that people are laughing at you?
However, we find the amateur video of the crash on the net...
Amateur video of the crash on the net...??
If the FOM has chosen not to show these images it is only to protect its interests under no circumstances those of the pilot.
If the FOM had wanted to protect the drivers it would have left the safety because at the time or another vehicle (e.g. troubleshooter) entered the circuit.
But it had to end quickly before the typhoon, which we knew was coming, but for which the FOM did not consider it good to advance the time of departure (television rights, pubs, money...).
However, they are very protective of the pilots.
Of course, I also share that view.
But there is also that if the very British FOM gets into the SC, it will allow Nico Rosberg to have a chance at the restart to beat the Englishman who led then...
This is my blog, my dear Dayrton.
But don't worry, I've got some time to find all your shit.
No, I just don't.
There have been lots of conspiracy in F1, but never one that puts commissars in danger of death for a distant history of possibility of victory from one driver to the detriment of another.
It's not the FOM that comes out the safety because it's the FIA.
Nuance of size.
In view of the amateur images, the lack of image mainly allows the FIA to avoid disturbing questions such as: How does the Commissioner stir a green flag in full intervention and continue to do so after the accident (see the full video after the accident)
No, it is not because the video is deemed too violent that the FIA is blocking the images of the accident but because one clearly sees one of the commissioners shaking a green flag, a sign that the race can resume normally and that one is more under yellow flag regime.
Some comments show a dark misunderstanding of F1.
Yes dear Etienne, the race is no longer under yellow flag regime APRESS the place of the accident, hence the green flag agitated.
This is the usual procedure.
The station of Commissioners just downstream from the accident (depending on the case, it can be 10 meters or 100 meters after the accident) shakes the green to tell the pilots to resume a normal look.
Sensationalism sells advertising.
I used to think that the media was an integral part of the government’s “patriotic” propaganda offensive, but I’m afraid that, in the end, it’s just for the money.
And sex, let’s not forget sex, fear of not having sex life, advertising and the media are good at selling us things that are supposed to improve our sex life.
The info does exactly the same thing.
Buzzing with information that you really don’t need to worry about is just to keep scaring people so you can keep controlling them.
“When tabloids cough about Ebola, we all catch fear,” it should be “derailing,” not “coughing.”
Given the medical reference, “coughing” is much better said in this context than “derailing”.
I wonder if all the people who are upset that Ebola could spread by air realize that they now believe in evolution?
You're doing them too much honor.
They probably think that this is the end of the world and that Ebola is just one of the signs of the approaching apocalypse.
Ebola is the Antichrist.
You're confusing Ebola and Murdoch.
Great article, thank you!
A short and concise article that beautifully and firmly ridicules this abject pseudo-journalism.
It made me laugh. It made me laugh.
I’m depressed that the media talk about most things with that optimism backwards.
The goal is once again to keep us sufficiently scared and anxious (without getting to the hysteria) for the government to get us off when it needs it.
I think it is perfectly logical that, if we have to undergo a budgetary emergency in the absence of any crisis, a terrorist emergency in the absence of any attack, why not have an Ebola crisis in the absence of any evidence?
It seems that this government is trying to save us from crises that it has invented itself.
Isn’t there something fundamentally problematic about the idea of governing by fear?
Congratulations for this post, and for being still from this world almost 35 years later.
In the beginning it must have been horrible, given the context of the 1980s-90s.
I am bluffing, living with the certainty of spending years there .....
Totally unnecessary testimony.
As always when it comes to science.
Not only are the testimonies useless: taken in isolation, they cannot be used as a scientific material.
But they have a detrimental influence on the objective assessment of the facts.
<0x40>trafic: Testimonials cannot be used as scientific material.
Perhaps this is why we refrain from asking questions to psychiatric patients when we have reliable observations from loved ones.
My psychiatric record mentions that my psychiatric mother explains that I was telepathically educated by her stepmother.
This is therefore an objective symptom.
When I say it's bullshit, it's an irrelevant subjective testimony.
Ah, because the testimony of a fact (<0x3D> here this testimony, which testifies to the contamination and effectiveness of new treatments) is useless in a scientific approach?
What do you base your research on, then?
On ghosts?
Are you putting fantasy theories and facts at the same level (<0x3D> giving rise to verifiable testimonies)?
"Resilience": the word snuffed out by the grandmothers, fans of J-L Delarue, who consider themselves great psychologists after reading from Amsterdam.
<0x40>Jim: There are a lot of meaningless buzzwords in psyches.
Cyrulnik gave us the blow of “resilience”.
As he is a great scientist, Cyrulnik, I hope that he has built us a reliable scale of measurement to quantify it, this famous resilience.
I wonder if the Air Sentinels could all save us from Farage and company??
Doesn't that remind you of Team America?
Seriously, it's *not* a good idea to get the Sentinels out of the air...
And why then?
It was a great series and it looks like those who come up with it are aware of it!
So let us leave our salvation to the Almighty who can do miracles.
But how are they going to get the kids to hang out?
The only solution that comes to my mind is pipi-caca humor, which would kill the series.
It was already a children's series.
The children were hanging.
Oh, because it's a children's series?
The UKIP works for the Mysterons.
So keep your Team America.
Still in Super Marionation?
It won't be the same if you don't see the threads and the animation is well done. :-)
I’m looking forward to seeing this (although being an adult), but I hope that will give the idea to a chain of rebroadcasting the old ones.
The series has almost never ceased to be broadcast here in Australia; it has been at least 40 years since episodes of one hour on Saturday and Sunday at 6 a.m.
Since the arrival of free digital television a few years ago, it is on one of the second-class commercial channels and you can still see it at these times.
And in addition, the episodes of half an hour now pass at 5:30 p.m., from Monday to Friday!
Okay, I’m probably a “sad” 60-year-old guy, but I don’t watch this series every day!
There is no "Mount of the Temple" in or under the mosque of the esplanades!!!
The radical Zionists invented this to give themselves political legitimacy to colonize Jerusalem.
By the way, all the Israeli excavations below and around the Esplanade Mosque for several decades have allowed nothing to be found.
The Temple Mount, if it exists, is elsewhere.
Could it be in Argentina?
This mountain is not sought for the simple reason that it is the hill on which the esplanade of the mosques was built.
Its summit, or dome of the Rock, stands out in the middle of the mosque of Omar.
For Muslims, Muhammad ascended to heaven from this rock.
For the Jews, it is Mount Moriah where Abraham failed to sacrifice his son Isaac.
From the moment it was taken and contextualized, there is no propaganda, but information, dear K1K1.
Israel also counts its extremists, it is good to recall it regularly, and they are unfortunately relegated to the government (Naftali Bennet, Avigdor Liebermann, and even Netanyahu, the latter had accepted the 2-state plan, and sabotaged it continuously!).
It is also good to show how peaceful the annexation of Jerusalem is.
Will God be able to recognize His people?
The shortest of the Jewish jokes: "God be praised!"
To brag about tourism in Israel, we are often shown young naiads half naked, alanguis on the beach.
The reality is, as usual, very different from what advertising shows us, as can be seen in the photo that illustrates the article.
It's a little scary anyway.
And this photo is a wonderful piece of propaganda!
It is a pity that the Reuters photographer did not photograph the hundreds of Palestinians allowed to return to the Temple Mount and who prefer to drop the faithful Jews downstairs, praying at the Wall of Complaints.
<0x40>Mat, If this photo bothers you, it's right, it's not the newspaper, nor the photographer, but this woman and the ideology that she conveys that she must condemn.
This system is not durable and will end up in tears.
The only way to end this system is through revolution.
Since the economy seems to be falling apart, large companies have greatly benefited from their employees.
They have managed to convince their employees that they are lucky to have a job and that they cannot afford to raise wages, while at the same time and without hiding, they have given increasingly important wages to the small elite at the top.
You are right, it is not acceptable, but it will only change in this country when workers really speak with one voice.
Instead of yelling and yelling when someone else strikes, support them, show a little solidarity and understand that their strike is not only about their problems, but also shows your employer that you don’t get people wrongfully.
Unless we give up democracy, in which case it is tenable.
I totally agree with you.
The only thing you have forgotten is that British and American companies have sold our industry and now our services to countries where social and environmental conditions are worst.
Such as China and India, for example.
All of this cannot end well.
That's because we're in a democracy.
Have you voted for PTCI?
The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (PTCI) aims to increase the profits of companies owned by these people by short-circuiting national governments by secret courts.
That sounds incredible, but that's exactly what the investor-state dispute settlement mechanism (ISDS) proposed by the agreement is for.
The Greens are against this project and are trying to warn people about the unimaginable harm this agreement will have on our lives.
It’s only recently that we’re starting to talk about it in the media: Independent Guardian World Development Movement So look at these links and you’ll understand what’s being negotiated behind your back.
Did Churchill not say “blood, sweat and tears”?
That’s what makes great returns, while digital money has no reason to fall and even less to grow on trees.
The next weak link will probably be the automotive market.
This gentleman is right, in the 18th century there were unions in all the regiments.
In the very Catholic French army, there is a sacrificial dimension.
Let him (finally, his officers, the others, no one knows anything) believe in the safe of France’s eternal values, and she will fight and shut her mouth.
And then with the decline of the country, globalization, Europe, the crisis of values, in short: the dissolution of the idea of Nation, having this little relic, it is comforting.
Even though it's getting more and more uncomfortable for her...
You still miss the union of married men, celibates, married women, celibates, lost dogs and I don't know what else
If you don't write French correctly, I'm syndicating.
You are warned, it will be your fault.
For the defense of categorical interests, protected professions with trade unions are already well underway, which has created a break in equality with other citizens.
We are asked not to laugh about the fear of danger on the part of an official.
One can very well imagine a system that guarantees some freedom of expression without unions, or without the right to strike as in Germany, in return for the protection they enjoy.
Otherwise, disaster is assured.
And with the carts getting ready, the government congratulates them.
What security are you talking about?
Ignorance indeed...
Ignorance for ignorance Sybille I was referring to the military and other officials, since this is the subject here commented...
We shall abolish "through its delegates" in article 8 of the preamble to the 1946 Constitution.
It will be: "8.
Every worker participates in the collective determination of working conditions as well as in the management of enterprises".
This is absolutely necessary with the eruption of informational power.
And yet you opened, probably read and commented on an article specifically titled “The Great British Bake Off review”.
Wait, the section was there, empty.
I thought we should start the conversation.
Anyway, it's Joffrey's wedding I looked at, and I can tell you some have been well seasoned.
In the episode of Joffrey's wedding we have one of the best moments (although misleading: it was wine) in the history of television.
Also, from the cake mmmh...
Game of Thrones!
I love the GBBO.
This is the second time in a row that, strangely enough, the show ends with a least bad bakery victory; no one has done anything like, "boom, here's my fucking cake now eat it and lean in front of your master!"
Perhaps the extra pressure from friends and parents outside has finally had an effect on them?
In the previous weeks, all these external persons were kept at a distance.
And there’s also this idea of “playing security, there’s always next week” that disappears last week.
I like to cook, but I can't imagine doing that.
I am grateful to those who do and thus offer us great entertainment and push us to try new things.
Forward to GBBO 2015!
I agree, last year's last challenge, the wedding cake, was absurd.
Professionals usually take days to do them and they had to knit one in 3-4 hours.
The three challenges were really hard to start, I don’t know how they were able to choose a winner.
At Luis’s, the only real flaw they could find was the base a bit dry (although I agree with Hollywood to say that the green glazing on Richard’s mill didn’t give in, anyway Richard had already lost at the time).
I have to admit that several challenges in this series seem a little artificial because of the time allocated.
There is also the cancer that lingers, with the blows of the solar wind.
Definitely, we are all successful right now.
A bad time to go for humanity, we hope.
You confuse solar wind and ultraviolet rays.
UVs are blocked mainly by the ozone layer which is formed precisely by the impact of residual solar wind particles and UVs.
So even if the magnetic field was weakening, there wouldn’t be enough solar wind to “hunt” the ozone from the stratosphere.
There would be even more, and therefore less UV and “cancers”.
Fortunately, the ozone layer does not block UV.
They have a lot of useful functions that you don’t suspect.
If we are limited to humans, they have an interest in allowing us to have bones (synthesis of vitamin D), warming us (less than infrared), modulating our immune system and, it seems, improving our morale.
The ozone layer blocks carcinogenic UVCs and lets UVA and most UVBs through.
Do you know that you do not have to be condescending and consider your interlocutor to be a survivor when you post a comment?
Especially for a minor precision that was implied in the commentary, which itself intends to prove pedagogy.
Not to mention that I am a melanoma habituator, UVs only accelerate its development.
They do not provoke it.
For proof: not all people with bronchitis have melanomas.
That is, when a toubib tells you to avoid the sun and live at the bottom of a cellar, it is better not to listen because UVs are necessary for every human.
Excess, on the other hand, is like everything: it kills.
But for other reasons.
UV directly causes melanoma.
Is it possible to fold it?
And, more importantly, can we pass it to the mixer?
Or put it in the mixer...
I think the majority of those who are interested in it have found that anything can be folded if enough strength is applied to it and the robustness of the iPhone 6 is perfectly acceptable, for the use it is intended for.
I think the military would need something more resilient and has therefore not yet adopted the iPhone6 as front-line communication material.
But for the rest of us,
It's still a good choice.
The majority of those who are interested in it have found that anything can be folded if sufficient force is applied to it.
I have a Nokia 3310.
More specifically, is it already folded?
This is a joke in every discussion.
I decided to count them.
This is the fourth folding joke I read in the comments today.
It is difficult to understand how a prototype can be distributed like this.
Before installing specific software, it is assumed that the phone has been removed from the main production line and it is hardly seen how it could return to it.
So, hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
Most likely, it is a production unit on which the iOS has not been installed correctly and which is therefore stuck with the factory test code installed.
I don’t know how they do these things at all.
But, would they put test software on everyone?
The photographs on Ebay clearly show the absence of an FCC or CE logo and the presence of a prototype red connector.
ah l article for bobo par excellence.
We want inexpensive products and we wonder that the industrialists produce in "industrial" We highlight super u but all the brands and meme the small trade are concerned How to eat good, organic avac 1650<0xE2><0x82><0xAC> (average salary in France)?
But to answer your post, if it is possible to eat correctly with a small salary.
After all, everyone is free to put their priorities where they hear them.
For me, food is one of them.
Go without regret, I kiss you
They are called bobos, or rather boboecolos, people who see the world through an ideological “software” that leads them to disconnect from reality.
This is the total disengagement of thought-reason.
They are experts in gesturing, for example, claiming to save the planet because they have avoided taking a shower.
They are also experts in truffling, joining the caviar left, from which they sometimes come, for example by condemning CO2 emissions while spending their holidays in the Maldives.
The vast majority of our fellow citizens do not tolerate this mixture of heavy ideology and truffle, so do not be surprised to encounter criticisms of them often.
Wow, thank you for this complete and exhaustive theorization as well as for all the related details (plane, shower...).
I'd like to be a part of it, but I can't find myself there.
The concept is not so complicated.
The boboecolos are monobloc.
Do you understand the concept of caviar?
And you are able to understand the concept of boboécolo.
It's the perfect copy with just an ideological nuance.
Classification would be more complicated if we were interested in eco-friendly at all times.
The boboecolo is part of it but represents only the most visible fringe of the ecos because it is the one that infests the media.
This is a beautiful giraffe.
Apparently, no one wants to look this giraffe in the face.
It is so badly made that it vaguely resembles a female nude.
Fall, you're next to the plate.
You have to be part of the microcosm of art to understand the astonishing beauty of truth in this work.
But you simply don’t have any legitimacy to comment since you haven’t spent countless decades studying and flattering great artists.
The important thing is not that Emin does not know how to draw and always seems obsessed with the same subject.
The important thing is that she really managed to become fabulously rich and famous by not having any artistic ability.
That's art. That's art.
No, it's pork.
The fact that Emin can't draw
This is not really a proven fact.
It's more of an opinion.
Unless the only thing you can enjoy is realistic reproductions of dogs that smoke while playing billiards.
Judging art can be problematic, but not in this case.
Drawing is much more than just representing the real thing.
If you’re just looking for that, a camera will do the job.
The author also speaks of Emin's expressionism.
Look again and let the image speak for itself, without comparing it to the kind of drawing you might prefer.
If it's that easy, why don't you do it yourself?
There is still something to be spared: horseback riding, the number of horses in the Republican Guard or the status of generals who are no longer in active service.
Honesty obliges us to say that France decreases its workforce, but as all countries have done, sometimes even more drastic, starting with Britain.
It's only half as encouraging...
The operative without the support, it quickly finds its limits!
A singular approach, at a time when we observe the weaknesses, the shortcomings of our defense tool, especially in the Sahel.
A bad blow to the local authorities concerned, who lose a dimension of their activities, or even a part of their history.
Where is the promised sanctity?
<0x40>edmond: that's what I said, look elsewhere to save money but especially not at home, at home it really is not possible...
This is exactly what you propose to do, look elsewhere where the gabegie is certain.
That all those who have lived close enough to the military thing dare come here, eyes in eyes that there is no money wasted in this perimeter and this without bursting with laughter...
Applying the same potion to the public service as a whole and public finances will be a little better.
And for Josi: really reloud: look at the inflation of public jobs in other ministries and you will understand why La Défense may consider itself a little busy!
Well yes, the economies on which everyone agrees to say that they have to be done, but it has to be seen somewhere, right?
Lack of pot, those on whom it falls groan at the murder when it happens to them, the poor darling.
It should be done, but most importantly, it doesn’t fall on me because, in this case, it’s a crime and not an economy.
Guignols, go!
How will closing the Val de Grace weaken our defense tool in the Sahel?
As for local authorities, history repeats itself at each closing of the post, maternity, hospital, barracks.
But everyone is for the economy, of course.
It is bizarre, a UMP mayor who wants compensation and is not happy with the savings in public spending.
This article is truly the most amazing thing I have ever read!
This embarrassing moment where the first three people who comment are making the same bad joke.
It’s depressing to scroll through his Facebook thread and see that 80% of his friends started their status with the phrase “This embarrassing moment.”
I think they're going to make a movie of it.
It will certainly be based on hilarious scenes where someone accidentally falls on their ex on the bus going to work and only realizes there that his skirt has come back into his panties.
It's not embarrassing, it's completely bullshit.
Not really, in my opinion, the author adopts the role of the typical British man who has always been taught to bury his emotions and tighten his teeth.
I’m sure if you’re a fan of Kate Bush, the announcement of her return to the stage after 25 years of absence was something strong.
Do you realize that your comment is now at the heart of a battle to find out who will have the rights?
I don’t have the “Internet”.
So I don't think I can comment.
Not having a computer.
Oh, my God, I have to watch this movie before I die!
I can’t believe how amazing this article is the most amazing thing I’ve ever read!
Charlie has just really demonstrated that satirical journalism is at the top of the cosmic universe!
I'm falling in the face!
I absolutely need to share with all my friends on Facebook and Twitter to finally have the enlightenment and discover the incredible brilliance and insurmountable genius that emerges from Mr. Brooker’s keyboard like a divine glow.
Oh, my God, it was really nothing.
Especially if it's not women or transvestites.
I'm a parasite.
This shows a positive development within democracies: the rise of effective regional policies and associative initiatives.
Until further notice, we confiscate the right to save our planet by States that play truffles at every meeting to save the planet.
So we, the citizens, decide to take matters into their own hands.
With the commissioner they planted in energy, all these beautiful recommendations have flown in....
Wind turbines and solar farms are the Round Points of tomorrow.
All financed by the tribal.
Please stop this pro-nuclear discourse.
Pollution is not limited to CO2.
Radioactivity is much more harmful in terms of its waste and in the event of an accident.
As long as the sector is not controlled in its entirety, it is better to limit it to laboratories.
Renewable energies are our only salvation, provided, of course, that our consumption is drastically reduced.
Renewable electricity to combat CO2 emissions? <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
France has nothing to do with it.
Nuclear electricity is zero CO2 emissions to production and epsilon for the other stages.
Electricity by renewable wind or PV is already more GHG on other stages and especially gas, or worse than coal as in Germany, to compensate for intermittency.
Replacing nuclear power with renewable wind or PV would be counterproductive to the fight against CO2.
Christian I don't insult you I'm a Doctor of State in Physical Sciences 1981 plus I did research in nuclear physics I challenge you to prove the opposite of what I said.
For what I did not say it is you who lend me ideas I did not say anything about Germany in fact you did not answer what I said and like all right people demolish the interlocutor I never do.
I also quote the conclusion of experts mandated by the German government: Germany's current renewable energy programme is a non-profitable and inefficient way to reduce GHG emissions and should be stopped.
0 emissions if you do not count the extraction of uranium and construction and if you do not count the water vapour greenhouse gas of less effect than Co2 it is true recall two-thirds of the energy produced by a nuclear power plant goes into water vapour and a little in the water of the rivers.
I stopped reading when you talked about Pakistan as a “South Asian giant”...!!
Last time, Pakistan won against Hindustan.
I’m not surprised, most Indians who post comments only want to read and comment on articles against Pakistan.
By the way, it shows your state of mind.
It would have been the same if they had called India the giant of South Asia...
I have nothing against the fact that some Pakistani players participate, but having a Pakistani version would be unacceptable.
It would simply open a box of Pandora full of corruption and mafiosi.
As for the ISL, today's opening match was surprisingly interesting, Kolkata Athletico imposing 3-0 against Mumbai.
Pakistan still has a long way to go.
In comparison to the billions and billions that India devotes to IPL cricket and now to football, how could we one day compete with our “noisey neighbors”...
The race to the low cost launcher pays cash.
Too bad for such a beautiful project.
For the incident, the possible design defect is only manifested with too cold helium.
So we may not be in a design flaw, but implementation...
Unlike arianespace which is a private company, it seems that soyuz belongs to the Russian state...
And if the rule is the same as here the state is its own insurer..
Maybe they'll pay the satellites in frigates who knows.
This is all the more painful because many media outlets are taking on the only titles of articles – and many readers are holding on to only those titles.
In total, this creates an erroneous impression contrary to the content of the article itself.
Totally agree with you, the title is not appropriate, it unfairly challenges the project while it is only a launcher problem.
