A 9-year-old boy found on the runway in Tampere
Police have been on a search mission after a 9-year-old boy fled to Tampere on Tuesday night.
The news of the disappearance of a boy who left West Tampere with his friend has been circulated on social media.
According to the police situation center, the boy has been contacted, and he has no life and health risk.
The boy’s father told Ilta-Sanom at midnight knowing that the boy had been found.
He's fine, and now we're starting a follow-up.
The boy was found near the house, the father said.
Ronaldo is back in the line-up for Messi
Cristiano Ronaldo scored five goals in the Spanish league over the weekend and continued his production in the Champions League.
The battle between Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo over the Champions League's sixth goal was at least a moment's worth.
Real Madrid’s Ronaldo moved alone to the top of all-time goalkeeper statistics when he shot a visitor to Shahtar Donetsk’s net from two penalty kicks and one from a game situation.
Ronaldo climbed his field to 80, with 77 hits at the Barcelona Messe, which was on the same page with him before Tuesday.
Real won the match 4-0.
Juventus have been computed from the start of the season in the Italian Football League in Serie A, but in the Champions League D-Block it began strongly with a 2-1 guest victory over Manchester City.
The winning goal was scored ten minutes before the end of Juventus Alvaro Morata.
The attack on the city was bored by the absence of the knee-deep Sergei Aguero.
Aguero, who was injured in the weekend’s league game, only came to the field in the last ten minutes.
Manchester United's second team also suffered a hard time in the Netherlands against PSV Endhoven after a 1-2 loss.
ManU's 20-year-old goalkeeper Luke Shaw's fight lasted only an hour.
PSV’s Hector Moreno’s dangerous-looking glider hit the target of the attacking ManU pack so badly that Shaw probably broke his leg.
Shaw was lying in the backyard of Eindhoven’s home stadium ten minutes before the medical staff took him to hospital.
Memphis Depay took the visitors to the 1-0 lead in the 41st minute, but ManU's joy lasted only a few minutes.
Moreno leveled before the break with extra time.
PSV’s winning goal was scored by Luciano Narsingh in the second half.
In the Champions League, the A-Block began in Paris Saint-Germain.
The match was played by the Argentinean Angel Di Maria, who changed Manchester United’s shirt to PSG.
Di Maria broke through the right and lifted the ball to the back corner past Malmö goalkeeper Johan Wiland.
Edinson Cavani scored 2-0 for PSG in the second half.
PSG has been ranked among the winners of the season.
The assumption is not wrong, but Malmö, one of the league’s small clubs, is not the best possible benchmark.
PSG star striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic met for the first time in his professional career with his starting club Malmö FF.
Ibrahimovic started his career in Malmö in 1999.
Roman Eremenko played 90 minutes after his team's Moscow TsSKA lost to Wolfsburg 0-1 in the B-Block match in Germany.
The opposition party demanded immediate resignation – the president gave the wrong speech
Zimbabwe’s President Robert Mugabe gave the same speech he had given a month ago.
Zimbabwe’s President Robert Mugabe has again given the same speech he gave in the country’s parliament at the end of last month.
During his 25-minute speech, Mugabe apparently did not realize that the speech was the same.
The speech raised doubts about whether the 91-year-old Mugabe is in full swing.
The main opposition party MDC demanded Mugabe to resign because this is too old to rule.
Mugabe’s assistants hastened to say that the confusion had only occurred in Mugabe’s squad and that the president had done nothing wrong.
Mugabe’s speech discussed China’s impact on the country’s economy in the past and now.
Germany and Austria want an extra summit on the refugee crisis
Germany and Austria have presented an additional EU leaders’ summit next week due to the refugee crisis.
The President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, chaired the summits, assessed the request.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the heads of state should discuss cooperation with the countries of origin and how they could be more effectively registered in Europe.
According to Merkel, the negotiations on the quotas for asylum seekers are on the table of interior ministers.
Teacher admits he shot his girlfriend during an emergency call
In an emergency call, Shannon Lamb, a university professor with a little color, tells the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the police must come to their house.
Lamb stressed that his "golden dog" is alive and probably shocked, and said that the contact details of the deceased woman's relatives can be found on this phone.
Inside the house, the police found Amy Prentiss' body and a message written on the hate page: "I am so sorry I could cancel this beloved Amy and she is the only woman who has ever loved me," the letter said, which according to experts is Lamb's signature.
There was no indication that Lamb, who taught two online courses at the Delta State University in Cleveland, Minnesota, had already traveled nearly 500 miles to the school campus, where police believe he was shot and killed by a long-held history teacher, Ethan Schmidt, at the door of this study.
Delta State University Chief of Police Lynn Buford said the University staff heard the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
He said Lamb had made a fatal emergency call some time after that.
By the end of the day, the death toll rose by one more: Lamb committed suicide while surrounded by the police.
Authorities were still trying to figure out Lamb’s motives the day after the students and staff had to hide behind locked doors due to the school shooting.
Researchers on both sides of the state have released information that students and staff described Lambia as a gifted teacher, but who may have had problems.
The students told me they were waiting for her.
Police in the town of Prentiss, Gautier, say Lambi did not have a violent past or a criminal record.
Schmidt himself had included Lamb in his book, in which he thanked the "powerful people" with whom he shared his academic life.
Both taught at the Institute of Social Sciences and History, with a total of 17 staff members, and many of the students attended both men's courses.
On the other hand, there were some signs of problems.
A student named Brandon Beavers praised Lambia, but said she also seemed nervous and restless, "as if something was wrong."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, told Lamb that he had a lot of stress at the end of the 2014-15 school year.
Lamb had previously asked for sick leave from Delta State University saying he had some sort of health problem.
This year, he taught only two online courses.
The recent changes in the university’s payroll meant that while Lamb had worked hard for his doctoral degree, it did not give him an automatic career development and an assistant professorship.
William LaForge, the university's principal, said that there was no conflict between Lamb and Schmidt in his knowledge, but that "there was clearly something in Lamb's mind."
Lamb is no longer able to answer these questions.
After Lamb had fled the campus, the police were able to track him down when he moved back to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he was arrested, Lamb shot himself with a .38 caliber pistol in the backyard of a house about one-and-a-half miles south of his parents’ house in the suburbs of Mississippi Greenville, Washington County’s death warden Methel Johnson said.
Lamb's car was still running on the porch.
It was not immediately clear why Lamb went to this house, although Johnson said he believed Lamb knew the people living there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb started working at the University in 2009 and taught geography and education. The University has 3,500 students and is located in a city with about 12,000 inhabitants.
Lamb graduated with a Ph.D. in Educational Science in the spring.
One of Lamb's old friends described him as intelligent, charismatic, and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 years old and Lamb was 20 when they met through mutual friends.
Hairston and his friends were in high school, and Lamb was a funny, older guy who for many years tried to teach Hairston to play guitar.
He was quite charming at the time.
All the girls were melting wax when she was there, now told 40-year-old Hairston, who lives in the suburb of Jackson, Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss had apparently been dating for some time.
In an emergency call, Lamb said he killed his wife, but there is no evidence of their marriage.
They had a dog named Lightning who lived with them in a riverside brick house in Gautier.
The police said the dog was okay.
The former husband of Prentiss, Shawn O'Steen, told me they divorced 15 years ago, but I remain friends, and now they have a 19-year-old daughter.
"He's really shocked," O'Steen described his daughter.
He was her mother's best friend.
O'Steen said he hadn't met Lamb but had heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when Lamb and Abigail were both performing on the summer market three years ago.
Later, they played together with some of the chefs.
O'Steen told me that his daughter does and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for several different online companies.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and occasional entertainer at The Julep Room near Gautier, says he last saw Lamb and Prentiss on the night of September 5, when Lamb had stopped performing guitar and lip harps for a rare audience.
Nothing seemed to be wrong.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We played and threw punches at each other.
So they were both pretty nocturnal.
The late teacher Schmidt led the first-year student seminar program and had specialised in Indian and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English teacher at the school.
Schmidt was married and had three small children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas, and was the chairman of his fraternity and student administration.
On Tuesday evening, at the Delta State campus in Cleveland, a candlelight event was held, attended by about 900 people, including teaching and other staff, students and community members.
Schmidt's wife Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt also took part in the show, during which the university choir sang the songs Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
Teaching will continue on Wednesday.
“We’re trying to get our students back,” LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
It's time for recovery.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Mississippi to Cleveland.
Associated Press writer Emily Wagster Pettus from Mississippi Greenville and Rebecca Santana from New Orleans participated in the report.
The case has been corrected by the fact that the police now say that Lamb called an emergency call after Schmidt was shot, and that although Lamb referred to Prentiss' wife during the call, there is no evidence that they were married.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer employees for holiday season
Toys R Us says it doesn’t hire as many employees for the holiday season as it did last year, but a toy and baby products retailer says that current permanent and seasonal workers are given the opportunity to do more hours.
According to the company, it plans to hire 40,000 people to work in stores and distribution centers across the country, compared to 45,000 people employed during the 2014 holiday season.
Most of the work is part-time.
The company said that interviews with applicants will begin this month, and the number of staff will rise from October to December.
Even though there are months in the holiday season, the Christmas shopping season is approaching, and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to assist in the occupancy of stores as well as in the sale, shipping and delivery of products.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his "dates" with Princess Diana
The premiere of The Return to the Future was a moment of great professionalism for Michael J. Fox.
It was also worth noting for personal reasons.
“We sat in the theater waiting for the royals to arrive, and I realized that the seat next to me was empty, and then I realized that Princess Diana’s seat next to me was,” she said in the upcoming documentary Back in Time trailer.
The movie starts and I think I’m just a little bit of a snag and a stretch of my hand from a date with the Princess of Wales.
Back in Time is a documentary about the film Back to the Future, which interviewed Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and production director Steven Spielberg.
Returning to the future was her first night 30 years ago.
Spielberg once said, “To me, it’s undoubtedly the finest time travel film of all time.”
Back in Time will be available as a subscription video, DVD and some movie theaters in October.
U.N. President Says Syria Will Not Be Armedly Resolved
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon’s response to Russia’s increasing military support for Syria is that this nearly five-year conflict “will not be resolved by armed means” and the additional weapons will only exacerbate violence and the suffering of millions of people.
The UN leader again called on all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and support non-discriminatory negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban told a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet with foreign ministers of the five permanent member states - the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France - at the General Assembly's ministerial week later this month to discuss Syria.
He regretted that the division of the Council, the people of Syria and the regional powers "has made it impossible to resolve the situation."
Mr Ban called on the five permanent Member States to demonstrate the solidarity and unanimity that they demonstrated in dealing with the Syrian crisis when agreeing on Iran's nuclear programme.
8 Poll Results That Show Donald Trump Is Seriously Serious
Some people have tried to label him as a windmill.
Some people just think of him as a joke.
Some are waiting for the collapse.
While some Republicans have tried to drive Donald Trump out of the top of the polls, it has not (yet) succeeded.
Of the last 11 national polls in ten, Donald Trump has been led by a two-digit number, and some have begun to seriously ponder what this means for the appointment of a real estate king.
Of course, the election season is only at an early stage.
These results do not yet mean that Trump is likely to become a Republican candidate.
Commentators point out that at this point in 2011 Rick Perry was losing his lead to rising Herman Cain, neither of whom won any state in the nomination process.
There are also many reasons why he would have problems in the general election.
However, outside groups such as Jeb Bush’s Super PAC and the conservative economic organization Club for Growth have noticed Trump’s persistence and have begun to use his funds to oust him.
The following recent survey results suggest that the real estate king is not just a transitional stage:
Trump’s popularity figures have made a complete turnaround.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, polls at Monmouth University showed that only two out of ten Republicans favored the real estate king.
By mid-July, the figure was 40%.
At the beginning of August, the figure was 52%.
At the moment, six out of ten Republicans are positive about Donald Trump.
About three out of ten say they’re negative.
These figures are also true in the first pre-election countries.
In a poll conducted by the University of Quinnipiac in Iowa last week, 60 percent of Republicans said they were positive about Trump.
Two-thirds of Republican voters would be happy if Trump became a candidate.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be either "interested" or "satisfied" if Trump were a candidate.
Only two out of ten said they would be “shocked” if he became a candidate.
Only Ben Carson gets basically the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent "interested" vs. 40 percent of Trump).
The next most exciting thing?
Marco Rubio is only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters would be “dissatisfied” or “disturbed” if the ruling party’s favorite Jeb Bush would become a candidate.
Trump’s fire nature is not a problem for most Republicans.
While Donald Trump has been widely criticized for his powerful speeches and insults, according to Monday’s ABC News/Washington Post poll, 52 percent of Republican voters at the national level think that the real estate king has a suitable character for the president.
According to a Quinnpicac poll last week, the number in Iowa, which hosts the first party conference, is the same: 52 percent of Republicans think Trump has the right character for the leader.
However, according to an ABC/Post poll, 44 percent believe that his character is not suitable for acting as president, and nearly six out of ten believe that his character is not part of the White House.
Republicans are getting used to the idea.
When Republican voters think like commentators, they think that Trump is the real option.
According to a CNN/ORC poll, four out of ten considered Trump the most likely option when asked who is most likely to be nominated as a Republican candidate.
At the end of July, four out of ten were in favor of Jeb Bush.
Disclosure of information: Republican voters have not always had the brightest possible crystal ball at their disposal.
In the last term at this time, four out of ten Republicans felt that Rick Perry would be nominated, and only 28 percent supported the final candidate, Mitt Romney.
In any case, this shows that the majority of Republican voters consider Trump’s campaign credible.
Even if the Republicans stood up to support another candidate, Trump would still win almost everyone.
Some commentators have pointed out that the splinter field is likely to have contributed to Trump’s leadership, as anti-Trump support has been shared among numerous other candidates.
However, a poll conducted by Monmouth University in early September showed that in a hypothetical bilateral race between Trump and almost all other Republican candidates, Trump gets the majority support in almost all cases.
He leads Carly Fiorina with 13 points, Marco Rubio with 14 points, Walker with 15 points, Jeb Bush with 19 points and Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie with 33 points each.
He's on par with Ted Cruz.
Trump's only winning candidate?
If they were opposed, Ben Carson would win businessman Trump with a big 18-point gap.
Most of Donald Trump’s supporters have said they have made the decision.
A new CBS/NYT poll on Tuesday shows that just over half of the voters in favor of Trump have decided who their vote is going to be.
Of course, the situation can change, and no one can say with complete certainty that they would never change their mind.
46% said they could possibly change their candidacy.
In any case, Trump’s biggest competitor at the moment is another unlikely winner, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but those voters who said they made the decision are twice as likely to be on Trump’s side.
Six out of ten Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump two months ago called Mexican immigrants “raids” in his campaign announcement speech, immigration has been at the center of the 2016 debate.
Some are concerned that Trump’s tyranny will drive Latino voters farther away from the Republican Party and harm rebranding efforts.
According to a new ABC/Post poll released on Monday, six out of ten Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So it seems that as long as immigration is at the center of things, so is Donald Trump.
Frustration with the government has reached a new peak.
The support of Donald Trump and Ben Carson now covers about half of Republican voters, largely because of their position outside of politics.
Six out of ten Republicans said on Monday in an ABC/Post poll that they would rather choose an out-of-policy person than one with government experience.
They are also angry with the federal government.
Two weeks ago, a Des Moines Register/Bloomberg poll in Iowa showed that three out of four Iowa Republicans are frustrated with Republicans in Congress: 54 percent are "dissatisfied" and 21 percent are "really angry".
Jeremy Corbyn's first appearance at Prime Minister's Question Time
Corbyn's first appearance at the polling station has been eagerly awaited since his election.
The new Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn will meet David Cameron for the first time at the prime minister’s polling session.
Corbyn will rise to ask the first six questions a little after noon, and probably both the media and the Labour Party MPs will be closely watching his performance.
Corbyn has called for the weekly show "less theater and more facts".
He has also said that he could leave some of the opportunities for his colleagues to take care of.
This meeting is Corbyn’s first parliamentary test for leadership since he was appointed to the shadow government and he spoke at the trade unions’ annual meeting on Tuesday.
At the same time, the decision of the leader of the Labour Party to stand silent during the national anthem at the memorial service on Tuesday, which was held on the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain, has aroused criticism among the Conservative Party’s MPs and appeared in a number of frontrunners.
Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem has attracted attention
Corbyn's representative said he was "respectfully silent during the season" and that he recognizes "the courage of the Royal Air Force in the British Air War."
Corbyn's shadow board member, Owen Smith, told BBC Two Newsnight that he had called on the Labour Party leader to sing the national anthem despite the fact that he thought the royal house should be abolished.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers have refused to join Corbyn's inner circle, arguing for disagreements in economic, defence and foreign affairs, with initially less than a sixth of the parliamentary party supporting him as leader.
BBC policy correspondent Robin Brant says the differences in the party's position in the European Union as well as the government's support ceiling have "earned" within the Labour Party even after Corbyn's appointment.
Corbyn said at the trade unions’ central meeting that the Labour Party is proposing a change that would remove the entire ceiling.
Hours later, the shadow government’s secretary for work and pensions Smith said the party was “very clear” about the fact that they were only opposed to the government’s plans to lower the ceiling from <0xC2><0xA3>26,000 to <0xC2><0xA3>23,000.
Corbyn becomes the fifth leader of the Labour Party that David Cameron has faced in the last decade, when he has been the leader of the Conservative Party.
The Labour Party leader has promised a new approach to politics and now says he has "forced" ideas into questions for the prime minister, and has received more than 30,000 proposals.
Mr Corbyn, MEP for the Islington North region, has said that the nature of the Prime Minister's questioning hours is too contradictory and that he intends to refrain from both polite speeches and gossip, promising instead to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and youth issues.
Corbyn has said that the shadow government's finance secretary Angela Eagle will act in his place during interrogation hours when Corbyn is not involved - for example, when Cameron is abroad.
Mr Corbyn has also suggested that other colleagues should also be allowed to speak at times, and he has said that he has approached the chairman of the Chamber, John Bercow, on the sidelines of the matter.
When Cameron took office in 2005, he said he wanted to move beyond a political theater that is often combined with the Prime Minister's questioning lessons, but he later had to admit that he had failed.
Since they were televised in 1990, the Prime Minister's Question Time has been an important measure in assessing the leader's discretion, his control of the House of Commons, and his position among other MPs, even though critics have criticised the polls every season.
Homeless young people are being trained as photographers in Joburg
The centre of Johannesburg is a difficult place to be homeless.
However, a group of former street children have found a way to learn skills and earn a living.
'I was shot in Joburg' is a non-profit studio where homeless young people are taught how to take pictures of their neighborhood and make a profit from it.
BBC News met one of the young people who graduated from the first project.

The value of the pound rises as wage growth in the UK accelerates
The value of the pound jumped upwards after the numbers showed a rise in the UK’s wage growth, and at the same time the FTSE 100 index rose with SABMiller.
Between May and July, UK salaries, excluding bonuses, rose 2.9 per cent compared to the same time last year.
The rate of growth was the fastest since 2009, and it was considered to bring with it estimates of the increase in prices.
The pound rose more than 1% against the dollar to $1,5505, and 0.84% against the euro to $1,3730.
The FTSE 100 index closed at a 1.49 percent increase to 6229.21.
SABMiller was the most distinctive share on the market and rose by 20 % after competitor AB InBev approached it with an offer.
The agreement would combine the world’s two largest breweries and bring together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry’s share rose 0.9 percent after a competing luxury product group from Richmont received encouraging news.
Richemont's latest sales figures were better than expected, and they also showed that sales in China - which is Burberry's key market - had begun to grow again.
Glencore’s shares rose 5 percent after the mining giant said it had raised $2.5 billion by rolling out shares as part of its debt-cutting strategy.
The packaging and paper group Mond's shares were among the index's biggest decliners by 4.3 percent after Goldman Sachs changed its recommendation from a company to a "sell" form.
JD Sports rose 3.1 per cent after the sports betting company announced its six-month pre-tax earnings: a 83 per cent increase to <0xC2><0xA3>46.6 million.
JD Sports CEO Says Higher Wages Could Hurt Enlargement
JD Sports CEO Peter Cowgill says that if the minimum wage for employees is raised in the UK, it could mean “the purchasing power of potential consumers is increasing.”
However, this purchasing power is unlikely to exceed the higher labour costs for the company, says Cowgill.
The costs could be related to the company’s expansion plans, he added, which would mean fewer additional jobs.
Metcash launches grassroots campaign against Aldi’s intrusion
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA stores from Aldi’s attack in South and Western Australia.
Food wholesaler Metcash has launched a grassroots campaign to defend the market share of IGA traders in South and Western Australia ahead of Aldi’s $700 million attack.
Aldi is preparing to open two distribution centers and the first trade in South and Western Australia early next year, with up to 120 trades coming to them. At the same time, Metcash and IGA supermarkets will strengthen their relations with local food brokers as well as with the local food market.
IGA dealers and buyers have jumped in, and brands like Dunsborough ice cream maker Simmo's offer tasty treats at IGA's stores, and store owners sell discounted tickets to Australian football matches to stand-alone customers.
Metcashin is expected to reveal more details of its defense strategy on September 29, when this food, alcohol and iron wholesaler is organizing the annual Investor Strategy Day.
There is a lot at stake, as South and Western Australia account for almost 30 percent of Metcash’s IGA trades, and their profit margins are higher than that of the Metcash’s eastern IGA network.
Visitors to shopping in South and Western Australia are known to be corner-based, and IGA dealers have a much higher market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland: more than 30 percent in the south and 24 percent in the west compared to 14 percent in the eastern states.
Analysts such as Morgan Stanley, however, believe that Aldi captures about 5 percent of the food market in these two states within 12 months of opening the first stores. The turnover is obtained from all operators, but mainly from independent retailers.
In this week’s report, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath estimates that IGA dealers could lose $360 million annually in sales and Metcash could lose $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that next year Aldi will open 25 moves in the south and 30 moves in the west, generating $500 million and $600 million in turnover in these regions.
The loss of food and food sales and volumes at Metcash’s high fixed-cost base could cost Metcash about $13 million in operating profits before interest and taxes, Kierath said.
At the same time, Metcash loses market share in the eastern states mainly to Ald and Coles, although a recent Roy Morgan study found that IGA’s customers were the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley believes Metcash’s food and food sales will drop by 3.8 percent in 2016, by 4.1 percent in 2017 and by 2.1 percent in 2018, so that its market share will drop from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent in 2020.
Last week, the manager of the leading investment fund and founder of Magellan Financial Group, Hamish Douglass, said at a business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash could "most likely lose in a decade".
Metcash has refused to respond publicly to Douglass' comments.
It is understood, however, that a member of the Metcash Board of Directors had contacted Douglass last week.
IGA’s market share has decreased since 2010 from 18 percent to 14 percent, and revenues from Metcash’s food and food business, which transfers products to around 1200 IGA retailers, have decreased by 43 percent since 2012. This reflects the decline in operations’ debt financing and the decline in sales.
However, the wholesaler is on its side, and has invested more than $150 million a year by dropping the prices of hundreds of products each week to the same level as Coles and Woolworths, helping IGA resellers to renovate their retail stores by adding more quickly to the retail market, as well as growing fresh produce.
Ian Morrice, CEO of Metcash, said the price cuts and upgrading of stores have increased appeal, and he hopes that wholesalers will return to the path of revenue growth in 2017, for the first time in four years.
Australian Tennis Association President Steve Healy Supports Thanasi Kokkinakis
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves more respect than criticism for his behavior
Thanasi Kokkinakis has suffered as a sidekick in a recent storm that has swarmed around his friend Nick Kyrgios. He deserves more honor than criticism for his own behavior, says Australian Tennis Federation President Steve Healy.
A younger member of a talented twin called "Special Ks" Kokkinakis was inadvertently exposed in a case where Kyrgios irritated Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
Shortly thereafter, in the Cincinnati shooting, the Chief Justice had to separate Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison twice, when Harrison declared, "Wawrinka should have hit Kyrgios, and I should have hit that cake."
Although Kokkinakis was last seen breaking down his yard after a cramp ruined his potential victory over Richard Gasquet at the US Open, Healy has been a staunch defender of Kokkinakis.
Right now, the young man is in Glasgow competing with Sam Groth from second place in the doubles with Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-final against Britain.
"I'm pretty strongly of the opinion that Thanasi has just been dragged into the ditch," Healy said.
“He broke his milestone by losing a cramp at the US Open, but he’s not the first player to break his milestone when he’s frustrated, and I know Thanas well enough to know he’s not proud of it.
But he has behaved very well, even in quite provocative situations at the US Open with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves praise.
He has a great team around him, he has a great family around him, and I think he has been treated a little harshly.
He is very mature for 19 years, he works hard, fits into the team and so on, and he has never had any problems with other players. He is appreciated in the dressing room, he practises solidly, is in good condition and is in good condition with his peers. He is quite calm and mature young man, me
Healy has also supported the decision not to include Kyrgyzstan in important games starting Friday describing this "joint decision" as a solution for everyone, but still supporting the Canberra return to the team's stable.
"We want the team to be fully focused on the games and not on all the polemics around [Kyrgios]," Healy said.
And Nick has risen really quickly, as for example Federer and Murray have pointed out, and he is growing up in public, and has made some terrible mistakes and deserves all the criticism he has received. However, we will also try to support him with this in order to get him out of the way, we will try to help him understand his actions.
European immigration crisis: Hungary declares state of emergency, closes borders, arrests immigrants
Hungary declared a state of emergency and closed its southern border against Serbia, arresting those who tried to enter the country illegally, with the aim of dampening the flow of migrants coming into the country.
There was chaos at the border as hundreds of migrants gathered in the neutral area, and the Serbian authorities reacted with shock.
The people who have fled the violence of their homelands have now set up their tents and settled indefinitely between the checkpoints of the two countries.
Frustration, however, increased.
While the police helicopter stood above them, the immigrants shouted "Open the border!" and shouted insults to the Hungarian riot police.
Some of them refused to eat and water to protest.
Serbia's foreign minister said it was "unacceptable" to accept the return of migrants from Hungary when more arrived from Macedonia and Greece.
"(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, not cause damage to civilians.
Talks with other countries and Brussels will be held in the coming days," Dacic said in Prague.
A mixed conflict on the Hungarian-Serbian border arose after a group of 28 nationalities failed to establish a common immigration policy at a controversial meeting in Brussels.
Ministers agreed on the allocation of responsibilities for 40,000 asylum-seekers who have now conquered Italy and Greece, and Ministers spoke hopefully about reaching a final agreement - next month or by the end of next year - on which EU countries will take up an additional 120,000 refugees, including the UN.
Germany’s Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria are calling for an additional EU summit next Tuesday to discuss the continent’s immigration crisis.
However, Hungary does not put its hopes on its neighbours or Brussels to act soon.
Tuesday's state of emergency in two southern areas gave the authorities greater powers to act in the crisis and allowed you to be closed and asylum cases accelerated.
Meanwhile, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that now that the fence on the Serbian border is ready, the country is also planning to set up a section of the spike-line fence on its border against Romania to stop the flood of migrants across the country.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prisoners had been recruited to complete the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become the biggest bottleneck and entry point for refugees to the European Union, many of whom are fleeing war from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has argued that most of the arrivals are economic refugees looking for a better life, and not those fleeing under the war who are entitled to protection - this view is strongly in conflict with other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws, which came into force at midnight in Hungary, now define an attempt to cross or damage a 4-metre (13-foot) spike fence built by the government on the southern border with Serbia as a crime, and include longer prison sentences for convicted people.
"Due to the situation caused by mass immigration, the Hungarian government is declaring a state of emergency," Zoltan Kovacs, a spokesman for the government, told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We are very clear about this: crossing the illegal border is a crime.
Parliament still has to formally approve the military position expected next week, but the Associated Press reporters at the border have already seen heavy-armed military personnel carrying vehicles and dogs for days.
Orban's national security adviser, Gyorgy Bakondi, said authorities had arrested 45 people as they tried to cross the border, as well as 15 who had already reached the country.
They got over by damaging the fence, are now in police custody, and are charged with violations as defined in the new laws.
The authorities are repairing the fence quickly.
Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven crossings at the border against Serbia on Tuesday morning after they sent a train car covered in a spike to close one of those crossings.
The main crossing point near the Hungarian town of Roszke was covered in chaos as Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container for handling people and crowds came in.
About 20 got in, but thousands were left out.
A group of immigrants blocked the main highways between Serbia and Hungary, saying they would refuse to eat and drink until they were allowed to enter Hungary.
2016 Elections: According to a National Poll, Hillary Clinton’s lead to Bernie Sanders has narrowed down
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to lead a two-digit run for the Democratic nomination, but Senator Bernie Sanders has arrested her.
Clinton now supports 47 percent of Democrats (down from 58 percent) and Sanders, second-placed, supports 27 percent (down from 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden has not yet announced whether he will join the presidential race, but he is in favour of 15% of the Democrats.
More than five months before the start of the pre-election, most Democrats say it is still too early to say that they would have decided who to vote for.
Clinton’s supporters, however, stand behind their own choice more tightly than the supporters of other candidates.
Clinton’s popularity has declined among several population groups since last month’s CBS News Poll, and at the same time, Sanders has risen somewhat.
Clinton is strongly at the forefront of women and moderates, but his leadership has narrowed.
His popularity with men has dropped significantly, and Sanders is only 5 percentage points behind.
Clinton’s lead among Democrats under the age of 50 has disappeared, and he is now on par with Sanders.
Clinton, however, clearly leads the way with older voters.
Last month, Clinton led Sanders with a double-digit number against the Liberals, but now Sanders leads this group by five percentage points.
About half of the country’s Democratic voters say they will support Clinton enthusiastically if he becomes a party candidate.
A quarter says they support him with certain reservations, and 15% would support him just because he is a candidate.
Six percent wouldn't support him at all.
It is not surprising that Clinton’s current supporters are very likely to be eager to support him.
Opinions are more confusing with those who do not currently support Clinton - only a quarter would support him enthusiastically.
While 48 percent of Democrats say they support Clinton enthusiastically, Republican leader Donald Trump says the same thing about fewer Republicans (35 percent).
When Clinton supporters were asked in an open question why they wanted her to be a candidate, the most popular answer was that she had the right experience (16%). After that, the most popular answers were that now is the right time for the female president (13%) and that she is the best candidate (10%).
Clinton supporters also mentioned his connection to Bill Clinton (9%).
The same opinions and the possibility of being elected were also mentioned.
Because the vice president influences a possible presidential nomination, 57 percent of Democrats would like to see him already in the race - even though a third disagrees.
When asked by Democrats who they would choose to nominate for a second party, Biden is the most popular choice.
More than half of Clinton’s supporters say they would choose Biden, who is much more popular than Sanders.
If Biden decides not to seek the Democratic nomination, Hilary Clinton's leadership in Sanders will grow; if Biden joins, the leadership will be 20 percentage points, but if he resigns, the number will be 30.
55% of Democrats believe Clinton has the best chance of winning the presidential election, but this figure has dropped from 78% last month.
At this scale, Biden remains far away, but the share of those who consider him the most voteable has grown.
When Democrats were asked what was the most important thing about the candidate, however, they raised their opinions ahead of the voter turnout.
Also last month, no Democratic candidate or possible candidate was considered to be an impossible candidate for these voters.
Democratic candidates, or potential candidates, do well in certain key issues among the voters of their party.
Most consider Clinton, Sanders, and Biden to be honest, reliable, and strong leaders.
Biden does best in the trio in honesty, while Clinton’s strength is leadership.
Thirty percent of Democrats say they don’t consider Clinton honest and trustworthy, which is twice as much as Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent say they don’t have an opinion on Sanders.
Democratic voters also generally believe that Clinton, Sanders and Biden agree ideologically.
Looking at all these things, about a quarter of Democrats say they don’t have an opinion on Sanders.
While Hillary Clinton’s use of her personal email address and server while she was Secretary of State still raises questions, most Democrats are satisfied with her explanation and say the matter did not affect their general opinion of her.
However, this is different when you look at America as a whole.
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with his explanation, and only about a third are satisfied.
The people’s opinions were divided in March shortly after the matter came to light.
Most Americans say that email polo has not influenced their overall opinion of Clinton, even though 36% say their opinion of him has deteriorated.
More than six out of ten Republicans say their opinion of Clinton has deteriorated.
Although Clinton's own party voters consider him honest and trustworthy, this is still a problem for him among all the registered voters. Only 32% consider him honest and trustworthy, and this figure has dropped by 8 percentage points since the last month.
62% of registered voters say they do not consider Clinton to be honest and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55 percent of registered voters across the country do not consider Trump to be honest and trustworthy.
Both Clinton and Trump are considered good leaders.
Of the six candidates involved in the study, Biden, Carson and Bush are considered the most honest.
Sanders is generally considered to be honest, but many don't have an opinion on him, just like Carson does.
The margin of error in the survey, which included 351 Democratic voters, is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson Approaches Donald Trump in National Enquiry
Ben Carson joins Donald Trump in the latest CBS News/New York Times poll
In the new poll, two candidates collected half of all votes, leaving the others to fight on foot.
Republican voters across the country are still strongly in favour of Trump, whose support has risen to 27% of the CBS poll released on Tuesday before last month’s Fox News poll.
At the same time, Carson jumped from 6 percent to 23 percent.
The survey also found that Carson is very good at different demographics and is being marginalized among Trump’s highly educated Republican voters.
The rest of the field has been left behind, except for Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, and Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker's support has fallen the most: from last month's 10 percent to the current 2 percent.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are in third place at 6%.
The margin of error in the sample of 376 Republican voters for this latest poll in September is <0x2B>/- 6%.
Last week’s CNN/ORC poll showed Carson was on the rise in polls: he has 19 percent support for Republicans, and Trump is ahead of him at 32 percent.
Also, according to the latest ABC News/Washington Post poll, Trump was significantly ahead of Carson.
With Carson’s popularity rising last week, Trump criticized the retired neurosurgeon in vain, even though Carso apologised for questioning Trump’s faith.
“We need energy,” Trump said during his campaign visit to Iowa on Saturday.
Five Brotherhood Members Accused of Death of First Year Student at Baruch College
Nearly two years after the student died in a fraternity symphony ceremony in the Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, the murder case has been brought against five people.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi fraternity at Baruch College, New York City, brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during the membership rite in September 2013, and then delayed his hospitalization, thus contributing to his death by police.
Authorities say Deng’s eyes were tied and his back was loaded with a 13-pound backpack full of sand, after which he was repeatedly tacked to the ground as he tried to walk through an ice field towards the target.
Eventually, Deng complained that his head hurts, after which he lost consciousness.
The members of the fraternity did not call the emergency number after Deng was turned, but according to the charges, they waited an hour before bringing him to the hospital, police say.
However, they had time to change Deng’s clothes, search the web for information about his symptoms, and contact the brotherhood’s national president Andy Meng to ask for advice, police chief Chris Wagner told a press conference.
“At this point, the members began to hide their ritual equipment and thus practically put the well-being of the brotherhood above Michael Deng,” said Chief of Police, Wagner.
Dengi couldn't get a warrant, and he died the next morning.
According to the Body Surveillance Protocol, Deng suffered repeated blows to the head, body, and travel of a dull object.
“Too many families have suffered fraternity beatings when at least one student has died as a result every year since 1970,” said Doug Fierberg, a lawyer representing Deng’s family.
The fraternities and their members must be held accountable, and this step of the authorities is important.
The Monroe County Grand Jury backed the first five members to be charged with third-degree murder.
Thirty-two other members of the fraternity, including Meng, are also charged with violent mutilation and criminal treason.
“We don’t want to hold individuals accountable, but if there is an organisation that has accepted the situation either formally or informally, they should also be held accountable,” Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College banned the fraternity and the national fraternity disconnected from the local branch.
This is what happens when the U.S. central bank raises interest rates.
Interest rate hikes are coming, and the market for rising prices is falling, bond yields are rising and the economy is facing a recession.
That's what we know.
What we do not know is how long this will take or how long it will take.
The past does not provide much help in terms of timing, specifically as regards the economy.
The arrival of the recession has lasted only 11 months, sometimes as long as 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the U.S. central bank in raising interest rates has often, though not always, been a determining factor in how the economy and financial assets react.
That is why officials at the U.S. Central Bank have so vigorously stressed that investors should not focus on it because interest rates are being raised, but mainly on the scale of the period leading to the normalisation of the situation.
There are indeed several variables in the equation.
In the end, however, the market participants may find that all interest rate-related haircuts have been exaggerated.
“The central bank’s first post-global economic crisis surge is inevitably interpreted in some circles to end the ‘bad money’ era,” said Julian Jessop, chief economic expert at Capital Economics, in a message to customers.
Instead, we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest rates to normal, albeit still low, to a level of shock that many seem to fear.
However, this does not mean that it has no effect.
Below is an overview of how some of the economic aspects will react in the light of past developments:
As the market has seen in the past about a month, waiting for interest rate hikes can make the situation unstable.
When the increase becomes a fact, the effect is not quite as dramatic.
"It seems that the return on capital tends to stop for 12-24 months after the first increase, which in turn may reflect a delay in monetary policy," Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study of what happens after the central bank's rise.
More specifically, over the last 35 years, the market has generally been strong, with an increase of about 14% when approaching the increase, 250 days after the increase, the situation is quite flat (average increase of 2.6%), and the normal state of the output is reached in a quarterly ratio of 500 days in a quarter in a quarter in a quarter in a quarter in a quarter in a quarter in a quarter in a quarter in a quarter in a quarter in a quarter in a quarter in a quarter in a quarter in the final.
According to Deutsche Bank, the impact on shares is usually clearer at a later stage of the growth cycle when returns begin to fall.
Recessions are part of economic life, but interest rates often contribute to their income.
In the current situation, the central bank is faced with certain challenges that have not existed before and which can accelerate the recession.
This is particularly the gross domestic product, which will be the lowest level of all time before the central bank's interest rate purchase.
According to Deutsche Bank, in 118 increases since 1950, the nominal annual GDP has only been less than 4,5 per cent twice.
Although the figure was 3.6 percent in the second quarter of 2015, few believe it will remain, as the third quarter has progressed by 1.5 percent, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta.
Raising interest rates in such a fragile economy can be risky and raise the question of whether “this time is different,” Deutsche Bank said.
Market participants have been preparing for a year-round increase in the central bank, and everyone is looking forward to this week’s meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economic experts believe that the Committee can accept the increase at this meeting, futures trading predicts only a 25% probability.
“Our research shows that since 1950, all of the lifting cycles have so far been present in supercycles with increasing leverage, where GDP has surpassed its pre-recession peak very quickly after recovery has begun,” the report says.
In contrast, there has now been an exceptionally slow recovery from the recession, which has been the worst of the observational season.
In the current cycle, the central bank has been waiting the longest since the end of the last recession: the record has been 35 months, and it is now the 74th month.
Fixed returns have also been volatile in anticipation of the market’s interest rate hike, and the model resembles some observations made on capital.
The main difference is that when a central bank changes its line, its effects appear more quickly in bonds than in shares.
The direction of bond yields appears to change immediately with the first increase/cutting of the cycle.
At the end of the maturity cycle, the return on bonds will immediately fall,” Deutsche Bank said.
Charles Schwab strategists believe that raising interest rates leads to convergence of yields on longer and shorter-term bonds, thus balancing the yield curve.
High-performing bonds often yield better in such a situation, although “we are still cautious about looking for a return,” said Kathy Jones, a fixed-performing analyst at Schwab.
Surprisingly, Jones believes that the market has already adapted to the central bank’s line yields.
“In addition to the strength of the dollar and the drop in inflation expectations, there are several signs that the market has adapted to the prospects of a tighter monetary policy,” he wrote.
Short-term interest rates are high, the yield curve is more stable, credit margins have increased and instability has increased - all of these are characteristic of the market when the central bank has tightened its line-up.
In general, companies whose business is mainly based in the United States will win as interest rates rise and local products become more attractive.
Multinational companies with a lot of debt are getting worse when the rise in dollar value makes their products more expensive on the world market and their debt becomes more expensive than they have financing.
"History shows that 'quality' stocks are generally more profitable in the three months following the first interest rate," Goldman Sachs analysts said in their report.
Undertakings with strong turnover exceeded weak turnover by an average of five percentage points after increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004.
Companies with high capital returns and low volatility stocks performed better than lower-quality companies, with the above-mentioned average of 4 (percent) and the latter of 3 (percent).
Blame is going to be a big problem.
Those companies that have a lot of variable-rate debt are losing the most, Goldman said.
Outside of stock market speculation, consumers also have the opportunity to benefit from the dollar’s rise in value.
Sparers can also make a profit with higher earnings, although experts disagree about how quickly the impact feels.
BBC Radio is a copy of Classic FM, MP Andrew Bingham says
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham Accuses Channel of 'Recognition'
He argues that its separation from a commercial competitor is becoming increasingly difficult
In addition, he addressed the BBC Music Awards saying that they only toured the Brit Awards.
MP Damien Collins criticised The Voice, saying it was not original either.
BBC Radio 3 is "modifying" into Classic FM, claiming a leading MP, adding to the production company's pressure to prove it's doing something that commercial production companies aren't doing.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told BBC leaders that the public service radio channel appeared to be "publicizing" its content, and that it is increasingly difficult to distinguish from a commercial competitor.
“It seems that Radio 3 — I don’t want to use the term ‘public awareness’ — is turning into Classic FM,” he said.
He also took on the BBC Music Awards award, which was launched in December last year.
“The BBC Music Awards launched last year only seem to be in the Brit Awards industry under a different name.
So if you’re trying to do something different, here are two examples that I can directly remember when you’re actually just copying something that’s already on the market,” Bingham said.
The head of the BBC disputed the charges, arguing that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial competitor in terms of live music and information sharing to the public.
Radio 3 teaches things about classical music that I can’t learn from anywhere else.
Its commitment to live music and music is, in fact, first class.
“In addition, I think it’s really important that Radio 3 is committed to finding new music and ordering new works,” he said.
Earlier this year, the head of BBC Radio 3, Alan Davey, claimed that the channel needs to do more work than before to reach the audience because the British know less about classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only part of the BBC's offer, which was criticized for entering the toes of commercial competitors during the hearing of the Committee on Culture, Media and Sport.
Tory MP Damien Collins criticised The Voice, a music competition that the BBC bought from Dutch production company Talpa Media for an estimated <0xC2><0xA3>22 million.
Do you understand why this program is often discussed because it is not original and it is not in any way distinctive?
Lord Hall claimed that this BBC1 program, featuring the star judges Paloma Faith and Boy George, was produced "in the style of the BBC".
He added that he wants the production company to "find success inside their own house" the next time it starts the entertainment series.
However, he did not agree to prevent the production of future seasons of The Voice, or to order that the money of licensees be used for other entertainment formats.
Online sales so far rose the least in August, Black Friday may be the reason
Online sales increased by 7% in the first three months of 2015
Last month there was a slight increase since the beginning of the statistics in 2000.
Three years ago, online sales confirmed the use of mobile devices to make purchases
Experts believe that November’s Black Friday could curb consumption
The making of virtual purchases has grown tremendously over the past decade and has transformed many of Britain’s shopping streets into ghost cities.
However, experts say that there are now signs of a levelling of online sales in the air, with the latest figures showing only a 7% increase in the first quarter of 2015.
In August, total consumption increased the least since the beginning of the statistics in 2000: only a 5% increase from last year.
Experts say there are signs of a levelling of online sales in the air, with the latest figures showing only a 7% increase in the first quarter of 2015.
“If we look at the growth levels of previous years and go back to 2000, it was clear that the situation would rationalize over time,” Andy Mulcahy, the JMRG sales index provider, told the Guardian.
He explained that three years ago online sales strengthened when buyers began using their mobile phones to make purchases.
It meant that more people were shopping online, and that they could be done in different environments, such as on the couch.
But now it's leveling, and (growth) can count.
The Black Friday phenomenon imported from the United States has been seen as one of the reasons behind the slowing trades.
Experts believe that consumers will be restrained from making purchases before the last Friday of November.
Last year, on average, five times as many buyers were roaming their computers to grab stores by knocking down the websites of many merchants.
Experts believe that Black Friday, which led buyers to argue over the findings, can restrain the making of purchases
A study published by the British Retail Consortium found that only about one in five pounds was spent online.
For certain products, such as televisions and washing machines, more than a third of purchases are now made from online stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of using street fashion chains.
Moslems bury dead in Mecca lift car accident, sanctions against Bin Laden family
Muslims carried 29 dead bodies through the streets during the first funerals in Mecca
Saudi Arabia has partially accused of collapsing building giant Saudi Binladin Group
The Ministry of Health said a total of 394 people were also injured when the cranial cavity collapsed.
29 The dead were carried through the streets, when hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury them, and the victims died when the crocodile collapsed in the mosque of Mecca.
Mainly dressed in white, the deceased filled the path to honor the first of the dead who made their last trip to the cemetery of Al-Moaisem.
The sad passage passed the holy place, where only a few days ago a crook fell through the roof of the mosque and knocked down worshipers.
The bodies were released for burial when the King of Saudi Arabia confirmed Bin Laden's family building group guilty of a disaster that also injured 394 people.
29 of the worshippers killed in the Meka Grand Mosque were transported through the streets
Among the dead was the father of four children, Qasim Akram from Bolton, Manchester, who was on his first pilgrimage when the cranial cucumber collapsed.
Akram had been at the Grand Mosque with his parents before the beginning of the annual Hajj pilgrimage.
The Saudi authorities have already vowed that the hajj will continue in Mecca, with thousands arriving in the city constantly.
Today King Salman stated that Binladin Group should not have left the crane up when it was not in use.
In an Arabic-language version published by the state-led Saudi Press Agency, the Binladin Group was said to be partly responsible for the collapse.
The news agency’s English-language service did not mention this detail, but it said that the company’s executives are not allowed to travel abroad.
Earlier this week, Salman vowed to find out what caused the shovels to fall into the courtyard of the Grand Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims had gathered before the hajj pilgrimage later this month.
The Binladin Group has not published any announcements about the collapse of the calamity, and its representatives have not been arrested for comment.
The Royal Decree also accused the company of not using up-to-date safeguards and of not cooperating with meteorological authorities.
There are dozens of lifting cucumbers around the Meka Grand Mosque, which are part of a huge building belt led by Binladin Group.
Binladin’s family has been close to the Saudi ruling family for decades, and it is leading major construction projects.
Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was a rebel son banned by his family in the 1990s.
The robbery took place in windy and rainy weather just days before millions arrive in the kingdom for a pilgrimage that every capable Muslim must do at least once in his or her life.
Authorities say 158 people are still in the hospital.
The authorities ordered a million riyals (174,000 pounds) to be paid to the owners of the deceased and to the permanently injured.
The other injured will receive half of this amount.
B&Q boss says Eastern European low-cost workers are behind in popularity
The British are increasingly using the services of assistants, says Veronique Laury
The number of professionals coming from Eastern Europe is behind the rise
As a result, Screwfix stores for professionals will open 200 more
Kingfisher to close 60 B&Q stores across the country
Written by Rupert Steiner, the city's chief correspondent for the Daily Mail
The British are said to give up vassals and paint pens and prefer to hire skilled Eastern European workers to do home improvement work.
It seems that if you are handsome with a hammer or a hammer to paint the walls, you are now in the minority.
The British are increasingly hiring helpers to do their own homework, says the head of the company behind B&Q.
Veronique Laury, the new CEO of Kingfisher, who owns the home refurbishment chain, said that the popularity lies behind the number of skilled workers coming from Eastern Europe and the fact that they offer their services at a discounted price.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open 200 new Screwfix stores for workers and close 60 B&Q stores.
Laury said she wants more women to work in B&Q stores because eight out of the ten purchase decisions made in stores are made by the most beautiful sex.
Today, most of the staff are men.
He said that changes in the population must be taken into account: today there are more one woman's economies where more housekeeping is done than before.
Laury said: “Most of the staff in our stores are still men.
We need to find a better balance. We need to find a better balance.
However, half of our customers are women, and 80% of product purchase decisions are made by women.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process.”
Laury is one of only five women to lead the UK’s leading FTSE100 index. She has rebuilt her management team with as many male and female males.
Kingfisher is almost the only company in the group with just 50 percent of women, including its CEO and Chief Financial Officer.
Laury said, "This was a conscious decision - difference is an important thing here.
It has not been difficult to find good women in the leadership team.”
Kingfisher reported a drop in both its six-month earnings and sales after the group took on the cost of closing stores.
As a result of the trend, Kingfisher, which owns Screwfix and B&Q stores, is opening 200 new businesses.
The government of the three aces decided to resort to mandatory legislation to save the country’s economy.
The visible effects have been achieved quite quickly.
The sharp head of the SAK and other employers’ centres began to coerce at the same time, and as a result, the country will stand on Friday due to a broad public outcry by workers.
A lot of people think it makes sense, too.
I wonder if it’s worth a strike when it’s not going well.
There is even a resistance movement.
More than 50,000 people have already visited the Internet to announce that they are not going to participate in the statement but going to work.
In the old days of good consensus, that would have been impossible.
Of course, there was no internet to protest, but openly declaring yourself a criminal would have been a small political suicide of a human being.
The protest of a few tens of thousands of million-member trade unions does not take much time, but it gives them a reason to think.
The role of the trade union movement is no longer as clear as it was 20 years ago.
Not everyone knows the goals of the movement, the values have changed.
From the point of view of the interest of the Ay-movement’s activities, the government’s harsh solutions can also be seen as a direct gift from the sky.
When things have seemed to roll on their own weight for years, now the unions finally come to the point, namely, the rights of the worker to defend, visibly and properly.
Thus, the government may be willing to imprison the role of the ay movement, when membership in a trade union may be seen as more necessary than before.
Whatever the actions of the organisations may be, it is a shame that Friday’s statement of intent would somehow stop Finland.
Yes, Finland has stopped for a long time.
Industrial production, for example, has fallen for 31 months in a row.
Gross domestic product continues to decline and unemployment is on the rise.
These things are supposed to force everyone's head.
Hard savings for Lappeenranta University: 8.5 million savings aiming to reduce staff by 130
Lappeenranta University of Technology is launching a savings round aimed at reducing costs by a total of 8.5 million euros.
As a part of the savings, the university is launching joint consultations for all staff, with a savings target of 6.5 million annually.
In practice, this means a reduction of about 130 employees.
In addition to the other activities, the aim is to save two million.
The CAP negotiations are based on the 2016 budget, which forecasts that the actual activity will be 8.5 million deficits.
This is also affected by the government’s budget cuts.
In this fiscal year, the university is making about 2.6 million deficit results.
Expenses will increase slightly next year, but at the same time the funding from the Ministry will decrease by 2 million and other funding by <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.2 million.
The total budget of the university is about 85 million euros, so the goal of saving is ten percent of the entire budget.
The interaction between massive cuts in teaching and research and a reduction in corporate funding is very important for our university, says Rector Anneli Pauli in the University’s press release.
Before the summer, the effects of the cuts seemed even more moderate, but now the reduction in supplementary funding appears in new proportions.
Negotiations with the trustees will begin next Tuesday and will last for six weeks as prescribed by law.
Yle: Onnibus wants Finland on the railways
The owner of Onnibus, Sir Brian Souter, told Yle that the company is also targeting rail transport in Finland.
I am very interested in joining the Finnish rail network.
My stagecoach company is one of the largest rail companies in the UK, says Souter.
Rail transport is to be opened up gradually to competition.
The first is in turn the local traffic of the capital region in 2017-2018.
After the close-up, there is long-distance traffic.
Souter says he's already approaching the Department of Transportation.
According to Yle, Onnibus’ plans are welcomed at the Ministry of Transport.
At least Transdev (formerly Veolia), which also has bus transport in Finland and rail transport in other parts of Europe, has reported on other international companies interested in rail transport.
The U.S. Central Bank must decide on interest rates.
The rest of the world is watching the sidelines as the U.S. central bank meets for two days on Wednesday and Thursday to make a critical decision on whether to raise interest rates for the first time in almost a decade.
When Reuters surveyed 80 economists, just over half of those who still believed last week that the central bank would raise interest rates, now believe that the situation is still not resolved and the interest rates are kept at the current level of 0-0.25 percent.
This is a historic event, as it has been seven years since the central bank cut interest rates to zero.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where the central bank has the opportunity to exit the zero level and start normalising interest rates," said Angel Ubide, senior fellow of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The U.S. economy has worked relatively well, and the recovery has brought trillions of dollars into the balance sheet and created little inflation.
However, the central bank cannot ignore the less-pink global outlook.
It has warned the market that they should be ready for a raise, but the signs also indicate that they believe that the odds are against the raise.
The decision will be announced on Thursday at 8 p.m. (CET).
Delta State University Shooter Leaves Message of Apology
After shooting his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - before shooting his colleagues later that day - Shannon Lamb wrote a message saying he was "sorry" about the first murder and hoped "that he could cancel it," authorities said on Tuesday.
Police in Gautier, Mississippi, said a professor of geography and social sciences at Delta State University, Lamb, called the emergency number at about 10 a.m.
On Monday, he said he shot and killed someone.
Lamb told the respondent that the police had to send police to his home.
He said he "killed his wife last night" and also mentioned that there is a "sweet dog" in the house that "doesn't bother anyone" but is probably upset.
The police asked the caller his name, but he didn't tell them.
Lamb didn't give an explanation for the shooting.
When the police arrived, they found the body of 41-year-old Amy Prentiss and a message written by 45-year-old Lamb: “I’m so sorry that I could cancel it.
I loved Amy and she was the only person who ever loved me.
After writing a message, Lamb drove nearly 500 miles to Delta State, where he killed history teacher Ethan Schmidt, before finally killing himself late Monday when police surrounded him.
William LaForge, the university's principal, said that there was no conflict between Lamb and Schmidt in his knowledge, but that "there was clearly something in Lamb's mind."
Authorities said on Tuesday that despite allegations released on Monday that Lamb believed Prentiss had been in relation to Schmidt, there was "no law information or evidence" of any kind of "triangle drama".
Shawn O'Steen said she had been married to Prentiss for about seven years and described her as a "good man".
The couple divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends.
O'Steen said he and Prentiss had a 19-year-old daughter who is "disturbed".
O'Steen said Prentiss and her daughters were "sometimes best friends".
According to Linsday Knowles, Prentiss worked online from home, and according to the Sun Herald, Knowles was a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles said that Prentiss, who had a dog named Lightning, had been dating Lamb for about three years.
“He always wanted to help other people,” Knowles said.
Police said Lamb had called his relatives somewhere on Monday to tell them that "he's not going to jail."
When police reached Lamb's Highway 1 near Greenville later that night, Lamb stopped his car at the side of the road, left it behind, and ran into the woods where he shot himself.
Lamb argued about the education of Delta State in the spring of 2015, according to a CV found on the university’s website.
The Stars Who Lost Their Attraction
The actor (left), pictured with his son Redmond (right), has been tough in recent years.
In 2001, she was diagnosed with leukemia, and in 2009, her long-term partner, Farrah Fawcett, died of cancer.
According to rumors, he has also had drug problems, and in 2008 he was arrested for possession of drugs.
All of these things really require their taxes.
Manchester United's Luke Shaw has been out for months due to double murder
Luke Shaw was doubled in his right leg when he lost Manchester United to PSV Eindhoven in a Champions League match.
Although the defender was in tears and is out for at least six months, Louis van Gaal hopes that Shaw could still play this season.
The injury was caused by Héctor Moreno's unscathed back in the 15th minute after 20-year-old Shaw crashed into the PSV.
She was treated on the field for 9 minutes and had to be given oxygen before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He has a double fracture in his leg and he is now in the hospital."
He'll be transferred tomorrow, or maybe the day after, and then cut off in Manchester.
This is terrible. The boy comes to Manchester United at the age of 18, suffers difficulties and then plays brilliantly, and that's what happens now.
When I was in the dressing room, he had an oxygen mask on.
She was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but a double break takes at least six months, and he doesn't play in the block stage.
I hope he will be able to play this season.
Moreno seemed lucky when he got either a red card and a penalty shot.
The referee, Nicola Rizzoli, did not punish a Mexican player.
Van Gaal suggested that the Italian official was mistaken.
You can judge the situation yourself by saying that it was a penalty shot and a red card.
It was really bad with two legs.
Shaw tweeted, “Thank you for all your messages, words are not enough to tell me how disappointed I am, my recovery begins now, I will come back stronger.”

The English defender has an additional incentive to recover from the European Championships in France next June.
PSV coach Phillip Cocu said, "It's a really bad injury."
If a player gets out because of such an injury, everyone is very sad.
The purpose of our players is never to offend an opponent.
Moreno's leg broke when he played for Mexico's Van Gaal team against the Netherlands in the 2014 World Cup.
"Moreno takes this seriously because it's not meant to hurt the opponent, and when he hears that the injury is really bad, it's a bad thing," Cocu said.
I didn’t see it in that situation.
The only thing I saw was a ball that was going in a different direction, so it looked like he [Moreno] had touched it, but I didn’t see Luke’s back.
Moreno told SBS6: "I know how it feels, I know how difficult this can be.
I feel terrible about this, I'm so sorry."
PSV’s Andrés Guardado was also taken to hospital after being challenged by Chris Smalling.
David Cameron knows Lorax better, doesn't he?
Every parent soon learns one thing: if your child loves a book, it won’t take long before it almost learns from the outside.
Unless you're David Cameron.
When the holiday childcare service asked the prime minister about his favorite children's book, he chose Dr. Seuss's The Lorax, an environmental story published in 1971.
The choice was difficult, Cameron wrote in a message posted on SuperCamps' website and continued: "Funny, moving, creative and contains a strong message. I enjoyed reading this book for my children because it always feels like we've found a picture or a message that we've never seen before."
All this is true, but the next track, in which Cameron supposedly describes the story of the book, is a summary of the 2012 film version, with new characters and details added to the rather short original text.
"In the city of Tarville within the walls, where all nature has been lost and even the air is a commodity, Ted's son hopes to win over the heart of the girl of his dreams by fulfilling Audrey's desire to see the real tree," the text says, and describes the love story of the song Themel, which Dr. Right died in 1991.
If this is not yet suspect enough, Cameron's text sounds locally as if it had been taken from the Lorax film's storyline on the Internet Movie Database, which begins as follows: "In the city of Tarville, a canopy of a canopy, where everything is artificial and even airborne."
Considering that Cameron is a publicly active parent, it seems unlikely that he would be so unfamiliar with the story of the book. In it a young, anonymous son hears how the local nature has destroyed a greedy, barking tree from every tree."
Such a relatively invisible PR task is probably outsourced to an assistant who has apparently never read the book 20 times in a row to a child.
The prime minister's spokesperson said the text may have come from Cameron's constituency office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was received from Cameron's staff, but did not comment on the matter at the time.
Adam Lyth was clearly in danger of being away from the England team, but it was still a tough place
“Playing against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a tough task, but when you see what kind of team England have chosen for the tour, I don’t think a repeat of the last 3-0 series loss is likely.
I wouldn't rule out a guest win from the bills.
Alastair Cook’s half may have been less experienced than the team three years ago, but it has good rounders and the team’s mindset is strong: they don’t have scars from 2012, just young positivity.
Moeen Ali develops in his spins and Adil Rashid is an attacking option, although there is an unknown factor at this level.
Related: Adam Lyth dropped from England cricket team, will be replaced by Alex Hales
“The decision to leave Adam Lyth is understandably difficult for me to analyze because I am his head coach at Yorkshire.
His seven games have been good against attackers in challenging conditions, and the simple but unfortunate truth is that cricketers are being judged based on their results.
For example, there was no uncertainty about Joe Root’s choice before the announcement, because, as I’ve said before, players are the best decision makers.
About a hundred more points, and Lyth's season on the team could have continued, but he was responsible for his own fate.
Hopefully, if he gets more runs to Yorkshire, there's a second chance.
English head coach Trevor Bayliss praised Lyth’s attitude even when he didn’t perform as well as he could, and that doesn’t surprise me. Lyth is a team player above all.
It's hard to answer the question of how long a striker gets to leave a trace.
Lyth was elected to the national team seven times, like Sam Robson before him, while Nick Compton was elected nine times.
Only Compton was given the opportunity to play at home as well as on the guests.
The only reason for the complaint is that England chose Jonathan Trott first for the Caribbean when Lyth was in top condition, but that lost opportunity is now the past.
Alex Hales is coming along, and there's a striker I appreciate.
As a cricketer, he has something we saw in Yorkshire early this season when he scored 236 points against us at Trent Bridge.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as the others before him, but this certainly depends on the composition of the team in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of Moeen in a punching hole next to Cook has been bolted, so there's an extra feeder on the field, but there's four quicks, and I'm not against that.
I don't understand why no striker could hit there, and this left-handed guy has already proven to be a pretty cricketer.
Moeen may not have done his job in his county of Worcestershire, but he's the three of them and it doesn't make much difference.
My old teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 games in his first hurdle before moving on to the opening in 2001.
He immediately scored three hundred points and could not remember the past.
Zafar Ansari will come to the team as a robber, and the little I’ve been doing with him, he feels very impressive as a young man.
People can look at his unfinished stats - hitting an average of 31, with a ball of 35 - and think it's a gamble, but there aren't too many feeders available and voters chose young people.
He learns a lot on this tour.
Outside of the team, England seems to have a few hard additions to the coaching side.
The appointment of Sri Lankan striker Mahela Jayawardene as a consultant for the games may prove to be a genius emblem.
He is one of the most enjoyable guys in the game, and brings with him a huge amount of experience, because he has done everything in all situations and against all kinds of attacks.
Paul Collingwood gets involved in the white ball games, bringing both energy and merciless fading.
I’ve always thought that he was born to be involved in international cricket, whether it’s playing or coaching, and he has the same ugliness to use as Mahela.
Sometimes new sounds in the locker room can refresh the team, even if their message is the same as before.
Colly’s teammate, Ben Stokes, is rested in a one-day draw, Root was given a similar break against Australia, and I have no problem with that at least.
While not everyone agrees, coaches and selectors do not make schedules.
And you have to remember that just like the players, their work depends on the results.
Such decisions are never made on the lightest basis.
Britain’s exit from the EU (Brexit) could take profits if the economy is in trouble in 2017
David Cameron’s half-hearted renegotiation strategies to hold Britain in the EU are becoming increasingly problematic day by day, even if the heartfelt Jeremy “Is it yes or no?” Corbyn’s choice to lead the Labour Party or as a trade unionist to the European Union.
Foreigners also have their own Corbyns and Nigel Faragens.
The European diplomatic blood recently explained that because the EU is so deeply in a variety of crises, not all of which are its own faults, some Member States are tired of Britain’s self-centered agenda, which is full of the most dissenting concessions and non-distracting, non-disagreemental agreements.
At its annual meeting in Brighton, the trade unions’ central organisation decided that it would not want them either if they undermined social protection.
We could even call it Dave and George's selfie agenda.
The Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance will be late for summits or bilateral meetings held in foreign capitals, take a picture of themselves in front of a famous local monument, either with or without a local eyewitness, and then come home and say that they will win.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants to look outside the UK's EU tent - 'Don't leave us alone with France', they say from Berlin - suggests that the shortest-sighted ministers and officials in certain capitals are now at a point where we are not in the middle of it.
German conservative and moderate Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave her action before it goes to waste in the same way that happened to the late Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
France’s Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande will be re-elected or replaced in 2017.
He's a fading force, too.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right-wing government, Spain a left-wing one.
It is difficult to see these countries sacrifice themselves on behalf of selfie Brits, when their energy should rather be directed towards preventing Scotland from leaving the United Kingdom - they do not want it either because of similar separatist tendencies.
So, my friend suggests, some of these ministers may even deliberately plan to make useless comments in the Scottish National Party style during the 2017 UK referendum campaign to speed up the Brexit process.
"The renegotiations were a matter of order" and "The renegotiations were of no importance to Britain."
Europeans have had a keen experience of how greedy the Fleet Street press can be and how skeptical the EU press is, what they were not at the time of the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn, when our membership, which began in 1973, was confirmed at a ratio of 2:1.
They can be vaguely recalled Boris Johnson, the biggest Euro-opportunist who made a name for himself by writing “the EU’s straight bananas” as a Brussels correspondent in the early 1990s.
Ed Miliband may have been a fool, but at least he knew who his enemies were.
They included a handful of tax evaders, foreigners who hacked their phones, and individuals who had their registered office elsewhere and who own most of our large newspapers.
Tony Blair actually thought the same about them, but he realized that if you’re in a cage with a shiny gorilla, you have to give up bananas because of distractions, unless you want to be on that gorilla’s lunch list and later on even dinner.
In fact, Miliband was more Blair than Blair himself, in terms of opposing Cameron's renegotiation, because Bair had agreed to the principle behind the rejected EU Constitution, which was rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, thus giving Blair the right to vote.
The press never forgave him, either.
But the nice Jeremy Corbyn, who kindly clapped my back at the Westminster House on Monday (I told him he didn’t have time to waste on me), would seem at risk of taking Neil Kinnock’s 80s again and boycotting both Murdoch’s strategy.
While it may take time, he still has to develop a consistent strategy to keep in touch with the media, not with me, but without a doubt with Andrew Marri, whose BBC correspondent Corbyn left on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position in Europe is, to put it nicely, evolving.
He said he would like us to remain in the reformed EU.
Well, most of the people of the UK Independence Party, outside of Ukip’s wartime insurgency and the Conservative Party’s most arrogant nationalists, can certainly stand behind this view.
Hilary "Benn, but not Benn-fan" Benn said so on both radio and television this week, when her internal partisan would have wanted to admit that Corbyn's choice to nominate Mr. John McDonnell as shadow government finance minister was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 70’s when his father was on TV trying to be disloyal to his colleagues in the Labour Party’s government without going so far as to lose his seat in government.
Hilary's coatings were more attractive.
But the fight to stay in “anywhere situation” — Benn’s statement — was not what McDonnell said, and ultimately not what Corbyn told the chiefs and MPs at a private meeting on Monday night.
Whatever the non-hierarchical, emotional and personal image that Corbyn wants to convey (remember that he even touched me), the discipline of communication is important in the era of 24-hour television, and especially in social media circles, which is a welcome platform for growth.
As Mr McDonnell has said, it is only fair not to give Cameron a free ticket to Europe by allowing him to see the support of the Labour Party in the referendum campaign as self-evident.
At least Simon Jenkins thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbyn’s basic reversal of EU membership (and in line with their Benn-spiritually regulated economy and anti-capitalist past) is no longer just a difficult-to-reach debate in the minds of left-wing thinkers who have little to-do knowledge.
As for his dualism with regard to NATO (Tom Watson is convinced that Corby is not campaigning to surrender), foreign diplomats just have to try to explain it to their bosses.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital (they also have suspicious voters) on concessions to Britain, when it can be totally in vain?
The United States is already somewhat disappointed by the British's weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with the cost-cutting Conservative government in power, as I was reminded at the start of the British Influence Security Forum on Monday.
Experts Criticize Public Health England’s E-Cigarette Assessment
Researchers have said that the state-funded agency’s claim that electric cigarettes are 95% less harmful than traditional cigarettes originated from a meeting of 12 people, some of whom had connections to the tobacco industry.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined the Lancet in their report on electric cigarettes using evidence from Public Health England (PHE).
PHE published this "pillar" report last month, describing it as a "comprehensive review of evidence".
However, several researchers have questioned the sustainability of the data and referred to links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
The medical journal Lancet last month published a headline attacking the “exceptional huter base” of the PHE Directorate-General’s decision.
Two other researchers at the BMJ have wondered whether the claims are “built on a rock or on sand.”
Martin McKee, professor of public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine in Europe, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, say: “The main principle of national health is that practices must be based on proven effectiveness.”
They say the public expects PHE’s claim that “in the current best estimate, e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than traditional tobaccos” is based on a detailed assessment and modeling of the evidence.
In fact, it comes from a 12-person meeting that developed a multi-criteria decision-making model (MCDA) to synthesize their opinion on the harms associated with various nicotine-containing products, and the results of this meeting were consolidated into the study.
McKee and Capewell say one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO is said to have previously received funding from Bristish American Tobacco for independent research.
He also supported BAT’s public health mandates in the sustainability report, they say.
One of the 12 people at the meeting said they had received funding from the manufacturer of e-cigarettes, but not the funding he was told had previously been received by tobacco company Philip Morris International, they add.
The selection criteria for the panel members are not disclosed, but the panel includes a number of well-known supporters of e-cigarettes, some of whom also report that they have received funding from the research sector.
The others who were there are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
The Tobacco Director of PHE also attended the meeting.
The study, produced by the group, "many say" that there is a lack of "unquestionable evidence regarding the disadvantages of most products and most of the criteria," McKee and Capewell write.
However, none of these links or restrictions are mentioned in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell say PHE's claims that "there is no evidence so far that e-cigarettes act as a route to smoking in children or non-smokers" are premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of health and well-being at PHE, says that the allegations made at BMJ have been answered earlier.
He says, "Electric rooms are much less harmful than combustion."
Half of all people who burn their lives die from addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks posed by e-cigarettes are relatively small, but we need to continue to investigate the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public about what the evidence shows and what it does not, especially when there is so much public ignorance about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people die each year from smoking-related illness, and smoking costs the NHS <0xC2><0xA3>2 billion a year.
By explaining the current evidence - i.e. even though electric cigarettes are not risk-free, their disadvantages are only a fraction of the disadvantages of traditional tobacco - we are fulfilling our national responsibilities.
BBC Should Give Up EastEnders, Former Channel 4 Director Says
Former Channel 4 president Luke Johnson has said that the BBC should stop broadcasting programs like EastEnders or The Voice, and that commercial competitors would "switch anything" from hits such as this soap series on Albert Square, for example.
Johnson said the license fees should only be used to make programs that other broadcasters in the UK do not.
He criticised the BBC for putting public-service programs, which are likely to have a smaller audience, into difficult broadcasting times against the most viewed programs by competitors and on channels such as BBC4.
After the BBC CEO Tony Hall said the company wanted to work more closely with other organizations, Johnson said that during his time on Channel 4, he was pushing for six years to create a relationship with the BBC, in vain.
“I don’t understand the idea that the BBC is producing and broadcasting programs that are clearly suitable for non-subsidized competitors,” Johnson told the upper chamber’s communications committee as part of its research into the future of the BBC.
If the pledge is respected - and I am not sure that it would be a good idea for this message or in the long term - it should at least limit its production to programmes that others do not make and produce.
The Voice will be sent to the main broadcast time because it wants to collect as much support as possible for the future.
The idea that no one else would show the show is a joke, it’s ridiculous, it’s clearly nonsense.
Johnson said: “I don’t understand why a regressive tax should be funded by programs that could also be funded without state aid.
The Voice is one such and EastEnders is the other, undeniably carried out inside the house.
In other words, the other channels would give you anything.
I don't understand how it's about public service broadcasting.
“I don’t think that would weaken the BBC at all.”
Channel 4’s lead series entrepreneur Johnson said the BBC is guilty of hunting viewers “for the purposes of the people working there, and because they believe it’s the best way to achieve long-term support.”
He commented on the BBC's most popular series reminiscent of the comments of former Sky director Tony Ball, who used his 2003 MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh to suggest that the BBC sell series such as EastEnders.
Johnson said that the BBC's smaller public service programs "go to BBC4, where the number of viewers can often not be measured, but the BBC thus fulfills its responsibilities and can then, when defending the <0xC2><0xA3>4 billion pledge revenues, hypocritically state that 'of course' programs do, but we know all this.
They put them in a place where no one will ever see them.
Speaking about the pledge, Johnson told the committee: “I challenge you to look for a more regressive system in who gets the most out of it.
Of course you all think, we all think that for 150 pounds a year you get a lot of money, but I don't know if that's true for those people who spend 150 pounds a lot of money because they don't use the BBC much.
Former Sky and Channel 5 director David Elstein, who also testified to the committee on Tuesday, said the BBC should re-evaluate its mission during Reith's "to inform, educate and entertain".
He said that only a small part of the BBC's production is currently classified as education - he said the figures are 1% of TV production and 0.1% of radio - and that it should model on Australian and Canadian public radios and change the role to "inform, enlighten and entertain".
As for partnership issues, Elstein said the BBC should focus more on events such as Proms concerts, which he says are only shown on television, and team up with commercial companies so that they can all be viewed online.
"Sound Genetics" enables the control of brain cells through sound waves
The video shows how the sock cams change direction as soon as the sound pulse hits them.
Scientists have bred worms that have genetically modified nervous systems so that they can be controlled by sound waves.
Small socks change direction as soon as they are hit by a sound pulse that is too high to be heard by the human ear.
The pulses work by switching on genetically modified motion nerve cells with ultrasound-reacting membrane channels.
Related: Researchers Read and Write Brain Activity with Light <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
The researchers said that worms demonstrate the functionality of a new method called audiogenetics, in which ultrasound can be used to activate certain brain, heart and muscle cells from outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a Salk Institute researcher in La Jolla, California, told The Guardian that the method may one day replace deep-brain stimulation, an invasive measure that conducts electrical impulses into the human brain to treat Parkinson’s disease.
Succulents do not normally respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that when surrounded by a fluid with microscopic small bubbles, the situation changed.
He noticed that the bubbles were amplifying ultrasound waves that then pass into the worms.
Reinforced ultrasonic waves affect the TRP-4 ion channels, the structures found in the cell membranes of some worms.
The sound waves allow these ion channels to open and activate the cells attached to them, according to a report published in the journal Nature Communications.
To produce ultrasound-controlled succulent mammals, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that some of their nerve cells contain TRP-4 ion channels.
When Chalasani used ultrasound for modified worms, the microbeams strengthened the sound waves and transmitted them to the worms where they switched on the modified motion nerve cells.
The method has some of the same features as optogenetics, a pioneering tool that allows scientists to switch nerve cells on and off using light pulses.
Chalasani, however, says that the use of sonogenesis may have some advantages over optogenetics.
Unlike light that has to send optical fibers along the desired point within the brain, low-frequency ultrasound waves can pass through the tissue without hindrance, so they can be sent to the brain from the skull.
"We believe that using gene therapy and a therapeutic virus may make it possible for the human neurons to respond to the ultrasound signals in certain neurological treatments in a clinical setting at a moment," Chalasani said.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.

Advertisements May Be Embarrassed About UK Arms Trade
Watch Amnesty International’s anti-personnel video.
Horrible killing machines!
Knee-breaking socks!
Rice bombs!
As well as electronic shock pumps that cause painful pain but leave no traces!
The joyful voice and the graphical language of the cartoons leave no doubt that this advertisement at the world’s largest position fairs is a sharp parody produced by Amnesty International to highlight the British government’s willingness to trade arms to the repressive governments at the Defence and Security Equipment International ExCeL Centre in London.

With the separate campaign, many posters also appeared on bus stops and metro trains, which required a more detailed introduction.
"Significant information, are you travelling on the DLR route from 15-18 September?" is asked together using the London Underground font and brand, as the DLR track turns into a tank image.
This September, a herd of arms dealers arrive on the DLR route... Customers are asked to help stop the station trade fairs.
These 300 posters are made by artists whose works were on display at the Banksyn Dismaland Museum of Cruel Designs (the Museum of Christmas Plans).
A collective called Special Patrol Group helped spread posters around London using the "Ad Space Hack Packs" packs, a six-pound six-wheel drive key package that, according to the collective, "accesses one-third of the world's bus stop advertising platform".
Transport for London is not interested in this unsubstantiated 'poster vandalism'.
One of the parody advertisements produced by the Special Patrol Group.
According to the Curator of Cruel Designs and University of Essex lecturer Gavin Grindon, artists are increasingly questioning and wanting to export political works to audiences outside the galleries.
A lot of artists have started working with activists in the resistance camps, when they have realized that they have to go abroad if they want their art to influence society.
Another anti-arms trade poster greets business travelers on the subway.
The video of Amnesty has been viewed through Facebook over 100,000 times in the last 24 hours. It was created for free by the advertising agency VCCP, and also a graphic designer and background artist worked for free.
VCCP’s creative director Matt Leverin found that no position fairs were advertised at all – and ExCeL’s calendar was empty at the time too – and thought, “Let’s give them the campaign they’re trying to avoid.”
They played with the idea of a more realistic advertisement for a vague corporation, but "it was more halting to emphasize it with bright colors and animation".
“They’ve done a fantastic job of helping us raise questions about the illegal torture device sold at trade fairs,” said Tom Davies.
Now the UK government must take action and ensure that torture devices are not sold illegally in our own homes near us.
Perhaps the most creative of the art fairs comes from the inside of ExCeL, when exhibitors trade fantastically decorated products.
In a press release, he received an order from the U.S. Army for an "at-the-bottom AT4CS RS".
This includes a "unique piping resistance mark that targets excellent impacts on the rear of the armor inside the object".
Whatever it does, it's not pleasant.
Eight Golden Rules for Living in a Student's Home
It's been 11 years since I moved into my student housing at the age of 19, when I still believed in baritones and moral relativism, but it's only now that I remember people's violent smiles - and the many, long complaints from others.
Much of what I have learned can be summed up in eight simple rules.
Changing an apartment can be anything from nerves to completely scary.
It’s tempting to say: tell me where you came from, whether you enjoyed the interlude and where, what you think about Corbyn, and why “I really don’t love or hate Marmite because it’s really just yeast extract HAHAHA to find me in my room”.
Take a breath.
And also help others to breathe - ask questions and show interest in it.
It guides the conversation and helps you find the people you like, not the ones you don’t want to talk to even if your eyelashes are on fire and they share the extinguishers.
Make room for people.
People’s rooms often turn into cocktail parties, movie theaters, and general entertainment venues, but they are also the places where people dress and repair their underwear.
Related: Don’t even imagine starting a university when you’re in a relationship
The University is a tough place for introverts.
Your room should be a place to rest, but in many apartments there is a culture of walking from room to room that is friendly, social, and creates lifelong friendships.
It can mean hell for someone who is trying to rest.
Nothing in this culture allows you to say, “I like you and I want to be friends with you, but you have to leave now, so that I can collect back the energy I consumed while talking to you.”
Try to sense when your fellow student is tired of socializing – and maybe send a text message to the door instead of knocking.
When it comes to knocking: knocking.
One guy in my student house thought that if the door wasn’t locked, he’d been invited in.
He saw quite a few things.
Friendship through baking.
Since you start college at the peak of the baking trend, knocking people on doors with a chocolate plate and presenting yourself seems somewhat less strange, less "welcome to the neighborhood, I baked something for you, now smile when I ask you personal questions."
Offering homemade treats is a great way to make friends.
Your roommates feel obliged to talk, and they may continue to combine your face with a tasty surprise.
It depends on whether you know how to bake.
Poorly mixed flour-sugar-fat abilities are likely to make people just pretend to sleep when they knock.
Stealing food is a common crime in student housing.
Understandably, taking someone's chicken is stealing, but what if you just take a drop of milk from your tea?
Ask and check with the milk owner.
It is quite possible that they will give you permission, even if they boil internally.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying and you get my sympathy, but try to treat it more adult than my roommate who mixed his milk with detergent to punish those who stole it.
He's in jail now.
You shouldn’t worry about people not being able to sleep or study.
Not just to be a decent person, but because you're like that proverbial pot ringing pot.
The girl in my hallway asked her neighbors if they could play their drum and bass music more quietly, because it was three o’clock in the morning and she had an exam in the morning.
The answer was to increase the volume.
When they finally calmed down at five in the morning, the girl kindly let them sleep for two hours before setting her own music to pause, locked her door and went to the three-hour exam.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future spouse happened to move into the same apartment with you?
Or vice versa, wouldn’t it be unbelievably embarrassing if you were to have an apartment partner as your future spouse, you would come together, you would break up, and then you would see her every day and possibly lose all of your common friends to her.
Of course, the heart wants what it wants, but if your hot housemate isn’t really your future spouse, you might even try to make sense of yourself.
At that thrilling moment when you find that someone has left their key unlocked in their room, the line between kicking and bullying is thinner than it seems.
A good stick is fun, but it can be cancelled in a moment.
You can give a useful and fun lesson on safety by hiding something - but never mess someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock their doors and drop the keys into the water glass, which you then place in the freezer - but do not attach their property to the blue ceiling as no more than twice.
A racist attack on the residence of foreign students in Kiteela - a house planned as a reception centre was erected in Salo
On Saturday morning, a racist attack was carried out on the premises of foreign students in Kitee in North Karelia.
Contrary to what the police previously said, it is not the accommodation of minor asylum seekers, but the dormitories of foreign students who have been in Finland for a long time, says Heidi Luukkainen, a teacher at the National University of Kiteen.
The windows and walls of the premises of the People’s Republic of Finland were carved with racist signs, such as hackers, and a metal object was thrown through the windows of one of the premises, according to the police of Eastern Finland.
According to Luukkais, a responsible teacher for the education of young people at the National Institute of Social Security, there were an estimated ten people in the building that was the subject of violence at the time of the attack.
“It was a weekend and adults are free to move, so some could be elsewhere,” Luukkainen says.
The National University is home to people from 12 different nationalities.
They are students who have been in Finland for some time, as well as newly arrived minor asylum seekers.
All of the people in the building have A-Statuses.
Some of them are in adult education, some are in professional studies and some are in Finnish," Luukkainen says.
A status is a so-called permanent residence permit, which can be granted for four years at a time to a foreigner who has been in Finland for some time.
The police in Eastern Finland are investigating the attack as damages and violations of the home peace.
According to Luukkainen, a news conference was held for students on Monday, where there were also the necessary interpreters.
There's no panic here, and no one's ever wanted to leave.
We’ve had foreign students for twelve years, and this is the first time that something like this has happened,” Luukkainen says.
According to him, the mess has already been cleared of the wall.
At least three men were suspected of being the perpetrators and were on the move in a light passenger car.
I think this is the main point of the youth weekend, when this topic has now been on the surface.
There is nothing more serious about it,” Lukkainen says.
A hospital has also been evacuated in Salo, where a reception centre has been planned.
The incident happened last week.
This was reported by MTV on its website on Tuesday evening.
The wall of the hospital was painted with a hammer cross and written in English "You are not welcome".
There has been a criminal report to the police.
Corrected incorrect information provided by the police about the age and status of the people living in the building.
The state abolishes the Y-train for the herd - passengers in their nests, "severe idiotic"
The Y-train going from Helsinki to Raaseporin Karjaa will stop in March.
The news angered the passengers who boarded the train at Helsinki’s main railway station.
The downside is particularly striking for missionaries, said Torbjörn Bengtström, who lives in the municipality.
It’s completely idiotic, because the population is growing all the time and people at work need a fast and smooth connection to Helsinki.
This can't be about anything but political will or lack of it.
Bengtström says in an interview video on HSTV that he is coming to the capital by tractor.
There are also train changes taking place elsewhere in New Zealand.
The H- and R-trains at the front end will be connected to the new R-line.
Purola’s position in Järvenpää and Nuppulinna Tuusula will be discontinued.
On Tuesday, the Ministry of Transport and Communications and VR released information on which routes the Ministry will buy train services for the next contract period.
The contract period changes at the end of the year and there are routes to be discontinued throughout the country.
The new four-year agreement, which will be finalised in autumn, will later be approved by the Committee on Monetary Affairs.
The Siuntian Bengtström considers that the state rail link is a short-sighted operation.
Let us make the same mistakes that have been made in the past and repeat them in a very systematic way.
Then there will be regret.
The Y-train is also used by non-Raaseporians and Siuntians, as it is fast and bypasses several stations.
Annina Pöyryä from the east was embarrassed by the fate of those travelling farther from the city by train.
“It’s just bad for those who have to re-plan their trip,” he said in pain on the Y-train.
A little relief is allowed.
There may be a new train connection coming to the coastline, which will replace the Y-train in the area of Seudun Transport (HSL) in Helsinki, i.e. take you to Kirkkonumme.
This will lead to additional costs for HSL, i.e. in practice for the municipalities of the region and their taxpayers.
“We are now beginning to explore the different options and their impact on service levels and ticket prices,” said Suvi Rihtniemi, CEO of HSL.
It is still impossible to accurately estimate the costs.
According to Rihtniemi, based on the number of passengers, HSL has paid about a million per year for the Y-train, of course the ministry is much more than that.
The upcoming R-line will miss two stations.
In Ainola and Saunakallio, however, the number of train turns doubles.
A total of 28 small stations and numerous routes stop across the country.
The Ministry will no longer buy train services from Joensuu-Nurmes, Tampere-Keuruu and Jyväskylä-Haapamäki-Seinäjoki.
The Pieksämäki-Joensuu route is shortened to Pieksämäki-Varkaus.
Train turnover will decrease on the routes Riihimäki-Lahti, Hanko-Karjaa, Kouvola-Kotka port and Kajaani-Oulu.
Over half a million journeys are made on discontinued journeys per year, with a total of around nine million journeys in the traffic purchased by the Ministry.
The new agreement is intended to bring to the state an annual savings of 12.3 million.
The value of the contract is about 27.5 million euros per year.
Sixten Korkman wrote a chapter in Capital's Timeliness: "Marx is worth getting acquainted"
The crises of the world economy have brought to the surface Karl Marx (1818-1883) and his final work Capital published in 1867-1894, writes in the book Marx Capital, which is now published by Yrjö Hakanen as the former chairman of the SKP.
"They will be taken more seriously now than for a long time," Hakanen writes in his foreword.
Marx’s estimates of the development of the capitalist economy, of the internationalization and penetration of all sectors of life, of the concentration of capital, and of the growing role of money capital and imaginary capital have proved to be astonishingly far-reaching.
The list of writers of the book based on the Capital seminars organized by the applicant also includes Aalto University professor, the esteemed financial beneficiary Sixten Korkman.
In the book Korkman writes that Marx is relevant "now and forever".
Isn't the former Executive Director of the Business Research Institute and the Business Delegation, though, a Marxist?
No, no, no, no.
Korkman says on the phone that he does not consider Marx a contemporary economist, but rather an interesting social theorist.
Today, social sciences are differentiated and specialized, but Marx was a philosopher, historian, sociologist, economist, journalist, political agitator, and literary scholar.
“The usual notion is that atheistic history tells of the false opinions of dead men,” Korkman begins.
It is true that Marx's predictions went badly wrong.
Although Marx understood the nature and significance of the industrial revolution, he drew too far conclusions from the initial stage of capitalism, Korkman ponders.
However, Korkman sees value in Marx’s radical stance.
“The most relevant thing about Marx is that he asked good questions,” he says.
Now we are again talking about Marx’s interests, such as the distribution of wealth.
“Marx might be able to give inspiration to those who want to understand the big picture, the changing world as a result of the technological revolution,” Korkman said.
But in what the government should decide tomorrow, there is no help for Marx.
In his opinion, capitalism was a hopeless case that should just stop.
However, Marx believes that Korkman should be familiar with it.
"In the '70s, Marx could not read," Korkman says.
"The Maoists and Trotskyists and the other Szeks hated all capitalism, but even more each other."
Today, the debate is more diverse, and Marx too can approach without the ideological and political pressures of the past years.
“Every social scientist should get acquainted with Marx’s world of thought – as well as other classics,” says Korkman.
U.N. Calls for War Crimes in Sri Lanka
The U.N. calls for the establishment of a special court to investigate war crimes committed in Sri Lanka’s civil war, the AFP news agency said.
The United Nations report on the civil war between 1983 and 2009 came out on Wednesday after a long delay.
The report accuses both the Sri Lankan armed forces and the rebels known as the Tamil Tigers of war crimes.
Sri Lanka’s civil war has killed at least 100,000 people.
There is no precise information on the number of victims.
In particular, the large-scale attack by the armed forces in the last months of the long war in 2009 should be thoroughly investigated, according to the UN report.
The Sri Lankan Armed Forces report accuses Sri Lanka of torture, kidnapping and systematic sexual violence, the victims of which were as likely as men as women.
According to the report, the rebels have been guilty of coercing sidelines and children into fighters.
According to the report, both parties were charged with the murders.
Sri Lanka responded on Wednesday that it intends to organise the investigation itself, but does not intend to allow the establishment of a UN tribunal because of foreign judges.
In an English yo-experiment, social media was punctuated
In the autumn student papers, on Wednesday, there was a long foreign language in turn, most of which was English.
His English skills were tested by more than 16,000 cooks.
You could write about it on social media, though.
Based on our own experience, we had to consider whether social media makes us lonely and unhappy.
Alternatively, an English-language version of 150-250 words could refer to the owner of the online magazine’s advisory bulletin.
The title was Dear Agony Aunt.
Agony Aunt is in charge of Finnish Leilia’s armchair.
He had to ask for advice on how parents should look at things for young people as well.
In total, there were four subjects of the substance, one of which had to be chosen.
“It was the hardest of them,” said Mia Lybeck, a lecturer at the Swedish-language high school in Porvoo.
The third issue was just a quote from the former President of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso.
The fourth one, Lybeck said, was nice.
It had to write a firefighter speech on why companies should hire young people to work.
"At least our school has practiced writing speeches," Lybeck says, and rated the whole experiment "to be quite normal".
In the Finnish - or Swedish - English experiment, questions were answered about texts that drew, for example, the adaptation of the summer camp to climate change and the processing of large data masses.
On Wednesday, some long Russian (168 pupils), German (124), French (52) and Spanish (27) were also written.
Autumn’s articles will continue on Friday, when another Swedish or Finnish test will take place.
In the classrooms, the test is organized normally, i.e. the employee's expression does not affect it.
The Student Research Board urges cooks to look for suitable transit connections in time to get to the test.
You can also get extra time if you can show that the delay was not due to your own negligence.
In Oulu, arms trade was looted under threat
In Oulu, a shop in the Kello district was looted on Wednesday morning.
According to police, the robber was dressed in dark clothes and a commando puppet covering his face.
The man is normal and about 30 years old.
According to police, the man had threatened the staff with a handgun and received a small amount of money.
This is being investigated as a robbery.
Police prepare for the arrival of tens of thousands of demonstrators in Helsinki - support parties from elsewhere in Finland
The protest against the government’s cut decisions will be blocked in the centre of Helsinki on Friday, police predict.
According to preliminary data, up to tens of thousands of people can arrive.
The members of the SAK, Akava and STTK alliances will meet at the Railway Tower at 11 a.m.
Police are also believed to be involved in the protest.
The task of the police officers at work, in turn, is not only to carry out the alarm tasks and other police activities, but also to ensure the smooth running of the statement of absence.
The roads leading to the railway tower will be closed from motor vehicles for about 9.30 to 14.00 hours.
Only alarm vehicles are allowed in the area.
From the direction of Hakaniemi, traffic will be cut off from the point of the Kaisaniemi transport circle, from the west direction from the mainland.
Are there enough people at the Helsinki police station, Commander Seppo Kujala?
At least so far, it seems enough.
I don't take a stand on police work.
According to Kujala, support parties from other parts of Finland are coming to Helsinki because of a declaration of sympathy.
The exact batch numbers are not reported by the police.
“Sometimes it’s coming, but as a rule, we can do it on our own,” Kujala says.
Police are urging that private cars be avoided in central Helsinki on Friday.
Kujala estimates that the worst traffic jam extends from the Hakaniemi level to the core centre.
Standing traffic is expected from the morning until the beginning of the day.
With demonstrators coming from elsewhere in Finland, there are also a lot of order buses coming to Helsinki.
They're not allowed in the Railway Tower.
Buses are usually a long way off.
The final trip will then have to walk to the demonstration site,” Kujala says.
The announcement also stops public transport in Helsinki.
From a police point of view, there is a positive side to this.
The issue of the smoothness of public transport, which is normally at these large gatherings of the people, is now partly self-sustaining.
The organizers of the protest have informed the police that there may be tens of thousands of opponents of the government’s economic policy in Helsinki.
The police are waiting for the statement to go smoothly.
There are ordinary people who are either working or unemployed, ordinary citizens.
Yes, Finnish people are reasonable and peaceful,” Kujala says.
Local protests will also be held all over Finland on Friday.
In many ways, Friday's expression is exceptional - do you remember these smears and expressions?
In many ways, the big public opinion held by trade unions on Friday is interesting and exceptional.
For example, it does not find a very good reference point in Finnish political history, says Martti Sisisinen, professor of sociology at the University of Jyväskylä.
It’s no wonder that the ay movement is protesting.
If it did not, it would raise its hands up in front of the government, Siisinen says.
The very right-wing government has struck at the core of the Finnish corporatism tradition - and also at the points that have been important for the development of the Finnish welfare state.
The government's hard work is about contract law.
Here are a lot of features that the ay movement is really trying to get to the knees.
At the same time, the ay movement also has a place to look in the mirror.
A mirror is needed, for example, because the ay movement does not have the support of all employees for Friday’s statements.
What is new now is the sharp division that the expression of the mind will bring about among those whom the ay movement would like to participate in the demonstration.
Unemployed people gathered from all over Finland showed their views in the House of Representatives in November 1993.
If you are looking for a reference point for Friday’s remarks, it could be a demonstration of unemployed layoffs, held in Murrostorstai in 1993, Siisinen says.
In the middle of the deepest stall, Murrostorstai gathered 20,000 unemployed.
Esko Aho’s (central) government is computing the labour market crisis into another.
It was said that the relationship between the Finnish government and the employers’ organisations had never been as bad as during the bourgeois government of Aho.
Now the relationship between the government and the ay movement is perhaps even worse than in Murrostorst's time.
Besides, the most bourgeois government in Finland has ever been in power, Siisininen says.
The current government coalition is still so interesting that it is so tightly right-wing despite the speeches of the Finns.
There were still some elements of the old labour movement at the time of the junction.
Thousands of protesters are expected to arrive on Friday.
The announcement also stops public transport and possibly closes day care homes and schools.
Even if it does not receive indivisible support from employees, it can become the biggest years.
In recent years, about 300 demonstrations have been held annually in Helsinki.
They're out of line.
Traditionally, the demonstrations of the ay movement in Finland have been quite peaceful - even though the practices have been toughened in recent years.
Traditionally, the Finnish demonstration avoids conflict, is law-abiding.
Demonstrators are trying to avoid damage or destruction of property, Siisinen says.
However, the late 1990s brought new winds.
The culture of protests has changed.
EU membership angered farmers to throw eggs and the police prepared to get pork on top.
The firefighter strike lasted three months in 1998.
There were also visible strikes amongst pilots and air traffic controllers.
Do you remember these protests and protests?
Metal and electric roofs of the 1970s
The most significant strikes of the 1970s were the metal lacquer in 1971 and the power plant and electric lacquer in 1977.
A total of 70,000 metallic members participated in the strike.
The strike was suspended by the Conciliation Committee after a seven-week strike.
Metal males received a 16 percent salary increase.
In the spring of 1977, the electric varnish lasted 49 days and caused power outages across the country.
Murrostorstai in 1993
On 4 November 1993, about 20,000 people, many of whom were unemployed, gathered in front of the House of Representatives to show their support for the work.
Firefighters strike for three months in 1998
The firefighter strike was one of the longest, if not the longest, national strikes of the 1990s.
Farmers protested against the EU in 1994 and 1999
Police were hit by an egg hunt when farmers protested against the EU in 1994.
"Siberia is teaching, the EU is quitting," was one of the slogans.
For Espaille, farmers were grazing a ton of snow.
The Helsinki EU Summit in 1999 also prompted farmers to protest and burn potatoes in front of the meeting place.
Nurses Striked in 1983 and 1995
Nurses were on strike for about a month in 1995.
The last time they were in the barracks was in 1983.
The 1995 strikes were marked by a number of deaths during the strike.
Tehy was threatened by a strike and a mass curfew of nurses in 2007.
The threat of mass expiration eventually accelerated the negotiations to a conclusion.
Doctors Striked in 2001
"Doctors in strike - forced," was the slogan of the strikers in 2001.
The strike by local health centres and hospital doctors lasted five months and sparked a lively debate on how strikes could endanger patient safety.
After the strike, the public sector raised the salaries of doctors.
Students on the Move in 2013
Approximately 5,000 students marched in Helsinki from the Senate to the House of Representatives in 2013.
Central Criminal Police to find out the backgrounds of a Finnish group of refugees to Austrian police
The Austrian police have asked the central crime police to help find out the background of a refugee swarm registered in Finland.
On Sunday, Austrian police stopped in Aisterheim near the German border a truck carrying 42 refugees.
It is not known if the truck was on its way to Finland.
Those who were driving in the cold were all in good condition.
We had an exchange of information with the Austrian police.
The investigation and the main responsibility is at the scene in Austria, says Tero Haapala, the commissioner of the Central Crime Police.
At the end of August, the fate of other refugees travelling in trucks in Austria was worse.
At the time, all 71 passengers on board were reportedly drowned.
According to the Public Radio, the truck belongs to a Finnish limited company, which first reported the cooperation with the Austrian police.
The company operates restaurants, among other things, and its CEO is a foreign background, about 40 years old man.
Two Iraqis have been arrested in Austria for smuggling.
A refugee captain, a former drug courier and a drunken businessman - the story of five smugglers
The arrogant king of smugglers, the violent boatman, a stylistic missionary and a taxi driver who considers himself a good keeper.
Such people, for example, engage in human smuggling to the European Union.
Andrea Di Nicola, a criminologist at the University of Trento, and journalist Giampaolo Musumeci have met and interviewed dozens of smugglers and their "customers", and their book Death Travel Agency will be published in Finnish this week.
In the book, they present the smuggling lonkers, present solutions and introduce smugglers from different stages of the business.
HS presents five of them.
I'll get your thoughts out of them right away.
The Kerkenna Islands on the Tunisian east coast do not attract foreign tourists, but many Tunisians are heading there for a summer holiday.
Because of its location, the islands are also ideal for smuggling, as the trip to the island of Lampedusa, which belongs to Italy, is only 120 kilometers away.
For comparison: the distance from Helsinki to Tallinn is about 85 kilometers.
There, in the village of El Attaya, lives Emir, a chain-burning captain and the father of six children.
Kerkenna Islands are famous for their shrimp, but the fisherman is more profitable to transport people.
Emir has already done this with his blue, ten-meter wooden boat hundreds of times.
If the boat is fully sunk, it can accommodate 40 people.
For one trip Emir earns about 8,000 euros after expenses.
Emiri has five assistants who are looking for clients all over Tunisia.
Customers come from many countries, but during the Arab Spring a huge number of Tunisians wanted to escape the unrest.
After that, the situation calmed down until the refugee crisis again ravaged.
Customers arrive from the mainland to Kerkenna Islands in small groups.
Emir places them in empty houses for as long as he sees fit.
The food is given in such a way that customers just stay alive.
The accommodation costs about 75 euros per night, and if the customer spends the money in the middle, it’s their problem.
We leave the water at midnight at the shortest.
The first night we drive away from the islands, then stop, wait for the day and drive the next night to Lampedusa.
Sometimes seafaring is hard, and in the 20-metre-high waves, passengers cry and vomit.
At the destination, the human child has been unloaded in half an hour and Emir leaves for a return trip.
Emir wants to be scared of him.
That’s why he beats his clients and at least claims to kill the applicants.
He tells in the book that when the police once nursed him, he threw all his passengers overboard and ordered them to swim to the nearest island.
"I grabbed the customers one by one and threw them overboard," Emir says in the book.
The most peaceful travelers come from the south of the Sahara.
He told his countrymen he'd have to abuse this.
I'll get your thoughts out of them right away.
We need to show them immediately who's in charge here.
Just a regular taxi driver.
Goran is an ordinary taxi driver in Bogovada, Serbia.
His cab is not very good - the starter is pulling his last and he has seen his best days anyway.
However, the most important thing for Goran’s customers is that the taxi moves at all and that it moves towards the Hungarian border.
Bogova<0xC3><0xB0>a is a small village of 500 inhabitants about 60 kilometers south-west of Belgrade.
Next to the village is a centre for asylum seekers, where mainly families are allowed.
In the forests surrounding the city centre, men traveling without their families are staying in tents, slabs and abandoned cars, which everyone has now managed to find or build.
There are also families living in the forest who, for one reason or another, have not applied for asylum in Serbia.
Some also stay in private apartments, but it is a public secret.
Among the foresters, Goran finds most of his clients.
These are often exhausted - the route through the Balkans requires a large number of border crossings and week-long walks in hard-to-reach terrain, often in mountainous areas and in the dark.
When it finally arrives in the Bogovada region, a major point of human trafficking, people are suffering from death.
Goran's Cypriots are mainly Syrians, Afghans, Pakistanis, Iraqis and Kurds.
The best clients are Syrians, he says in the book.
"They say their thing once and that's enough," Goran praises.
He says Africans are trying to smash.
That's what Goran doesn't like.
You fool fool fool all the way.
For example, the price is set at 300 euros, then they reduce it to 200 and finally offer 150.
Goran emphasizes that he is a nice and kind-hearted man.
I don't care about money.
I just do my job and help people,” he says in the book.
Goran says he works cheaper than the others and charges only 50 euros per person for the trip to the Hungarian border.
The distance is 300 kilometers, most of which is convenient on the motorway.
Colleagues are asking for a three- or four-fold price.
Goran earns about 50,000 euros a year.
It is not a large amount for the smuggler, but in Serbia quite a nice annual income.
Serbia has ordered that taxis not be allowed to carry migrants 12 kilometres closer to the Hungarian border.
Goran doesn’t care: he knows the roads and lanes and takes his rider a mile from the border.
Then he points his clients in the right direction and turns it off.
In the Work of Mercy
A 35-year-old Congolese is called a Missionary, and it’s not just a nickname.
He actually has a Protestant church in Kampala, the capital of Uganda, with many Congolese refugees, as well as a small centre to help Congolese orphans.
In addition to preaching, the Missionary preacher runs a smuggling business that moves people from the Congo to Europe.
He thinks he's doing the work of mercy.
It is important for the missionary to look good.
She polishes her shoes many times a day and ensures that the rubber band in the white panties elegantly clogs under the low waist of the jeans.
The missionary is proud of the new Merced, its SUV and its three motorcycles.
When the Missionary does not preach, he arranges people from the Congo to Uganda and onwards to Europe.
The customer first calls one of the Sending Preacher’s five phone numbers.
He advises that it is best to arrive at the border in the morning, hide the money thoroughly and shine amongst the shopkeepers who cross the border.
In order to obtain asylum seeker or refugee status, the Ugandan authorities must be informed that they have come from war zones in North Kivu, for example, and that they have had to flee from home violence.
Often it is true, but if not, the Sender preacher arranges for the customer to have a new identity.
The old identity card will be destroyed and another will be replaced.
It helps the envoy’s contacts with the Ugandan police.
The client is then redirected to the same place where the right asylum seekers go: to the asylum procedure, to the NGOs, and finally to the UN refugee organization UNHCR.
The missionary knows the bureaucracy because he himself has become a refugee in Uganda.
He bills for each staircase separately: submitting an application to the Ugandan police costs about one hundred euros, handing over documents to a humanitarian organisation about 150 euros, and the migration process to a European country, for example, between 4 500 and 7 000 euros.
Foliota and ice cubes
Tom's a novice smuggler, a former drug courier.
A 40-year-old Irish man is on the French coast in Calais, where his job is to load people into trucks on the way to Britain.
He is assisted by an Afghan, a French taxi driver living in London and dozens of truckers who may not even know they are in the human trafficking business.
At night, Tom and the taxi driver catch up with their customers, usually 2-3 people, somewhere near the centre of Calais.
They're driving on the A26 and trying to avoid the police.
If the police stopped the car on the highway, Tom and the driver would go straight to jail for organising illegal immigration.
That's not what Tom wants, he's been sitting for seven years on drugs.
When the taxi stops, Tom runs with his clients across the highway to a resting place where the scouts sleep before continuing across the canal to the Brits.
Tom picks the right trailer... to make sure it's on its way to England, not Holland... and cuts through the safety guard.
It must be done in silence so that the scouts do not wake up.
Sometimes a man is involved in the story, but then the desire is more expensive.
When the route is clear, Tom wraps his client in aluminum foil, a similar one wrapped in the kitchen around a toaster or oven pot.
It should prevent a police heat scanner from detecting a hidden object.
Some use a sleeping bag filled with ice for the same purpose.
Tom leaves his client in the truck and leaves the scene hoping he won’t hit the smugglers suddenly before Britain.
The King of Smugglers
Muammer Kü<0xC3><0xA7>ük is one of the world’s most famous smugglers.
The plump Turkish has been called the champion of marketing and the undisputed king of the illegal landings in the Mediterranean, which governs sea routes from Turkey to EU countries, mainly to Greece and Italy.
Kü<0xC3><0xA7>ük has been operating since the 1990s and has continuously developed new smuggling methods.
He also has a competitive advantage over other entrepreneurs: he only demands the money when he arrives.
One of the new methods is luxury boating: Turkish ports are supposed to be rented for fun to take American or European families to comfortable tourist skiing for a few days.
In reality, the ships are loaded to the full by Syrians, Iraqis, Kurds and Afghans, who are transported first from Istanbul to some port and from there by sea to Europe at a cost of between EUR 5 000 and 7 000.
Customers are kept in human stocks, for example in old industrial halls, until it is time to leave.
People are being dumped in minibuses and driven somewhere along the coast.
They are told to hide among the vegetation and wait for signs.

American Olympic Runner Reveals His Illness and Prostitution in His Book
Three-time Olympic runner Suzy Favor Hamilton’s new book has caught the eye in the United States.
In his book Fast Girl, Favor Hamilton talks about ending her career and becoming a prostitute.
The Sports Illustrated magazine published cuts to the book on Tuesday.
Favor Hamilton ended his career at the Sydney Olympics.
He came to the races in top condition and ran in the races for the second best time.
In the final, he panicked.
Right at the start, he pushed to the top and defended his leadership position with a ground run.
However, 150 meters before the finish, his strength was exhausted.
He collapsed on the surface of the track, and the other competitors passed him one by one.
I felt like an idiot and I thought I would never run again.
However, I forced myself over the finish line, Favor Hamilton says in his book.
It was later revealed that Favor Hamilton was suffering from a two-way mood disorder.
His brother Dan had committed suicide a year before the Sydney races, and he himself felt enormous pressures for success.
Favor Hamilton was a 43-year-old mother when she became a prostitute in Las Vegas.
The couple had no financial problems, but she was fascinated by the idea of getting money from having sex with foreign men.
She also convinced her husband to accept her actions.
Favor Hamilton's tax was 450 euros per hour.
He says he spent the money on luxury.
One explanation for Favor Hamilton’s prostitution was also that he needed the same adrenaline spikes he had gained in competing in athletics.
Later, Favor Hamilton found out that he had a bipolar disorder.
The twin life of the former runner came to light in late 2012, when the magazine Smoking Gun published an article about him.
Favor-Hamilton competed in the Olympic Games in Barcelona, Atlanta and Sydney.
In 2000, he was at the world's top 1500 metres at 3.57.40, but was last in the Sydney Olympic Finals.
The World Champion was delighted when the Federation put a Norwegian ski helmet on the line: "Fairy-to-air"
The Norwegian skiing king, Petter Northug, has exceeded the limits of suitability, according to at least one of his colleagues.
Northug and the Norwegian Ski Federation have turned their backs on an athlete’s contract, just like last summer and autumn.
Although the league has offered Northug a better deal than other athletes, it has also failed to qualify for a multiple World Champion and Olympic winner.
As a result of the contract dispute, the Norwegian Ski Federation decided to exclude Northug from the upcoming World Cup.
The decision received praise from double world champion Astrid Jacobsen.
He said he was happy that the union had put a ski hat on the ground.
“Thank you for showing your spine,” Jacobsen wrote on his Facebook profile.
"We can't allow one active athlete to avoid working for the union's sponsor," he continued.
The dispute between the Norwegian Ski Federation and Northug is about money.
Northug would like to be part of the season so he can advertise his own sponsor.
Jacobsen said he was happy to represent the alliance, which also cares for future generations, and does not leave one athlete alone.
At the same time, he recalled that the alliance has given Northug both economic and other privileges for several years.
I know that because I've been part of the system.
Jacobseb does not accept that one athlete has completely different rules than just because he is the best.
On Tuesday, Northug released a press release confirming his desire to compete in Norwegian colours at the World Cup next season as well as at the World Championships and the Olympics.
Astrid Jacobsen won a total of six World Cup medals in his career, including two gold medals.
Last winter, he was part of a team that won the gold medal in Falun last winter.
Bread translators’ day is also celebrated in Northern Ireland
On the 25th of September, tempests will be held in various restaurants and shops, which have been awarded the sign of the Pastry translators.
The aim of the day is to emphasize Finland’s high level of food industry expertise and to lower the threshold for leaving the restaurant and to raise awareness of the importance of the shield as part of high quality.
At the same time, we would like to remind that not all high-quality restaurants are concentrated in the capital area, but there are top-notch restaurants all over Finland that are checked and classified by an impartial operator.
The international attention received by the event is an indication of the importance of the event as part of increasing the visibility of the turtle restaurants and the organization.
The day is held in Vaasa in Fondices and Kantarellis.
In Kokkola, the Old Town Restaurant participates in the Day of the Shield.
The event has also received considerable international attention.
The event has therefore been decided to make the organization one of the most important international events, which will be held on the same day around the world.
Finland will continue to host the event.
Kauhajoki-lehti: Legal Chancellor charged with establishing a Kauhava reception centre
The Finnish Immigration Agency and the Finnish Red Cross (SPR) are working together to establish a refugee reception centre at the premises of the Kauhava ex-council, currently owned by LSK Business Park Oy.
According to the complaint, the region continues to have a permanent location in the critical infrastructure of the crisis, which is used by the Defence Forces and its partner, Suomen Erillisverkot Oy.
Kauhajoki-magazine reports that according to the individual, the installation of the reception centre in the same building would pose a significant security risk, which has not been taken into account in the preparation of the case.
According to the complainant, the defence forces may have interests in the area and airport of the former Aeronautical School, the impact of which has also not been clarified in the preparation of the reception centre, the newspaper writes.
In the case, it is stated that negotiations have been held over the last two years regarding the organisation of flight training and the outcome of any foreign operator at the airport.
The matter has been discussed, among other things, with the Minister of Defense Jussi Niinistö (p.) and the head of the Ministry of Defence Arto Rädy.
The individual states to the Chancellor that the complaint is not a matter of a fundamental objection to the reception centre, but of the fact that the intended place in the former armory area is incorrect.
The city government of Kauhavan dealt with the reception centre last Monday.
Title: The situation in Syria is reflected in Ukraine and the Baltic Sea region
The administration means that the immigrants and those present here have the necessary conditions, Niinistö commented to reporters in the evening after meeting the presidents of all parliamentary parties at their official residence in Mäntynim.
According to the President, concern over the management of the refugee situation brought together all participants.
He considers it valuable that in Finland, the government and opposition parties are able to discuss confidentially the most pressing issues.
Especially in these times when we have a lot of challenges ahead of us.
According to him, the situation in Syria and the actions of Russia and the United States in the region could also have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and the Baltic Sea region.
This is a hope for the development of dialogue.
If this situation develops in a positive direction, i.e. the United States and Russia will be able to do so, it will have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and will continue to affect the situation in the Baltic Sea.
According to him, the NATO issue was also sidelined in the discussions.
The president did not take a stand on the labour market situation.

According to police, the closing time depends on the number of people participating in the demonstration.
Only alarm vehicles shall be allowed in the area.
Metro and scooters in all-Friday announcements
Subway and tram drivers will participate in Friday’s declaration of concern from the morning to the night traffic.
The Association of Railway and Metro Staff reported this to STT this evening.
Most alcoves close for two hours, including posts closed
Friday’s announcement also causes disruptions to Posti’s services.
Significant delays are expected, including the distribution of daily mail.

The trade union of service industries, Pam, has instructed its employees to suspend their work between 11am and 13pm.
Pam has also called on the employees of the grocery trade to participate in the trade unions’ statement.
Representatives of SOK and Kesko tell the Helsinki Sanom that the stores will be opened if necessary by the executive branch.
According to Kesko, there is no information on the possible closure of individual stores.
Helsinki kindergartens partially closed
Helsinki kindergartens do not operate in full on Fridays, reports the Helsinki Agency for Early Childhood Education.
Due to the dissent of professional organisations, day care may be concentrated in certain daycare centres, and club activities in daycare centres and playgrounds may not be organised.
24-hour day-care centres and groups of children with developmental disabilities and multiple disabilities remain open.
In addition, afternoon activities for disabled and autistic schoolchildren are organized normally.
The Agency for Early Childhood Education will announce further changes tomorrow.
Media researcher: Birds take a high risk
According to Sipilä, the communication requires a variety of channels, and the Prime Minister's television and radio speeches are one channel among others.
Such a direct speech channel will also be needed in the future.
This will not be the last time, Sipilä told reporters in parliament.
Sipilä did not yet want to assess how often the Prime Minister's recurring manner of television and radio speeches will be.
According to Sipilä, speeches may not always be broadcast on Yle channels in the future.
If the other channels sign up as a channel, then we'll look at it.
Now we are using this channel tonight, Sipilä said.
According to Sipilä, the state of the Finnish economy is so serious that it requires television and radio speaking to citizens.
This set of issues, which we are now talking about, is quite complex and requires a longer justification.
That’s why we ended up on this channel, Sipilä found out.
The speech will be broadcast at 21.05-21.20 on both TV1 and Radio Finland.
You can also watch it in the arena.
Birds take a big risk
The media researcher hopes that Sipilä’s televised speech does not tell of a more general turn in government.
Is it an attempt to take the right to define a public debate more strictly into their own hands and to refuse to ask questions about the public debate? says Anu Koivunen, a professor at the University of Stockholm.
The recent comment made by Minister for Foreign Affairs (Timo) Soin that he does not follow the media agenda and does not allow it to define itself.
In the name of democratic debate and publicity, I hope that these things are not interrelated.
Koivunen understands that the commercial media is upset about Sipilä’s announcement.
It'd be weird if the media field didn't respond.
The communication styles of political decision-makers are not a matter of publicity in a democracy.
It is the duty of the media representatives to make sure that the agendas of the politicians are not adopted.
According to Koivus, television talk is a big risk for Sipilä.
In his speech, the onion should bring something new and special to the table in order to meet the exceptionally high expectations set for the speech.
Is there any more of what we have heard today?
Or is he able to speak in different tones, in different ways or in different words, or to say something new?
Koivunen says that if there is only more of the same old thing in the permit, you have to wonder why such a great gesture was made and Yle gave it exceptional time.
In general, in this sense, a risk is taken if it is not a special situation, but a routine speech among others.
The danger is that Yle will be labelled as a message by politicians or parliament and government, which is certainly not in line with Yle’s interests or the general line.
Onion Skilled Veto
In the upcoming speech in Sipilä, it is also important what the prime minister does not say, the media researcher emphasizes.
In the evening, we need to look carefully at what Sipilä is missing and what is not, says Heikki Kuutti, research coordinator at the University of Jyväskylä.
According to the listener, the TV talk is a clever bet from Sipil, because this way this can bring out its own view without the noise.
In this way, the message is delivered to the general public without a journalistic filter, unlike at a press conference where journalists can ask critical questions.
The onion crosses the media and speaks directly to the people.
The danger, however, is that the media misinterpret something about the subject, because clarifying questions are not allowed to be posed.
According to the interviewer, it is very important how Sipilä appears on TV - whether sweat or hands shake.
He compares the Monkey to the father figure who now tells the people what to do.
If Sipilä knows how to present his case well, it can work.
The situation is different than if the government were to inform about something, because here a person is like speaking directly to another person.
This (U.S. President Barack) Obama and his partners are engaged in on a regular basis.
Really Extraordinary
Policy researcher Erkka Railo considers the Prime Minister’s speech to the citizens to be truly exceptional.
He said it has not happened in decades that the Prime Minister speaks directly to the people.
Exceptional time requires exceptional means, Railo says.
The researcher believes that the prime minister thus wants to make the Finns sympathy for the predilections ahead.
On Friday, employers’ organisations are organising demonstrations and strikes against the government’s actions.
Paavo Arhinmäki, the president of the left-wing union, said on Twitter that Sipilä could give his speech on the state of the nation in parliament as a prime minister's announcement, which would also allow for discussion.
The President of the SDP, Antti Rinne (sd.), again announces his challenge to the dialogue of Sipilä.
There is no time for monologues.
Almost six months after the election.
You can’t hide indefinitely, Rinne writes on Twitter.
A 9-year-old boy has been found in Tampere
The boy was fine at the time of the encounter.
WHEN the boy was found and known, the boy’s father updated his Facebook page.
The Inner Finland Police Department also confirms the matter to Iltaleh.
The boy went out to play at four o'clock in the afternoon.
Later that night, he was no longer contacted.
Father thanks all the people who helped in the search.
Thank you for the dozens of contacts and observations during these hours.
The update was shared closer to 15,000 times which is an incredible balance in such a short time
Finnish UFC star was disappointed in the violent wildness of young people: You will cause hatred
Freelancer Makwan Amirkhani posted a video on Facebook, appealing especially to young immigrants.
Makwan Amirkhani had a heavy speech against the street battles of young people.
Amirkhani, who was born in Iran and arrived in Finland with his family at the age of five, has won both of his professional titles in the most prestigious UFC series so far.
Amirkhani said he received a message asking to view an Instagram account.
Videos have been uploaded to the account where young people are fighting with extreme violence.
Amirkhani says he is disappointed in the youth’s wildness.
The 26-year-old Amirkhan has over 62,000 followers on Facebook.
“You guys kick the people on the ground, sit on the other one, and you don’t even think about any of the consequences of making these videos,” Amirkhani said.
Difficult to defend anymore
Some of the young people seen in the videos have immigrant backgrounds.
According to the Helsinki Police Commissioner Jarmo Heinosen, both immigrants and Finnish youth have uploaded combat videos to social media.
It's precisely the fact that you're killing everywhere on the street.
You make the lives of so many other immigrants more difficult here in Finland, recalls the Turkish Amirkhani.
Amirkhani reminds that there are websites in Finland that are looking for crimes committed by immigrants.
These individual cases have become very serious.
It's a little hard, boys, to defend you no more.
You should remember that you are still in a foreign country and you will be here for quite a long time.
That’s a little different way of thanking you for being here,” Amirkhani says.
Amirkhani urges young people to remember their loved ones.
If they ever fall victim to racism, you can blame yourself for it.
Now, think a couple of times before you go for a ride like that, guys.
Amirkhani says that violent activity is contributing to racism.
You're going to get me some hate that I don't like.
You're having a pretty bad time anyway, and you're not going to fix it at all," Amirkhani says.
SAK puts its position on the savings package - Lyly: decisions on Monday
SAK President Lauri Lyly said on Twitter that the employers’ association will consider Monday its stance on the STTK’s alternative savings list.
Lauri Lyly commented on the STTK proposal on Twitter.
On Wednesday, the STTK announced that it would present its own proposal to the government to achieve the 5% productivity target demanded by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (center).
President Fjäder believes that the government will accept the proposal if the SAK, STTK and Akava are all behind the proposal.
However, it would require the largest employers’ organisation SAK to soften its position.
The president of SAK, Lauri Lyly, said on Twitter.
Lyly writes that the SAK Bureau will deal with the matter on Monday.
According to Lyly, the SAK is looking for solutions to "open the labour market lock", and that instead of forced labourers, agreements made by the active parties are needed.
Mr Lyly recalls that the proposal of the Prime Minister Sipilä’s government for a social agreement was not valid for the SAK.
Sipilä previously interrupted the negotiations on the social agreement, when SAK refused to commit to the 5% productivity target.
Comment: Great demonstration threatens to shake - "It feels a little funny to pull the fists"
It’s a bit of a joke to pull a fist if you already have a matching paper in your pocket, writes Pekka Tiinanen.
Atmospheres vary in wage camps from law to law.
Is it intended to call the government to death, or is it supposed to agree with it?
On Monday, SAK’s coalition leaders broke out with a holy hatred of the republic’s government.
The whole country was threatened to shut down.
The threat spread to the lights.
The teachers’ union OAJ threatened to close schools and kindergartens.
On Tuesday, OAJ announced that no schools or kindergartens will be completely closed.
On Wednesday, STTK Chairman Antti Palola (sd) made a conciliatory appearance.
He said he had kept in touch with the government and was drafting an alternative proposal by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (center) for a 5% productivity ratio.
The chairman of Akava, Sture Fjader (kok), immediately hurried to announce that his bargaining paper is already ready.
At first, the SAK office was not part of the turmoil.
President Lauri Lylyn (sd) is hard to come to an agreement when union leaders on Monday ordered the country to stand down on Friday.
Finally, however, Lyly announced that the SAK Bureau will meet next Monday to discuss the situation and that SAK will look for solutions to "open the labour market lock".
In order to create a common representation of the employees, the SAK should be inclined to accept the 5% productivity target.
It is no wonder that Palola STTK has relations with the Sipilä government.
Palola’s right hand, Jukka Ihanus, the head of the STTK responsible for social interaction, previously served as a special assistant to the Prime Ministers Matti Vanhasen and Mari Kivinieme.
Palola said that the government’s ay skills have improved all the time.
Coincidentally or not, but Palola’s exit took a bit of a blow away from Finland’s supporters, whose bowling shot is played by Marko Piirainen (sd).
It's a bit of a joke to pull your fists if you already have a matching paper in your pocket.
Edited at 18:00: Added information about Lylyn's comments.
Russia blatantly accuses Finland of being a bad host: "This must not happen again"
The President of the Russian Duma, Sergei Naryshkin, criticised the Helsinki OSCE meeting.
The President of the Russian Duma, Sergei Naryshkin, said that Mongolia is a better OSCE host than Finland.
In the Mongolian capital Ulan Bator, the autumn session of the Parliamentary Assembly of the OSCE has begun, where Naryshkin made extensive comments on the July festive meeting in Helsinki.
At that time, Finland did not allow Russian politicians who had to be on the European Union's sanctions list, such as Naryshkin, to come to the meeting - something the President used to remind reporters of.
In our opinion, this was contrary to the values of parliamentary democracy and the principles of open dialogue.
This should not happen again, Naryshkin said, according to Interfax.
In addition to Finland and the EU, Naryshkin’s criticism was directed at the United States, where he had also been blocked.
Sanctions are a political suicide of the EU, Naryshkin declared.
The Russian delegation to Mongolia came in uncomplicated, so Naryshkin continued to pierce Finland by praising and praising Mongolia for its "excellent organization".
I am sure that the Parliamentary Assembly will run constructively and with positive results - unlike the meeting held in Helsinki in July.
The Mongolian leadership understands that parliamentary dialogue should not have any obstacles.
Naryshkin has met Ilkka Kanerva, the head of the meeting in Ulan Bator, who, according to the Russian media, has already discussed with the Russian delegation.
The lock faces a real playoff hole: "Paints tight"
Tappara and Lukko continue their bull days in Hakamets today, when both are on fire on the second day in a row.
Janne Lahti predicts that today in Hakamets there will be no actual painting festivals.
Killpara went to Kuopio yesterday to win a 3-2 draw from Kalpa.
The rise was masculine, as the last season’s silver team was at its worst from a two-goal loss.
The lock was more win-win on Tuesday.
As a guest of the Blues, the Rumanian catch was round zero points, and the losses were also 2-3.
Hard game, goals tight, if none play the same game as last year, lock attacker Janne Lahti predicts the positioning on the club’s pages.
Tappara has become a pretty playoff nightmare for the Rohingyas.
In fact, Tappara has in the last two seasons dropped in the semifinals just from the finals of the Luko series.
Both times, a decisive seventh match is required for the solution.
Last season, Lukko took the series off in the fourth game, but Tappara climbed to the next three laps and passed.
There are no major changes in the group compositions except for goalkeepers.
The cashiers who fought both of them yesterday are going to get a glimpse of today.
With Killara's goal, Mika Noronen makes room for Tomi Bear, and Rasmus Rinne replaces Ryan Zapolskin between the locks.
Perspective: A sad play going on in the ass
Sports Director Toivola wrote an incompatible sequel to the head coach Eisenakallio, writes Santtu Silvennoinen from Tampere.
It's a classic.
In 1976, Sylvester Stallone directed the film Rocky, in which he played the lead role.
The vice-chairman sensationally pitched a heavyweight to the world champion Apollo Creed.
Rocky gained great sympathy, even though he eventually lost the title game.
Thirty years after Rocky's first night, Mika Toivola wrote a restless ash story to Pori.
The anonymous and wooden-handed potato pack went on to surprise everyone at the 2006 SM Finals.
The team was full of anonymous but tough underdogs like Rocky.
There were white Indians, Pori Matt and Pele Pelto.
In the drop games, the players colored their heads red and cut the Iroquois.
The hopeful became a blonde.
TV presenter JP Jalo called coach Neumann.
He just took the winning silver.
Hope was one of the heroes.
Writer Toivola believes that the novelty of this period works in the same way as it did ten years ago.
The man who works as the head of athletics for donkeys has built a baton on the evil boys.
Semir Ben-Amor and Josh Gratton have gone on a long-distance run like Rocky's pig carcasses at the slaughterhouse.
Masi Marjamäen, Mikko Viitasen, Juha Kiilholman and Matti Kuparisen are the winners of the game.
Hoivola has forgotten that the lead role in Rocky VI is played by Pekka Eisenkallio.
Karri Kivi has christened the Iron Curtain as Sean Connery.
In Toivola's Rocky script, Eisenkallio is as horny as Connery would have been in the original 1976 film.
There's nothing else in the iron cliff but Rocky's nickname.
The game philosophy of the Iron Curtain does not include sprinting and small-scale tourism.
He appreciates a hard game, but it's a different thing to play hard than a pig.
Garret Stafford of Ässien last season took Tapparan Jere from Karelia.
He got 2 <0x2B> 10 minutes from the judges, but Eisenkallio put the man in the shower.
He didn't deserve a minute!
We only play with those who deserve it.
I do not accept such a game and it is not part of the ice hockey, the hotly visited Iron Ridge vibrated after the game for the Nation of the Snake.
This season's Eagles team is strangely built.
There are junkies, veterans, cops and co-workers.
There are virtually no key men in the best game age.
No wonder the head coach has complained about a skill shortage.
How much have you been able to influence player acquisitions, Pekka Eisenakallio?
The events of the last season affect procurement and, unfortunately, the situation on the market was rather narrow, Eisenkallio responded diplomatically.
Underneath the surface, cops.
The 1953 model is known to be interested in moving to Toivola as a sports venue.
Men's contracts will end in the spring.
The balance of the axes in the three leagues of the season is as many losses with a goal difference of 1-6.
I would not have liked to have written the sequel.
Olga Temonen plays Sipe Santapuk's mother
Olga Temonen reveals that if she had met her husband as a teenager, they would have nothing in common.
Olga Temonen will be directing her husband for the first time.
Yes, in the movie, I'm introducing my husband's friend's mother.
In a way, it feels crazy, the actress and producer Olga Temonen laughs.
She has been married to former Apulian bassist and director Tuukka Temose since 2008.
The couple has done a lot of work together in the past, but now Olga is acting in the direction of Tuuka for the first time.
Olga’s role in Apulanna’s early years in the film Make Us Beautiful is the drummer Sipe Santapuki’s mother Sirkka.
Circus clamps and supports his son, although this father, Risto (played by Lorenz Backmann), tries to be the voice of reason.
The more I get acquainted with my real role model, the easier it seems to be to play the role.
He's a great guy and I'm grateful to Tuuka for trusting me in the role.
Olga had met Sirka before the film project, but since then the duo have come a lot closer.
They've met, talked on the phone, communicated.
The circus has helped a lot.
We have gone through a lot of different angles in their history.
Luckily, the circus also understands that drama is a drama and maybe the truth needs to be a little colored.
Olga emphasizes that Sirkka was almost the only one in Heinola who blindly believed that Apulanna would become the biggest band in Finland.
In the '90s, it was a long and really scary one.
There was a pretty small probability that someone would actually succeed, but Sirka had some intuition, and he was right.
Olga says she had heard from Tuuka a lot about his youth before filming plans.
However, the parents’ stories have sometimes been a bit different.
So, if you’re a 15-year-old teenager, then how much parents really know what you’re doing.
Olga reveals that her own youth was completely different from Tuuka, known as Heinola’s famous skater.
Olga was an everyday and kind girl who had nothing to do with the movie Tuuka.
At the very least, he could have secretly fallen in love.
Olga says she has worked with Tuuka so much over the past 10 years that a big joint project doesn’t scare her.
Everything has always gone super well.
Now the entire production group is going to Heinola for a month.
However, the couple living in Iiti often plans to drive home for their young children because the distance is not too long.
We'll take over Heinola for a month.
They have welcomed us very warmly, only asked what streets and when they will be cleared.
Iron Sky 2 is Finland’s Most Expensive Drama
Directed by Timo Vuorensola, the film Iron Sky: The Coming Race has a budget of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>17 million.
The filming will begin in October in Belgium.
Director Timo Vuorensola will be filming Iron Sky 2 in Belgium in October.
The sequel to Iron Sky: The Coming Race will become Finland’s most expensive film of all time with a budget of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>17 million.
Previously, the title of Finland’s most expensive film was Jalmari Helander’s Big Game.
The up-and-coming Angry Birds animation will also go up beyond Iron Sky 2, with the film’s budget of over <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million.
Filming of the film, directed by Timo Vuorensola and produced by Tero Kaukomaa, will begin in October at AED Studios near Antwerp and last eight weeks.
Director Timo Vuorensola is leaving for Belgium next week.
The giant budget is not afraid.
I've been so sickly relaxed!
I'm so relaxed about the script because I know exactly what kind of movie it should be.
Everyone in the working group seems to realize that something unprecedented is being done.
It's great to go to Belgium.
Even if time is tight, there is no fear in the ass.
I’m more excited, and I can’t wait to be shown this film to the public,” he tells Iltalehde.
Initially, the budget of the film was planned to be 8-10 million, but with the development of the script, the budget also grew.
The budget is big, but it's also big.
However, 100 million would be intruded into the film, because every angle and effects are so expensive.
Now everything has been twisted so tightly that there is no looseness.
The film’s production company, Iron Sky Universe, launched a crowdfunding campaign and a bond to pay an annual interest rate of 4-8 percent on Wednesday.
The final interest rate is determined by demand and supply during the campaign.
Within two years, the company will repay the loan.
The film stars Udo Kier, Tom Green and Vladimir Burlakov.
Joint or cool?
Big logos return to shirts
The breasts of trendsetters have recently been decorated with large logos.
Some time ago, fashion-conscious dressers avoided clear and large logos like Crocs.
Advertising of a hoodie or t-shirt was seen as somewhat joint.
But times are changing.
Sportiness has become a real fashion megatrend, and so have old, well-known sports fashion brands such as Adidas and Nike risen to the pinnacle of coolness.
And as so often before, the boundary between funny and trendy is blurry: if something is already in the right junction, it begins to become ironic and cool.
First came the norm core trend, that is, fashion, in which the trend setters surprised by preferring as boring basic clothes as possible as a way to stand out from the mass.
Now, instead of the grey base collage, we put on the grid connectors buried at the bottom of the cabinet, in front of which the manufacturer’s logo appears.
The bigger and more traditional, the better.
In addition to the logos, for example, Adidas’ recognizable tracksuits, favorite team shirts and New York Yankees clips have made a comeback to catwalk fashion.
The Calvin Klein logos for beginners are now a cool detail.
The trend seems to be shifting from sports speakers to luxury brands as well.
For example, the breastfeeding of Versace’s autumn blouses makes it clear what a distinctive garment it is.
Would you be willing to present logos in your outfit?
A Russian politician published evidence: I didn’t get stuck in a tank hole for hours!
According to the allegations, a special incident would have occurred in Nizhni Tagil, where Russia Arms Expo 2015 was held.
In recent days, colorful allegations have been circulated in the Russian media that the Russian Emergency Ministry had to remove large-sized Zotova from the tanker loop for five hours.
Zotov has since done everything in his power to disprove the information.
He even posted a picture on his own public Facebook page, where he looks like he’s crawling out of the cage of a armored vehicle in pretty good moods and at least based on their pictures, it’s not about getting stuck or getting angry.
It's all bullshit.
Let's start with the fact that I didn't go inside the battle tank, it was a battle tank BMP-3.
I'm a former soldier myself, a colonel. I've served on the Ural.
I went in there, looked around and came out in peace, Zotov told Komosomolskaya Pravda.
“I didn’t get stuck and I didn’t really spend five hours in that position,” he said.
In the exhibition, Zotov explained to the Russian army TV channel that he admired the new technology of Russia, because he himself is a former professional soldier.
That’s why I was interested in what was inside the cars, I loved our technology.
And I came out through the backpack, he said.
I went with all my thoughts.
And in the next exhibition I will definitely go to all the tanks and all the trailers, Zotov promised.
Zotov also mocked the reporter who wrote about it as a fool.
One fool wrote, and everyone else repeated.
There was nothing like that.
I went in, and I came out.
I’m tall and rotting, but nothing like I was stuck somewhere in a tank, didn’t happen, he told Russkaya sluzhba novostei radio.
Zotov’s words are supported by the fact that no photographs of the alleged arrest have been published, even though a total of 50,000 people visited the exhibition in a few days.
The claim of Zotov's arrest started with a Bloknot.ru case where Zotov was told he was ripped out of a tank hole while trying and eventually threatened to shoot everyone around him if he doesn't get his pinch.
Later the Bloknot website published a follow-up story in which the organizers of the exhibition told about their own views.
Everyone is just used to the fact that soldiers jump out of armored vehicles quickly.
But MP Zotov, due to his large size, simply delayed when he came out.
But he never sat there for five hours, the exhibition coordinator Aleksandr Pisarevski told Bloknot.
Here are some of the favorites of interior bloggers
The 1962 Lassen candle of Mogens (1901-87) and Flemming (1902-84) looks like it would have been designed today.
A skeleton of steel is like a work of art, and that was it in the beginning.
Architectural tiles are known to grind candle shape for a long time and mathematically accurate.
It was initially presented only to the gentlemen's esteemed dinner guests.
Kubus candle holders are manufactured by the family company By Lassen, which maintains the design heritage of the famous brothers.
Candlesticks are handmade in Holstebro, Denmark, in versions of eight, four and one candle, in four different colors.

A leak has occurred in the Kittilä mine of the Canadian-owned mining company Agnico Eagle Finland.
The purified process water of the gold mine has leaked from the so-called enrichment sand basin to the stream.
According to the company, measures have been taken to correct the leak.
The basement contains neutralized enrichment sand and purified process water from the foaming process.
Typically, water is either pumped for reuse as process water or, as permitted, is diverted into the environment through a surface irradiation field.
The leak was estimated to be about 300 cubic meters per hour when it was detected.
According to the company, the quality of the leakage water meets the current permit conditions.
The rest of the material was not absorbed into the environment.
The leak was detected during an inspection round on Monday morning.
The leak has not been found to cause structural damage to the pool pavement structures.
The company says it is working closely with the authorities to monitor and correct the situation.
The mine employs about six hundred permanent workers.
Dansken Kuoppamäki: IMF warns to cut too much
The Finnish Country Report, published by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today, largely follows the views of the government and the Ministry of Finance.
The organisation struggled with structural reforms covering Finland in order to cope with economic problems.
According to the IMF, reducing overtime allowances and paid days off would support Finland’s competitiveness.
Reforms of the contract system as a whole and unemployment protection would be needed.
According to Pasi Kuoppamäki, chief economist at Danske Bank, we agree on structural reforms, but there are also small differences.
The IMF’s assessment has a lot of messages of support for the government’s actions, but on the other hand, there are also warning words about what should not be cut too much.
Such are, for example, infrastructure investments, Kuoppamäki tells the Economy.
The IMF also believes that growth projects should be implemented as soon as possible in order to support weak economic growth.
The IMF is forecasting 0.4 per cent economic growth for Finland this year, which will accelerate to 0.9 per cent next year.
In today’s new economic forecast, Danske predicts that growth will remain zero this year.
The IMF is a little more optimistic this year.
It may have been based on the latest findings.
This morning, Statistics Finland reported that the total production in the summer was a small increase, Kuoppamäki says.
Once again, less attention has been paid to the industry’s weakening confidence or other so-called softer gauges.
However, the difference is only a few percent decimal places.
Nintendo Recovering from Death Appoints New Leader
Tatsumi Kimishima, who died of cancer in July under Satoru Iwata, will begin work on Wednesday, Nintendo said on Monday.
Iwata has led Nintendo since 2002 and she was a popular and charismatic face in the gaming industry.
Iwata, for example, was responsible for the successful launch of the Wii console.
The choice of 65-year-old Kimishima is not a big surprise.
He was one of the names that were raised as possible followers of Iwat.
Kimishima is a safe choice to track Iwata’s footprints, according to Ace Research analyst Hideki Yasuda Reuters.
Kimishima is tasked with bringing Nintendo into the mobile games, but so that it does not eat the company’s bread on the side of traditional gaming consoles.
More and more minor asylum seekers arrive in Finland alone
As early as February 2015, the Swedish Immigration Agency acknowledged that hundreds of children who have come to the country are missing every year.
SVT.se and Dagens Nyheter have reported on their website, according to the Swedish Immigration Agency, hundreds of minors are missing in the country each year.
Juha Kannelmaa, Auditor of the Finnish Immigration Agency, explains what is the situation in Finland and how it has changed.
Is the situation in Finland the same?
How many "underground" asylum seekers are missing in a year?- A total of 156 asylum applications were made in Finland in 2013.
Nine of them disappeared.
In 2014, 196 similar applications were submitted and 11 of them disappeared, according to Kannelmaa.
The grounds for the disappearance may lie in the fact that the applicant has already been registered in another country applying the Dublin Regulation and has possibly been found to be of legal age there.
In this case, the applicant may be more attractive to lose than to continue the proceedings in Finland and be returned to the country responsible for the processing of the application.
Similarly, some of the missing will also be found later when they seek asylum from another Member State.
In 2014, there were a total of 3651 asylum seekers in Finland, of which 134 were granted a waiver decision on the grounds that the applicant was likely to have moved out of Finland, so that 123 adult asylum seekers disappeared in the past year, he says.
Is the number growing?
As of 6 September this year, we have received a total of 586 asylum applications from minors who have come alone.
The total number of minor asylum seekers missing this year is not yet available, but the number of minor asylum seekers is thus known and this has increased clearly, which is likely to also affect the number of missing persons, he stresses.
What about those who have a conversion decision?
Will they, for example, be covered by the “blind labour market”?
This is difficult to assess by the Immigration Agency, because the police are responsible for implementing the conversion decisions, Kangelmaa emphasizes.
Interior Minister Petteri Orpo (kok) has been concerned about the growing number of unregistered applicants.
He's taken action on this.
At a meeting of the EU’s interior minister, Orpo, who discussed refugee issues, said on Monday about practical measures to control the flow of asylum seekers through Sweden to northern Finland.
Nina Mikkonen sells Timo T.A's studio online - watch photos of the devices
Timo T.A. Mikkos, a media pioneer who lost his ability to work due to strokes, is now on sale.
Mikkonen’s husband Nina Mikkonen sells equipment on Huuto.net, which was once one of the most advanced professional tools in his field.
The online announcement was first reported by the online magazine Iltamakazin.
Today, a large part of the equipment has remained at the forefront of technological development.
In the digital media world, there are no TV shows for Betacam tapes anymore.
Nina Mikkonen is still confident that there will be those who are interested.
Of course, the hardware is no longer that up-to-date, but these are also needed as long as there is some old-generation material that needs to be digitized.
On the other hand, there are also a lot of enthusiasts - collectors and designers of their own studio, Nina Mikkonen reflects on IS.
The reason for the sale is that Mikkos are trying to move away from their current Stormylän home.
We can't take all the goods with us anywhere.
I'm slowly starting to invent and see where the goods are being handed over.
This is where I started, Nina Mikkonen says.
There is no longer any use for television and radio equipment.
After the recent strokes, it is clear that the man who has made a long career will not return to work.
Nina Mikkonen notes that now only goods and equipment are sold.
Timo T.A. Mikkosen’s actual life work was archived at the National Audiovisual Institute already in the summer, whose representatives came to pick up films and other material from Stormylä at the box office.
Traffic threatens to get worse than expected: Metro and trams can stop all Friday
Metro and tram drivers will decide today whether they will expand their efforts in connection with Friday’s declaration of intent.
The original plan was to stop subway and tram traffic only for the time of the announcement to be held on Friday.
In the afternoon, it is decided whether the traffic stops all day.
Chief trustee Pekka Hirvonen says the threat is high on the ground.
Nocturnal and intermittent cuts are aggravating drivers, so the government’s plans to cut the cuts raise some resistance.
Hirvonen thinks that stopping traffic all day is, however, a kind of dilemma.
If the metro and trams stop on Fridays, public transport in the metropolitan area is practically completely at stops.
According to VR, trains will not run between morning and evening on Friday.
On Fridays, there will be no near or long-distance traffic.
Trains departing before dawn will be driven to destinations.
According to HSL, most of the buses remain on the runway.
ACP members will be out of work on Friday morning from 3 a.m. to 3 p.m. on Saturday morning.
Probably a small number of buses can be driven, they will be driven by the executive force, HSL spokesman Pirkko Repo guesses.
Repo says HSL is unable to tell exactly which bus lanes will run on Friday.
Employers’ organisations will organise a large-scale demonstration at the Railway Tower in Helsinki on Fridays from 11am to 1pm.
Aftonbladet: Hungarian police used tear gas against refugees
The Hungarian police attacked hundreds of refugees with a tear gas.
The incident took place on the Hungarian-Serbian border, where many refugees are trying to get to Europe, according to the news agency AP.
According to Sky News, refugees have tried to break through the border fence.
The refugees, many of whom were women and children, fled in panic.
According to local media, Hungarian police would have also used plumbing against people.
Muslim Boy Arrested at School in Texas – Teacher Thinks His Own Clock Was Bombed
In Texas, Ahmed Mohamed, 14, has been arrested after his teacher held a watch he brought to his school as a bomb.
Mohamed told Dallas Morning News he only wanted to present his electronics hobby about the output.
However, one of the teachers thought the watch looked exactly like a bomb.
The police were called to the scene, and the situation eventually ended with the boy being taken to the juvenile detention cell in handcuffs.
Mohammed has not been found to have at any point claimed anything other than that he had made the watch.
However, it is still possible that the boy is accused of making a false bomb.
According to Mohamed, the police had said the watch looked like “film bombs.”
The clock is in the police station, but it was known to consist of a circuit board and a digital display, between which there were wires.
The incident happened last Monday and Mohamed was sentenced to three days of forced schooling.
His father is furious about the case and the country’s American-Islamic Council is wondering if the case is yet another indication of Islamophobia in the United States.
UK: Labour leader refuses to sing national anthem <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
The song asks God to protect the Queen, but Corbyn is an opponent of the monarchy.
Corbyn's own Labour party has also joined the criticism of the pro-government press.
This has offended the people, according to Labour MP Kate Green in a BBC radio interview.
Green said Corbyn should have joined the song.
Yesterday, the commemoration commemorated the battle of British Air Force pilots against the German Luftwaffe in 1940.
The Labour Party, in its official statement, defends Corbyn and stresses that he has shown his respect for the pilots by participating in the event.
We are all in huge debt of gratitude to the heroism of the Royal Air Force pilots.
He (Corbyn) stood respectfully during the national anthem, the statement emphasised.
Corbyn's election as party leader has divided the ranks of Labour.
Particularly among the MEPs are those who fear that he will expel moderate voters with their radical views.
Mr Corbyn supports unilateral disarmament, the cessation of austerity measures and the increase in public expenditure.
Corbyn is scheduled to appear in Parliament today for the first time as party leader during the Prime Minister's Question Time.
Corbyn has asked the public for proposals on what Prime Minister David Cameron should ask.
On Sunday, Cameron tweeted that Corbyn had been elected as the party's leader.
The Labour Party threatens our national security, our financial security and the security of our families, the Prime Minister tweeted on his own account.
Minnesota's cause of family death remains unclear - family's father awaited trial
South Lake Minnetonka police have been investigating a family murder in Greenwood, Minnesota, for a week.
The family of five was found dead at their home on September 10, and a few days later police confirmed that the shooter was the family's father, Brian Scott Short, 45.
After first shooting his wife and three children, Brian Short killed himself in the garage of the house.
They've been dead for days
The family was found after the school was concerned about the absence of children.
According to this announcement, the police went to the house for an inspection and found the dead of Short's family in a huge house.
According to StarTribune, it is possible that the victims had been dead for days.
A Millionaire’s House and a Successful Company
South Lake Minnetonka Police Chief Michael Siitar's case is still under investigation.
The motive for the blood clots is still unclear.
Shooter Brian Short was a successful entrepreneur and he had created his property on the social media site AllNurses.com for nurses.
In a 2014 interview with the StarTribune, Short reported that the site had four million different visitors per week.
I've been offered 50 purchase offers from the company over the last 10 years.
I've abandoned all of them.
However, I still have a lot of ideas that I want to implement.
Maybe I'll sell the company at some point, but not yet.
In 2011, Short’s family bought a house in Greenwood for $2 million in cash.
The house is advertised as a real estate site in Zillow for a collector's dream: the house has not only 12 rooms, but also a garage suitable for eight cars.
The case is underway
According to StarTribune, the father of the family was awaiting trial.
Achieve Test Prep, who offers a variety of prep courses, had challenged him for commenting on AllNurses.com.
According to Achieve Test Prep, no offensive comments were removed from Short’s website, and thus they had lost customers to their competitors.
However, according to StarTribune, it is very unclear whether the trial would have had a significant impact on Short's transactions.
Vesku Loiri offered cake coffee
In addition, the three owners were rewarded with the Finnish Hippos Horse Owner of the Month award.
This is great, Loiri commented with benevolence on her tribute.
The celebrated Fabrice Duo won the Derby on the first Saturday in September and earned 100,000 euros.
Artist legend Loiri was still puzzled by Fabrice Duo’s success in the big competition.
I still don't think it's happened.
According to Loir, the coach of the success horse Korpi gets a complete peace of mind when working with the horse.
Pekka orders and decides where to take the horse to compete.
And I'll hold my ass, Loiri laughed.
The NHL star's hilarious gesture - "The greatest gift ever made by an athlete"
Montreal Canadiens superstar P. K. Subban has donated $10 million (approximately <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6.7 million) to the Montreal Children's Hospital.
According to a hospital report, it is the largest individual donation ever made by an athlete to charity in Canada.
In addition, the 26-year-old Subban is committed to assisting the hospital in another fundraiser for the next seven years.
Subban signed a deal with the Canadiens a year ago worth eight years and $72 million.
Subban’s donation amount is therefore significantly higher than its $9 million year-on-year record.
As a reward for his donation, Subban receives a hall with his name from the hospital.
In the past, Canadians have been instrumental in helping local hospitals.
The long-time captain Jean Beliveau, who died a year ago, raised millions of dollars for the same children’s hospital, and Saku Koivu, another large hospital in the city, collected a huge amount of money to get the hospital a PET scanner needed for cancer research.
Japanese coffee shop can be ordered for wife's dinner - serves food only bikini and vinegar on top
Tea cafes are a big deal in Japan.
There is already a goat cafe, a canoe cafe, a vampire cafe, a hazelnut cafe and now a wife cafe.
It strikes the lonely, the sore and the hungry.
This was reported by Metro.
You can order a wife or husband for dinner at the Ore no Yome coffee shop in Tokyo.
It's a waiter who pretends to be a client's husband.
The "half" is selected from the list before coming to the cafeteria and he prepares and serves food.
The wife is facing just an ace and bikini on, the husband in tight cycling shorts.
The website provides the candidates with all the information about the length and weight of the mattress they prefer to sleep on.
Soon, 150 million vehicles have been connected to the network: the attacks against the security of cars began to be equipped
The Automotive Security Review Board (ASRB) also supports technological development and innovation in the industry, Intel said in a statement.
The Board is made up of top security experts from all over the world.
Researchers at ASRB will conduct ongoing security tests and inspections aimed at standardizing best practices and design recommendations for advanced cybersecurity solutions and products, as well as in the future.
At the same time, Intel announced the first version of best practices in cybersecurity.
The company will continue to update the report on the basis of ASRB’s research results.
International ICT research and consulting firm Gartner estimates that by 2020, about 150 million vehicles in traffic will be connected to the network.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road.
According to the same estimate, 60-75 percent of these vehicles will be able to consume, create and share online-controlled data.
“We can and must improve the cybersecurity of cars,” said Chris Young, head of Intel Security.
With ASRB, Intel can establish best-practices for security and support the view that cybersecurity is an important component in the design of every car connected to the network.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road, which makes the ASRB board the right idea at the right time.
Intel is one of the world’s leading innovators in data processing.
The Ford Focus RS costs about 52,000 euros in Finland!
The Ford Focus RS has been expected for years as the moon rises.
Finally, the car is also in sight in Finland.
Ford has released RS data now with car worldviews at the Frankfurt Motor Show.
Ford’s new four-stroke RS accelerates with its 2.3-liter, 350 hp engine in 4.7 seconds from zero to 100, with a top speed of 266 kilometres per hour.
In Finnish, the price is also interesting, initially it is said to be 52,000 euros.
The car is already available to order, but when the first cars arrive in Finland, Ford does not say in its announcement.
Favourite brand Kia presented two new features at the Frankfurt Motor Show - such as the new Sportage and Optima
More important than the two innovations in Finland is certainly the new fourth generation Sportage, with which Kia intends to capture a larger wing than before from the ever-growing crash truck market.
With its shapes, the Sportage, created by the new European design director Gregory Guillaume, is rounder than before.
The axle spacing and external dimensions have come one centimeter to the other and the car blows the air even more efficiently.
The engine range is similar in its main characteristics, but it has added a 1.6-liter turbo with 177 horsepower.
More about the Kia Sportage and its performance and consumption will be reported closer to sales revenue.
We will have to wait a little longer, as the new Sportage will arrive for us in the spring of 2016.
Even before the turn of the year, new Kia Optimat arrived in our country.
All of a sudden, the novelty doesn’t seem to have changed, but it’s a completely new car.
Kia intends to conquer the hearts of top-middle-class buyers with better driving features, lower noise levels and higher-quality equipment.
The Optimise is equipped with a 1.7-liter turbo diesel and a 2.0-liter petrol engine.
Next summer, the pace will be accelerating with the 2.0-liter turbocharged Optima GT.
At the same time with its arrival, the sale of the Optima farm begins.
Chisu returned to the stage - smuggled in a brave sledgehammer
Singer Chisu is involved in the concert Life for a child with other local stars.
The electric blue trousers have a looky, open neckline.
The house beautifully presents the singer's star's silhouette belt.
The crown of the whole is a golden metal band and a red lipstick.
During the three-year break, the singer who became a mother has been punished with light exercise and yoga.
Chisun's daughter's gonna be a year old.
The singer released their first single from their new album in August.
Going back on stage and in front of the public after a long break doesn’t really make me nervous.
I’ve missed anything to do with the music, the singer says.
In a few weeks, Chisu will release her fourth album, Polaris.
The new life situation has inspired me to make new songs.
At this point, I wonder if people will find my new album, Chisu thinks.
Kim Kardashian's Maternity Style Is Surprised Again - Now You Can See Her Breast
True-tv beauty Kim Kardashian gives speeches one after the other.
She presents her pregnancy and bra casually in sexy clothes, last night at one American time, when she left her sister Kourtney Kardashian with her husband Kanye West.
The black maternity dress is transparent to the breasts.
It reveals the skin-colored bras under the dress when lightning flashes.
Kardashian was last dressed in an Amazonian maternity dress when he visited his friend for dinner in New York just a few days ago.
The equipment was emphasized by black over-the-generation boots.
The third special maternity leave is as fresh as last week’s Friday, when the presentation was a pregnant fetus.
The Hard Laws of the Model World: No Homes, You're Lonely, Competition Is Horrible
Top model Mano Leloup wanted to correct the notion that the modeling world was pure glamour and champagne celebration.
He made his own documentary, Speaking Dolls, in which Leloup and his colleagues talk about a purely modeling business.
Harpeer's Bazaar brought together Leloup's six hard truths behind the scenes.
Every season starts from an empty place.
Even if in the previous season you had posed in the outfits of top designers, the new season starts again with castings.
And every season, new, fresh faces come to the industry, competing to work with crocodiles.
Models rarely have a place they can call home.
Work is a continuous journey and can go on for years so that there is a hotel room or an apartment in which fashion houses house their models.
If you are very young, and your mother cannot travel with you, loneliness can be unbearably difficult.
New York and Paris are the desired jobs, but they are the most stressful of all.
There is not just one kind of weight.
An agent in New York might ask for the kilos to drop, but in Paris they say you're too thin.
Getting a job is a risky game all the time.
On fashion weeks, models and designers are together all the time, and act as a support network at the same time.
When the fashion weeks are over, the difference is blissful.
Models want this industry because of the opportunities it offers, but they are flattered by the fact that everyone thinks the job is just a presentation of clothes.
Models also want to be personal.
The work makes the models feel like they are actors who have a role to play.
But in the work of the model, you can also express yourself.
Models at Tory Burch's show yesterday.
Fashion Weeks are being held in New York City, where designers will reveal their designs next year.
Changed style Roope Salminen presents unknown Apulanta musician in the film
Roope Salminen performs Antti Plattela, the band’s founder, in the film based on the early years of the band Apulanta.
Plattela founded Apulanna in 1991 with Toni Wirtasen, but left the company in 1994.
After all, this is a pretty big challenge for me, because I’m going to be a rap artist for 26 years, and in this movie I’m going to perform a 16-year-old guitarist, Salminen laughs.
I didn't want to meet the real Antti before the descriptions, because I want to make him my own interpretation.
Antti is clearly unknown to people about that bunch, so I think it's good that I learn his playing style only from the video.
I don’t want to imitate people.
The man with the band Roope Salminen and the Dogs is out of the box.
Punk maneuvers come naturally with a man.
In the punk season of the Stars, Stars, I'm sure a lot of people saw the first taste, just as if they've ever been to our queues.
Our presence has never been anything small, but we always go fully.
In Apulia, the main actors of the 1993-2004 bassist film Teukka Temosen, directed by Teit ou ou bueno, were announced today.
The band’s nucleus, which became known to the public, is presented to the general public by young actors who are still quite unfamiliar.
Rumpali Sipe Santapukki performs by Teppo Manner, singer Toni Wirta Tatu Sinisalo bassist Tuukka Temosta Iiro Panula.
Roope Salminen gave a hint about his future plague last night, when he told Snapchat that he was mysteriously preparing for the most important day of his career.
Roope has already posted on Instagram a picture of his new look, which he has had to perform for the film.
The Roope, previously seen in the five and the cleavage, has turned her face into silhouettes, and dyed her brown hair black.
Psychologist Advises: How to Tell Children About Refugees
In recent days, many parents have had to think about how to tell their child about the situation of refugees seeking to Europe.
Or is it worth telling at all?
There is no need to speak out forcefully, the SPR crisis group member, psychologist Ferdinand Garoff advises.
Younger children should be protected, for example, and not let them watch the news alone.
Young children are not always able to understand what they see, and it can get stuck in their minds and stress, he says.
However, if a child has encountered television news about refugees or heard about it from elsewhere, it is worth talking about.
It is good to go to the child’s point of view and listen carefully to what he or she asks.
The child’s fears may be surprising.
They may not be the ones your parents think you’re afraid of.
A child should not be frightened in vain, even if he is being harassed and frightened.
The younger child closely monitors the behavior of his parents.
If the parents themselves remain calm during the conversation, the children also feel safe.
Older children are likely to encounter a conversation about refugees at school, with friends, or online.
Parents should take the matter with them if it concerns the child.
The fact is that not all people in the world are doing well.
Parents, together with their children, can think about how our family feels about this.
Is the world, after all, a safe or secure place?
Parents may also have different aspects of upbringing – some may want to protect their children as much as possible from anxiety.
On the other hand, if you also talk about difficult things in the family, the child will get a model on how to deal with the difficulties ahead in life.
This can be of use to him in the future.

At the end of your own power?
You can still be a good parent for your child.
It is hard to stop the ball rolling in Vermo.
Perttu Pohjola made Apila's Pallosalama beat to the attack in mid-summer.
It only smashed victories and second-place finishes until at the end of July the Tampere smashed.
Since the slave was buried at the bottom, the coach suspected something was wrong and ordered his guards for some time from the veterinarian.
The explanation for the disappearance survived in the constellation.
The horse had a sore throat.
The disease was not the mildest, but it took two courses of medicine to swallow it.
Since Apila’s Ballosalama had to be on light exercise, Pohjola says she is positively surprised by the horse’s last run.
It was the second SE dam in Turku at its record time after Taruntule.
Apila Ballosalama was under a lot of pressure when she was able to drive normally for only a few weeks.
That little flexion at the end of those things was understandable, Pohjola says.
The coach assumes that a good competition made the Ori a blade.
The horse's reputation certainly went ahead of it, and I hope it would have been leveled as well.
Apila Ballosalama has been a so-called humorous horse.
When it has not been amused, it has been able to throw a fever without even the disease.
On a good day, however, there has been such a flash of lightning that the opponents have been amazed.
With speed, competitors can’t make it to Ballosalama, from which even warm-blooded rides can be discarded.
In the north, there is a pea run in Vermosa.
The difference, however, is how Apila Ballosalama agrees.
It is quite difficult at the time of departure and may even crawl under the trunk of the starting car and so on.
I hope the slave would be calmer than when Turu left.
Apilan Ballosalama can also come from the field when he is in good condition, and we are going to drive with it a victory, the coach promises.
This is why you can’t get rid of useless iPhone programs
Tim Cook, CEO of Apple.
At least some of the apps that come with Apple iPhones may be removed sometime in the future – but not all of them.
“Apple is likely to remove some of its own apps from iPhones in the future,” Tim Cook, CEO of the company, told Buzzfeed.
On Apple’s iPhone, there are a number of programs that are relatively rare to use: For example, FaceTime calls, Newspaper Kiosk, Health, Stock Exchange, Podcasts and Tips come to mind.
The latest addition to these programs is the Apple Watch, which came as a mandatory update to iPhones, although it is only needed for Apple smartwatch owners.
According to Cook, removing Apple programs is more complicated than it looks.
Some apps have been linked to something else on the iPhone.
If removed, it could cause problems somewhere else on the phone, Cook says to Buzzfeed.
Cook did not mention which of Apple’s iPhone apps work closely with other apps.
There are other programs that don’t work that way.
So with time, I think we can develop a way to let the user delete them, Cook added.
According to Cook, Apple is investigating the matter because the company does not want to waste memory space on users’ iPhones.
Euro area inflation slumped to 0.1% in August
Consumer prices in the euro area rose only slightly in August, or 0.1 per cent from year-on-year, the EU Statistical Authority Eurostat said today.
The rise in prices was driven down by the cheapening of energy.
Eurostat thus revised its forecast of 0.2% a few weeks ago, slightly downwards.
In July, the inflation rate was 0.2%.
So-called base inflation fell in August to 0.9 per cent in July from 1.0 per cent.
Eurostat’s forecast for base inflation was 1.0 per cent.
Energy in the euro area was 7.2 per cent cheaper last month than a year ago.
In all 28 EU countries, the average inflation rate was zero in August.
In July, the increase was 0.1%.
In the Eurozone, consumer prices rose by 1.4 per cent in August in Malta.
In Cyprus, inflation was at its lowest when prices fell by 1.9 per cent.
In Finland, inflation was 0.2 per cent according to the EU harmonised price index.
Inflation in the euro area remains a long way from the European Central Bank’s (ECB) target, which is a sharp rise in prices of 2% over the medium term.
The ECB forecasts an average inflation rate of 0.1% for the euro area for this year.
The increase will rise to 1.1% next year, the central bank forecasts in its new inflation forecasts at the beginning of September.
The U.S. Fed is trying to tighten monetary policy
The next U.S. recession will begin at its fastest in less than a year, but most certainly within three years after the country’s central bank Fed starts raising its interest rates again for a long time.
And in the financial market, the decline starts before the next recession.
The Fed has indicated that interest rates may start already this week and no later than the end of the year.
Thus, the next recession can hit at its fastest pace by next autumn and as the financial market’s price fluctuation before that.
Or at least, if the world’s largest economy and financial markets act as they used to do – and if they react to the tightening of the Fed’s cash flows as they have done before.
Such conclusions have been drawn by the market research strategies of Deutsche Bank in London, Jim Reid, Nick Burns and Seb Barker in their extensive study of long-term market and economic cycles.
The bank distributed a 60-page Long-Term Asset Return Study to its international major customers last week.
The strategies of the study and the report do not believe that they know exactly when the Fed will start raising its interest rates or what happens in the economy and the market after that.
Instead, they present economic statistics with cool facts and their calculations on how the economy and the market have behaved in the past during and after Fed interest rates.
In addition to historical observations, they look at what key economic and financial market variables are now in the same or different model as at the time of previous interest rates - and what might be the result.
It is clear that both the economy and the financial markets are now in a position to withstand the rise in interest rates as never before since the 1950s.
At the beginning of the recession, perhaps not a year.
Throughout the last summer and early autumn, the leaders of the Fed’s monetary policy and its timing have suggested that the time is ripe for interest rates to rise.
The first increase in interest rates in more than nine years may already occur this week.
The matter will be resolved on Wednesday and Thursday, when the so-called Open Market Committee of the Fed Board meets to decide on the matter at its two-day meeting.
The last time the Fed raised its so-called Fed fund interest rate in June 2006.
At the end of the two-year period, the Fed raised its interest rate from 1.25 per cent to 5.25 per cent by a series of relatively regular interest rates of 0.25 per cent.
The financial market symptom began in 2007 from the difficulties of the most risky housing finance in the United States, and a year later the financial crisis broke into a global judgment day nightmare.
The Great Recession occurred in 2009.
Last time, serious financial market and real-economy countermeasures started slower than has typically been the case since previous Fed interest rates.
Similarly, the trials then were harsher and worse than ever since the 1930s crisis.
Deutsche strategists have screened the ups and downs of the world’s largest economies as well as the financial markets since the 1950s and in some places since the early 19th century.
The Fed’s interest rates and their economic and financial impacts have been clarified since the 1950s.
The fastest time since the start of the recession has been less than a year, usually less than three years and on average less than three and a half years.
The rate hike in the financial markets has ended within two years of the start of Fed interest rates.
Since the early 1950s, the Fed has in turn raised and lowered its policy rate by a dozen different cycles.
Each time has differed in some respects from the other, and there are relatively few times under consideration, so it is hardly possible to draw any definite conclusion on the effects of the following interest rates.
It reminds me that many things are different this time.
And not just better.
Interest rates too low for too long
The root causes of the financial crisis may not have been unquestionably discovered even by decades of research.
But the three factors that led to the crisis and increased its destructive power may be somewhat undeniably clear:
1) The Fed, the euro area ECB and other major central banks held their interest rates too low in the 21st century.
They placed traces of the technology cube, and at the same time they grew the next one.
2) The amount of debt accumulated in the various parts of the financial and real economy over the decades, and so far too large, has grown even more as a result of the monetary policy impact of the central banks.
The largest debt bubble in the history of the economy to date was born.
3) In particular, the insanity of the financial economy almost unbounded in debt financing surged in most parts of the financial market from the largest exchange rate bubbles in the history of the economy to real estate, bonds and commodities.
Also, it is hardly a very harsh argument that the financial markets, rising to higher levels as the debt leeches become increasingly complex, were rarely dangerous and unstable and in a state of instability when the Fed and other central banks recently pushed interest rates upwards.
As a result of the debt-to-credit financial structures, the valuation bubbles did not last until after interest rates had started and the cost of debt financing had turned upwards.
The risks occurred during the financial crisis, followed by a major recession.
Bigger bubble and more debt
Deutsche strategists do not guess what will happen next, but give the subject of nukes by mentioning, for example, the following things:
1) The Fed and other major central banks have now held their monetary policy stance even lighter for even longer than before the financial crisis.
If interest rates were too low for too long before the crisis, they have now been even lower.
2) Indebtedness has long been not as crazy as it was ten years ago, but now debt is at its lowest cost literally cheaper than free.
Thus, the debt of the financial and real economy has not eased, but now there is a much heavier debt burden in different parts of the economy than before the financial crisis, or at any time before.
3) Liquidity issued by central banks more than previously inflated and cheaper has largely remained on the financial market and has plunged key types of securities and assets to their most expensive peak since or at any time before the financial crisis.
And the strategies are not only attuned to the warning signs of the financial market, but they also point out that even the US economy has not yet recovered from the financial crisis and the heaviest recession in decades to the model it has been before.
The euro area economy has hardly recovered at all.
In other words, the real economy is in an unusually weak condition, but the pressures and risks of the financial markets are comparatively greater than before the financial crisis, when the Fed then begins to tighten its money flows.
Perhaps the picture of the future of the Societe Generale strategist Albert Edwards is not as strange as it might seem.
He has been preparing the Bank’s international investor clients for the following full translations by Fed for a long time:
First the Fed raises interest rates, then the financial bubbles erupt - and soon it's time for the Fed to run out of the financial bubbles with even bigger QE cash flows.
Hewlett-Packard (HP), which manufactures computers and printers, intends to cut up to 33,000 jobs.
The majority of the deductions go to HP’s corporate service side, the company says.
In November, HP will be split into Hewlett Packard Enterprise and HP Inc., which is focused on sales of PCs and printers for consumers.
HP had its highest number of employees in 2011, when it had 350000 employees.
In October last year, the staff was reduced to 302000.
The company records non-recurring expenses of $2.7 billion (approximately EUR 2.4 billion).
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will cut between 25,000 and 30,000 employees.
Reductions on the consumer side will remain to 3300 within three years.
HP plans to move its operations to low-cost countries with 60% of its employees in low-cost countries in 2018.
The company says it has already balanced its business in such a way that none of its customers are responsible for more than ten percent of its revenue.
In the second year, its three most significant customers brought 65% of the business results.
iOS 9: How to get a new operating system for iPhone after Apple's update release
You can request a new operating system by going to the Settings app, clicking "General" and then selecting "Software Update".
If the update is ready, the phone gives you the option to download and then install it.
Some people have had problems since this installation, when the "Software update failed" error message appears on the screen.
To bypass this, it is recommended that users either wait for the worst flood to pass or try to update through iTunes.
The phone will guide the user in the final process.
This may include removing apps to get the status, but Apple has reduced this possibility by reducing the size of the update, and has also simplified the process with a new tool that suggests deleting apps and then reinstalling them when the update is complete.
You should make sure that your phone is charged or near the charger during an upgrade, so that the battery does not run out.
If the charging level is too low, Apple won’t let the update go, because if the battery runs out, it could lead to an update failure.

It’s also worth making sure that you’ve gone through our list of all the things you need to do before downloading, so things don’t go wrong, and how you can protect yourself from it if they go away anyway. iOS 9 brings with it new features of using the system, such as a much smarter version of the iPad, as well as a top-notch personal assistant, and a huge amount of new ones.
Yle: Minister Berner has served on the board of the tax haven company
According to Yle, Minister of Transport and Communications Anne Berner has served as a member of the Board of Directors of the tax haven company.
I agree with the company’s so-called tax planning.
It is a Luxembourg-based company called Saltri II LuxCo, to which Berner was appointed as a member of the Board in December 2012.
According to the Luxembourg Trade Register, Berner is still officially a member of the Board of Directors.
Berner himself said he had filed a resignation notice in May this year.
I checked it out, and it's enough that I've filed for divorce.
It is almost impossible to manage and control that the registration chains take place on an agreed schedule, Berner says in an interview with Yle.
Membership after the merger
The holdings of the Swedish company Kährs are managed through the Luxembourg company.
Kährs is a car park manufacturer that merged with the Finnish car park manufacturer Karelia-Upoflor in 2012.
Berner served on the board of Karelia-Upoflor between 2010 and 2013 and, after the merger, on the board of Kährs and the Luxembourg company.
According to Yle, Kährs’ holdings are carried out in Luxembourg through a multi-stage ownership structure.
Berner tells Yle that he accepted the membership of the Luxembourg-based company Kährs as the second largest owner.
This owner is Hartwall Capital.
I've been a member of the board of Karelia-Upoflore owned by Hartwall Capital.
The company was looking for a partner who was found in Sweden.
This company was owned by a capital investor with a company in Luxembourg.
I knew that my task was to take care of the realisation of the interests of the Finnish family company.
It is important that we ensure that the incomes of our Finnish companies are taxed in Finland and that the starting point was secured in this context,” says Berner.
Berner tells Yle that Hartwall Capital's assets do not involve tax planning.
According to Berner, the complex ownership structure for tax havens is due to the fact that the largest owner of Kährs’ capital fund, Triton, already had a Luxembourg holding company ready for ownership.
In Espoo, a reception centre maintained by the company opens
The first reception centre for adult asylum seekers maintained by the company will be opened in Espoo, Otaniemi.
The reception centre is ready to pick up the first 100 residents as early as this evening.
The number of places can increase within a week to a maximum of 300-400 people.
The Immigration Agency establishes a reception centre on the property of the former University of Salvation.
It is operated by Luona Oy, whose business is in particular the provision of healthcare and medical services.
The City of Espoo, the Immigration Agency and Luona Oy agree together on, among other things, the centre’s security arrangements.
STTK prepares alternative work-life harassment package
The STTK is preparing an alternative package for the government’s labor pressures.
The organization also wishes to participate in other employers’ centres.
According to President Antti Palola, attention is currently being paid in Friday's statement.
Thereafter, alternative means of lowering the price of labour will be returned.
Everyone understands that life will continue after Friday, Palola noted the organization’s management meeting with a pause to reporters.
Mr Palola said that the Central Economic Union (EC) does not have the capacity to hold discussions.
Economists of the STTK have calculated that the change security contained in the government’s competitiveness package will cost the employer an estimated EUR 30 million, while the other side of the package is EUR 2 700 million.
I don’t know if the party has a terrible passion to have a conversation if there is a one-hundred relationship available.
Palola: Negotiation was constructive
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central) has hoped for alternative proposals by Wednesday, as the government is due to give its own package to the parliament and begin preparations for reforms.
She didn’t know if the timetable was realistic.
According to Palola, there is a dialogue with the government, and it has been constructive for him all along.
According to Palola, the STTK’s staff center is a painful place, especially on Sundays.
The organization requires the government to withdraw from the mandatory legislation that would allow it to implement part of the coercion.
According to Palola, the STTK does not warm up to the preparation of an alternative package with the SDP, which was presenting the matter.
Employers will meet in Helsinki on Friday to oppose the government’s work-life repression package presented last week.
As part of the package, salaries for the first days of illness will be cut, overtime allowances will be halved, Sunday allowances will be reduced to 75% and holidays will be shortened.
The STTK underlines that central organisations have called on employers to express their views, and that it was not intended to organise strikes.
Akavan Fjader thanks
The Chairman of the Committee, Mr Fjäder, welcomes the announcement by the STTK of the preparation of an alternative package.
According to Fjäder, the STTK will now be on the same lines with Akava, as Akava has been devising an alternative model for government proposals for a long time.
Fjäder hopes that the SAK will also be included in the alternative package, because without the SAK, the package will not be comprehensive enough.
Akavana President Sture Fjader hopes that the SAK, headed by Lauri Lyly, will come to prepare the proposal as an alternative to the cuts.
Antti Palolan STTK said earlier on Wednesday that it was preparing new proposals.
We want change protection and working time banks.
Akava announced on Wednesday that it has been preparing its own proposal for a long time, with which it is ready to negotiate a 5% competitive jump as an alternative to cuts.
Akava has always been ready to negotiate, and we have been writing an alternative model for government proposals for a long time.
We are ready to view the terms of service as part of the contract.
In return, we want change protection and working time banks,” says President Sture Fjader.
Fjäder hopes that the SAK will also come to Akava, as the STTK did earlier on Wednesday.
Without the SAK, the package is not strong enough.
We are now working together on a model for the country’s government and employers,” Fjäder says.
The Bureau will meet on Thursday at 3 p.m. to take a decision on the content of the agreement.
"The same boat, common charcoal, talcs" - playing bingo while talking to Sipilä in the evening
The Green Left of the University of Tampere
Tampere University’s Green Left’s Viva Bingo Coupon for the evening.
The Prime Ministers have previously held exceptional speeches during the rebellion and wars in Mäntsälä.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä speaks to the nation exceptionally about the state of the Finnish economy on Yle channels on Wednesday evening at 21.05.
A similar request for the Prime Minister’s previous speech must go back to 1932, when Pehr Evind Svinhufvud was Prime Minister when he gave a famous radio speech, which marked the beginning of the end of the rebellion in Mäntsälä.
After that, the president and the ministers gave a number of radio speeches during the Winter and Continuation Wars.
In the 1990s, Esko Aho gave a New Year's speech to President Mauno Koivisto, but it was more of a ceremony.
In the autumn of 1976, President Urho Kekkonen gave a televised speech to stop the strike of train operators.
The Monarchist Monarchist Monarchy
The onion speech has aroused criticism all day long and speculations about what to expect.
Paavo Arhinmäki, the president of the left-wing union, said on Twitter that "Sipilä could give his speech on the state of the nation in parliament as a prime minister's announcement, so that the speech could also be discussed".
According to Greenville Niinistö, "the single call has already been seen.
Leadership is about dialogue, listening to people.
Erkki Tuomioja of the SDP condemned on Facebook that "monarchist opinion: the prime minister will tell the people what is best for them".
SDP President Antti Rinne challenged Sipilä's dialogue: "Soonly six months after the elections.
Not a single performance by the Prime Minister in the media with the opposition.
It's been tried.
What are you afraid of <0x40>JUHASIPILA?
Public Service (Public Service)
According to the State Council’s office, Sipilä’s speech has been recorded in advance and lasts about 15 minutes.
According to SAK, this was commented in a live broadcast by SAK President Lauri Lyly and EC CEO Jyri Häkamies.
The general public has been criticised for the presentation of the Sipilä speech.
We considered this and noted that it is part of the public service’s mission to promote comprehensive publicity throughout Finland, according to Ismo Silvo Yle, Director of Publications.
Like Me in the Tammels
The speech has also caused irritation.
In the evening, dinner is enjoyed in good time, the children are combed and dressed to their best.
The mother puts on the nicest seat and the father adjusts the tie to her neck.
At 9 a.m., we are silenced on television like we used to be at the time of the Tammeloids,” writes blogger Saku Timonen.
“Does Prime Minister Sipilä also say in his speech why the Finnish government is sitting in tax havens with millionaires hiding their capital, who have drafted charity laws for their fellow taxpayers and at the same time claim to the people that it is necessary to cut back when the state has the money?”
From what Sipilä says, one guess is presented by the green leftist Viva of the University of Tampere.
It has posted a bingo attached to Facebook.
Do we hear tonight about the same boat, the common coal, the debts of living and the crew?
Coupons and pens ready, at 21.05 it starts and the channels are TV1, Radio Suomi and Yle Arena.
Ahtisaari in the Guardian: Western countries rejected Russia's proposal to expel al-Assad
More than three years ago, the Western countries rejected Russia’s offer to get Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to step down, President Martti Ahtisaari told the Guardian.
According to Ahtisaari, the U.N. envoy of Russia proposed a plan that would have left al-Assad in an elegant manner after a while.
However, the Western countries did not accept the proposal because they believed that al-Assad would fall within a few weeks.
Ahtisaari discussed the Syrian crisis in 2012 with the five permanent members of the UN Security Council.
According to Ahtisaari, the Russian ambassador Vitali Tshurkin listed three points to him in the bilateral debate: the opposition was not allowed to arm, the opposition and al-Assad had to be immediately contacted and the resignation of al-Assad’s power had to be carried out with restraint.
I know Tshurkin.
We may not agree on all things, but we are able to talk openly.
I told him what I did there and he said that sit down, Martti, so I'll tell you what we have to do, Ahtisaari remembers in an interview with the Guardian.
The diplomats did not comment.
Ahtisaari said he had conveyed Tshurkin’s message to the United States, Britain and France, but nothing happened.
Tshurkin did not confirm the content of the discussion to the newspaper, but Ahtisaari said there are no two words about it.
The UN diplomats also refused to comment on Ahtisaari’s claims, but said al-Assad’s forces had already committed several mass murders at the time and that key opposition groups had refused all agreements that he would have remained in power.
Sir John Jenkins, the former head of the British Foreign Ministry’s Middle East Department, is hesitant about Ahtisaari’s speeches because, according to his experience, Russia was at no point ready to discuss al-Assad’s fate.
Officially, Russia has supported al-Assad throughout the war.
The weakest point in Ahtisaari’s claim is that Tshurkin spoke with Moscow’s authorization.
If he had told me about Tshurkin’s speech, I would have replied that I would like to hear the same from President Vladimir Putin so that I can take it seriously.
According to Jenkins, he would have suspected, even in that case, that it would have been Putin’s turn to hold power with some supporter of al-Assad.
The refugee flow of our own actions
During the negotiations on the island of Ahtisaari, some 7,500 people had died in the Syrian crisis.
The UN estimates that the number of deaths exceeded 220,000 at the beginning of the year.
More than 11 million people have had to flee their homes due to the war.
We should have prevented this disaster.
The influx of refugees into Europe is our own business.
I see no choice but to take good care of these poor people.
We are now paying the bill that we ourselves caused, Ahtisaari tells the newspaper.
Asylum Seekers Organisation Centre in Turku Tornio
The asylum-seekers organisation centre planned by the Government of Northern Finland is likely to be set up in Tornio.
The centre would be established in the city centre in the vacant Tornio joint-venture building.
The Ministry of the Interior has been looking for a suitable location to better manage the flow of refugees from the Swedish border.
Helsinki Sanomat announced on Tuesday that the board had already decided to present the school building as a temporary solution to the ministry.
According to Sauli Hyöppisen, vice-president of the Tornio City Council (left), this is not true.
When the whole council was not together and part of the party wanted an official decision, we decided to invite the council meeting next Monday to decide on it, he clarifies to the STT.
There were 36 of the 43 delegates at the meeting.
Thirteen delegates opposed the centre.
On that basis, the decision could be expected to be positive, Höppinen says.
According to Mayor Timo Nousiainen, the city was contacted on Monday, and there was a quick response.
There are an estimated 500 asylum seekers at a time.
The expert has gone to check that it could be suitable for such use.
The location is a couple of hundred meters from the border, so it would be functional in that sense too, says Nousiainen.
Sipilä still hopes for an alternative to bullying from the labour market
According to Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (central) the halving of holiday funds in public would only take care of part of the government’s goal of calculating the price of work.
However, he said that the government would be happy to accept the alternative package if the social partners managed to agree on such an agreement.
Sipilä told reporters in parliament that he had not been in touch with social organizations.
He also did not know how seriously the organizations were looking for alternative means to the government’s reported labor pressures.
If such an agreement arises, we will certainly welcome it as part of the overall package.
In Sipilä’s view, the halving of holiday funds would be a means of action, since it would affect almost all employees, unlike, for example, the government’s planned Sunday cuts.
Labour organisations could agree to cut vacation funds because they are registered in collective agreements instead of the law.
The government will report to the parliament next Wednesday about the pressures on working life as a government reporter.
According to Sipilä, the proposals of the organizations should be known before this.
This is not the final frontier either.
The legislative work will then go on the move, i.e. the train is on the move and it is getting more difficult all the time.
Now's a good time.
It doesn’t take long for such things, if there is a will, Sipilä formulated.
The list, which was published last week by the government, includes the conversion of the finalist and the helatorstain into unpaid days without shortening the annual working time.
In addition, wages for the first days of illness will be cut, overtime allowances will be halved, Sunday allowances will be reduced to 75% and holidays will be shortened.
The reforms are being implemented as mandatory legislation beyond trade unions, which has sparked a lot of criticism.
As a result of the actions, the unions are organising a mass demonstration on Friday, in addition to which a number of trade unions have declared political strikes.
Tohmajärvi Council approves expansion of mahlahalli stockpile
The Tohmajärvi Board unanimously approved the expansion of the Nordic Koivu Oy’s holdings, or the juice hall stock.
The criticism was caused by the fact that the project is larger and more expensive than was originally discussed.
There is also a busy schedule.
It was also a little surprising that the need for a subscription had not been known a year ago when it was decided on the previous expansion.
At this stage, the extension of the stock by 400-450 square meters was approved for the investment programme, but the fund will be decided at a later date in the context of the interim report.
An investment of EUR 150,000-200,000 was still on the agenda, but at the meeting the technical director Erkki Ikonen said that the price will be estimated at EUR 300,000.
The investment was supported on the basis that it brings work and tax revenue to the locality.
The municipality has no risk, as the company pays the investment in rent, Vesa Väistö (ps.) explained.
Karjala language in Joensuu
The city government eased its sturdy stance to bring cattle-language farm villages to the centre of Joensuu.
The new decision is important and rightly considering the Karelian tradition in the whole province.
Joensuu does not declare itself as the capital of cattle language because it has no historical basis and cattle language is not a natural part of the identity of the region.
The language spoken in the Joensuu region has been more of a part of the Eastern Savannah massacres.
After the new decision, there will be no cattle-skinned villages in the city centre.
However, the city of Joensuu is, on a case-by-case basis, also ready for the use of cattle language, for example in infotainment and tourism marketing.
The same attitude the city recommends to all other actors.
Although Joensuu is officially a one-language municipality, it is also worth considering the use of cattle language in an aquatic way now that multiculturalism is living and changing strongly in North Karelia.
The language of Karelia is still the special features of the province, as well as the idea of Joensuu as the forest capital of Finland.
Both of them can be well used for the benefit of the many types of marketing in the province.
Discontinuation of train connections cuts the vitality of the province
Cuts in train connections will hit the province's vitality with a hard hand.
Transport links have a direct impact on the province’s business and competitiveness.
And that affects whether it is possible to live and work here at all, Joensuu Mayor Kari Karjalainen wonders.
He also raises the issue of air transport, which has also been followed several times in the report.
It is important for the province as a whole that we do not reduce our ability to cope with government measures, as we are now doing.
We should look at the impact of these cuts on employment, for example, says Karjalainen.
The deterioration of traffic connections poses an additional challenge to the University of Eastern Finland in terms of attractiveness.
Of course, the better services there are here, such as transport connections and housing conditions, the easier it is to get students and employees, says Jukka Mönkkönen, the head of the University of Eastern Finland.
He notes that poor transit connections also affect the research team, which is very mobile and travels a lot because of the research.
Recruitment manager Marko Junkkarinen says that already at the moment marketing the university towards Western Finland is difficult, because traffic connections are weak in the cross-sectional direction.
About half of the students at the University of Eastern Finland currently come from outside of Eastern Finland.
About 10-20% of them are from New Zealand, which is partly due to direct train connections.
The river became one of the voices of Siu's wars
Joensuu City Government’s view of the provincial Siu sote project is apparently unanimous, but one of the sora’s voices is.
Pentti Keskisalo, a member of the city council (sd., in the picture), presented the entire project to the board at a meeting on Monday, but his presentation ended unsuccessfully.
The Board approved the draft decision of Mayor Kari Karjalais, which will be revised in early October before the City Council meeting, which will issue a final opinion on the project at the same time as all other municipalities.
One train ride from Kotka to Kouvola will end next year
Passenger transport from Kotka to Kouvola will continue in the future, albeit with less than one pair of trains.
There will be changes in passenger traffic between Kotka and Kouvola next March.
One pair of trains leaves, but still five times a day you can get from Kotka to Kouvola and vice versa.
The reductions are due to state savings.
For the next four-year period, the Ministry of Transport and Communications’ train purchase funds will be reduced by EUR 12.3 million.
The quietest routes will be completely discontinued.
VR will make new schedules by the end of the year.
They shall enter into force on 27.3.2016.
The boys climbed to the roof, one didn't get down, the guys were livin' from the place
The rescue team rescued a 12-year-old climber from the cliff to the roof who couldn’t even get his help down from the roof.
The situation arose in Tornionmäki Ketoti at half past six on Tuesday night.
There is an old two-storey wooden house with no stairs leading to the roof.
It did not stop the crowd of boys who decided to climb the roof of the house along the mast of radio amateurs next to it.
The rest of the boys got down the same route, but one didn't.
As a result, the others slumped from the scene and passers-by alerted the rescue facility to help vetoers safely get back to the ground.
FedEx’s business profit doubles, lowers tax year 2016 outlook
FedEx reported staggering results in the last quarter, and the supply giant cut its year-round earnings forecast, due to weaker demand for freight services and higher costs for its land services.
The company also said it intends to hire around 55,000 seasonal workers during the holidays.
At this time last year, FedEx announced that it is hiring 50,000 seasonal workers during the holidays.
Its share fell about 2.5 per cent in the opening auction 45 minutes before Wednesday’s opening hours.
FedEx Corp. says it expects $10.40-10.90 for the fiscal year ending next May, which is 20 cents lower than the previous forecast.
Analysts expected $10.84, according to a FactSet survey.
The smaller outlook came despite an average price increase of 4.9%, which will come into effect on 4 January, and despite the higher surcharges starting in November for heavy or large parcels.
The company said it expects revenues to grow more and more from the previous year, as they have cut costs, turnover has grown and e-commerce is growing.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company is "performing steadily taking into account the expected weaker economic conditions, especially in production and global trade."
Plans for pay for the holiday were announced the day after competitor UPS said it plans to hire 90-95,000 extra workers, about the same amount as it hired last year.
In the quarter ended August 31, FedEx’s profit was $692 million, which is 6% more than last year.
The earnings per share came to $2.42, which remains from the average forecast of $2.44. Zacks Investment Research conducted a survey of 12 analysts.
Revenue rose 5 per cent to $12.3 billion.
In Zacks’ survey, six analysts were waiting for $12.23 billion.
FedEx has suffered in recent years from a decline in international priority transport, which has halted the development of its Express unit’s turnover.
However, the increase in e-commerce has improved the results of FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, the unit’s turnover increased by 29 per cent, but the operating income was basically the same due to the higher package costs and own insurance.
The revenues of the Express unit were better due to higher basic charges, while the business profit in freight operations was reduced by higher labour costs.
In the opening auction, about an hour before the opening hour, FedEx shares fell by $3.85, or 2.5 per cent, to $150.15.
On Tuesday, FedEx closed 11 percent of the decline for this year and 17 percent below the June 11 record.
This week, U.S. Central Bank decision-makers will sit for two days at a long-awaited meeting around a giant mahogany table to decide whether it’s time to raise the lead rate for the first time in almost a decade.
At the other end of the central bank’s decorative, double-storey meeting room is a wall painting from the United States.
The map is a reminder that the President of the Central Bank, Janet L. Yellen, and her colleagues must put the economic interests of the nation above all else.
Congress has placed a dual responsibility on the shoulders of the central bank: they must maximize U.S. employment and keep prices stable.
After the Great Depression, however, the leaders of the central bank have accepted that there is also a third unwritten mandate: financial stability.
It is precisely this third requirement that can be a decisive factor in a decision to be announced on Thursday, which is so strict that it cannot even be predicted: a decision on whether the US economy is ready to be deflected from a record-breaking stimulus, which from the end of 2008 onwards has remained at almost zero.
While most of the data shows that the economy is growing steadily, the recent slump in the global financial markets may have made the precautionary officials of the central bank even more frightening in terms of increasing the instability. What would be the impact of the negligence?
“Understandably, the labour market and inflation are the first and most important things to follow,” says Lindsey M. Pegza, chief financial expert at Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
“However, I believe that if they are looking for a justification to keep the interest rate going, the increased uncertainty on the world market has enough valid reason to wait,” he says.
The Central Bank's decision has not been agreed, which is already causing nervousness to the economy.
According to a recent study by Bloomberg, about half of economists predict that interest rates will rise this week.
The financial market, on the other hand, expects the central bank to delay the withdrawal, as the key indicator indicates that the chance of growth is only about 30%.
This refers to a decline in the securities market if the central bank raises the level, unless the decision-makers then manage to soften the blow by promising that the next raise will not happen soon.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average index rose 228.89 points, or 1.4 per cent, to a new figure of 16,599.85.
The recovery brought with it the expectation that the central bank will maintain its level this week,” said John Lonski, chief economic expert at Moody’s Capital Markets Research Group.
“It’s surprising if the central bank raises interest rates right now,” he says.
If policymakers raise interest rates, “they have to put a lot of effort into their lineup to support the financial markets so they don’t panic.”
Other experts argue that a higher level would calm the financial market, as it would eliminate uncertainty about when the central bank will operate.
Just a month ago, it seemed that the central bank was raising the interest rate by a quarter this month, thus taking the first small step towards a slow tightening of the monetary situation that would confirm the stability of the US recovery.
Yellen has said in the spring and early summer that he expects the level to rise this year despite the liberals demanding more economic development in their complaints.
Although the creation of new jobs slowed in August, the growth of the labour market has been stable this year.
Unemployment fell last month to 5.1 per cent, the lowest figure in seven years and close to the level considered by the central bank to be the limit of full-time employment.
The increase in wages has shown signs of stimulus.
Although inflation is still below the ECB’s annual target of 2%, the central bank’s decision-makers say the reason for this is the temporary effect of a significantly lower oil price.
The economy “clears even higher interest rates and also needs them in view of the tight labour market situation,” says Ian Shepherdson, chief economic expert at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, financial markets around the world shook last week as China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell as much as 16 percent from its May record as investors feared China’s slowing economy would slow global growth as well.
The market has recovered somewhat this month, and the Dow index is now almost 10 percent below the May peak.
For central bank decision-makers, the market’s millerry is an additional factor in the complex equation, which tells us when interest rates should be raised.
“Without these financial market events and the news of the weakness of the Chinese economy in recent weeks, decision makers would push the level at this meeting,” said Stephen D. Oliner, a specialist at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former central bank official.
Now he predicts that decision makers will wait at least a month to get a better idea of the impact.
“The potential impact on the U.S. economy is still rather ambiguous, and they don’t have much information at their disposal about the consequences of the events in China,” Oliner said.
The well-being of the international economy is not the central bank's main concern and should, in principle, not affect decision-making.
In practice, however, the Federal Central Bank has become the world’s monetary authority.
In recent years, the influence of the central bank has been enormous.
In 2013, the suggestion by the then president, Ben S. Bernanke, that the central bank could “think” about increasing the amount of money caused a revolution in markets around the world.
In a world where markets and economies have been increasingly cohesive, central bank officials are expected not only to follow developments elsewhere, but also to consult other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the world economy.
The central bank’s decision-making process is “more art than science,” says Zachary Karabell, Head of Global Strategy at Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank in Richmond, Virginia, noted this month that "the central bank has previously overreacted to the movement of the financial markets, which has seemed to be separate from the fundamentals of the economy."
The Federal Open Market Committee, which makes decisions, has called for interest rates to be raised, and Lacker, a member of the committee entitled to vote, draws as an example on the 1998-99 decisions.
The Asian economic crisis caused the central bank to cut its benchmark by 0.75% during the three meetings “despite its limited, identifiable impact on U.S. economic growth,” Lacker says.
A year later, the central bank canceled these cuts.
The central bank should prioritise economic stability only during a major crisis, like when the market collapsed in 2008, says Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England interest rate committee.
The last millerry doesn’t even come close to its level, Posen says.
“No one wants a situation where interest rate hikes are feared because the market is deteriorating,” said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act (Federal Reserve Act) still contains a two-sided requirement, and does not mention economic stability. As long as this is the case, I do not think they should anticipate it.

Brazil’s Childhood Disease Association in Rio Grande promotes a healthy diet for infants
The Brazilian pediatrician SPRS has invented a shocking way to get women to understand the importance of good nutrition during breastfeeding by publishing pictures of babies breastfeeding, painted with descriptions of unhealthy food.
Breast milk consists of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates, which give babies all the nutrients necessary for the development of a strong immune system.
Pregnant women and new mothers need extra energy, so they are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories.
However, a new study suggests that increasing the number of calories is not the only dietary change that mothers should make.
A recent study led by Baylor College of Medicine Professor Robert Waterland revealed that the healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genetic manifestation of their babies and protects babies from tumor development.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet was found to have a negative effect on the child’s immune system.
The Seven-Channel Sunrise program is a favorite on TV shows, despite the Nine-Channel’s efforts to announce the leader’s revelation in the Today Show program.
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson’s rush to Canberra to announce the aftermath of the Liberal Party leader’s revelation failed to increase Today’s viewership.
The Nine-Channel Morning Show was broadcast from the country's capital after Malcolm Turnbull succumbed to Tony Abbott.
The competing Sunrise program, run by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was stuck in London as part of its week-long series of international broadcasts, including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
The mid-term period did not seem to disturb Australian television viewers, as the average viewership of the Sunrise was 397,000 in five state capitals, compared to Today’s number of 339,000.
Today's average rose slightly compared to Monday's (317,000) and last Tuesday's (283,000), but it was still lower than last Thursday's (343,000).
Today has caught Sunrise in the last few months.
In August, Today's average was 318,000 and Sunrise 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference varied between 40,000 and 50,000 viewers.
As of September, the Sunrise average has 349,000 viewers, while Today has 314,000.
This is the most interesting event of the morning.
The wind is blowing this morning, not just in this House!
Karl and Lisa are doing well, thank you for asking!
Published by TODAY on Monday, September 14, 2015
The big news for the Seven-Channel was the 800-word series featuring former Packed to the Rafters star Erik Thomson, an astonishing premiere.
The new drama series, which garnered an impressive average of 1,219 million viewers, tells of a recently widowed father who decides to move to the New Zealand coast with his two children.
Critics have wondered if Thomson would be the bearer of the popular series on its own without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
Last night's results gave this one real certainty.
Seven-channel The X Factor was a strong favorite with 1,136 million viewers, easily winning The Block (838 000) and TBL Families (726 000).
Seven had a dual fate on the second night of The Chase Australia.
Andrew O'Keefe's first half-hour (17-17.30) of the new visual program drew an average of 446,000 viewers.
The second half-hour (17.30-18) raised 623,000 spectators - which was small enough to win the Eddie McGuire Hot Seat (613 000).
On Monday night, The Chase Australia’s first half-hour viewer averaged 520,000 viewers, and the second half-hour was a staggering 720,000.
The average Hot Seat was 620,000.
The fall in the second night viewer average in The Chase Australia gives Nine Channel confidence that Hot Seat will eventually become the most popular show at 5:30 p.m.
The Chase Australia replaced the Million Dollar Minute program, which failed to reduce the McGuire viewership.

The final trio agrees with Dad that Sam Wood is the perfect guy, but who does he pick?
The secret has been revealed?
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay, and Snezana Markoski may have accidentally revealed who will win The Bachelor series.
The woman’s identity has been kept a secret, with whom Sam Wood ends up in The Bachelor.
The three remaining girls really don't know who got the last rose.
However, when we spoke with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markosk and Lana Jeavons-Fellows the day before the three became two, they could inadvertently give a hint of the winner’s identity.
Sam Wood's lips are sealed before Thursday's final
All three of the women were cast out as telling how perfect Wood is, mentioning his sense of humor, his ambitions, his family values, and his positivity as to why they would like to be his partner.
When asked, however, "If Wood's last rose is not for you, to whom should it go?", their answers might provide a clue as to who won the boy's heart.
Both the Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski quickly cited Mackay as the best option for Wood after themselves.
The relationship between Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood has been uncomplicated since day one.
"From the moment I walked into the house, the (Sarahin) energies and Sam's energies felt quite compatible, and that idea was on my mind throughout the series," Jeavons-Fellows said.
"Sarah is really close to the ground, it's fun to be with her," Markoski added.
I've seen them together, and there's chemistry between them.
They seem to be nice and relaxed together.
Sarah Mackay thinks she and Sam Wood are a very good couple.
Mackay said last week's home visits made him realize that Wood could be "the right one".
“When I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this is clearly not just a game – I’m now involved with this with all my heart,” he said.
When asked who Wood should choose if not him, Mackay was mystical.
“I don’t know how to say it,” he said.
I like the rest of the girls just as much, so it's a tie between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor will be broadcast on Wednesday at 19.30 on the Ten channel.

Jarryd Hayne has many options to start his NFL career
Detroit and Seattle were both quite interested after his move to the United States, and many other teams have asked him about his impressive open training day at the end of last year.
However, Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers as well as coach Jim Tomsula, and this seems to have been a wise decision.
Some coaches would have left Hayne on the bench for the final time after this Australian rugby league relegated dropped the ball on his first flight kick when he won the team in Minnesota on Tuesday 20-3.
But Tomsula trusted her husband and allowed Haynen to return the next flight crash and took him into the running game after Reggie Bush was injured.
The real nature of Tomsula also appeared in the dressing room after the game.
Instead of shoving his newcomers to the side of the other team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly supported Hayne at a post-game press conference.
49ers specialty reporter Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by special teams coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget the dropped ball and worry about the next game.
Jarryd Hayne Drops a Flight Shot Captured by the Minnesota Vikings in the First Quarter
This really wasn’t the start that Hayne and his numerous Australian fans hoped for for the man’s NFL debut.
Haynen was seen cursing on the road from the field after the fall, and later told Australian radio station Hamish & Andy 2DayFM on frequency 104.1 that he could not have imagined a worse start to his NFL career.
“It was just one of those things, you just have to think about the next game and it’s there,” Hayne said.
Hayne compared his fermentation to his 2007 Origin debut, when a feed in his own target area led to a Queensland goal.
Overall, it was a great experience for this 27-year-old.
After the game, Hayne posed on his Instagram to post a photo with fans holding the Australian flag.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, Russia’s richest man, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, was arrested with a gun on a Siberian pier.
Khodorkovsky had openly questioned President Vladimir Putin, so he was convicted, his oil company Yukos was confiscated, and his efforts to support democracy were limited.
4 killed in police shooting of rubber bands against protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, died in southern Nepal after police fired rubber bands at a crowd that defied the country’s new draft constitution, authorities said on Wednesday.
The violence took place on Tuesday evening in the Rupandeh region, about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, the region's top official, said more than 1,000 demonstrators had gathered outside the police station and some of them threw stones and bombs.
Dhakal said the police used tear gas and then shot in the air before resorting to rubber bands.
Twenty policemen and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why rubber bands, known to have killed but traditionally used as a less dangerous alternative, appeared to have caused so many deaths.
In recent weeks, there have been violent demonstrations in the southern parts of Nepal, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say that the new provinces established under the proposed new constitution will weaken their political influence.
There have also been protests in western Nepal as the Tharus group demands its own state.
Since August 10, at least 40 people have died in violent clashes, 11 of them police.
At the time, the four main parties signed an agreement that divided the country into provinces - this is a big step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which has had a central government for centuries.
A new constitution has been envisaged since 2008, but lawmakers hastened the process after the devastating April earthquake killed thousands of people.
Legislators have voted on the constitutional clauses in Kathmandu this week, and authorities have said the new charter could be adopted by Sunday.
U.S. National Hurricane Center NHC Says Cape Verde's South Side Has a 60 Percent Chance of Hurricane
On the broad low-pressure front, located about 560 km south of the southernmost point of the Cape Verde archipelago, there is a 60 percent chance of developing into a tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said on Tuesday.
On the other extreme low-pressure front, located in the middle of the Cape Verde archipelago and the Little Antilles, there is also a 60 percent chance of developing into a tropical cyclone over the next two days, the Miami Weather Forecast Center added.
Google launches donation campaign to raise $11 million for refugees
Google Inc. (GOOGL.O) has launched a donation campaign aimed at raising $11 million to humanitarian organizations to help thousands of refugees who have come to Europe as they flee war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google had an exceptionally personal point of view when it published a donation campaign blog.
Instead of the announcement made by the director, Google employee Rita Masoud, who fled Kabul with her family at the age of seven, wrote about her personal experience.
“Our trip included a number of dark train and bus trips, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and darkness,” he wrote.
I was lucky.
But as the refugee and immigration crisis in Europe has grown, people like my family desperately want to help.
The donations are made by four non-profit organizations that help refugees and immigrants: Doctors Without Borders, the International Rescue Committee, Save the Children, and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said that it equals the same amount for every donation made globally at google.com/refugeerelief up to $5.5 million, with a total goal of $11 million.
Europe has the worst refugee crisis since World War II, mainly due to the four-year civil war in Syria, which has driven more than 4 million people from their homes this year.
Many also flee war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Weight Loss Surgery May Help Lightly Overweight Diabetics
According to a new study, the benefits of weight loss in mildly overweight type 2 diabetics can last for at least five years.
However, it is still too early to say whether these lightly obese diabetics live longer after weight loss surgery than those who are treated in ways other than surgery.
"Getting mortality data takes a long time," says Dr. Robin Blackstone, a weight loss surgery expert who wrote a paper on the new study in the journal JAMA Surgery.
For weight loss or bariatric surgery, various methods are used to reduce the size of the abdominal sac.
They reduce starvation and limit the absorption of food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has been shown to be effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but the majority of people in the study have been obese, and their BMI has been 35 or more.
The BMI, or weight-to-length ratio, is considered normal when it is between 18.5 and 24.9.
If the BMI is over 25, it indicates that someone is overweight, and if the person’s BMI is over 30, he or she is considered overweight.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For this new study, researchers at Min-Sheng General Hospital in Taiwan used the data collected since 2007 to compare two types of bariatric surgery, gastric bypass surgery, and gastric reduction, a type 2 diabetes mellitus that was used for medical treatment in humans.
The study showed that the average BMI of the cuts fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year.
At the same time, the BMI of those who were treated by means other than surgery remained largely the same in 29.
In 36 percent of the cuts, diabetes improved in full and 28 percent in part.
For comparison, in the drug-treated group, diabetes improved completely by only 1% and in part by about 2%.
In addition, blood pressure, triglycerides and "bad" LDL cholesterol "were generally better in the surgical group," the authors noted.
The researchers also monitored blood hemoglobin A1c levels in patients, which reflect blood sugar levels over the long term.
Haemoglobin A1c should remain below 7%, researchers write.
Post-surgery haemoglobin A1c decreased from about 9% to about 6%.
However, in the drug treatment group, it remained stable at about 8%.
However, this improved “glycemic control” described by improved hemoglobin A1c levels did not reduce mortality over five years, says lead researcher Dr Chih-Cheng Hsu and colleagues.
The study group also compared the mean results between two different types of surgery.
In the fifth year, when compared to the group under gastroenteritis, the group under gastroenteritis had lost more weight (18.7 and 14.2 kg), had decreased its weight index by more (7.4 and 5.1), had reached diabetic levels of A1c by 1 %, had decreased by 1 %, had decreased by 1 %, had decreased by 1 %, had decreased by 1 %, had decreased by 1 %, had decreased by 1 %, had decreased by 1 %, and had decreased by 1 %, and had decreased by 1 % by 1, by 1, by 1, by 1, by 1, by 1, by 1, by 1, by 1, by 1, by 1, by 1, by 1, by 1, by 1, by 1, by 1, by 1, by 1, by 1, by 1, by 1, by 1, by 1, by 1, by 1, by 1, by 1, by 1, by 1, by 1, by 1, by 1, by 1, by 1, by 1, by 1, by 1, by 1, by 1, by 1, by 1, by 1, by 1, by 1, by 1, by 1, by 1, by 1, by 1, by 1, by 1, by 1, by 1, by 1, by 1, by 1, by 1, by 1, by 1, by 1, by 1, by 1, by 1, by 1, by 1, by 1, by 1, by 1, by 1, by 1, by 1, by 1, by 1, by 1, by 1, by 1, by 1, by 1, by 1, by 1, by 1, by 1, by 1, by 1, by 1, by 1, by 1, by 1, by 1, by 1, by 1, by 1, by 1, by 1, by 1, by 1, by 1, by 1, by 1, by 1, by 1, by 1, by 1, by 1, by 1, by 1, by 1, by 1, by 1, by 1, by 1, by 1, by 1, by 1, by
The University of Arizona College of Medicine-Phoenix Blackstone says that while the study does not show survivors or surgery after five years, there are research results from Sweden, where surgery led to longer lives in heavier people.
A Swedish study found that overweight people who had undergone weight loss surgery were 29% less likely to die over a 15-year period compared to a group that had tried more traditional treatments.
While the new study does not show any improvement in the survival of surgical patients, Blackstone says the results are encouraging, however, for people with a BMI below 35 and who are interested in surgery.
"The results of the study are crucial precisely in that they show that surgery is safe for a group with a lower weight index," and do not involve an increased risk of death or kidney disease, he says.
Blackstone adds that both patients and their doctors should take their weight very seriously at the stage when the patient’s BMI is between 27 and 30.
“I think we’re waiting too long before we take this seriously,” he says.
I believe that once a person has accumulated these genetic changes that permanently prepare his body for obesity and diabetes, reversing the situation is very difficult.
"Not everyone can come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
The Dalai Lama has said that Europe cannot accept all refugees, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis can be found in the Middle East.
The leader of Tibetan Buddhism has called for an end to violence in refugee countries.
The Dalai Lama addressed the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech, which he held at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford at the beginning of his ten-day visit to Britain.
The Dalai Lama claimed that in the current situation, the needs of all mankind should be put above individual peoples or even continents.
He also stressed that while the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis must be admired, it is also insufficient.
“Not everyone can come to Europe,” he said in his speech.
While the Dalai Lama praised Germany’s and Austria’s actions in the crisis, he stressed that this is only a temporary solution.
“It is wonderful to care for thousands of refugees, but in the meantime, we have to think about long-term solutions: how to bring real peace and real development to these Muslim countries, mainly through education.
The last thing is to think about how we can reduce the killings in their land.
We need to reduce the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.
When taking a stand on the issue of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions following the 9/11 terrorist attacks, claiming that the US violent response provoked the chain's grim events.
“After 9/11, in a letter to President Bush, I expressed my condolences and told him that the solution to this problem is through non-violence.
“I know his motives were good, but he used force and it created unexpected consequences,” the Dalai Lama said.

Poisoning data centers across the United States have reported a nearly 400 percent increase in the ingestion of highly alcoholic hand sanitizer in children under 12 years of age since 2010, the Georgia Poisoning Information Center reports.
According to Dr Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poisoning Information Center, cases of ingestion of a disinfectant reported to the Poisoning Information Centres in children under 12 years of age rose from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
"Children are more interested in these products, and unfortunately a certain percentage of them are due to the update," Lopez told CNN.
He said that some children drink disinfectant on purpose, while some want to impress their friends or respond to the challenge on social media.
There are videos on YouTube where teenagers drink disinfectant to get a cheap climb paint.
According to reports, teens have mixed the disinfectant in alcoholic mouth water to get a stronger drink.
The pleasant smells of the disinfectant can attract younger children.
"The child doesn't think this is bad for him," Lopez said.
Many of the more interesting (handmade) are those to which the smell has been added.
There are disinfectants with a scent of strawberries, grapes and oranges that are very attractive to children.
The hand disinfectant can contain any alcohol between 45 and 95 percent.
Especially in young children, alcohol poisoning requires only a few injections.
“It’s really concentrated alcohol,” Stephen Thornton, director of hospital care at the University of Kansas Hospital’s Poisoning Information Center, told Fox 4 in Kansas City.
So don’t leave a whiskey shot lying on the table, but hand sanitizer is left visible, and if children are interested in it, it’s a quick way to drink a lot of alcohol.
Nhaiyah Russell is a six-year-old girl who some time ago only swallowed four sprays of strawberry fragrances with hand sanitizer at school, and she was taken to first aid.
Her blood alcohol level was .179, which is twice the limit for adult wheel intoxication, says first-aid clinician Chris Ritchey, who cared for the girl at the Gwinnet Medical Center outside of Atlanta.
Nhayah shrugged as he spoke and could not walk when he arrived at the emergency room.
Doctors followed her overnight in a separate children's hospital for possible brain damage as alcohol caused the girl to fall down and hit her head, Ritchey said.
“It was really scary,” Nhaijah’s mother Ortoria Scott told CNN.
The situation could have been deadly to my child.
Lopez has recommended that parents and teachers use non-alcoholic products or disinfectant wipes and move the disinfectant out of the reach of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants have been associated with deaths.
In 2013, two Ontario women died after swallowing a hand sanitizer that contained a toxic undisclosed ingredient.
The health authorities assume that the product contained methanol, a lethal substance, and not ethyl alcohol, which was reported as an active ingredient.
In January, in the northern part of New York state, three of the fourth graders planned to poison their "smooth" teacher by spreading bacterial poisoning into the classroom, a police report said.
The teacher is very allergic to the disinfectant in the hands and banned it from his class.
The police must prevent the plan as a "funny joke" and leave disciplinary action to the school district.
Celtic: No Conflicts
Griffiths detracts from talking about Celtic's contradictions, and Deila admits that Hoops is in a tight spot, but he gets it to turn around
Hearts is battling the Scottish Football League over Neilson's accusations, and Warburton is on alert for January recruits that could disrupt the team's unity
Dons raised their lead to Celtic to five points
Adam Rooney's first-half penalty kick led to Aberdeen's narrow victory at the Hamilton Pittodri Stadium and gave the team the opportunity to increase the gap to five points.
Griffiths reduces speeches about contradictions
There have been rumors about the internal conflicts within Celtic, but Griffiths passed them immediately, claiming that he and his teammates have no sense of working under closer watch as the team is preparing to face the Dutch series leader.
I don't think we're under pressure, I think the players are waiting for the match.
The lack of a Scottish championship race bores the Dutch - de Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and former Dutch national team player Ronald de Boer has said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic because it has no competition for the championship with the Rangers.
Ajax's current ambassador de Boer said: "The Netherlands no longer shows the highlights of Celtic's games and why?"
Because the Rangers aren't involved.
People here can't just talk about Rangers coming back.
They're talking about Old Firm teams.
They’re talking about both teams together, and they’re interested in that.
There is a lot of excitement in the games of these teams, and also other than the Scots want to follow them.
Deila vows to turn around the situation
Ronny Deila has admitted that Celtic is in trouble, but the Norwegian boss has vowed to turn the situation around.
Losing Malmö and the resulting drop in the Champions League was quickly followed by a loss of ten men to Aberdeen, who is now at the top of the series with a five-point gap to the next.
However, Deila said, "Celtic has had bad episodes in the past, and we'll get up again."
Now we just want to get out of this situation as quickly as possible.
I know that this is frustrating and that many people are very, very angry or sad about what is happening.
So are we, but we have to keep going.
We really need supporters because it improves the performance of the players.
Now it's important to stay together.
Warburton to watch for player transfers in January
While Rangers boss Mark Warburton just a few weeks ago commented on possible January player transfer targets, he is on guard with the most reassuring reassurance that he does not want to confuse the team’s consensus.
Brentford’s former boss said, “The January transfer window is very different from the summer window.”
For upcoming players in the summer, the adjustment period is a pre-season period, as can be seen in our team this season.
The team is doing really well.
Sometimes adding unnecessary players can do more harm.
Celtic's point of interest Michu suggests retirement
Swansea striker Michu, whose name has been attached to Celtic in connection with the transfer window, has suggested that he may retire after his contract with Swans ends.
The 29-year-old has had ankle pits for two years and has not managed to find a new companion outside of Wales during the summer.
Hearts is ready to fight the Scottish Football League because of Neilson's comments
The Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was removed from the field, and the team lost 3-2. The defender's red card was later cancelled, and this was already the third red card that Collum condemned in the last eight months, which was cancelled.
Neilson remains behind his statement, stating, "I did not question honesty, I did not comment on performance."
Griffiths vows to avoid Tynecastle
A loyal Hibernian player was sniffed after admitting to singing an offensive song about former Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The accident occurred at a pub in Edinburgh's Roseburn, before the Edinburgh derby at Tynecastle Stadium in March 2014.
"It was a derby and it was a cheerleader for a moment," the striker said, adding, "It's probably safe to say I'm not going back to Tynecastle, unless then go to Celtic."
Tannadic's government believes in Dundee United's leadership - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly argues that the Dundee United government still has faith in the management team to be able to turn the situation around, but admits that the weakening of players must stop.
"I think Stephen Thompson trusts us.
We'll get the boys back in shape," Donnelly says.
McInnes is happy with a "gross victory" in the Hamilton game
Derek McInnes admits that his team, Aberdeen, was desperately hooked up in the game against Hamilton Actie, but Adam Rooney's first-half penalty kick managed to achieve his seventh consecutive league win, which brought them to the top of the table five points Cel.
McInnes says: "There is no team that would have won anything, whether it's a cup or a league that wouldn't have won games in this way either."
Unemployment among Scots will remain the same as the UK’s total growth
EMPLOYMENT in Scotland remained at 164,000 during the period between May and July, while unemployment in the whole of the United Kingdom rose by 10,000 to a total of 1.82 million.
Scotland’s unemployment rate is 5.9 percent higher than the UK’s 5.5 percent, according to figures from the National Statistics Centre (ONS).
At the same time, unemployment in Scotland fell by 12 000 people over a three-month period, and the number of people currently employed is 2 612 000.
The employment rate in Scotland fell to 74 per cent during the quarter, which is higher than the UK average of 73.5 per cent.
Scottish Secretary of State David Mundell commented on these latest figures: “The government’s long-term plan is to build the foundation for a stronger economy.”
Almost exactly a year has passed since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
During these 12 months, the Scottish labour market has improved, employment has risen and unemployment has fallen.
Why I'm Executing in Oklahoma
If there is no legal intervention, I will see later today when the man is executed.
If that's the case, and I hope not, I'm sitting in the spectators' magazines at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary watching Richard Glossip be executed with a deadly syringe.
He has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death.
I received the request in January through his best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
I'm starting to crumble this day as it approaches.
So why did I agree?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story of the death penalty.
It would offer a unique perspective.
Journalists, of course, have the opportunity to follow executions in America, and since there are often more applications than vacant places, participants are selected through a staggering draw.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of places reserved for the media from twelve to five.
Whoever you choose, you see the event as cool.
I can't do that.
I will sit next to Richard Glossip’s closest friends, and I have also made my own contact with him through the phone calls I made during the months and a two-and-a-half-hour visit.
I like a man.
We laugh a lot when we talk.
The prison authorities say I can’t be both a witness and a reporter, so I’m not allowed to have a notebook and a pen to record what I saw.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
On Twitter, an Oklahoman journalist accused me of intimidating my impartiality.
Here's a lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story the way he wants you to, and you'll get involved.
I asked the reporter.
Yesterday admitted that "I could have put my words better", but still thinks that what I'm doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip has disagreed with some of the things I have said and written.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't do it even if he said it.
I told him that he could remove me from the Witness Hall at any time.
But he wants an international reporter to write about it.
If Glossip dies, he believes that publicity will help a trend against the death penalty.
Huffington Post reporter Kim Bellware is with me.
If you want to know more, you can listen to the podcasts I made in the series.
I will not go through all the details again.
I can't say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Trees would make him guilty anyway.
But I think there's a very strong possibility that he's not guilty of murder.
I certainly believe that there was not enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
I believe that his execution is incorrect.
And so this is the point of view from which I think he's dying.
I cannot claim to be completely neutral.
There will be other journalists who will take care of it.
I'll give you a description of what it's like to look like when the man I love dies unnecessarily.
Man lured off Canning River after water police hunt
Canning Vale's officer remained dry when he lured the man away from the Canning River.
An attempt by a man from Perth to mislead the police with his stance went wrong when he found himself in a shallow, muddy water just meters away by a policeman who was trying to "grip him gently back to the beach".
Canning Valen police were called to Beckenham on Tuesday for unauthorized intrusion.
When they spotted the suspect, he tried to trick them into heading for the Canning River.
However, he did not go very far.
"He was standing in the water saying 'I'm not coming out, come get me,'" said Senior Superintendent Shandell Castledine.
Officer Laclan Perhavec did not want his uniform to be watered, so he used a safer tactic: "fair police negotiation".
"Sometimes people do funny things when they try to escape," said senior colonel Castledine.
Champion footballer Ben Cousins is a good example.
In 2006, Cousins abandoned his car to avoid buoyancy and tried to swim across the Swan River.
He was unsuccessful in his endeavor, but inspired locals to start designing the playful Ben Cousins biathlon.
Peter Moody says reporters have tried to spy on him and threaten to stop competing
Peter Moody has claimed that Racing Victoria's agents tried to infiltrate their spies into his warehouses last year, and threatens to stop racing immediately.
He accuses the reporters and the Racing Victoria's Integrity Division of claiming that they have a personal campaign going on against him. On Wednesday, Lady Tata's late rejection of the treatment on the day of the race was the final straw.
Moody told Fairfax Media that his goal has always been to do what is best for the competition, and that he has been in a difficult situation after Lidar’s unexplained positive cobalt sample.
He has been keeping his tongue under control for a year and a half with regard to espionage claims, and did not want "it to look jealous".
“I wasn’t going to say anything about it, and I’ve been silent about it for a long time, but sometimes it gets so frustrating that it all goes down at once,” Moody said.
They knew the situation was going on.
Sometimes you just have to react and live with the penalties, and I have to live with what I have said.
I'm gonna go home tonight and sleep well.
I want to go head up and I want the owners to think that I'm doing my best for them.
When they start to think differently, then I don’t have to continue as a coach anymore.
Then I'd have to think about what I'm doing for my license.
Previously, Moody dropped the bomb in an interview with racing.com, in which he said that the non-gift division had tried to spy on his stables.
"Five and a half years ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - I'll name him when asked - and offered him a job on my record if he would pass on information about what I'm doing there.
They obviously think I'm a fraud.
If that's the case, of course, they should fire their lawyer, because they failed to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former chairman of Racing Victoria, David Moodie, current chairman of Racing Victoria, and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of Racing Victoria, were all aware of the matter at the time and are aware of it today.
Should I start to think that this is going to be personal?
Has Victoria Racing finally decided to mend and perhaps pass on responsibility to other than coaches for what is happening in the field?
Am I harmful to the industry?
Am I that bad for the industry?
Maybe people think so.
Maybe they have to take my license and push me aside, and I have no doubt that what I say now may not make them think about it.
But I'm at the point where I don't care anymore, and it's sad for me.
It really makes me sad.
I urge them to make a decision that is their responsibility.
I have the support of my family, and I can turn my back on this.
The coach's frustration has increased with Lidar's long-term cobalt investigation, and his late rejection led him to state that he could "throw his license over the table".
Moody, best known for coaching the undefeated champion Black Caviar, has called the rule of treatment for the race day "ridiculous" after a mud or clay pit has been placed on the horse's feet, which is illegal.
“It’s against the rules of competition.
I have to take full responsibility for it,” he said.
One of my employees accidentally put dirt on his foot.
It could have been a graveyard last night.
It could have been yesterday, as it was.
It was a race day.
Moody may face a three-month ban on race-day bullfighting, which the reporters began an investigation into.
It's a joke.
The people who make these rules don’t know anything about the horse.
"We all understand that rules are needed, but this has gone too far," Moody said.
Cobram driver charged with traffic jam arrested
Police have arrested a man who committed a traffic jam after colliding with a cyclist over the weekend in Cobram.
A cyclist was flown to the Royal Melbourne Hospital after he suffered serious injuries when a car hit him on Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
Police said the driver drove away and did not stop to help the injured cyclist.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalie reported himself to the police in Shepparton.
He will be accused of not stopping in an accident, of failing to provide assistance and of other traffic violations.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobra, is still in the hospital and his condition is stable.
Melbourne Storm team coach Craig Bellamy strikes against rivals in pressure claims
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has criticised the two NRL rugby league champions' claims that his team's tackling would be part of the lineup.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said the arbitrators allowed Storm's "dream" on his side when he suddenly won the final race in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett barely managed to hide his reference to the Storm after he defeated the North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night in the final round. Bennett called the game "a showcase window" of the rugby league and said "you won't be in the two Quélandes."
Bellamy defended his team's tackling and said they're just concentrating on "contact" tackling.
Bellamy added that his confidence added criticism of the two leading coaches against Storm, as it meant that they were afraid of losing to the team.
"This is always going to be a talk - I didn't hear Trent Robinson talking about the pressure when we lost to them 24-2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we have not changed anything in our defense systems or in our technologies all year long; in the last six weeks we have only emphasized contact in the pockets, and that has made us succeed.
“Trent has been on the team for three years, and obviously he has a great team to coach, so he’s probably not used to losing, so this was a small shock to him.
Funny how this is always going to be talked about at this time of year.
Bellamy challenged Bennett's idea of "exciting rugby" by reminding his mentor that the St George Illawarra Dragons, coached by Bennett, won the championship in 2010 by playing "softly".
Wayne's talking about exciting rugby.
He thought it was important to compare Saturday night’s game to our Friday night’s game and tell us how exciting their game was,” Bellamy said.
I remember 2010 when St George was often criticized for being a boring team, and Wayne said he couldn't care less.
But now he has a team that is able to play rugby that we consider exciting, especially when he has quick young friends.
That’s the kind of game you want to play when you have the type of players.
He brought it up in 2010, now he wants everyone to play his style of rugby – not who has friends like Anthony Milford or Ben Hunt in the team to be able to play like that.
I get more confident when they say things like that because they’re a little worried about playing against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think of us as resisting important games.
Bellamy also noted that the game between Storm and the Roosters was more punctual than the game between the Broncos and the Cowboys.
The Broncos game was definitely a good game, I haven’t watched it yet, but how did it end? 16-12?
Our game was 20-18, so we had two more goals but is it exciting rugby?
Or does it make it exciting to break the line of defense and not do the paint?
For me, this is about the lines.
If they mention us, it means that somewhere we can play against them.
The Storms are free this weekend, as they have already won the right to a home game against either the North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks for next Saturday night’s pre-final at AAMI Park. Tickets will go on sale next Tuesday morning.
Serbian man's $200,000 bail for drug charges
A man threatened for life by a 40-cocaine holding company smuggled to Queensland has been released against a $200,000 bail.
The 29-year-old Marko Maksimovic is one of five men arrested last month after federal police tracked down 100 pounds of drugs for the Solay hunt, which came to South America via Vanuatu and landed in Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was seen meeting other defendants in the boatyard all morning, and then he met them at the Coomera Roadhouse cafe, where police found 40 kilos of drugs in a Toyota Echo car.
Although Maksimovic threatens a potential life-long holding of the amount of cocaine intended for business, his lawyer claimed that there was no evidence that Maksimovic was trying to hold the entire amount and that he might have been in the cafe for completely innocent reasons.
Supreme Court Justice Peter Flanagan was concerned that Maksimovic was trying to escape.
"He has strong ties with Serbia.
He travels to Serbia often," he told the court on Wednesday.
In the criminal court case, Maksimovic lied to the police about where he lived.
Maksimovic's mother and stepmother had jointly offered a $200,000 guarantee to secure his release.
“After reading the valid certificates of both persons, it is clear that setting a $200,000 guarantee amount is a real financial burden for them,” Judge Flanagan said.
But alone it wasn’t enough to prevent him from appearing in court, he warned.
Maximovic was granted guarantees on the condition that he hand over both his Australian and Serbian passports, inform the police daily, and stick to his foreign traffic jam between evening and morning.
Stevan Hogg Uses Girl's Phone to Attract Pedophiles to Send Photos
A pedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to ask for pictures of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the girl’s phone while she was sleeping and then logged in to the online communications service, where Hogg received numerous unscrupulous pictures of children sent to her by another user.
The girl woke up later, noticed that the phone was missing and found it sleeping in Hogg's hand.
The girl searched her phone and found shocking messages, after which she immediately told her mother about it.
When police arrived, they saw five pictures, searched the computers on the spot, and found "worrying" web cookies with keywords that had been used to search for impeccable images taken from children.
Hogg then claimed to police that he had done this to “incite paedophiles” on the internet before he “presented himself to be a policeman to intimidate them.”
Eilidh Robertson, Deputy Fiscal, told the Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it was an addiction - that he is addicted to intimidating people.
He admitted that he had conducted a search on the computer but said that they had been made only because he wanted to pretend to be a policeman in order to scare paedophiles.
She was asked about conversations with an unknown person who sent her pictures, as well as when Hogg asked the person to send additional photos.
Hogg said he only did this for feeding purposes.
He said he's sick after drinking, and he wants to see pictures of rape and murder.
Robertson added: “When the girl found pictures of her phone, she screamed at her mother, shook and cried.
The mother saw the unscrupulous pictures on the phone and then met the accused.
The girl was interviewed, and she said that the accused had used a computer and a Playstation to talk to girls who looked younger than her.
Hogg, a 23-year-old resident of Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty to the charge of making or taking pictures of impudent children on June 14 last year. He violated his warrants on January 25 of this year and failed to appear before the court on March 24 of this year.
Defense attorney Gregor Sim asked Hoggia not to be listed in the sex offender register, as it could be argued that his crime did not include a "significant sexual element".
Sheriff Alistair Carmicheal postponed the sentence until October, so that the social action had time to prepare the background reports.
Hogg was granted bail in this case, but in other ongoing cases, he has been arrested before the trial.
He was added to the sex offender register before the date of conviction.
Zimbabwe’s Robert Mugabe made a false speech to parliament
Earlier this year, Africa’s oldest leader, Mugabe, fell on a staircase leading to the speakers’ summit.
He was not injured, but the video of the fall was circulated on social media like the virus.
Parliament’s opening speakers were also tainted by opposition lawmakers’ claims that they had been sent anonymous death threats warning them of booby-trapped Mugabe during his speech.
Last month, they buzzed and interrupted him in the middle of a speech to Parliament on the state of the land - which he repeated on Tuesday.
Innocent Gonese, the head of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) party, said seven opposition politicians had received text messages on their mobile phones warning them to interfere with Mugabe’s speech.
"The number from which the message was sent does not correspond, but the message is titled 'death'," Gonese told reporters after Mugabe's speech.
The communication warned the relevant Members that immunity to Parliament would end and that, when they step out, parliamentary immunity would not be valid.
The watchdog said the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, is "worried" about threats to its politicians.
Hewlett-Packard cuts 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is set to cut between 25,000 and 30,000 jobs as part of its restructuring and cost-cutting efforts in the corporate services business.
Later this year, HP splits into two publicly traded companies, separating its computer and print business from the faster-growing enterprise hardware and services.
Expected job cuts will bring about $2.7 billion in costs starting in the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement.
“These restructuring actions will enable a more competitive and sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise,” said Meg Whitman, President and CEO of HP, who will lead the unit after the division.
“Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than today’s HP, and we will have a broad and deep range of services to help companies move into a new kind of business,” Whitman said.
As a separate company, our ability to meet the evolving needs of our customers around the world is better than ever.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s annual turnover will be more than $50 billion, and it “focuses on producing unparalleled integrated technology solutions” for businesses, the company said in a statement.
The division breaks down the company, which graduates from Stanford University, Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard founded in the 1930s to manufacture electrical appliances. The company operated in a garage located in Palo Alto, called "the birthplace of the Piila Valley".
HP has undergone a massive reorganization to cope with the transition from traditional computers to mobile devices.
HP is the world’s second largest computer manufacturer and one of the largest technology companies in the U.S., and its distribution is the latest in the industry, based on the belief that tightly-limited companies perform better.
Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says teammates must support injured Jack Wilsherea before Dinamo Zagreb
Wenger has also stressed to Wilshire that it is now September and assuming that his rehabilitation is going according to plans, there is no reason why he would not be playing again by Christmas.
Even in this best case, Wilshire will miss at least four more games in England, and given his background, it is uncertain whether he will participate in the European Championships next summer.
The saddest thing about this latest problem is that the end of Wilshere's last season was strong after a single ankle injury, and he remembered his old sharpness before the start of the season.
"Such a disability does not threaten a career," Wenger said.
It's a bone that hasn't healed properly.
It's not weird.
It was just an accident.
It has nothing to do with his ankles or the injuries he has had in the past.
This may be true from a medical point of view, but, as Wenger also admitted, when a player tries to get back through, there is always a risk of additional injuries.
There is also an inconvenient model.
Research by Premier Injuries Ltd shows that Wilshere has had 23 different injuries since she debuted six years ago.
In addition, he has played 157 league games for Arsenal in just 65 games over the past five seasons.
Looking at Arsenal's wider overall after the 2007–08 season, in six of the eight seasons, it has been the second of the Valioliga teams to have lost the most days due to injury.
Wenger concedes the possibility of a witch body, but Arsenal believes that their latest season improvement in injury statistics will continue.
“Sometimes when you’re recovering from an injury, there can be a vulnerable season when you have to strengthen your body and gain competition,” Wenger said.
Jack's young enough to get over it.
I hope that his body will stabilize, I am sure that it will, and that he will be able to make the career he deserves.
Wenger is preparing to regroup as Arsenal start their Champions League game on Wednesday against Dinamo Zagreb and then play against Chelsea on Saturday and next Wednesday against Tottenham Hotspur.
Héctor Beller<0xC3><0xAD>n and Aaron Ramsey have not traveled to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to be in the start.
Wenger can also replace Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud with Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
“I’m trying to keep the balance and give a breather to the players who need it,” Wenger said.
While Arsenal is the clear favourite of the F-Block, Maximir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the most frightening in Europe.
Dinamo has also not lost in 41 games since they produced their "Invincible" campaign in the last season.
The stadium was hit by an earthquake on Tuesday night, with a magnitude of 3.2 on the Richter scale.
It was the 10th in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes that Arsenal has learned from last season’s Champions League surrender against Monaco, and he is motivated by the still distant dream of leading the team to its first European Cup victory.
“This motivation is huge,” Wenger said.
Arsenal have never achieved that.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other hand, I can be realistic.
We are ambitious, but we are not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedy series that taught us serious things about friendship between men
It is striking how similar depictions are not in the series, especially given that the need for men to open up is more desperate than ever, and the suicide rates of young men over the age of fifteen.
In 2013, suicide was the largest cause of death in men aged 20-45 in the UK, and it is three times more common in men than in women.
In an effort to tackle the problem, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) announced the 2015 Men’s Year, with the goal of challenging a culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of this challenge.
A recent study involved more than 2,000 high school and high school students who showed symptoms of depression. According to the study, a person’s chances of recovery doubled if a sufficiently high percentage of his friends were “healthy minded”.
Similarly, in those who were not depressed, the likelihood of potential mental health problems was halved if they had healthy friends.
But in order for friendship to work, it must first be available.
In this time of communication through social media, the style passes through the content and the immediacy of the response is often more important than a meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to seem strong, joyful and successful, even though in reality isolation is dominating.
This superficial success is dominated by the values that psychologists call external: money, image, social status. All this happens at the expense of internal values - the internal desire for personal growth and friendship - which profoundly affect our mental health.
And as the billionaire video game developer recently explained, money really doesn’t make you happier.
The beauty of Frendi was that it turned this focus on its head.
None of the characters defined their work, but rather their personality, which clearly stood out in the interaction as friends.
Joey and Chandler's numerous hugs, moments in comfortable chairs watching football, Ross misses Rachel - their humor came from the knowledge that yes, men can identify with all this, although they often hesitate to fully explore their emotions.
As a Samaritans volunteer explained to me: "When I listened to people who are depressed and self-destructive, I really understood how little interaction with a friend can improve feeling."
Men who contact us often feel that they can’t talk to their friends.
The old idea of "overcoming" is strong, as is the feeling that if you open up to problems, you are seen as weak.
Frendit is one of those series that comes to mind when I try to offer longer-term ways of survival.
It emphasized the small moments of friendship between men.
While my unbiased, out-of-the-box position on the other end of the phone helps people in moments of despair, long-term support comes from a close, personal network of family and friends.
And so if you’re attending Comedy Central’s FriendsFest this weekend, and all the venues have been redesigned to celebrate, why not take your friends to Central Perk for coffee.
Or, even better, if you see someone at Starbucks alone, smile and say hello.
You never know how much your friendship can mean.

Di Maria paints and helps PSG smash Malmö’s side
Angel Di Maria celebrated with Blaise Matuid and Edinson Cavan against Malmö.
Angel Di Maria scored in his Champions League debut, helping PSG beat the Swedish team in Malmö on Tuesday.
Below are the game reports and reactions to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were on the right track as Paris Saint-Germain finally started their Champions League game with a 2-0 win against Malmö at the Parc des Princes on Tuesday.
Di Maria scored in his Champions League debut under four minutes pointing the way for the French leaguers, but the team lost several chances before finally adding their lead in the 61st minute of Cavani's strike.
Paris, which is in the same A-Block with Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk, needed a strong start against the Swedish league champion, as the game was not only a continuation, but also an improvement in their games leading to the quarter-finals in the last three rounds.
But even though PSG took the points, it was not a classic game, as Laurent Blanc team Zlatan Ibrahimovic lost the spot in front of the goal and later switched from the field. Malmö is his old home town team and the team where he started his brilliant career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win in the Champions League at home or in the visitors, so a 2-0 win causes problems for the opponent and looks good in the statistics, and it's a good start, even though there are things we have to skip this season," Blanc said.
This predicts good.
We wanted to win, and we won, even though we didn’t manage to score one or two more goals.
Ibrahimovic returned to the Paris team after injury in one of the three changes after the team stayed in the 2–2 home game of Ligue 1 against Bordeaux over the weekend, but he remained in the fourth minute under the shadow of Di Maria.
When he moved from Manchester United last month, the Argentine striker was named a man who takes PSG to a new level in Europe, and he testified why, when running Marco Verratt's infatuation caught up behind Malmö's defensive line and then hit the beautiful finish behind Johan Wiland.
However, if someone expected an easy and big win from PSG, he had to be disappointed.
Malmö was a tough opponent. It won the Celtic fixture when it reached this level, its open field has nine international players and a five-man defense, as well as two players in the deep midfield.
But the team did not offer much on the attacking side except for the 34th minute of Nikola Djurdji<0xC4><0x87>'s shot, which came just past Kevin Trapp's goalie.
PSG, on the other hand, was hit by a lack of supplies and a poor finish, especially by Ibrahimovic, who failed in a total of five attempts in only the first half and was disappointed after Cavani put the ball in from Ibrahimovic's touch at the start of the second half.
However, he was much more efficient in doing the pre-work with his colleagues, and it was just after Ibrahimovic's intake that Di Maria sent a roundabout, which was tilted around Wiland's dome in the 52nd minute.
The second goal was finally scored an hour after the game thanks to the Uruguayan Cavani who scored his sixth goal of the season after Ibrahimovic kicked forward from Maxwell's cross feed left.
That ended Malmö’s desire to get back into the game, and only Wiland’s brilliant fight against David Luis’s direct kick kept the final numbers low before the exchange-turned Ezequiel Lavezzi goal was abandoned at the very end of the game.
Malmö coach Age Hareide later admitted that PSG were at an equal level with his team. The Norwegian said: "Our last Champions League game was last December."
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish league, which is not the same level.
Fighting is not enough.
I'm taking my hat off to Paris.
This was a great game for them.
Glencore raises $2.5 billion to sell its shares
The Swiss mining sector left Glencore, suffering from a price drop in basic commodities, collecting $2.5 billion on Wednesday by selling shares as part of its broad debt reduction plan.
Glencore, listed on the London Stock Exchange, said in a statement that it had sold new shares for around <0xC2><0xA3>1.6 billion to shorten its debt.
The company, which lost 57 per cent of its market value this year, is struggling with the prices of collapsed commodities, as the slowdown in China’s economy strains demand and causes destruction in all markets.
The remarks raised the value of Glencore's shares at the top of the London Stock Exchange on Wednesday morning.
Shares rose 2.77 per cent to 131.60 pence in the FTSE 100 index, which opened 0.69% higher.
Last week, Glencore announced a $2.5 billion stock deal as part of its broader plan to cut its $30 billion debt by about a third.
The company sold a new share capital for 125 pence, which meant a reduction of 2.4 per cent to the closing price on Tuesday.
The company sold 1.3 billion shares with a total value of 9.99% of the company.
Concerns about China’s long-standing downturn in growth have cut iron ore prices by about half, and at the same time coal, copper and other commodities prices have fallen by 20-40 percent.
White House confirms Xi Jinping's visit to Washington
Chinese President Xi Jinping will make a state visit to the United States at the end of the month, a White House statement on Tuesday confirmed.
Xin’s first official visit to Washington will take place on September 25 and is a response to President Barack Obama’s last visit to Beijing in November, the statement said.
U.S. President and President Michelle Obama’s husband are organizing a dinner for Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan after the leaders have held bilateral talks.
“President Xin’s visit gives the opportunity to expand cooperation between the United States and China on a number of matters of common interest in the global, regional and bilateral spheres, while at the same time giving President Obama and President Xi the opportunity to discuss constructively in the context of matters of law.”
With the visit, which was first announced in February, Xin is also expected to depart from Seattle on his trip to Washington to meet numerous U.S. technology leaders before moving on to New York City and the U.N. General Assembly in September.
Obama and Xin are expected to discuss a number of controversial topics, including Washington’s concerns over China’s alleged online espionage and the country’s increased absoluteness in the disputed waters of the South China Sea.
Matt Damon Reduces Difference in Film Industry
Matt Damon teamed up with African-American filmmaker Effie Brown in their discussion of a difference that Damon doesn’t think is needed behind the scenes.
In the Sunday evening episode of Project Greenlight on HBO, an experienced actor interrupted Brown by emphasizing the need for different perspectives on the dark protagonist of the script chosen for the project.
“When we talk about diversity, it’s taken into account when choosing actors for a movie, not a series,” Damon said.
Shocked by Brown's reaction to the injury, the comments "Oh! Wow. Okay", while the Martian actor's comments were left hanging in the air.
Other producers Ben Affleck and Farrelly's brothers joined Damon and Brown to discuss the series' finalists.
“I want to encourage people to think, whoever the director is, how they treat Harmony’s character,” Brown said at the start.
The only dark character is a whore beaten by her white partner.
The producer of The Dear White People demanded the film's directorial rights to the finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio; Damon responded tediously that their directorship "could end up giving us something we don't want".
When the discussion was posted, social media exploded to discredit Damon's comments.
Twitter user MrPooni expressed his anger at the video clip, writing: "Matt Damon talking about the only dark person in the room and explaining the difference to him is SO BLACK that happens."
Since its release, Twitter has collected over 5,000 re-edits and 4,000 likes.
Damon’s comments coincide with a time when the precise racial presentation in the media is at the forefront of social discussion.
After a white policeman killed teen Michael Brown in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement spread across the country and urged lawmakers and authorities to stop discriminatory practices against colored people.
In February, the singer Prince referred to the issue by presenting the Album of the Year nominees for the Grammy Award.
“Albums still matter,” he said.
As with books and black lives, albums still matter.
The leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement recently issued a statement in response to the question of whether the group should be considered as a hate group by Fox News's television personality Elisabeth Hasselbeck.
"The Black Lives Matter Network is a love group," the leaders said.
It was recently reported that Damon is among the entertainers, producers and media moguls who have been invited to visit the pope to discuss the image of the Catholic Church in the West.
It is unclear whether he has accepted the invitation or has already met the pope.
First American Ninja Warrior Champion crowned
Professional climber and dish collector Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior competition on Monday and receive a $1 million grand prize.
It is precisely the competition programme that has concluded its seventh season that there has never been a competitor who would have survived all aspects of the esterada of the programme.
In the final episode of the series, two men, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten, survived the final round.
The last task was to climb a 23-metre rope in 30 seconds.
Britten climbed first and solved the challenge in time, making him the first athlete ever to solve the exhausting 4th installment of American Ninja Warrior. However, Caldiero solved the challenge three seconds faster, making him the winner.
Caldiero gave an interview to E!News after a hard-won win and was still shocked to win a million-dollar grand prize.
“So it’s great to think about this when I’ve never earned or lived as high as $10,000 a year,” Isaac told E! after his big pay raise.
So suddenly...I can’t even imagine what this will be like...the future is unknown.
Production director Kent Weed sat down to discuss the finals with The Hollywood Reporter and why Britten won’t get more rewards, even though he’s the first competitor to ever pass the track.
According to the rules, money goes to the fastest person.
“If more people pass, the money gets the one with the fastest time,” Weed said.
While money is a great reward and a life-changing experience, it still gives him a great sense of satisfaction.
I don't think he's upset about it.
He's just so happy that he's got to do what he did.
His fans have praised him.
He's a great guy, and he's got a good family.
He is the hero of his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, "If someone had to beat me, I'm happy it was Isaac."
And I think Isaac would have thought the same way if this had gone the other way.
American Ninja Warrior returns to the eighth season, with the shoots starting in the spring of 2016.
The Detroit Tigers pass the Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS -- The second half of the season hasn't been very fun for the Detroit Tigers.
The Tigers were once one of the best baseball teams, but are now the last in the American League Central division.
The Tigers played their sniper role perfectly on Tuesday when it won the Minnesota Twins 5-4 on Target Field.
The Twins lost their chance to play in the semi-finals of the Houston Astros in a competition from another wild card location in the American League.
For Detroit, the game was a return to the six-letter H-word pair for at least one night, which had been very difficult to reach for most of the latter half of the season.
“All wins are fun, no matter how you get them,” said team leader Brad Ausmus.
Tigers forward Alfredo Simon continued his early offensive assist as Detroit made the run three times in the first two rounds, and then once in the sixth and once again in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) fed 6 1/3 in a row and allowed three runs.
This was only his third quality start in his last nine games.
“I just want a strong ending for this year,” Simon said.
It’s hard for an exchanger to enter every game, and that’s why I want to go deep into the game.
Tigers substitute Victor Martinez hit three times and allowed two runs, which were his first hits since mid-August.
This was Martinez's first night of three strikes after he hit Seattle Mariners four times on July 6.
"He swung the mile well," Ausmus said.
He looked good (in the betting exercises), looked much better in the batting exercises and continued the same pattern in the game.
The Twins were three runs behind in the second half of the seventh round, and it was their best chance of getting back into the game.
Byron Buxton started the turn by hitting the left field line twice.
On the right board, Aaron Hicks returned home with a knock on one nest, and Simon was burned directly by another nest player, Brian Dozier, before Simon was switched to left-handed Blaine Hardy.
Hardy walked against Maurer, the only player set against, ahead of the starter Miguel Sano, who would kick two runners to the left of right-handed Drew VerHagen.
With two runners on the field and a levelling runner in second place, VerHagen got three-legged Trevor Plouffen to hit a doubles goal.
This was the 27th time in the season that Plouffe hit the doubles.
After Detroit had received a backup run at the ninth start, Mauer kicked two hits against the Tigers' shutout Bruce Rondon, and the situation was 5-4.
However, the right-handed player burned Sano in three innings in his fifth save.
Detroit initially took advantage of the rusty Phil Hughes.
The Tigers got three runs in the first two days against a right-handed veteran who got out of the injured list before the game after being away for more than a month due to an inflammation of the lower back.
“Obviously I didn’t want to start like that,” Hughes said, “but as the game progressed, I felt more comfortable, and I felt like I had a few nice feeds done in the third pair.”
After Hughes caught the starter on the first lap, he let the second lap player Ian Kinsler advance one by one.
J.D. Martinez’s walk on the right board in a situation of two fires brought Victor Martinez to the batting line, who led himself to the first half of the midfield and caused the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez broke his 0-21 tube while the runners were in good running positions.
Triangle player Nick Castellanos continued to hit right and caused a second run, but the menacing situation ended when Victor Martinez was abandoned in an attempt to advance to the triangle.
The Tigers continued in the second round and got one shot, two shots from the runner-up James McCann and two shots from the runner-up Anthony Gosel, one shot from the runner-up Anthony Gosel, after which the situation was 3-0.
"It was an important blow," Twins team leader Paul Molitor said.
He didn't hit very well, but it flew in the right direction.
Hughes began to be in the feeder classes and fed a runless third turn pair, after which he became a right-handed follower of A.J. Achter.
Hughes was given three runs out of six strikes and a walk in four fires.
NOTE: Tigers right-handed feeder Anibal Sanchez was knocked off the shoulder of the thrower.
He is being examined by Dr. James Andrews, who cut Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez has been on the injured list since mid-August due to a shoulder injury but was due to return on Wednesday.
While Sanchez is out, left-handed inmate Daniel Norris comes off the injured list to start against Twins.
Norriksen's stats at the Tigers are 1-1 in four starts after left-handed striker David Price was traded to him on July 30.
Norris has been out since August 20 due to a right-handed abdominal skeleton.
The Tigers and Twins three-game series will end on Wednesday at Target Field.
Norris (2-2, 4.43 ERA) will face Minnesota right-handed midfielder Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA).
Xi urges to open up the economy to the wider world
The economy should be more open to the outside world to promote growth, President Xi Jinping told a group on Tuesday whose task is to direct the reform.
"China should commit to attracting foreign funding and expertise and developing a policy of transparency," he said in a speech at the 16th meeting of the group leading the deepening of the general reform.
“Supporting transparency while driving forward reforms adds new movement and vitality, and creates new space for economic growth,” Xi said.
The Management Group adopted a series of guidelines, which include a negative list restricting market access, loosening of the principles of border controls, encouraging state-owned enterprises to take private capital, and revising the resident registration system.
The opinion establishes a negative list of sectors and companies in which no investment is allowed.
The system is being progressively tested and improved by means of pilot programmes.
The change is significant, as it gives the market a greater role in allocating resources, ensuring a legal business environment and making the market more transparent.
The government also loosens its control of the power it distributes to companies, thus ensuring that the companies themselves decide how to conduct their business.
The statement also said that China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms for the development of regional growth.
In order to open up government-controlled sectors to private donors, more sectors will be opened up.
“The government will not change its direction regarding foreign investments, and it will protect the legitimate interests of foreign-funded companies and provide better services to them,” the statement said.
In addition, the search process for foreign permanent residence permits, "green cards", is facilitated by optimising the requirements and facilitating the search process.
The meeting also discussed the guarantee of the rights of lawyers to practice the profession and the support of professional judges and prosecutors.
The meeting was also attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang, as well as senior leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, said in a statement released after the meeting.
