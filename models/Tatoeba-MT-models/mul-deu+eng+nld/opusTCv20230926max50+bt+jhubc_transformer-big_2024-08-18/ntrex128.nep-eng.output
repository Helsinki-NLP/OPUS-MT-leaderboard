U.K. car maker Gumaekoma 'sadhabari apologises'
Trade Secretary Greg Clarke said he was "sorry" if he took the lead role in the car-making business in the UK after Brexit, but he said he was "sorry."
He said it was a concern that Toyota had brought the UK to the BBC that if the UK left without a deal, it would stop production of raw materials at the Burnaston factory in the future.
Mr. Clarke said, "Hamilia wants a deal."
The Japanese car manufacturer Bhane Simanako has reportedly lost the No-Deal Brexit.
The Bernaston plant, such as the Toyota, was built by Auris and Avensis, with a production of 150,000 carrots per year, causing 90% of the rest of the European Union to export raw materials.
Marvin Cookle, a senior director at Burnastonma Toyota, said: "I think that by the end of March, production would be shut down at the Humro Factory if the UK were out of business.
Other UK car makers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar, fear that the U.K.'s cross-border business will be disrupted without a deal.
For Udaharnok, Brexiteers, BMW Le Oxfordma have been shutting down the Afno Mini plant for a month.
'No-deal Brexit' is a major concern for car makers, the main concern is the supply chain that is risky.

If the U.K. leaves the EU without a March 29 treaty, the border will be blocked as soon as possible and the part of the country will be reduced, industrialized.
For Toyota, the Debishair plant is unable to increase the price of a one-day supply of grain listed above, the company is unable to buy, and the production of tea can be prevented.
Mr. Clarke, a tester at Theresa, planned a new EU-funded future: "Simana has done a good job of calculating the amount of money for the check-in baby."
"Hamilai is a landmark agreement. We all want the Bhanda Ramro agreement to be a landmark destination, but we are happy with the success of the Bhanda Akhile but we also have the opportunity to make it possible for us to stay on the same path as the rest of the country. We are here to work," he said on BBC Radio 4.
"Not only Toyota, but also other manufacturers have been able to provide proof that we have released the same rakhan as we have been able to successfully set up the old supply chain," he said.
Toyota Bhann said that it would prevent the production of raw materials as much as possible, and for a long period, warning that the competitiveness of the low-cost plant would be less competitive and ultimately more productive.
Peter Sauwalaris, who has been a co-founder of Greco-Greece and the Union of Confederate Units in Berne for 24 years, expressed his concern to the members: "My experience as an employer has been one of my favourite days.
A government spokesperson said: "The future of the EU is a sustainable and reliable plan for our relations with the European Union."
