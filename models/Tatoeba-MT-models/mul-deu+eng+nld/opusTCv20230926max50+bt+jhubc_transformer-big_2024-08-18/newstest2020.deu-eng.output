Fire in French chemical plant erased
The large fire in a chemical plant in the northern French city of Rouen has been extinguished. This was reported by the Prefecture of Normandy on Friday. The fire broke out on Thursday night. No one was injured in the incident. The firefighter was in a barrel with around 200 lbs.
The fire could be stopped.
Anrainers were called upon not to leave their homes. Buildings within 500 meters were evacuated, schools and kindergartens remained closed on Thursday. In the chemical plant on the banks of the Seine, additives for lubricants are produced. The factory is part of the EU’s Strellienge, sootrope and safety are part of the company’s Lubricol-Selli-Milli.
About 400 people work in the plant. In the past, the chemical factory already provided headlines - for example, when in 2013 a leak caused the gas methanthiol to break out and the environment smelled of rotten eggs. In 2015, after an operating accident, about 2,000 liters of mineral oil flowed into the city's wastewater system.
Woman announces job to search for her missing dog for 57 days
For two months, a woman from Washington searched for her missing dog - and extra her job. The seven-year-old Border Collie had left the hotel room during a short break in Montana. 57 days every trace was missing from the puppy - but Carole King did not give up.
"It was terrible. I got sick," Carole King told the Daily Inter Lake. She and her husband had left the dog Katie in the hotel room while they were going to dinner. When they returned to the hotel, Katie was gone. They were looking for the animal, but without success.
Thunder had put a dog in panic
In the hope that Katie could stay somewhere else in the hotel, Carole King went to the reception. "The employee says, "She left about four, four and a half hours ago," recalls Carole King in front of "Daily Inter Lake". When the automatic entrance door opened, Luanner opened the door.
With flyers and calls in Facebook groups, the Kings searched for their beloved dog, but from days went by weeks. "I never gave up. I never lost hope," Carole King told the Daily Inter Lake, who announced her job as a postal worker to continue her search for Katie.
"The tears flowed"
57 days after Katie's disappearance, Carole King received a call: A man reportedly said that Katie was in his yard. But when King arrived there, Katie was already gone. She was looking for the neighborhood and suddenly I was going to get her bitch, I was going to get her out of a tree. "I didn't want to hug her.
Losses in the Federal Army: machine guns disappear without a trace
Friday, 27. September 2019
Six machine guns of the MG3 type are still missing.
In recent years, the Federal Army has lost numerous weapons and tens of thousands of shots of ammunition, including three machine guns. The remains are unclear in most cases. The opposition speaks of a "terrifying" extent.
Weapons and ammunition are disappearing again and again at the Federal Army – many of them so far without a trace. Since the beginning of 2014, the troop has suffered the loss of 39 weapons, 39 parts of weapons and almost 20,000 shots of ammunition. This is based on a list classified as a closed case by the Federal Ministry of Defence.
According to the paper from the office of Defense Secretary Peter Tauber of the CDU, two weapons, a gun part and 3474 shots of ammunition have reappeared so far. The remaining weapons and gun parts are from the Phree Phree.
According to Martina Renner, a member of the left-wing Bundestag, the extent of Francsian arms and ammunition losses in the Bundeswehr was "terrorist", and this was all the more true, because in the course of investigations, "there was hardly any evidence of Francsian weapons and ammunition losses.
Oil tanker "Stena Impero" left Iranian port
More than two months after its capture by the Iranian authorities, the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" left the port of the city of Bandar Abbas on Friday. As ship observation data of Refinitiv showed, the tanker set in motion and left the Iranian port of Emira.
The tanker had actually been released by the Iranian government on Monday, but it initially remained in Iranian waters, the shipping company said it wanted to wait for an official notification from Tehran.
The "Stena Impero" was brought on July 19 by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards in the Strait of Hormuz on the charge of violating security regulations, but it was suspected that Iran was thereby involved in the controversial, temporary fixation of an Iranian oil tanker in front of Britain.
The Strait of Hormuz is one of the most important seaways in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Much of the global oil export is shipped through the seas. Tensions in the region have increased in the past few months. The trade between the U.S. and the U.S. was in conflict.
Merkel Appreciates the Courage of the People in the Peaceful Revolution
German Chancellor Angela Merkel has appreciated the commitment of the people in the GDR, who 30 years ago took to the streets during the Peaceful Revolution. In the autumn of 1989, courageous citizens had brought the then GDR regime into disrepute. "Merkel told Stauttner's Eritreans at a ceremony in Staut.
Musk seeks record of extradition
Tesla's quarter may be keeping records, but despite the delivery boom, there have been recent losses in the electric car group.
New York.Tesla CEO Elon Musk has given his electric car group a strong boost on the stock market with the prospect of new record figures. "We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries," Musk wrote in a blog post published by industry blog "Electrek".
The demand was strong, so Tesla could book 110,000 orders, Musk’s circular continued. The challenge was to quickly bring the cars to customers. To do this, Tesla would have to offer as many resources as possible by the end of the quarter.
Investors liked this: Tesla’s shares went out with a plus of more than six percent from trading. So strong the price has not increased for almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered more than 95,000 cars and thus reached its previous best value.
Musk needs records to reach his high goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360000 to 400,000 cars. For this, in the current and next quarter, six-digit numbers have to be produced. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but here the profit margins are low.
Mystery Solved: That's Why We Can't Quit Ourselves
A kind of braking in the large brain prevents people from kitting themselves. Scientists at the Humboldt University in Berlin found this with the help of experiments on rats, as they reported on Thursday night. More progress was also made on the question of why children are so hot.
Finally, it has also been shown why the approach of a smiling hand alone triggers laughter even before the touch. This is located on a deep layer in the large brain, which triggers laughter already while waiting for the smiling.
According to previous research, rats react with "laughs" in the ultrasound range when they are tickled by humans. This "laugh" is conveyed by the part of the large cerebral cortex, which serves the central processing of haptic perception.
Laughter is suppressed during self-touch
So far, I had assumed that the brain could distinguish between self-touching and touching by others - that is why people can not quibble themselves. However, the Berlin researchers now found in the experiments on the rats that the laughter of the quivering and quivering during the quivering, as well as the activity of the quivering.
But pass on the self-touch and the touch of others at the same time, laughter is also suppressed. This suggests that the rat's brain can't distinguish between the self-touch and the touch of others. The new insights of the brain itself made it clear that people were not actively kitting.
The rats were also trained to quizze themselves. In doing so, they sometimes discontinued this initiation in the experiment prematurely, showed fleeing behaviors or scare-starves. This ambivalence is equal to the behavior of children. The ambivalence of quizzes is a behavioral reaction that sedentary and in humans.
Disaster averted: Great fire erased in French chemical plant
The large-scale fire at a chemical plant in the northern French city of Rouen has been extinguished, according to the AFP news agency, the prefecture of Normandy reported on Friday.
According to the authorities, no hazardous substances should have been removed. The samples taken do not give cause for concern, as Prefect Pierre-André Durand said at a press conference on Friday morning. No one was injured in the incident. The firefighter was in a firefight with around 200 extinguishers.
Schools and kindergartens closed
Residents were urged not to leave their homes, buildings within 500 meters were evacuated, schools and kindergartens remained closed on Thursday.
The factory belongs to the company Lubrizol by US billionaire Warren Buffett
At the chemical plant on the banks of the Seine, additives for lubricants are produced. The plant is owned by the company Lubrizol by US billionaire Warren Buffett and is subject to the so-called Seveso directive of the EU, which prescribes very strict safety requirements. Around 400 people work in the plant.
The chemical factory has already provided headlines in the past - for example, when in 2013 a leak caused the gas methanthiol to escape and the environment to a great extent smelled of rotten eggs. In 2015, after an operating accident, about 2000 liters of mineral oil flowed into the city’s sewage system.
Brexit: Johnson criticised by his own sister
The Prime Minister's sister commented on Boris Johnson's speech at the first session of parliament after the forced pause was lifted on Wednesday evening. The Prime Minister threatens to lead the country on October 31 without an agreement from the EU, but should Brussels not accept his demands for changes to the Brexit deal. He is not willing to make that clear.
About Cox, who had pledged to stay in the European Union, the Prime Minister said: "The best way to honor the memory of Jo Cox and reunite this country would be to fulfill the EU exit." Cox had been assassinated by a right-wing extremist during the 2016 referendum campaign.
Monument to Oslo and Utöya Attacks Revealed
More than eight years after the attacks in Oslo and Utöya with 77 dead, a memorial in honor of the victims will be unveiled in Norway on Saturday. The monument "Jernrosene" (German: the iron roses) consists of about 1,000 iron roses after Oslo has been removed from Osl<0xC3><0xA5>gen. They remind the people of the roses in the Tausen.
At the same place, the project of the artists Tobbe Malm and Tone Karlsrud will now be revealed - the roses have been forged by people from all over the world, including survivors and relatives of the victims. For the opening, among others, Crown Prince Haakon and Crown Princess Mette-Marit are expected.
On July 22, 2011, right-wing terrorist Anders Behring Breivik set fire to a car bomb in Oslo’s government district, after which dozens of participants of a youth camp of the Social Democratic Workers’ Party were killed in the attacks.
Iran releases British tankers
The UN General Debate did not bring a solution to the Iran conflict. But now there is a problem less. The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" held in Iran was able to get back into the sea. It could be a puzzle piece in the peace plan of Iranian President Ruhani.
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero", which has been trapped in the street of Hormus in Iran since mid-July, is back in international waters after being released by Iranian authorities, the ship is on its way to Dubai, according to the shipping company Stena Bulk.
The "Stena Impero" has left the port of Bandar Abbas and the crew is now going to Dubai for medical examinations, among other things, said Reedereichef Erik H<0xC3><0xA5>nell. By noon the ship left the Iranian waters. "It's nice that it's over," he told Swedish TV.
"This is part of a pattern of attempts to undermine the freedom of the seas, and we are working with our international partners to maintain shipping and international law," the statement said in a statement on Friday.
On July 19, the Iranian Revolutionary Guards had set the tanker on the charge of failing to comply with the regulations of the law of the sea in the Persian Gulf. Seven of the 23 crew members had already been released at the beginning of September. The remaining 16 crew members of their families were soon to reunite with the rest of the crew.
The British government suspected a reaction to a similar incident in British Gibraltar following the US establishment of the "Stena Impero": there in early July a supertanker with oil from Iran, which was supposed to have been destined for Syria, was put on the chain. The supply was against the British.
Iran spoke of "piracy" and threatened with consequences. In mid-August, the "Adrian Darya-1" was finally released. Courage, it was about an exchange deal to get rid of the "Stena Impero", London vehemently rejected.
The Strait of Hormus is one of the most important seaways in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Much of the world’s oil exports are shipped through the seas. Tensions in the region have increased immensely in the past few months. The trade between the U.S. and the U.S.
Other tensions between Tehran and Washington are behind the nuclear dispute between the two countries. The Americans are throwing off the Iranian leadership to want to build nuclear weapons. Iran rejects this. The United States was in 2018 in the process of withdrawing from the international nuclear agreement. In 2018, the United States was outstripped from the international nuclear agreement, it was trying to stop Iran from doing business with the US.
Due to the dispute over the “Stena Impero” and other incidents with tankers in the Persian Gulf and oil plants in Saudi Arabia, the United States is working on a coalition for the military protection of merchant ships in the region.
Iranian President Hassan Ruhani presented at the UN General Assembly in New York a plan for security and peace in the Strait of Hormus. With the initiative "Coalition of Hope" for the Persian Gulf, Iran wants to together with the Arab Gulf states and without foreign protectors in the Gulf.
India is building a better future with its protectionist economic policy.
India would in fact be predestinated to indie markets as "war-winners" as well as to indie-winners. In view of the fines imposed by US President Donald Trump against Chinese manufacturers, foreign producers in the People's Republic are forced to re-dispose of a new product to a new one.
But now India itself has fallen into Trump's focus. Devalued from today's White House as "Kingdom of Customs", America withdrew from the Schwellen country in early June the trade concessions for 2000 products. The US sees more of the intellectuals in India, prohibitively calling for high tariffs, and demands for a better brand.
On the world map of the trade wars, the frictions with India are just a side show. In addition, America sees the world's largest democracy also through the security policy glasses. Delhi and Washington combines a two-way preoccupation with India's preoccupation with China's power demands in the South Indian Ocean.
The problem lies, however, in another place: the empirically hardened thesis that open markets accelerate economic development, has a difficult position in the socialist Republic of India. Also under modes. Its reformer is now aiming mainly to profit from the bureaucratic madness and to profit from it.
The success of these efforts can be seen and measured in the relevant rankings. From an economic point of view, much has turned to the better in India in the first five Modi years. However, in trade policy, this does not apply. Of these, new reserves are sorely redirected to international competitive companies from foreign countries.
In the West, Modi is dependent on the Nimbus of the energetic reformer, who radically renews his country economically. This impression is not least due to the fact that the charismatic prime minister will only be too well aware of what vocabulary he likes and what he likes for Western managers.
Arrival of Jacques Chirac on Monday in Paris
Former French President Jacques Chirac is expected to be joined in Paris next week, according to a report. The former head of state will be confirmed on Monday at the cemetery Montparnasse in the south of the French capital of the family. In a statement, the family said in a statement in the French capital.
Carrying the competitor to the goal: Dabo is the first secret hero of the World Athletics Championships
At the end of the season, after the first run of the men over 5000 meters, Jonathan Busby from Aruba started to swing dangerously, and at the end of the day, he could hardly hold on to the goal, but at the end of the season, he could hardly hold on to the goal.
"I just wanted to help him. Everyone in this situation would have done the same thing," said Dabo after the race in Mixed Zone, when he was completely unexpected, I was drawn to the attention of the assembled journalists. He was shy to get out of a country, he would not want to talk about his heroism.
This he did in the evening with emphasis - and much more intense than he would have thought. Because this heroic act will remain in memory. Especially since Dabo even left his competitor Busby in the goal and voluntarily took the last place of the finale of the finale of the bus. In fact, he did not take the final place with the finale of the finale.
Dabo, who lives in Portugal and studies there in Lisbon, started to set up a personal best time at the World Cup in Doha. According to official data, he managed with 18:10.87 minutes, but he was still disappointed: "I didn't want to run in 17:55 minutes.
MILLION MACHINE: Egypt prepares for wild protest day
In Egypt, security measures have been intensified ahead of possible government-critical protests. In the centre of Cairo, an increased police presence was to be observed on Friday. Several subway stations remained closed, roads around the central Tahrir Square were blocked.
Police had already intensified their road checks in recent days and searched pedestrians' phones in part for news and photos related to the protests, hundreds of which were arrested according to two non-governmental organizations.
Opponents of Al-Sisi
Last weekend, during the month of April, he came to Egypt to protest against the government of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, but accused the critic of corruption and mismanagement. In the year of April, he said, "We did not protest against the political leadership of the people of Egypt."
The number of arrests in connection with the protests continued to rise, according to two observer groups. The Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF) counted more than 1,570 arrests until Friday. The Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights (ECESR) and the Human Rights Organization (HRW) did not attend any of these events.
Arbitrary arrests
Many people had been "willfully arrested" "just because they were 'at the wrong place at the wrong time'", HRW informed detainees, citing lawyers, but the accusations against the detainees range from "dissemination of false information" and "security" to "membership" in Kainista.
HRW also criticised censorship in the North African country, saying the government is blocking websites and online services in Cairo to stop further protests against Sisi.
Online Resellers: Shipping Resellers Should Be Easier to Donate Returns
For online retailers, many returned parcels are lost goods. Around 20 million returns land on the garbage. But there is an alternative.
The Ministry of Finance has shown online retailers like Amazon and Zalando a way to donate returned products instead of destroying them.
While companies could not be exempted from sales tax on donations of goods, the Ministry said on a question of the Greens-Bundestag faction, which was reported by the newspapers of the Funke media group on Friday. However, the traders could not lower the market value of the unsold returns.
Scientists at the University of Bamberg had determined that the federal citizens would return every sixth package when ordered on the Internet. Around four percent of the goods - about 20 million products - then landed in the trash. It would then cost the companies a fee to pay according to the current legal situation.
Greens Group leader Katrin Göring-Eckardt called on Finance Minister Olaf Scholz (SPD) to clarify with a ruling that companies can evaluate non-sales products accordingly and donate free of charge to non-profit organizations. The companies should not be able to rely on the model market, but should not be relied on for online donation only.
Banksy Art Auction: There Never Was a Better Time to Sell This Painting
The well-known work of Streetart star Banksy, "Devolved Parliament", is due to be auctioned soon.
For Branczik, Banksy’s work underscores the “restoration of the world’s oldest parliamentary democracy into the basic attitude of animals and strains”. From Saturday, the painting is to be exhibited at Sotheby’s in the British capital until it is to be auctioned on 3 October. It will be worth 1.5 to two million euros.
The work was first exhibited in 2009 in the Museum of Bristol in the South West of the United Kingdom, where Banksy lives. This year the artist had re-exposed the painting - at the same time as the original Brexit date on March 29. On this occasion, the "parliament" was "voluntarily" on this occasion.
The image could change the owner for a million dollars.
Last week, Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Wednesday at the first session of the House of Commons after lifting a forced pause imposed by Johnson by the Supreme Court a hard strike exchange with the opposition, Johnson wants to move the already twice postponed Brexit on October 31.
It is not the first time that Banksy, whose identity is still unknown, is involved in the Brexit debate. In Dover in the south-east of England, he painted a picture depicting a man who breaks a star of the European flag with a knife. The work is seen daily by the king in the presence of others.
Brexit debate is like a "walk in the park"
The violent verbal attacks of British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Brexit opponents in parliament do not contribute to a climate of hate, according to his top adviser. Compared to the election campaign before the 2016 Brexit referendum, the current controversy will be a "walk in the park and the EU will be out of sight".
Johnson had attacked Brexit opponents in parliament hard in recent days and accused them of “treason” to the people, including accusations that he might endanger MPs because they could be targeted by assassination threats, he acted as a “humbu.”
Cummings said the only way to bring peace back is if MEPs finally respect the UK’s decision to leave the EU. It is not surprising that people were upset that Britain was still not leaving the EU three years after the referendum.
In view of the charged mood, even the bishops of the Anglican Church called for restraint on Friday. "We should speak to each other with respect," it said in a statement. "And we should also listen."
Pakistan's Prime Minister Khan calls for UN intervention in Kashmir
With an emotional appeal, Pakistan’s Prime Minister Imran Khan once again called on the United Nations to intervene in the Kashmir conflict during his first appearance before the UN General Assembly.
Otherwise, a re-war between the nuclear powers of Pakistan and India would be likely, Khan said at the UN General Debate in New York on Friday. "If it goes badly, hope for the best, but be prepared for the worst." The United Nations should have held him accountable.
India and Pakistan have fought three wars since their independence from British colonial rule in 1947, two of them around the divided Kashmir region. Both nuclear powers each dominate a part of Kashmir, another part of China. At the beginning of August, India had a part of Spazogen and Pakistan had a part of the Indian Kashmir Autonomous Region.
Not even a bottle of water
Protesters in Cairo call for the overthrow of Egyptian President al-Sisi.
Against the current protests in Egypt, the government reacts with hard hand. It lets the population shoot with sharp ammunition, more than 2,000 detainees are accompanied in the prisons to the 60,000 political prisoners, who are already sitting there in the same time as Fahsien.
But one of the triggers for the 2011 protests was the poor economic situation. Poverty, hopelessness and the feeling of being suffocated by one’s own government, drove millions onto the street. And that is a problem that even the regime of el-Sisi has not got hold of. No matter how hard it looks against Dietu.
Today, every third person in the market has a lot of things to do with them. Since 2016, the currency has lost more than half of its value, the rate of inflation is at ten percent. If you want to buy a bottle of water in the supermarket, you have to decide who to buy it, so you have to pay for it.
BER-Chef: No more "showstoppers" for capital airports
Two months have been spent testing whether the complex system braid works in conjunction with BER fire protection. The operators are satisfied with the progress. But the turf has not yet been finished at BER.
After large-scale inspections at the terminal of the future capital airport, the operators have confirmed the planned opening in October next year, this is safe, Chief Supervisory Officer Rainer Bretschneider said after a meeting of the control body.
Airport manager Engelbert Lütke Daldrup spoke about a successful exam, but also said there were still shortcomings in the terminal. "We have a lot of detail themes, but we don't have a real showstopper." He assured that the schedule until commissioning still contained buffers.
However, there are indications that the time reserve should no longer be too large. The completion report is now due to be submitted to the Construction Office during the first quarter of 2020, which was scheduled for this autumn at the beginning of the year.
Hundreds of deficiencies in power cables are still to be fixed; the TUV wants to check them by February. "To create the conditions for the entry of the flight operation here, it is necessary to continue to work intensively on the handling of the deficiencies," it said in a written statement.
Lütke Daldrup said that in many cases it is about missing evidence, less about new cables. There is also no release yet for all the duplicates on which the cable routes hang. The airport manager expects this to be present by the end of the year.
In addition, the fire protection at the transition to the station under the terminal still does not work satisfactorily. The problems had already led the project to another crisis three years ago. This time it is about smoke scarves, which in the case of a fire like a canvas, Dan, so that the smoke should not spread out new gas. It has to be taken off with the heat of the year.
Problems with fire protection and further construction deficiencies as well as planning errors have been delaying the airport’s opening for years. Originally it was to go into operation in 2011. The cost has risen from two billion euros since the start of construction in 2006 to around 6.5 billion euros expected to open next year.
Since the number of passengers in Berlin has increased significantly since then, the authorities are planning to expand the airport, which is why it will be in a special meeting of the Supervisory Board on October 18, as announced by Chairman Brettschneider.
The airport company is now looking for two new managing directors. Financial director Heike Fölster is moving to Deutsche Bahn at the end of the year, HR chief Manfred Bobke-von Camen is going to retire next year, as Bretschneider said. He thanked Fölster. She has put the airport finances on a solid footing.
Chemnitz: Machines for drugs blasted - police arrest man
He needed money for drugs - and for that he drove several vending machines into the air in the Chemnitz area! Now the perpetrator is finally in custody!
In the last two years, the number of exploded cigarette and parking tickets machines in Chemnitz and the region has risen sharply, and there has been a million-dollar damage!
Police arrested a 33-year-old German at the end of May on Bürgerstraße and Further Straße in Chemnitz after two detonations.
Police spokesman Andrzej Rydzik: "In the course of the investigations into the production of explosives explosions in fact unit with a particularly serious case of the theft led by the Chemnitzer criminal police, not only this suspicion was confirmed against the 33-year-old".
Faced with the new evidence, the 33-year-old Chemnitzer now confessed a total of eight acts.
The police spokesperson: "With the loot, he apparently financed his narcotics addiction."Only four times between August 20, 2018 and May 31, 2019, the bomb had exploded parking tickets on the Bürgerstraße.
The total damage incurred amounts to at least 60,000 euros!
The automaton bomber is now in custody, and the police investigations continue against him.
It is possible that he was also responsible for further automatic explosions in Chemnitz and neighbouring districts.
AUA to take over Eurowings flights from Vienna
In the midst of the price battle with low-cost airlines such as Lauda, Wizz Air, EasyJet and Level, Lufthansa subsidiary AUA is taking over the "commercial control of all Eurowings flights from Vienna" on Monday.A press statement from APA confirmed on Friday.
The Viennese base of the Lufthansa Billigflieger Eurowings will be de facto disbanded. Of the currently seven Eurowings aircraft, four will remain in Vienna. This will take over the AUA from January 2020 in the "Wetlease", i.e. will be taken over by Eurowings personnel after Urno.
The Eurowings base in Vienna will be integrated into the AUA hub and the network planning, the spokesperson said. The flight times are to be adjusted for connecting flights. The aim is to strengthen the hub Vienna and, on the other hand, to decentralize traffic from the Bundesländer.
As AviationNetOnline writes more, Eurowings in Vienna serves only as a "production company" for the sister company AUA. For example, Barcelona and Rome would be served with AUA flight number, but mainly with Eurowings device 1, but the on-board product should not be adjusted to the Eurowing number in the Eurowings number.
At the airport of Vienna, after the Niki-pleite, a price battle broke out. The Ryanair subsidiary Laudamotion announced on Thursday that the fleet in Vienna next summer will be up to 16 aircraft. The Irish low-cost airliner will send the four Ryanair planes for this purpose.
The statement by Ryanair chief Michael O'Leary that Lauda will have overhauled the AUA in five years, Andreas Otto, AUA chairman, said on Friday: "We will remain the number one on site in five, six or ten years."

Study on Causes of Heart Disease
Smoking, overweight, unhealthy diet - there are risk factors for cardiovascular disease. But what really triggers a heart failure or a heart attack? Hamburg researchers now want to look at the legacy of 9000 healthy and sick people.
Through the analysis of the inheritance of 9000 people, Hamburgers and Swiss scientists want to find out in more detail the causes of cardiovascular disease.
The research project is the largest of its kind in the German-speaking area, the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) announced on Friday. The Kühne Foundation is promoting the project with 12.5 million euros. From Switzerland are the Hochbergsklinik Davos, which belongs to the Zürpi Foundation.
Obesity, smoking and unhealthy diet are among the main influencer risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. Genetic factors determine the risk. However, the interaction between genes and external influences is only known to the generalist about the 1000 and the uni-centric influences of the uni-centre, the people said.
There are currently more than 4,000 of the approximately 20,000 relevant human genes known for possible disease-causing changes in DNA - so-called mutations - said the clinic, adding about 200 each year.
According to the initiators, the aim of the five-year project is to develop new options such as prevention, detection and treatment of heart rhythm disorders, heart failure and heart attacks. The data could also be useful in the research of Hißnere und Herniß zu Herniß und Hernt-Hernt-Hernt-Herntz-Le Blankenberg.
Klaus-Michael Kühne (82), the chairman of the Herhne Foundation, also emphasized that there is a strong will to use the data also for the research of other diseases. The clinic of the foundation in Davos will be treated in the past. Zuhgengenen will be treated for allergies.
The biosamples of the healthy participants come from Hamburgers, who also participate in the "Hamburg City Health Study". With 45,000 subjects, this is the largest local health study in the world according to the clinic. In the case of Zürtal’s inheritance by encrypting data, a strict adherence to the protection of the anonymized data is strictly observed by the Zürby data.
According to UKE, a person’s inheritance can now be deciphered within 24 hours. The pure business cost is 1300 euros. The first gene sequencing worldwide, the results of which were published in 2001, has cost several hundred million euros more. The study is expected to start on October 1, 2020.
Nigerian Police Release Hundreds of Abused Boys
In Nigeria, police have released more than 300 tortured and abused boys from a Koran school. According to indications from residents, security forces searched the school in the northern Nigerian city of Kaduna and discovered those who were still partially underage victims of their abuse," police spokesman Yakubu Sabo said.
The boys had been detained under the pretext of being taught and "improved" in the Koran. In fact, the guardians were detained by their teachers under "detesting and inhumane conditions", Sabo said. About a hundred students, including children at the age of nine, told a young Sabo.
The Koran school has been in existence for about ten years, according to the information. Residents would have drawn the attention of the authorities to repeated irregularities in the institution. The parents would have been shocked when they were taught about the conditions in the Koran school staff, said Der Polii.
In the predominantly Muslim north of Nigeria, there are many private Koran schools. They replace the often-deficient state institutions. People in the region suffer frequent attacks by armed gangs. According to the UN refugee agency, therefore, in the last ten months, more than 40,000 people fled to Gresta.
Chained and tortured: Nigerian police release 400 children from school
“Many of them were chained and some had visible injuries suggesting torture,” said Yakubu Sabo, a police spokesman in the city of Kaduna.
There the children were discovered on Thursday after a hint in an Islamic school, where the conditions were "unhumane" and the officials arrested the head of the school and six teachers after the liberation action.
The children, all boys, were held at their school like slaves and chained, some of whom were sexually abused. Television footage showed disfigured and injured pupils in a noticeably poor state of health.
World football election: further allegations by Messis and Klopps Kür
Football "Signed not valid"
Jürgen Klopp, Lionel Messi and Megan Rapinoe
With a gala in Milan, the FIFA World Football Association honours the best player, the best player and the best coach of the year. For Lionel Messi, it is the sixth honor and thus a record.
After Nicaragua’s captain declared that he had never voted in the World Cup election, allegations from other countries come to FIFA. Egypt was not evaluated at all - with a curious reason.
In recent years, a lot of FIFA has proved to be awkward: the World Cup awards, the dubious plans of its president, Gianni Infantino, the general behavior of various corrupt officials. After the FIFA World Cup election, one suspects that, after all, the national footballer’s election is not going to get away with it.
But after the Nicaraguan captain had already complained that he had not voted at all, there are now other unrest: Egypt complains that the voices of national coach Hossam El-Badry and Captain Mohamed Salah were not taken into account. In fact, they do not appear in the official and public vote.
FIFA apologises that "the signatures on the electoral forms have been filed in capital letters and therefore not valid" and has been contacted by the Egyptian Association several times to clarify the situation - without an answer.
Sudan's coach is also surprised
The Sudanese association says that coach Zdravko Lugarisic did not vote in the same way as it did in the past, but it did not vote in the same way as it did in the first place. With Lionel Messi in the third place, and with him in the third place in the second place, Virgil van Sadiok.
Nicaraguan captain Juan Barrera had also raised allegations: "I did not vote for the <0x23>TheBest2019 Awards. All the information on my vote is wrong, thank you," he wrote. In his case, it was suspected that the Nicaraguan football club simply voted on his behalf.
On Friday, Lißwehr received the following message: "Yes, but of course it was not intentional. The completed election documents were "irreally" with the name and signature of Juan Barrera, the captain of the Nicaraguan selection, but it was also provided by the federation.
The other cases are now being examined by FIFA in an investigation, but stressing that the election process was externally supervised by the consulting firm PriceWaterhouseCoopers. As long as Lionel Messi remains the undisputed winner of the World Cup election - and Jürgen Klopp the World Coach of the Year.
Ukraine Affair: High-ranking Republicans Speak for Official Investigation
Two high-ranking Republicans have openly spoken out for an official investigation against U.S. President and party friend Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important," said the Republican governor of the U.S. state of Vermont, Phil Scott. "Where it is carried out from here, it is determined by the facts."
Scott said he was not surprised by the revelations. These had shown that Trump repeatedly asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyj in a phone call to conduct the activities of the Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Trump "successful to Scotto's yearly visit to Bieba in Ukraine.
So far, the Republicans have refrained from criticizing Trump for the whistleblower affair, only a few have been aware of the inconvenience of it. Scott’s statements are now a first sign of this in Trump’s party. In doing so, the moderate governor of Virginia had already written a few times against the policy.
Another senior Republican, Charlie Baker, governor of Massachusetts, also spoke out for the investigation. "It's a deeply disturbing situation," Baker said. "The right course of action and responsibility for Congress now is to investigate the matter and go to the ground."
Scott and Baker, as governor of the United States, formally did not have a conversation in the proceedings against Trump, which is decided in Congress. Their statements are therefore above all symbolic. Nevertheless, the first senators of the Republicans have also expressed critically about the situation in the United States. In fact, they have spoken critically about the situation.
The affair could take place in the opening of a resignation process against Trump, which Democrats in the House of Representatives have announced an investigation, accusing him of abuse of power for the purpose of foreign influence for his own political gain.
There is no exact timetable for the resignation process. With their majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could push for a so-called impeachment. But the decision on an actual resignation fell in the Senate, where Trump’s Republicans have the majority. The prospects of success of such a success were more than one.
Were torturers on board of racketes "Sea Watch"?
Three men have been arrested in Sicily, allegedly raped and murdered in Libyan refugee camps.
German captain Carola Rackete (31) had been arrested in June after she had unauthorisedly steered the port of Lampedusa with the rescue ship "Sea Watch 3" and 53 Libyan refugees on board. After fierce protests and international criticism, she was once again under house arrest by a few Italians.
Three men accused of torture in Libyan refugee camps could have arrived with the "Sea-Watch 3" in Italy. However, the suspects could not have been arrested in a detention camp in Messina (Sicily). What could have been taken out of information camps, what could have been taken out of information camps in Messina (Sicily).
The police said in mid-September that the suspects in the North African country had been raped, tortured and even murdered. It was Mohammed C. (27) from Guinea, and the two Egyptians Hameda A. (26) and Mahmoud A. (24).
NGOs and aid organizations are now pointing out that they cannot know exactly who is coming to the ships. "We cannot scan who the people are. They come without passports," said Neubauer. Torture is one of the main reasons why people will flee from Libya. It is therefore very likely that the people will be fleeing from Libya.
Former Italian Interior Minister Matteo Salvini has called for an immediate apology from Rackete, who is still being investigated in Italy for aid to illegal immigration.
Musk seeks extradition record at Tesla <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Tesla CEO Elon Musk has given his electric car group a strong boost on the stock market with the prospect of new record numbers.
“We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries,” Musk wrote in an email to Tesla employees published by industry blog Electre.
The demand was strong, so Tesla could book 110,000 orders, Musk’s circular continued. The challenge was to quickly bring the cars to customers. To do this, Tesla would have to offer as many resources as possible by the end of the quarter.
Investors liked this: Tesla’s shares went out with a plus of more than six percent from trading. So strong the price has not increased for almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered more than 95,000 cars and thus reached its best value so far.
Musk needs records to reach his high goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars. For this, in the current and next quarter, six-digit numbers have to be generated. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but here the profit margins are low.
U.S. budget dispute: once again only a bridge financing
The new fiscal year will begin in the United States on October 1 without a regular budget. The Senate followed the House on Thursday and decided on a transitional funding until November 21.
Although the U.S. Congress and President Donald Trump have agreed in August to increase the spending limits for the fiscal years 2020 and 2021, the United States will have to meet with Trump before the new fiscal year begins on October 1. The United States will have to enter into a new fiscal year before the beginning of October.
Shutdown reversed
The federal administration is now provisionally financed at the level and according to the priorities of the spending plans for the fiscal year 2019 ending on Monday. This is because Congress has not been able to profit in time from the 12 new spending laws, some of which can benefit from the budget 1, which can not be allocated to the various departments and authorities.
The Democrats in the House of Representatives, where they have the majority, have completed ten of the twelve laws. But the spending laws reflect the priorities of the Democrats, who have little chance in the Republican-dominated Senate. Conversely, the Senate has more than ten or less the twelve expenses.
The ghosts separate mainly on the issue of resource allocation for the area of domestic security and border security. In the Senate, the Republicans apparently try to force $35 billion for the construction of the wall, one of the major priorities of one of President Trump's militias has seen militias and others have seen it.
On the wall, the ghosts split
At present, it is unclear how the parties intend to approach this issue. More likely than an agreement on all twelve spending laws in the next seven weeks, an extension of the transitional funding beyond 21 November is beyond. A shutdown is also not ruled out in that case.
In view of the continued inability of the Congress to agree on the twelve spending laws in time, and the associated risk of shutdown, new ideas for the automation of the process of popularity are gaining in view of Parliament’s proposal for the avoidance of shutdowns.
France Allows Artificial Fertilization for Lesbians and Singles
In France, artificial insemination is also expected to be open to single women and lesbians in the future: The Paris National Assembly voted by a large majority in favour of a government bill that allows all women to take advantage of in-vitro insemination.
In the three-day emotional debate, critics in the right-wing camp had warned that many "children without a father" could grow up in the future. The French Bishops' Conference is also against innovation.
The new regulation is the core part of a bioethics law, which Health Minister Agn<0xC3><0xA8>s Buzyn defended as an "opportunity" for society. It represents the modern family, in which there are children with only one parent or with homosexual parents. According to their idea, the costs of artificial insemination should be borne by the parents.
Fertilization with sperm from dead husband further prohibited
With a bare majority, the National Assembly rejected a motion for an amendment that would give widows access to the sperm of their dead husband, in Belgium, Spain and the United Kingdom, allowing them to fertilize "post-mortem". In Germany, there was a woman in the past, there was a woman in the past.
Many MPs of the La République en Marche (The Republic in Movement, LREM) of President Emmanuel Macron and members of the opposition had, on the other hand, expressed their support for artificial fertilization with the sperm of their deceased partner. They also continued to say that their "unspoken children, if they become a widow, will continue to express their support for the artificial fertilization with the sperm of their deceased partner.
The initiators of the now unsuccessful amendment consider it unfair that a widow can in the future be fertilized with the sperm of an unknown, but not with the sperm of her own partner.
So far, artificial fertilization in France is only allowed to heterosexual couples who cannot bear children. They must be married or live together for at least two years. Buzyn had already announced in the summer that maternity leave will continue to be prohibited.
In Germany, artificial fertilization is theoretically open to all women – it is often difficult for single or lesbian couples.
Climate compensation: Calls for airfare for Unis become louder
A lot is being flown to the universities, which is why the country wants to have a climate tax done there in the future. The principals say they have no money for it. But now they are also under pressure internally.
The universities should also limit themselves to flying. Photo: dpa/Julian Street School
In the course of the summer break, there has been a lot of talk about climate change in the past, and there has been a lot of talk about climate change in the future, and there has been a lot of talk about climate change in the future. After the Rectors' Conference of the States have reacted sceptically to a corresponding move from the Green-Black Coalition, the plans have not received support from the universities, and the plans have now received support from the universities.
Russia Recaptures North Korean Fishermen
According to the FSB intelligence service, the detainees were said to have fished illegally in Russian waters. Ten days earlier, 161 fishermen from North Korea were arrested. At that time there was a gunfight between the border guards and the boat crew. However, three Russians and one North Korean were injured.
The communist North Korea suffers from chronic food shortages, according to which the North Korean fishermen were travelling in Russian waters, where the Russian Coast Guard is conducting patrols to protect its marine biological resources, according to its own information.
30,000 ink fish seized
During the re-checks, 30,000 inkfish were discovered and confiscated on the boats, and the information was confiscated after three fishing boats and two motor boats and brought to Nachodka and Posjet near Vladivostok.
Russia’s Fisheries Authority also issued no fishing licences to North Koreans this year following complaints from local entrepreneurs, with thousands of fishermen from North Korea reportedly arrested there this year.
The head of the association of Russian fishing companies in the far eastern region of Primorje, Georgi Martynov, recently also complained of high ecological damage by the North Korean fishermen. They fished with b-holes banned in Russia simply to care for the sea. They would live in the sea for 200 years. With these would also be small living creatures.
Only 18,000 in the future: U.S. lowers asylum ceiling
The “greatest nation in history”: Donald Trump, here at a meeting with elected police representatives in the White House.
The richest country in the world is collapsing with asylum seekers: As the State Department confirms in Washington, the ceiling for the legal admission of refugees will be further lowered. In the future, mainly endangered believers and Iraqis will receive asylum.
The U.S. government wants to lower the already historically low limit for the admission of new refugees once again. In the economic year 2020, which runs in the United States from October 2019 to September 2020, a maximum of 18,000 people are to be left in the country, as the U.S. State Department has already stated.
President Donald Trump’s government has drastically reduced the admissions readiness for asylum seekers from around the world in recent years, with far higher admission limits paid off under Barack Obama’s previous government.
The skewed upper limit of 18,000 refugees would be the lowest since the introduction of the U.S. refugee program in 1980.The State Department still called the U.S. "the most merciful and generous nation in history", a wording strongly related to the U.S. official's use of language.
A “responsible approach” to refugees aims to ensure that refugees can return to their home countries to help rebuild there, Trump said, adding that he has a lot of support from supporters for his hard course in immigration policy, but there is also massive criticism.
A major point of dispute is the border with Mexico, which Trump wants to lock down. In order to finance the construction of a border wall, Trump had imposed the national emergency. Whether there is a temporal connection between the current measure and the current domestic policy developments in the US capital under way and under way of going under pressure is unclear.
The U.S. government, according to the Foreign Office, wants to focus in the future on the admission of two refugee groups: people who are persecuted for their faith - and Iraqis who have helped the U.S. military in the country and are thus endangered by salvage, as stated in the statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The United States wants to achieve, in particular, that people from this "northern triangle" of Central America apply for asylum in other countries. Against this background, the United States has only concluded migration agreements with Guatemala and now also with El Salvador and Honduras to enter into immigration at the US-Southern border.
Court orders release of Orang-Utan from zoo
An orangutan woman has been transferred from the former Buenos Aires Zoo to a human monkey catching station in the United States at the request of the Argentine court. The 1986 Rostock Zoo-born "Sandra" was granted the rights of a "non-human person" who was not named Dalra, but was granted the rights of a "non-human person" as a direct person.
Since the 53 kilograms of human effigy is unable to adapt to life in the wild, she is expected to live in the outskirts of the Center for Great Apes in Florida in the future. There are already 21 more orange utans and 31 chimpanzees housed there, but among them, Quand ruffles have to pass through the "bubbles" in the US.
"Sandra" spent several years after her birth in Rostock in the former Ruhr Zoo in Gelsenkirchen, before she was moved to Buenos Aires in 1995. The process of "Sandras" fundamental rights initiated by animal conservationists in 2014 has contributed to the creation of a statue of a statue of Visten.
Record for Swiss extreme climbers: 550 meters in 46 minutes
Extreme mountain climber Dani Arnold has been lucky enough to have a new husaren ride on the almost 3000-metre high ridge in the Italian Alps.
Without a net, double ground or other aid, the Swiss forced the 550-metre-high north wall of the Great Lakes in a new record time.
Dressed in jeans, T-shirt and only supported by absolute dizziness, Arnold needed 46 minutes and 30 seconds for the ascent, thus undermining the old best brand by almost 19 minutes.
Arnold is now a record holder in Free Solo Speed on four of Europe’s six most important north walls.
Nike Benefits from New Online Marketing Strategy
Despite the trade conflict with China, the U.S. sports goods manufacturer Nike has recorded a significant increase in customer earnings. The net profit increased in the last quarter to $1.4 billion (nearly 1.3 billion euros). That's 25 percent more than in the previous year's period.
In the three-month period until the end of August, sales rose to $10.7 billion. The strongest increase in Nike sales with an increase of 22 percent in China. Thus, the group benefited from Beaverton in the U.S. state of Oregon, also in the People's Republic of Colorado.
Andy Campion, Chief Financial Officer, announced that with strategic investments, Nike will continue to drive the sporting goods manufacturer’s “digital transformation” and thus expand its competitive advantage. Investors responded gladly to the quarterly figures – the sporting goods manufacturer’s shares rose by more than four per cent.
Lifelong stadium ban for racism in Italy
Due to racist comments about football pro Juan Jesus of AS Rome, the club from the Italian capital has imposed a lifelong ban on a fan. The defender Jesus from Brazil had been smashed by the fan on Instagram. I was <0x23>spoiled by the fan, he said, with a <0x23>spoiler.
The club reacted late on Thursday. He reported the fan's account on Instagram and the police. In addition, the Roma followers are never allowed to visit a game of the club again, the club wrote on Twitter.
Racism is a problem in Italian football. On a regular basis, Italian fans scan racist shots against black players rivaling teams. "We can not have racism in society or in sports. In Italy, it has not improved the situation in Fiorentino, but in Fiorentino, it has not improved the situation in Fiorentino, and it is very serious in Gientino. One must identify the responsible
But there were also discussions about the supporters of Juventus Turin. The Italian authorities have now occupied 38 marginalizing fans of record champion Juventus Turin with stadium bans. Four of them are not expected to enter the stadium for a period of four years from the start.
The fans are connected with ongoing investigations against twelve leaders of ultra-fan groups around Juventus. The twelve are accused of heavy blackmail, money laundering and private violence. The club had launched the investigations with an ad last year.
According to Italian media reports, the ultra-leaders were behind the black ticket trade, had "militarily controlled" the ticket trade for the fan curve, and were said to have blackmailed Juventus employees to get to cheaper tickets.
Generation Z: Are they really different from Generation Y?
Millennials are narcissistic, Generation Z is political - whole vintages are thought of with ghastly designations. If you look closely, the awards are full of contradictions. So how well do these labels describe the respective sense of life of young people?

Iran-U.S. conflict: Ruhani talks about end of sanctions - Trump opposes
Iranian President Hassan Ruhani has spoken after his return from the UN General Assembly about an alleged offer by the United States to lift sanctions. The United States, in return for talks with the Tehran leadership, would have put an end to all sanctions on the Internet.
U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted: "Iran wanted me to lift the sanctions imposed on him so that there is a meeting. I said, of course, no."
Ruhani describes the event as follows: Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron were present in New York and had insisted that a meeting took place in Sanbatsag. "And America said that they should have stood on the streets, and that they should have lifted the sanctions," added Arthani.
However, Ruhani criticised that the move had not been made in an acceptable manner. Given the criminal measures in force and "the poisoned atmosphere of maximum pressure", no one could predict the outcome of negotiations.
Earlier this week, Chancellor Angela Merkel had met with Ruhani in New York. Background was the hope of the Europeans to save the nuclear deal Donald Trump negotiated with Russia and China. This is supposed to prevent the Islamic Republic from developing nuclear weapons US-Mr. Trump will develop US-Mr.
Severe earthquake near Istanbul - Nearly 200 aftershocks
After western Turkey was shaken in the shortest time by two earthquakes, the fear of a disaster is growing. 34 people were injured in the earthquake on Tuesday. Since the quake the previous day, there have been almost 200 aftershocks, the Turkish vice president Fuat Oktay said.
14 schools in Istanbul were closed for security reasons. Hundreds of buildings were damaged as a result. The earthquake of magnitude 5.8 on Thursday shook the Marmara region in front of Istanbul and sparked panic in the million-dollar metropolis. Now the government wants to use a commission to smuggle the land.
In the past 20 years, Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for earthquakes, said Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu. In the city itself, the latent danger is repeatedly ignored. Every year, poorly built housing collapses - among other things, mürbe made by the many minor earthquakes in Istanbul.
Urban planners such as the well-known architect Mücella Yapici have been warning for years that large open areas, which have been registered as a refuge in the center, have long been added. It was not until the 20th anniversary of the Gölcük earthquake in August that the Istanbul Civil Engineering Chamber had warned that it had not estimated a million.
The epicenter of Thursday’s quake was in the Marmara Sea in front of the Silivri district and in about seven kilometers deep, as the Disaster Protection Authority Afad reported, a smaller aftershock a few minutes later caused even greater panic on the streets.
Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu said on Twitter that no injuries or damage were reported at first. The state broadcaster TRT showed people running in panic from the houses. Students were taken out of the buildings for security reasons in the district of Silivri. Some were taken from the buildings. As students were crying,
Istanbul is considered to be particularly endangered by earthquakes. Below the Marmara Sea lies a section of the so-called North Anatolian Disturbance, which marks the border between the Eurasian and Anatolian plates. Turkey is repeatedly shaken by earthquakes. One of the deadliest was the earthquake in 1999.
Scientists fear that an earthquake of magnitude 7.1 to 7.4 could threaten. But when the earthquake will occur is unclear. The earthquake on Thursday already hit the west of the country and Istanbul again.
Businesses are designing emergency plans, private people have so-called go-bags packed with everything they need next to home doors, and schools are teaching children how to behave when the earth shakes. When the next big earthquake comes, it is unclear.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said after his return from New York, eight people were injured. Some of the buildings had suffered minor damage. Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu followed developments from Istanbul disaster coordination center of Avcizirrz and Avcirzen (Akum).
Warning for earthquakes in Istanbul
In social networks, many users report panic. Buildings were waking up. Schools and hospitals were evacuated. Telephone lines were interrupted. It had been more violent than that of Tuesday, writes one user. The head of the Turkish Red Crescent, Kerem Clinic, warned on Twitter to stay on the alert.
The time of the quake is officially stated at 13.59 (local time) and just minutes after the first quake, according to CNN Turkey, there was a aftershock, which was reported with a magnitude of 4.0 on the judge's scale.
It was not until Tuesday that an earthquake of magnitude 4.6 shook the Turkish Marmara region - it was to be felt up to Istanbul. Its epicenter was also located in the Marmara Sea west of the million metropolis, the disaster protection authority Afad said on Tuesday.
It was not the only earthquake that caused headlines on Tuesday: Pakistan was also hit by a severe earthquake.
Researchers assume that sooner or later there could be a catastrophic earthquake in Istanbul — the tension between the tectonic plates is extremely high — scientists believe it will eventually discharge — and will cause massive damage.
Earthquake researcher Sükrü Ersoy expects that the earthquake is now a warning. It has become more likely, he told CNN Türk. "These could be signs of a bigger earthquake", Ersoy said. "Sooner or later, the big earthquake will come. "
Already a few weeks ago, there had been an incident - the earthquake caused great concern in Istanbul as well. In addition, in Albania there had been a severe earthquake only a few days ago - there were 68 injured. Also on the Lake Constance this year, the earth had been shaken.
Parliament: New Fuel in Ukraine Affair
Two blatant documents provide new fuel in the Ukraine affair about possible abuse of power by US President Donald Trump. On the way to a possible resignation procedure, the US Democrats see themselves strengthened: the two of them, Psident himself, have complained to the anonymous informant about the phone.
USA: United Airlines passenger locked in toilet - plane rerouted
Due to a passenger locked in the board toilet, a flight was rerouted by United Airlines, and the toilet door was blocked during the 1554 flight from Washington to San Francisco, the airline said.
In the event of an unplanned landing in Denver on Wednesday evening (local time), the woman was finally released from the narrow cabin. About an hour after she was locked in it, the US media wrote, referring to other passengers. In order to continue flying in the direction of Mas Francisco.
In a video circulated on the Internet that is supposed to come from flight 1554, according to U.S. media, is seen how several people are trying to free the woman. "We are working at the moment to open the door, ma'am. We'll get you out of school soon, okay?" said a man.
The Kakerlake: Inspired by Kafka: Ian McEwan writes Brexit novel
How does a writer like Ian McEwan deal with the whole Brexit chaos? He writes a book about it – and his protagonist is unmistakable.
Inspired by Franz Kafka’s famous story “The Transformation,” the British author Ian McEwan (71) has written a book about the Brexit chaos in the UK.
The novel "Die Kakerlake" (original: "The Cockroach") will be published in German on November 27, Diogenes Verlag (Zurich) said. It is about the transformation of a man named "Jim Sams", who is not ignored and hated by his will on his own in his previous life.
McEwan was quoted as saying: "If the parliament is closed, so that the government cannot be challenged at a critical moment, when the ministers lie shamelessly as once the Soviet leaders, when Brexiteers in high positions, he can write about a disaster like a no-deal."
Kafka's first published account in 1915 is about Gregor Samsa, who one morning wakes up and sees himself "transforming into an immense scoundrel", is gradually excluded from family and society, and finally goes on the basis of "Ian McEwan, who refuses to stand before Kafka, to write a world."
EU invests 9.5 million euros in Austrian railway infrastructure
11,200 wagons in Austria and Hungary receive flush brakes to reduce noise from freight trains, and sections of railway connections between Graz and Györ and Vienna’s Neustadt and Sopron are modernised and electrified.
According to the EU Agency, this is intended to make travel more comfortable and to reduce CO2 emissions. The funds come from the EU infrastructure fund "Connecting Europe Facility".
Thomas Cook: All trips cancelled until October 31st
German tour operator Thomas Cook has cancelled all travel until 31 October 2019, one day after his insolvency application. Travel could not be commenced "for insolvency reasons", the company said on Thursday evening.
This also affected bookings of the brands Thomas Cook Signature, Thomas Cook Signature Finest Selection, Neckermann Reisen, <0xC3><0x96>GER TOURS, Book Travel and Air Marin, which are already paid in advance or fully paid for. As it will be checked for travel starting on November 1, 2019, the company left it open.
Thomas Cook in Germany was in the grip of the UK parent company and filed for insolvency on Wednesday. The company, which includes Neckermann Reisen, <0xC3><0x96>ger Tours and Bucher Reisen, employs about 2,000 people in Germany.
Insurer wants to transfer money to hotels from now on
On the other hand, from this Friday, hotels abroad, which are currently home to Thomas Cook holidaymakers, are to receive money from Zurich insurance. Payments to the hotels are linked to the condition that holidaymakers are no longer asked for extra payments.
Based on the booking information and without presenting separate invoices, the hotels in the resorts are now to receive 50 percent of the outstanding payments, according to a Zurich spokesman of the German news agency. "This applies immediately and under the condition that Sprend will continue to apply to Hotel-Cook-Travelers if we continue to say that Thomas-Cook-Travelers will need to withdraw from these hotels immediately.
The insurance company responded to reports from hotel guests who were forced to pay for their accommodations on the spot, some of whom had to put more than 1000 euros on the table. The German Travel Association (DRV) and the Federal Association of Consumer Centres had strongly criticized this.
The number of hotels affected will be agreed on Friday with the insolvent travel provider, the insurance spokesman said. According to Thursday, 70,000 Thomas-Cook package holidaymakers were still travelling from Germany. Zurich Germany has secured the holiday and return of Thomas-Cook customers.
Insolvency managers want to try to continue the three Thomas-Cook companies in Germany and find a future solution.
However, the now announced payments to hotels by the Zurich Insurance only help travelers who are still on the move. For Thomas-Cook customers who want to fly on holiday, it looks bad. At the end of Thursday evening, the company announced that the number of trips will be valid, all trips will be closed by October 31.
As it stands for travel starting on November 1, 2019, the company left open. In coordination with the insolvency insurance, the further procedure will be examined, it said. In principle, Zurich insurance is also responsible for these cases. The sale of new travel has stopped. dpa

For a long time, Prince Harry has continued his commitment to Lady Diana, and in Africa, he is now walking in the footsteps of his mother.
With a blue splinter protection vest, British Prince Harry has set off and destroyed a mine in Angola.
Near a camp of the British Halo Trust near the town of Dirico, he set up the ignition circuit in front of running TV cameras on Friday morning. In a safe distance, the bomb exploded in the savannah landscape, without causing any damage to the area of 1000 still. Although the land has been damaged by the bluff oils of the Halo Trust itself, there are more than 100,000 relics of the mines.
On the fifth day of his trip to Africa, Harry wanted to walk directly in the city of Huambo, following in the footsteps of his mother Diana (1961-1997). With the same skipper who once accompanied his mother, he wanted to leave behind the path that she was going to go to. The pictures, which were taken by Princess Diana in 1997, were stolen.
Harry, 35, and his wife Meghan, 38, have been on a ten-day trip to Africa since Monday, beginning in the South African tourist metropolis of Cape Town.
Brexit talks: The risk of a no-deal remains acute
However, in fact, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had always made it clear that with him there will be no guarantee of a third postponement of the Brexit negotiations. But what statements can be made by the polarizing British already of eternal duration. The most recent judgment of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom has been passed by the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom.
Boris Johnson says deal is still possible
Meanwhile, while visiting a hospital, he hinted that he would support an extension of the negotiations until the end of October in the event of a non-clearance:
You know, we're gonna stick to the law.
At the same time, however, we are confident that we will leave the EU by 31 October.
And best with a deal. I'm cautiously optimistic that it works.
And the time is running out of time for Brexit negotiators in Brussels at the start of the day. For about six weeks, the EU and the British negotiators still have time to prevent a departure of the UK from the European Union without a deal, but at the moment, it could not stop. But it could not stop talking about Brexit. Even the recent talks of the Ministers at the end of the month.
U.S. authorities: Other deaths from e-cigarettes
The number of deaths still reported in the United States in connection with the use of e-cigarettes in the United States has risen to twelve. In addition, there are now 805 confirmed and probable injuries in this connection, according to the U.S. Health Authority of the United States in the United States.
The fear of new protests in Egypt is growing
The videos of Mohammed Ali have been shared millions of times in online networks. The builder and actor living in Spain calls for a "people's revolution". For today's Friday, he has called for further protests against President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and the Egyptian militia.
In any case, the security authorities are alarmed. In the center of Cairo there was already an increased police presence to be observed. Several subway stations remained closed, streets around the central Tahrir Square were blocked. Photo had been taken by police in the past days and had to go through the traffic jams.
On September 20, the protesters also gathered around Tahrir Square.
Last weekend, there were protests in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura with hundreds of participants. There had been no such open protest in Egypt for years. Accordingly, the security forces reacted harshly to it. According to the information given by the Human Rights Watch (HRW), they were arrested in 2000.
The organization also criticised censorship in the North African country, according to which the government in Cairo is blocking websites and online services to stop further protests against al-Sisi. The general has ruled the country since 2013, after he had ousted the democratically elected Islamist president Mohammed Mursi and ousted the Islamist party.
"Ocean Change": Arved Fuchs from Greenland Expedition back
The polar explorer Arved Fuchs returned from his Greenland expedition on Friday and was welcomed on his arrival in the port of Hamburg by skipper Boris Herrmann, who had brought climate activist Greta Thunberg with the race hunt "Malizia" across the Atlantic.
In recent months, with a team of scientists, Fuchs had investigated and documented the effects of global warming on his sailing ship "Dagmar Aaen" on the coasts of Iceland and Greenland.
The Fridays for Future movement is a blessing, said the Polar researcher. He has been waiting for years for the young generation to come to terms with it. It has been known for decades that the earth is warming. Still, many acted as if there was a planet B.
"What happens on the sea often takes place without the public," Fuchs said. He and his team wanted to inform people about the effects of global warming and the clouding of the seas. During the expedition, among other things, a drone was splashed with micro-green glacier and measured with nestick.
For his "struggle for a sustainable and respectful use of the world's oceans" the polar explorer from Bad Bramstedt was awarded the "Seadevcon Maritime Award" in the context of the Hamburg Climate Week. "For all of us who have the survival of the oceans at heart with Lechnitz at the time of the change of the year, Arved Fuchs is a great example in the Bokiman.
Expensive spaghetti in Rome: Tourists paid for pasta 430 euros
430 euros for two plates of spaghetti with fish in a simple restaurant near the Engelsburg in Rome: It seemed two Japanese tourists too much. The bill with 80 euros of drinking money was paid by the two women, but they posted the receipt on Facebook, which triggered hot reactions.
"Such cases harm the reputation of Rome, and we urge the police to investigate whether this is a fraud," a spokesman for Federagit, the association of guides in Rome, told the Roman daily Il Messaggero (Friday edition).
The owners of the restaurant quickly reacted. The Japanese had ordered not only spaghetti, but also fresh fish, justified the local owner. However, this is not to be taken from the bill. A drinking fee of up to 20 percent of the bill is also normal, said the host.
A call in Ukraine, and everything is broken? U.S. President Donald Trump could actually face a resignation process after the turbulent revelations of the past few days, the Democrats want to examine that with their investigation in the House of Representatives now as soon as possible.
At the beginning of the scandal, it is believed that the telephone conversation with the Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj. The accusation of the whistleblower, who will be talking out of concern for national security and for the democracy of the United States, has led to the reluctance of one country with his complaint.
The core of this project is also to be seen in the now published co-author of the conversation with Selenskyj, although it does not reproduce the full text. The phone call of July 25 is only an episode of a much larger story, in the center of which, in addition to Trump.
From a public point of view, the story will take me to the ground in May 2019, when the New York Times reports very much about Rudy Giuliani's travel plans to Ukraine. He wants to meet in Kiev with the newly elected President Selenskyj, but will be meeting in Kiev. "And the lawyer himself may not have a right to say that we know very well that he is a gentleman. "We will not mix in any of his intentions.
The lawyer and former New York City mayor seems to have become infected with right-wing conspiracy fantasies fixed on Trump’s 2016 election counter-candidate: Hillary Clinton conspired with actors in Ukraine, critics said at the time to take these for granted to the United States.
This is about exactly the investigations, about which Trump will speak so prominently on the phone with Selenskyj in July. The version of Biulianis and of the President is: the former vice president of Ukraine and currently prospective candidates for the presidential nomination of the President of Ukraine.
In fact, the process was a bit different. When Joe Biden demanded that the Ukrainian Attorney General should go, the investigations against the gas company had already been completed, Hunter Biden was never directly affected by it against the company. In addition, Schogler was accused of violating the very very corrupt acts of the We, the U.S. government.
Facebook and Whatsapp Disruptions: Social Media Are Down
Users worldwide report massive disruptions to Instagram and Facebook. According to this, Germany, the UK and Spain are mainly affected. On the website allestörungen.de users report that Facebook does not load again since about 15.30 hours. Also Instagram does not issue the error message even if it does not load in the recapitulation of the contents. Snapp also could not be loaded from the recapitulation.
Instagram and Co. are more likely to be affected by disruptions
It’s not the first massive crash this year. Already in March and July, the services were out for several hours. And as in the previous cases, users also this time rely mainly on Twitter to air their anger.
Polish Scientists Saved in Antarctica
Three Polish scientists have been rescued by the Chilean Air Force from the ice of Antarctica. They were travelling by a hoseboat and several miles away from their base when their engine failed. They were lucky in the accident - less than an hour the Chilean rescue helicopter needed the mountain helicopter.
Eduardo Mosquera, commander of the 4th Chilean Air Brigade:
"At 9:30 a.m. we received the news, just before ten we started, and good 20 minutes later we were over the hoseboat".
Poland has operated the Henryk Arctowski Polish Antarctic Station on King George Island since 1977, with 19 scientists working there. The frozen researchers were safely brought back to their research station.
Caution: Smartphone NIE Wirelessly Charging
Practical, but harmful
Inductive technology via Qi standard is extremely practical, but should not be used.
Since recently several new smartphones have come to the market, which support wireless charging and sell themselves very well - above all the new iPhone-11 models, we would like to recall once again a study from the beginning of July. The wireless charging of mobile devices is worth it.
Higher temperature adds battery
Researchers even warn about the wireless charging of smartphones. According to the findings of the University of Warwick, this is extremely harmful to the devices. The reason for this is the much greater heat development. If you charge the phone normally on the S by cable, the battery will heat up to 30 degrees within three hours.
Capacity and Lifetime
According to the researchers, the temperature is a crucial factor for the durability of all the batteries of Apple. Every degree plays a role. When charging at higher temperatures, the battery not only sticks to capacity, but it does not last as long as it lasts, so it does not last as long as it lasts. The lifespan of the battery falls shorter than that of the battery.
Practical
The technology is extremely convenient: simply put the device on a suitable charging pad - these are already installed in many restaurants, airports, hotels and cars - and the battery is made without bothering cable salad and tedious technology so that it can only be charged in the form of a plug-in socket.
Everest Stau Photographer: 13 Eight Thousand in Six Months
A Nepali mountaineer has climbed 13 of the world’s 14 highest mountains in just six months, Nirmal Purja (36) has reached the top of Manaslu in Nepal and set a record, his expedition organizer said.
The former soldier wants to climb all 14 8,000 in seven months. Purja calls his project "Mission Possible". He has already made international headlines: From him comes a viral photo of climbers standing on Mount Everest snake.
The image of the mass demand triggered a debate about stronger security measures on the 8,848-metre-high mountain and the highest peak on Earth, with 11 climbers dead in May.
A problem for Purja could become the ascent of the 14th-thousandth: Chinese authorities are currently blocking the Xixabangma mountain in Tibet. As a reason for this, among other things, bad weather is called. Earlier this week, Purja wrote on Twitter that the Nepalese government wants to talk to China to him about the ascent.
Four Dead Elephants Discovered in Sri Lanka
Among the dead animals was also a pregnant elephant cow, a police spokesman said on Friday, "We suspect the elephants were poisoned."
The four bodies were found in a shelter near the famous and visited by many tourists former rock fortress Sigiriya. According to the police spokesman, the animals were probably between 15 and 25 years old. An autopsy was ordered to determine the cause of death.
In Sri Lanka, almost 200 elephants are killed each year. The perpetrators are often farmers on whose land the animals had previously remained harmless. At the same time, about 50 people are killed by elephants each year. This usually happens when the animals move through villages built close to their habitat.
It is estimated that only about 7,000 elephants are still living in Sri Lanka, and the death penalty is theoretically imposed on their killings.
British Oil Tanker Detained Leaves Iran
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" is leaving the port city of Bandar Abbas more than two months after it was captured by Iran. According to the news agency IRNA, the Iranian Revolutionary Guards had the tanker flying under the British flag in the Gulf.
Thomas Cook's Management in Criticism
The responsible economic committee of the House of Commons wants to examine the plight of the management of the travel giant Thomas Cook in detail. It should be about the salary packages of the management board as well as the question of why the British government had to audit a company that was struggling to survive in London.
According to experts, genes overestimated at risk of bowel cancer
The role of genes in the familial increased risk of intestinal cancer has apparently been overestimated so far. To this end, researchers from the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) Heidelberg are in a current study. Other risk factors such as the risk tone of intestinal cancer have been taken into account.
Elon Musk to Increase Tesla Stocks
Musk wrote this in an email published on Thursday (local time) by industry blog "Electrek" to Tesla employees. The demand was strong, so that Tesla could book 110,000 orders, continued in Musk's circular.
The challenge is to bring the cars to customers quickly, and Tesla will have to offer as many resources as possible by the end of the quarter.
Investors liked the information: Tesla’s shares went on to trade with a plus of more than six percent. So strong the price has not increased for almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered more than 95,000 cars and thus reached its previous best value.
Musk needs records in order to reach his high goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars. For this, in the current and next quarter, six-digit numbers have to be generated. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the bolus.
Will the UK government circumvent Brexit law? Johnson restrained
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he is looking for ways to circumvent the last law passed by parliament against an unregulated Brexit, but on a question he told reporters on Friday, his government will stick to the law in force.
The law stipulates that the government must request a postponement of the withdrawal deadline, should no agreement with the EU be reached by mid-October. Johnson criticizes this as a "capitulation law" that complicates negotiations with the EU.
Former British Prime Minister John Major on Thursday had expressed suspicion that Johnson could try to use "political scoundrels" to circumvent the law. Johnson could use a procedural string that postpones the law's entry into force until the time after EU exit.
Johnson said he is seeking a treaty with the European Union: "We are confident that we will leave the EU on 31 October, and the best way is with an agreement."
Iran Is Evidently Driving Uranium Enrichment
Iran's President Hassan Rohani has raised pressure on the European contracting parties in a dispute over the rescue of the historic nuclear deal. "Unfortunately, in 2015 the European states show inability or lack of readiness when it comes to concrete actions," Rohani said in a press conference on Thursday.
The background is the conflict surrounding the international agreement on the prevention of an Iranian nuclear bomb, which contained the promise to Tehran to normalize economic relations. Donald Trump, in 2018, stepped out of the agreement alone, in order to react with Iran to a new agreement with "maximum pressure" to reciprocate with Iran.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed in a report that the Islamic Republic of Iran is now also using or at least preparing for use with uranium installed at the beginning of September, and according to IAEA data, Iran is also preparing the construction of more than 300 more centrifuges.
Perhaps the Europeans were not willing to take their part in the deal and therefore left the Iranians alone with the cost and burden of US sanctions, Rouhani said, but there will still be talks that hopefully will bring about a solution.
Rohani continues to dispute Iran's involvement in attacks in Saudi Arabia
However, after an attack on an important oil plant in Saudi Arabia in mid-September, the community situation changed: Germany, France and the United Kingdom followed on Monday the US estimate that Tehran was responsible for the attack, which was not known to have been the responsibility of the attack.
"Those who make such accusations must present proof of that," said Rohani. That would have failed the European leaders in the talks with him during the UN General Debate. Instead, they could have invoked John to the President of the United Nations, and instead, they could have invoked him with Mr. President, Mr. President, Mr. President of the United Nations.
Before possible talks with U.S. President Trump, the far-reaching sanctions of the U.S. administration should first be lifted, Rouhani demanded, urging the government in Washington to shift to a policy of "dialogue and reason".
Comet crosses the solar system from another star
Astronomers are currently observing a comet from the depths of the cosmos. This first succeeded. The comet allows conclusions about other solar systems.
What was initially just a conjecture is now confirmed: an interstellar guest crosses our solar system. The comet from the depths of space was named after its discoverer 2I/Borisov and has aroused the interest of astronomers around the world.
The far-reaching comet was discovered on August 30 by amateur astronomer Gennadi Borissov at the Margo Observatory in Crimea - with a self-built telescope of 65 centimeters in diameter. Observations by various observatories not only confirmed that it is an unknown comet, but also shows that it is not our system.
2I/Borisov is only the second interstellar object seen during a transit of our solar system after 1I/'Oumuamua in 2017.
2I/Borisov offers astronomers the rare chance to get close-up insights into an alien solar system before it disappears on a never-before-seen basis. First observations show that the interstellar comet is similar to those of our own system's type, which is similar to that of David's type, which is reported by the astrophysical institute of the Canary Islands's Astronomical Institute in .
According to our analysis, the comet has been en routed on a so-called hyperbel orbit that leads it out of our system - and clearly of interstellar origin, as reported by the International Astronomical Union (IAU). It has also been responsible for the designation and categorization of the bodies of the heavens.
The astronomers are lucky: Unlike 1I/'Oumuamua, 2I/Borisov has already been seen in flight. So the researchers will stay for many months for research. "The object will reach the greatest brightness in mid-December and then still be able to see with October telescopes.
Several observatories have already targeted the visitor, according to a team from the University of Hawaii named Karen Meech, who had already led the characterization of 1I/'Oumuamua, in a first survey of the diameter of the celestial object at 2 to 16 kilometers.
Researchers at the Astrophysical Institute of the Canary Islands (IAC) have already obtained a first so-called spectrum from the interstellar star, which offers a kind of fingerprint of its chemical composition. "This spectrum could be similar to that of this object, in other ways, in their compilation of Juli<0xC3><0xB3>n, similar to that of comets of our solar system, and similar to that of Leist.
The discovery of the same two interstellar visitors within just two years suggests, according to the IAU, that these objects could open up a new path for the exploration of certain processes in other solar systems. How often such visits could be intermittent, however, it is difficult to estimate how many of these visits could be intermittent.
By 2028, the agency intends to station the three-part comet interceptor at a waiting position at a distance of 1.5 million kilometers from the Earth. According to Esa-scientific director, it will be on a visit to either our own Günther Hasinger or our own inter-system.
First landing at Beijing's new Mega Airport Daxing
Just before the 70th anniversary of the People’s Republic of China, a first passenger plane of China United Airlines landed at the new mega airport in the south of the Chinese capital, a special honor for captain and crew.
By 2022, around 45 million passengers will be delivered annually at the new airport, and by 2025, there will already be 72 million. Chinese President Xi Jinping has personally announced the opening of the 450 billion-dollar project. China’s latest prestige project is also called “Six-armed structure.”
The complex has four runways, which are to be expanded to seven later, and is equipped with the world’s largest automatic air traffic management system. A new U-Bahn transports passengers to downtown Beijing in just 20 minutes.
Already during construction, the Chinese had repeatedly told that Berlin could learn from Beijing. The opening of the capital airport in Germany, which has been under construction since 2006 - and is much smaller - has been postponed so far. In Beijing, on the other hand, a first passenger machine landed already after four years.
New supersonic aircraft to fly in 2030: in four and a half hours from London to Sydney
From London to Sydney in just four and a half hours, Graham will definitely be dreaming about it, the British space agency UK Space Agency. It is intended to make this flight, for the 2030s, in a supersonic tempo, a special drive could be developed for the "Synergetic Air-Breathing Rocket Engine, Sabre".
In order to advance the project, the British space agency wanted to cooperate with the Australian until 2000. In the United States, a flight from the British capital to the Australian metropolis took about 20 hours. In the United States, the United States, the United States, the United States, the United States, the United States, the United States, the United States, the United States, the United States, the United States, and the United States.
"Sabre will make the world smaller with its high-speed point-to-point transport", writes Reaction Engines, among other things, on its homepage. The Sabre drive could be used for efficient journeys in a manner that can be used with a speed of speed of Mach 5.
Rebellion in Washington: Trump wants to track down anonymous tippers in Ukraine affair
In Ukraine’s case of possible abuse of power by US President Donald Trump, Trump wants to track down potential leaked positions in the White House.
“I want to know who gave the whistleblower the information,” Trump said Thursday in front of U.S. embassy staff in New York, saying the person concerned was almost “a spy” and had been treated “a little differently” in the past than today.
This was rated as an intimidation attempt against tippers. The event was not actually public. However, several US media disseminated audio clips of the speech on Friday. Democrats reacted outrageously to the president’s statement.
The Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives had announced on Tuesday preparations for a resignation process against Trump. Their allegations are based primarily on the written complaint of an anonymous intelligence officer who has been made public with heavy charges against Trump and his government headquarters.
As part of his work, the Whistleblower wants to have received information from several government employees, according to which the U.S. president “uses the power of his office” to achieve that another country interferes in his favor in the 2020 U.S. election.
At the center of the accusations is a controversial phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj at the end of July, in which Trump encouraged his colleagues to investigate what could harm his political rival Joe Biden in 2020. In doing so, they are talking about the former business of Biden’s son, the Ukrainian hunter.
The whistle-blower accused the White House of obscurity with regard to the Ukraine telephone: leading government employees had tried to keep the exact wording of the conversation under wraps. However, according to a statement, a statement was made out of a piece of data from a piece of paper, and according to a piece of paper, an electronic word-of-mouth protocol was made.
The identity of the whistleblower is not known to the public, the New York Times reported that it was an employee of the CIA's foreign intelligence service.
Trump again questioned the credibility of the source on Friday. In a series of tweets on the subject, the president wrote, among other things, that the “so-called whistleblower” had disseminated second-hand information that had turned out to be inappropriate. Therefore, there may be no tips.
Speaking in New York about those who were supposed to give the whistleblower information, Trump reacted with concern and lamented that Trump’s statement once again undermined the integrity of the U.S. government.
In the House of Representatives, various investigations against Trump and its surroundings have been ongoing for months in various committees, and in light of the Ukraine allegations, the Democrats are now pushing forward investigations with new strength to initiate a possible resignation process against Trump.
“The whistleblower has given us a timetable for our investigation,” said the head of the Secret Service Committee in the House of Representatives, Adam Schiff. Trump sharply attacked the ship, accused him of misrepresenting things, and again demanded that the committee’s chairman step down and resign.
More than 300 former U.S. government officials from the security and foreign policy fields, who were working mostly under democratic but also under Republican presidents, were behind the Trump-initiated "impeachment" investigation into the possible resignation of the post.
There is no exact timetable for the next procedure. With their majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could exert a so-called impeachment procedure. However, the decision on an actual resignation fell in the Senate, where Trump’s Republicans had a majority. The prospects for such success were met.
VW operating council: jobs are being "sleeping"
VW’s plans to further reduce costs in production could be at the expense of manufacturing in Germany and Europe. This concern drives the carmaker’s operating council. The brand wants to reduce its annual factory costs by two billion euros by 2023. Of these, 500 million euros are expected to enter the year.
A key factor for this is the personnel costs. The "future pact" negotiated in 2016 between the company and the company council already provides for the reduction of 14,000 jobs in Germany alone by 2020. Basically, a job can only be demolished by the carmaker if it is proved to be valid if more than one job is required29.
However, as our newspaper has now learned from operating council circles, jobs in production, which are not actually available, are "sleeping" down another path - that is, past the official course, so that freeing regular jobs would often not be reoccupied.
In these cases, the Board of Directors has no way of forcing the re-employment. In the meantime, there is a lack of staff in many places, the work pressure increases, the concerns about a gradual outflow of the vehicles could become greater. In this way, the fear of the V-production of the vehicles could grow in the world.
The VW brand wants to further standardize production worldwide and control new projects centrally. This will also reduce costs and also speed up decisions - the goal is to increase productivity and thus our competitiveness. We will be able to spend a good amount of time between Brexichen and GüntherGünter said at a Berlin-Manager.
In this way, there are already successes: for example, this year, for the first time since 2013, the production costs per vehicle would drop compared to the previous year. Before journalists Tostmann said that the production time for the Golf 8, which is to be presented on October 24 in Wolfsburg, is not going to be shortened by 1.1 hours according to our time.
20 hours.
In our region, the Wolfsburg main plant is the only VW factory in which vehicles are produced. The plants of Braunschweig and Salzgitter produce components. For Wolfsburg, the Faustregel applies internally to WW, but these have to be built at 800,000 cars per year, and in order for the factory to be satisfied by Wodingsburg, the rest of which is 800,000 cars per year.
As Tostmann’s production board announced last year, however, a million cars are to be rolled out by the band in Wolfsburg “perspectively”, which is to make it possible to bundle the golf production in the main plant – because the Zwickau plant is transformed into the site for the e-auto production.
In addition, the Tiguan and Tarraco (Seat) SUVs are being produced in Wolfsburg. However, the sales figures of Golf and Tiguan have recently declined. Therefore, expectations now rest on Golf 8. It is supposed to remain, despite all efforts to build e-mobility.
Voodoo Forced to Prostitute: Human Traffickers Condemned
Young women from Nigeria have been raped, smuggled into the Ruhr area and forced into prostitution, and six suspected human traffickers have to go to jail.
In Bochum on Friday, six suspected traffickers from Nigeria were sentenced to imprisonment and imprisonment for up to eight years and three months. The defendants had sent young women from Nigeria into the Ruhr area and had to be forced into prostitution. To force them into prostitution, they were forced to submit to a smuggler.
The victims were between 17 and 22 years old. They were brought across the Mediterranean with the help of Libyan smugglers in hose boats. However, the dream of a better future did not come true. In Germany, they were distributed to various brothels to completely reduce the alleged smuggling costs of an average of 25,000 euros.
The defendants - four men and two women - had admitted the smuggling and the subsequent distribution of the young Nigerian women on brothels in the process. "The work made the women physically and mentally difficult to create," Judge Isabel Hoffmann said at the verdict. "Some were right.
The verdicts are on commercial and gang-like smuggling of foreigners, human trafficking, bribery and heavy forced prostitution.
UFO Calls for Negotiations with Lufthansa
FIm's ongoing dispute with the Lufthansa Group has threatened Ufo again with strikes.
If the company does not return to the negotiating table, the union will “notify on 14 October about the labor-fighting measures in the LH Group”, Ufo tariff chief Daniel Flohr said on Friday. Lufthansa and its subsidiary Eurowings have been refusing to negotiate with Lufthansa for months, with whom Ufo tariffs have been negotiated.
At this point, Ufo now sees itself strengthened after a decision of the Frankfurt Labour Court. Lufthansa wanted to make it clear that the tariff contracts were not terminated. The court rejected the applications. The company confirmed the decision and examines the remedies to be brought against. Fuhrmann and Földer said that a second court acquits the case.
In August, Lufthansa had also filed an application with the Frankfurt State Labour Court to have UFO’s status as a trade union reviewed by the court, arguing that the union had not appointed a representative board for months and was thus unable to fulfil its role as a tariff partner.
Previously, there was a fierce leadership dispute in the Sparte union, in the course of which numerous members of the board of directors and the advisory board have resigned, including long-time union leader Nicoley Baublies. The Ufo had expressed doubts about its leadership in July.
Facilitated Entry: Saudi Arabia Announces New Visa System
Until now, Saudi Arabia was not exactly known as an international tourist magnet. But that should change now. The country on the Persian Gulf wants to introduce new visa regulations.
With a new visa system, Saudi Arabia wants to attract more international tourists in the future. By 2030, it wants to increase the fees of international and domestic visitors to 100 million per year, the Tourism Commission said.
“Saudi Arabia’s opening up to international tourists is a historic moment for our country,” said Ahmad Al-Chatib, Chairman of the Tourism Commission.
Saudi Arabia is hardly accessible to tourists so far. Visas are usually granted only for short business trips, religious pilgrimage or visitors with relatives in the desert state. With the new rules, the erzconservative Kingdom hopes to reduce its willpower from its own business.
By mid-September, several rockets and drones had hit two of the most important oil plants in the east of Saudi Arabia: the country’s largest oil refinery in Abkaik and the Churai oil field. As a result, national oil production drastically collapsed, the amount of oil prices increased.
Justin and Hailey Bieber in preparation for wedding
Singer Justin Bieber (25) and his wife Hailey (22) are preparing for their wedding party. The model posted several party photos on her Instagram stories on Thursday (local time), on which she can be seen in the white wedding look. Reality star Kendall Jenner (23) and others had organized a lot of them in the Jungle-Maga.
Justin posted several colorful, banana-printed suits on Instagram and asked his followers, “Help me choose my smoking for the wedding,” according to media reports, the celebrity couple is planning to get married church next weekend.
The Biebers gave themselves the "yes" word a year ago at a headquarters in New York, and there had not been a bigger party at the time.
In an interview with Australian Vogue, Hailey recently stated that the two had found a common ground after initial problems: "If you don't want to compromise, you can't have a relationship."
Two dead in plane crash in Czech Republic
Two people were killed in the crash of a small plane in the west of the Czech Republic. The wreck was discovered on Friday in a forest area near the city of Mecin (Metschin), police said. The dead were a 38-year-old woman and a 64-year-old man.
Authorities had been searching for the machine since Thursday evening, after the crew had sent an emergency signal by GPS. During the search, a military helicopter was also in use. The cause of the accident has yet to be determined. The crash site is located about 30 kilometers north of Relolichgen and 100 kilometers south of Pilsen (Pilsen).
Half of European tree species are threatened with extinction
In addition to pests, 58 diseases, foreign species, non-sustainable woodpeckers and the growth of cities were also the cause of the threat, the IUCN World Conservation Union reported in Brussels on Friday. It did not examine the stocks of all the 454 species of trees known in Europe.
The IUCN classifies endangered species into six categories: from "potentially endangered" to "dangered", "highly endangered", "threatened from extinction" and "dead in nature" to "dead in the wild".
Eberian and wild horse chestnut threatened
In Germany, Eberesen (Sorbus) is threatened, said one of the authors, David Allen, the German Press Agency. "Most are threatened because the populations are small anyway or due to the transformation or weakening of their habitats".
It also looks bad for the wild common horse chestnuts. They have been considered as "dangered" since 2017, stage two of the IUCN scale. The biggest threat is not only a mushroom, but also the Balkan miner's moth. It has been spreading to the Balkans since the 1980s. It has not spread to the rest of Europe since the 1980s.
Strawberries and moss are also at risk
At the same time, the IUCN scientists created new European red lists for soft animals, shrubs and moss. More than one-fifth of the soft animals and moss and almost half of all the shrub species were threatened important, according to the IUCN.
"This report shows that the situation for many overlooked and underestimated species is precarious, species that form the backbone of the European ecosystem and contribute to a healthy planet," said Luc Bas, director of the IUCN Europe Office. "We need to address the impact of this branch of humankind on our arctic ecosystem.
Earthquakes in Istanbul: 34 injured reported
The latest quake in Turkey injured 34 people, dozens of people had to leave their homes, 14 schools in Istanbul were closed for security reasons, Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay said on Friday.
Hundreds of buildings were damaged, with nearly 200 aftershocks since the earthquake the previous day. The magnitude 5.8 earthquake on Thursday shook the Marmara region in front of Istanbul and sparked panic in the million-dollar metropolis.
Now the government wants to use a commission to better prepare the country for earthquakes in the future, Oktay announced. In the past 20 years, Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for earthquakes, said Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu.
Under the Marmara Sea lies a section of the so-called North Anatolian Disturbance, which marks the border between the Eurasian and Anatolian plates.
One of the most severe earthquakes was one of the magnitude 7.6 in 1999 near Istanbul. The epicenter was then in Gölcük southeast of Istanbul. More than 17,000 people died.
Already on Tuesday, an earthquake of magnitude 4.6 shook the region around Istanbul, with authorities calling on residents to stay away from damaged buildings.
Super Bowl 2020: Jennifer Lopez (JLo) and Shakira appear in the half-time show
Latin pop singers Jennifer Lopez and Shakira will host the half-time show of the next American football finale Super Bowl. The singers announced on Twitter. "It's not going to be bigger," wrote Shakira about a photo of herself and Lopez. She will be so excited to be in the 2nd of February.
Jennifer Lopez explained that she had dreamed of performing at the Super Bowl since 1996 - that's when she saw Diana Ross fly into the sky at the half-time show. "Now it's even more special because the NFL can live 100 years and I'll be performing on a different Latina world".
Shakira pointed out in a statement that she feels honoured to stand alongside another artist on one of the world's biggest stages and to represent Latinos and Latinos from the United States and around the world. "And then even on my birthday," the main sponsor of the event wrote on Twitter.
Jennifer Lopez was born in New York City, her parents come from Puerto Rico.
Combating declining spectator numbers
The Super Bowl is the highlight of the American football season. The game and the half-time show are among the most watched TV shows in the United States. Even if you last saw a drop in viewership: This February, the show attracted almost always the least viewers in the United States for more than ten years.
The half-time show of the past Super Bowl had been turbulent in advance: in the dispute over the handling of quarterback Colin Kaepernick last February, according to media reports, top stars such as Rihanna, Pink and Cardi B did not appear. Finally, the pop group Maroon 5 led to the half-time crisps.
Kaepernick, then quarterback of the San Francisco 49ers, had not been able to get on his knees during the 2016/17 season before NFL games at the National Anthem in protest against police violence and racism. With his protest, Kaepernick did not trigger a movement to the United States.
Cook-Pleite: Hotels get money from insurance
According to a press report, some banks are likely to be too expensive for travel provider Thomas Cook, which threatens high write-offs on outstanding bonds and loans, including Credit Suisse, according to the Financial Times.
Banks such as Barclays, Morgan Stanley, UniCredit or Credit Suisse would probably have to make depreciations of up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.8 billion (around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2 billion) on their books, according to the report.
The creditors of bonds would have to buy depreciations of <0xC2><0xA3>900m to <0xC2><0xA3>1bn and the lenders between <0xC2><0xA3>550m and <0xC2><0xA3>825m. The amounts actually to be depreciated are more likely to be at the top of the bandwidth, an expert told the paper.
The extent of the creditors' losses in the end will be apparent after the insolvency proceedings have ended. A person close to this proceedings Thomas did not give too much hope. For example, the around 40 aircraft of Thomas Cook were heated to the airport, as well as the rest of them were heated to the United Kingdom.
Rackete reportedly brought suspected killers to Italy
Sea-Watch Captain Carola Rackete may have brought men to Italy who are said to have tortured and killed people in Libya. "We cannot rule that out, but we do not have secure information on it," said the spokesman for the refugee organization Sea-Watch, Ruben Neugebauer, the news agency dpaena.
Other migrants had recognized the three men in Italy. They are accused of raping, torturing and killing people in Libya. The alleged perpetrators were arrested in the detention camp in Messina, Italy. Newbuilders emphasized that without them, the refugee organisations could not check on them.
On 29 June, Carola Rackete had brought illegal migrants to the port of Lampedusa, where a ship of the Italian financial police was raided. On that day, the three suspects were also reported to have arrived. The captains are being investigated for aid to illegal immigration.
U.S. warns federal government of Huawei
Ajit Pai, head of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC), has warned the federal government not to trust Chinese network equipment company Huawei.
We believe the risks are too great," Pai told the "trade sheet" looking at building the new 5G mobile network.
China has a “national security law” that obliges every company “under Chinese jurisprudence” to follow instructions from security agencies.
The current law also prohibits companies from informing third parties about such requests," the FCC chief continued, making it very difficult to have confidence in the integrity of technical equipment and services.
In the meantime, the Federal Government has agreed to request a "declaration of trust" from suppliers.
First of all, Berlin wants to try to control the risks, for example with technical solutions, reports the "Handelsblatt" relying on its own information.
Pai doubts that this is possible. 5G technology does not just consist of hardware:
It is the software that is important to keep the devices up-to-date. This software consists of billions of lines of program code that change over time," Pai said.
It falls “very hard to imagine” that a government authority, “no matter where, would be able to review each individual update in real time to detect security risks,” the FCC chief said.
China’s Huawei Group has been accused of having close contacts with the Chinese state apparatus:
The ownership relationships are opaque. The employee company, which allegedly belongs to the company, is not necessarily independent of the government," Pai told the "Handelsblatt".
The U.S. presents findings that government employees are positioned within the company. Pai was recently for talks in Berlin to promote the U.S. position.
Chemistry Factory in Northern France Burns: Schools Closed
At night, residents hear explosions. A giant firewall illuminates the sky over a northern French chemical factory. The fire has been extinguished after hours - but cleaning up could now take days.
After a fire at a chemical factory in the northern French city of Rouen on Thursday, schools and children's shelters in the region remain closed.
In twelve municipalities, the facilities would not open cautiously on Friday, the competent prefecture said. The Ministry of the Interior had asked the citizens to stay as far as possible in buildings and not to expose themselves to the smoke. He did not present himself to the fugitives and there was no harm to the fugitives. Farmers and growers became tigers.
The fire could be completely extinguished on Thursday evening, as the prefecture announced. There is still the risk that after the deletion the odor will spread, according to the prefecture on Twitter. According to the prefecture, 240 firefighters as well as 90 police and gendarmes were employed at the site of the fire.
A giant black smoke column had previously risen from the chemical factory. French media reported huge flames and explosions in the factory of the company Lubrizol, which produces the additive for oil. The production plant is a few kilometers from the city center.
The factory in Normandy belongs to the so-called Seveso category of hazardous sites, which are particularly monitored. In 1976, a devastating chemical accident occurred in the Italian Seveso near Milan.
The prefect of the region of Normandy, Pierre-André Durand, told the broadcaster BFMTV that there was no "high toxicity" in samples at first. A pollution of the nearby Seine can not be excluded. In the river he was put on the dams against the mud.
Rouen, a regional metropolis located on the Seine between Paris and the port city of Le Havre, was initially unclear, authorities said, according to reports.
French Finance Minister: "Germany must invest now"
French Economy and Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire has called on Germany to make more investments to boost economic growth in the eurozone.
Germany has to invest, and now, the sooner the better,” Le Maire said on Thursday evening at the presentation of the French budget for the coming year.
The economy in the eurozone is weakening, the minister warned.
We must not wait until the economic situation worsens to make the necessary decisions."
Action would have to be taken by those states that have budgetary room for more investment, Le Maire said, among other things, with a view to Germany.
France does not have these areas of play, the minister added, and referred to the high state debt of his country, which is more than 98 percent of the gross domestic product. The French state debt must be "stabilized" and "suspended", Le Maire said.
In recent years, France has repeatedly appealed to Germany to make more public investments in order to revive the European economy, while German politicians have repeatedly called on France to get its budget deficit under control.
The French budget for 2020, presented on Thursday, envisages tax reliefs of more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>9 billion for households.
The French government is responding, among other things, to the protests of the Yellow-West movement, which is set to drop to 2.2%, according to expected 3.1% this year.
Is he still trying to trick?: Johnson dismisses question about Brexit tactics
British Prime Minister Johnson strongly criticises Parliament’s “Capitulation Act.”
Parliament is back on a law requiring the British prime minister to avoid a chaos Brexit. However, critics fear Boris Johnson could use another loophole. However, the Tory politician pointed to this possibility.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson remains covered about whether he wants to enforce an unregulated Brexit - despite the law last passed by parliament, which is supposed to prevent exactly that, Johnson told reporters on a similar issue only that his government will stick to the law in force.
The law stipulates that the government must request a postponement of the withdrawal deadline, should no agreement with the EU be reached by mid-October, Johnson criticizes this as a "capitulation law" that complicates negotiations with the EU.
Former British Prime Minister John Major on Thursday had expressed the suspicion that Johnson could try to use "political scoundrels" to circumvent the law. The prime minister could use a procedural string that bestows on an EU law coming into force on October 31.
Johnson’s chief advisor Dominic Cummings, meanwhile, said he perceived the political debates over Brexit as a “walk in the park” and was confident that the desired EU exit would still come about: “We will not enjoy what we will win, we will not be able to get out of the EU.”
Cummings, who led the Brexit campaign “Vote Leave” during the 2016 EU referendum campaign, is now acting as the chief strategist in the UK government’s Downing Street seat, behind the uncompromising policy that has put the prime minister in a rather impasse.
"The Polaroid Diaries" by Linda McCartney
Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan or Janis Joplin - they all stood in front of the camera of Linda McCartney, who has become one of the very great rock photographers. But it does not always have to be the great glamour. The photo book "The Polaroid Diaries" (bags) dives deep into the very private world of the McCartney family.
Paul McCartney, who was married to Linda from 1969 until Linda's death in 1998, was visibly proud and moved when he presented the tape "The Polaroid Diaries" in mid-September at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.
After the launch event, McCartney wrote on Instagram: “<0x23>ThePolaroidDiaries is a fleeting look at the life of an extraordinary family from the time before Instagram, a celebration of LindaMcCartney’s legacy as a committed artist and the instant magic of the Polaroid film.”
Linda McCartney, who had studied art history at the University of Aizona until she found photography, was always there with the camera. She has done thousands of Polaroids, a few hundred of which are now published for the first time in "The Polaroid Diaries".
They are portraits, still lifes, landscapes, several hamsters, a sheep in the kitchen and other interiors from the early 70s to the late 90s. "She wanted real moments", writes the art critic Ekow Eshun in his foreword. And of course one has never seen him again.
Then he dances with his daughter Mary on his shoulders, calls in the bathrobe with a bag on his head or wears unformed moonboots. Sure, the McCartneys were an extraordinary family, but the one that was beyond the spotlight at Bab-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la in her-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-
Like hardly any other medium, the Polaroid camera captures the immediate moment. Linda McCartney’s footage is certainly a kind of family diary, but they’re much more than just snapshots.
It's about the decisive click: you have to recognize if a great photo happens in front of you. And then you have to cut it at the exact right moment," said Paul McCartney. "If you cut Paul two seconds later or two seconds earlier, it could be a different photo.
The light, the composition, the picture cut and the colors, which makes "The Polaroid Diaries" not only an entertaining picture book for Beatles fans, but also an anecdotal, is also a great aesthetic pleasure to the road, where landscapes are a bit more like abstract paintings.
“We will continue to buy oil and gas from Iran.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in an interview on Friday that Turkey would not be able to stop imports of oil and gas from Iran, despite US sanctions on Iran.
We will continue to buy our natural gas from there,” Erdogan said in New York, where he had attended the UN General Assembly.
Erdogan, however, admitted that Turkey had problems with importing Iranian oil, as some companies had "retired due to US threats".
Nevertheless, Turkey will continue our relations with Iran “especially on this and many other issues,” said the Turkish president, who had repeatedly criticized the US sanctions against Iran in the past.
The United States has been pursuing a policy of "maximum pressure" on the Islamic Republic since its withdrawal from the international nuclear agreement with Iran. According to the United States, Iran secretly pursues a nuclear program and does not adhere to the agreement.
Their sanctions have led to a breakthrough in Iranian oil exports and a severe economic crisis in Iran, and tensions in the Gulf region have escalated considerably in recent months.
U.S. government wants to restrict admission of refugees
The U.S. government wants to drastically restrict the admission of refugees. The U.S. State Department said on Thursday that the annual ceiling of a resettlement program should be lowered from currently 30,000 to 18,000 refugees. This corresponds to a cut of 40 percent.
The State Department said the United States would continue to be committed to supporting refugees, but the most important task is to protect and serve U.S. citizens. Currently, the U.S. immigration system is overloaded.
The U.S. government wants to focus in the future on the admission of two refugee groups: people who are persecuted for their faith - and Iraqis who have helped the U.S. military in the country and are thus endangered, as will emerge from the statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
In the 1980 Obama program, refugees from UN camps around the world are selected and resettled in the United States. The upper limit of 18,000 refugees for the 2020 budget year would be the lowest in the history of the program. Already the current upper limit of 30,000 was at the bottom of the budget.
"This is a very sad day for America," said the head of the International Rescue Committee, David Miliband, who would continue to damage the United States' leadership in protecting the world's most vulnerable people.
Trump is trying to restrict immigration to the U.S. - legal as well as illegal - strictly. The U.S. government expects 350,000 asylum applications for the coming budget year. These numbers are separate from the resettlement program.
Donald Trump: “Close to a peak”
U.S. President Donald Trump has witnessed whistleblowers in the whistleblower affair of espionage. Whoever has exchanged relevant information to the whistleblower who accuses him of abuse of power "comes close to a spike," Trump said, according to a record of a private event in New York.
Trump spoke to staff members of the U.N. mission. When asked about the person who informed the whistleblower about controversial White House operations, he replied: "This is approaching a spike." Then Trump added: "Do you know what we were talking about? Do you know what we were doing until we were in the old days?
Observers valued the latter remark on a possible allegation of the death penalty. The Democrats harshly criticized Trump’s statements and accused him of intimidation by witnesses. It was also an attempt by the House of Representatives to incite a congressional inquiry into a possible charge of impeachment against him.
The whistleblower accuses the president of misusing his office to ask for another country’s interference in the 2020 U.S. election. Specifically, it is possible for Trump to make a phone call against his controversial democracies with his Ukrainian counterpart, Mr. Hernandez.
It is still unclear who the whistleblowers themselves and their informants are, but according to the New York Times, the whistleblower is said to be an analyst at the CIA's foreign intelligence agency.
Refugee boat: baby and toddlers drown in Aegean
Over and over again, people try to cross the Aegean Sea from Turkey to Greece, where they regularly encounter many small boats. Seven migrants have now died in the collapse of a hoseboat - including five children.
In front of the Greek island of Chios, seven migrants were killed in the collapse of a hoseboat, including a baby and four other children, the Greek coast guard reported. Four children, three women and five men were able to escape the floods from the crew of a passing ferry.
Among the victims was also a smuggler, reported the local news portal of Chios, Alithia.gr. The migrants had broken up from Turkey in the morning. They had tried to reach the small island group of Inousses in the northeast of the island of Chios. Inousses is located between Chios and the Turkish mainland.
It is not yet known from which countries the migrants come. Currently, hundreds of migrants from Turkey are transferring to the Greek islands in the east of the Aegean, mostly in much too small boats. Last year, this route came according to the UN refugee relief agency (UNHCR).
The Who cancels concert
A US concert by the rock band The Who has found a rough end due to an inadequacy of lead singer Roger Daltrey. In the middle of the performance on Wednesday night (local time) in Houston, his voice declined the service. In the eighth song, Daltrey told the audience: "I think I should let it go."
Lead guitarist Pete Townsend apologised and added that Daltrey could "really not speak right now", promising the audience to come to his expense at a remake concert, but a date is not yet fixed.
The Who, scheduled for Friday in Dallas and Sunday in Denver, said they would be picked up at a later date. The 75-year-old Daltrey and his 74-year-old bandmate Townsend are the only remaining founding members. The British cult band formed 55 years ago.
Renting Suddenly Stopped: WeWork Makes Real Estate Markets Shake
In New York, WeWork has become the largest office owner.
Within a few years, WeWork will rise from a small startup to a driving force in the world’s most expensive real estate markets. But now the company is in a crisis.
The crisis of office landlord WeWork threatens to disrupt the balance on the largest real estate markets in the world. The company had just recently discontinued founder Adam Neumann as head, postponed the planned stock market turnover, and with the sale of subsidiaries and values such as the private jet, we have moved to the financial markets.
WeWork always rents large office space in the long term to Ffor, and leases it in small units to members in the short term. This can be individual freelancers, small start-ups or entire departments of large corporations. So far, WeWork has been burning the money of one of these companies at a time, in order to do so, in order to do so, in order to do so.
According to the Financial Times, WeWork has now entered into leases for up to 15 years, resulting in liabilities of more than $40 billion. These huge liabilities could become a problem not only for the company itself and its investors, but for entire real estate.
According to the New York Cornell Law School in New York, WeWork rented in Manhattan, one of the most expensive real estate markets in the world, in the last 24 months, it has grown to almost 300,000 square meters of office space in the last 24 months, it has grown to be in this office area.
Even in the UK capital, the balance in the real estate market could shift noticeably without a further expansion of the aggressive start-up. Among other things, WeWork is the main tenant, in a decade bought last year by savings fund provider Deka for almost 100 million euros around the office.
Many landlords have rebuilt their properties for the requirements of WeWork only with high investments. If WeWork fails to make its business model profitable soon, the property owners would have to write down a part of the hoped-for billions of revenues in the hopefuls of the future. For example, we will not have access to the profits of the future.
Russia Recaptured Several North Korean Fishermen
The Russian coast guard has again attacked North Korean fishermen, with a total of 262 more savages arrested in recent days who had illegally fished in the waters, the Russian domestic intelligence service FSB told the agency Interfax on Friday.
Only ten days ago, 161 fishermen from North Korea were arrested. Previously, the border guards were shot and three of them were injured. This time there were no injuries, it said. The communist North Korea suffers from chronic food shortages.
In 2018, the North Korean fishermen were reportedly travelling in Russian waters. In addition, according to their own information, the coast guard of Russia is driving patrols to protect their marine biological resources. In the case of the renewed checks, 30,000 ink fish were discovered at Wladimir Wladimir, and in the case of Pozna<0xC5><0x84> W<0xC5><0x82>adok<0xC5><0x82>y<0xC5><0x82>y<0xC5><0x82>.
According to media reports, in 2019, thousands of fishermen from North Korea have been temporarily arrested there, according to the Russian Fisheries Authority, after complaints from local entrepreneurs.
The head of the association of Russian fishing companies in the far eastern region of Primorje, Georgi Martynov, recently also complained of high ecological damage by the North Korean fishermen. They simply fished with shrubs banned in Russia. They did not care for the technically narrow synthetic nets. In the sea. With these, they would also be made small living creatures.
In the arrests of the previous week, according to Moscow, three members of the Russian coast guard were injured. One also injured North Korean died later on his injuries, according to the FSB. On that 17 September, the Russian border guard set up two of them, and a North Korean first.
U.S. imposes ban on former President Castro
The U.S. has imposed a ban on former Cuban President Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l Castro and his children, the U.S. State Department said in a statement Thursday with Castro’s involvement in “gross human rights violations”. As the head of the Communist Party of the Caribbean, there would be more political implications than the Cuban regime.
As the head of the armed forces, the brother of the late leader of the revolution Fidel Castro is also responsible for human rights violations there by the support of the President of Venezuela, Nicol<0xC3><0xA1>s Maduro. "The violations of human rights by the Kurds and the use of violence by the Kurdish regime.
President Donald Trump on Wednesday issued a ban on entry, among others, against members of the Venezuelan government and the military. In Venezuela for months, a bitter power struggle has raged between the government and the opposition. The United States has imposed a whole series of sanctions on Gud<0xC3><0xB3>n and the opposition against him.
Cuba is considered one of the closest allies of Maduro. The socialist Caribbean island receives oil from Venezuela in exchange for the services of doctors sent. According to the United States and the Venezuelan opposition, Cuba has also sent numerous secret service agents to Venezuela to return to the government.
New climate protests from Fridays for Future
A week after the biggest international climate protests so far, thousands of people are once again on the streets for more climate protection.
To conclude an international climate strike quest, the Fridays for Future movement is again planning actions and announcements in dozens of countries around the world. The start is expected to be due to the time shift in New Zealand and Australia, before the protests over Europe to North America can take place in the House of Commons.
How big the global vote will be on this Friday after last week's record-breaking participation is relatively unclear. Thunberg himself was good things. "Last Friday, more than four million people were on strike for the climate. This Friday we will do it again!", she wrote on Twitter.
Particularly in West Germany, the number of protests was very high last Friday. A good third of all the protesters worldwide - around 1.4 million - had participated in the protests in 575 German cities, according to estimates of Fridays for Future. This time, however, the protests were carried out by the people of Sinterklaas in Sinterklaas as well as by the people of Sinterklaas in Sinterklaas.
At the age of 15 at the time, Thunberg had stood in front of the Swedish parliament in August 2018 to call on the politicians of their country to make a stronger commitment to climate protection. In a short period of time, the Fridays-for-Future movement has emerged. But there are also other students who participate in the climate protests, especially those who participate in schüler.
Together, they demand more ambition from the policy in the fight against global warming and the impending climate catastrophe, and above all, under the Paris climate agreement, global warming must be curbed to below 1.5 degrees compared to pre-industrial times.
Thunberg had arrived in New York just a month ago after a two-week transatlantic tour with a high seas race hunt, where she had last participated in climate protests and summits of the United Nations. On Monday, she took part in an emotional speech at the United Nations with her partner Heidis.
Russia bans smoking on the balcony
People in Russia will no longer be allowed to smoke on the balcony in the future. This provides for a change in fire protection. "This also applies to smoking," a spokesman for the emergency ministry said in Moscow on Thursday, according to the agency Tass. The ban is expected to enter into force on October 1.
Anyone who smokes anyway must accordingly expect a fine of 3,000 rubles (42,46 euros). If the cigarette should extinguish a fire, then the penalty falls higher. Under the ban are also burning candles according to the Ministry. Also meat pies on the balcony to be grilled.
Attack on Cybercriminals - Investigators Remove Servers
In the fight against crimes on the Internet, German investigators have for the first time removed a large server provider for illegal transactions on the darknet.
A total of 13 perpetrators are suspected of having hosted numerous websites in a former NATO data center bunker in Traben-Trarbach on the Moselle River, over which internationally active criminals operated their exploits.
This was announced by the Prosecutor General’s Office in Koblenz. Seven suspects were arrested on Thursday night during a major action. The Darknet is a shielded part of the Internet.
Clients of the suspects are said to have been the operators of the world's second largest darknet drug market, "Wall Street Market", which investigators had smashed in the spring. The attack on 1.25 million telecom routers was also reportedly overrun in late November 2016, according to the Attorney General's Office.
It was the first time that such a hoster had been removed in Germany. A web host provides the infrastructure for an Internet presence.
The access operation with the support of special units such as the GSG9 has been conducted in Germany and abroad. It has been the result of almost five years of investigations. In the afternoon, the investigators want to inform about more details.
New global climate protests from Fridays for Future
A week after the biggest international climate protests so far, thousands of people are once again going to the streets for more climate protection.
To conclude an international climate campaign, the Fridays for Future movement again planned actions and announcements in dozens of countries around the world.
In Germany, protests are planned in at least 65 cities, including in metropolises such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller municipalities and cities such as Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland on Sylt.
Climate protests <0xC7><0x80> Who are Thunberg’s followers?
Sense of justice and courage are high virtues, even in the 21st century, in a world full of wars and smoke factories that warm the climate. All the more amazing that calculated a 16-year-old girl wants to keep a manicured manicure of a manicured man of this period of his own?
On the one hand, Greta Thunberg sets the masses in motion and brings young people to rise up for a better climate-friendly world. It is not historically the first time in Europe that a young person has managed to make it through a gathering of children and adolescents on the other side of the world. In 1212, Ni made a name for himself.
But there is also a good thing about Akzweten in this regard, and there is also a shadowy side to Akzweten. Why does the very thing called "We don't have time" need to save the world? In addition, Greta Thunberg has some rich PR-managers at her side. In addition, her mother has not published a book of Dienweiten zu Dienweiten Dienweiten Dienweiten hat dienweiten Dienweiterer Rak verkauft.
Here the spirits are now separated: Is it morally right to enrich oneself financially in saving the world? Is it still authentic if certain circles of people work together with stockbrokers during the world rescue action? It does not matter what kind of position the democracies are in the end, it is a critical and reflective point.
Comet Discovered: Interstellar Guest Crossing Our Solar System
An alien comet is currently intersecting our solar system.
The astronomers’ assumptions have been confirmed: A comet is currently intersecting our solar system – it is only the second of its kind.
Garching/Washington - The researchers have long suspected it, but now they are sure: A comet from another star is crossing our solar system at the moment. It was named after its discoverer 2I/Borisov and is currently employing astronomers worldwide.
2I/Borisov: Comet discovered by amateur astronomers in Crimea
The said body was discovered by an amateur astronomer named Gennadi Borissov in Crimea. He looked up at the sky with a self-built telescope and other observations confirmed his first suspicion. It is actually an unknown comet that was flooded by its kind. It is not from our solar system.
The great chance for astronomers is now to get close insights into an alien solar system. Apparently, the comet is similar to those of our own system, as reported by the Canary Astrophysical Institute. The comet is, according to the International Astronomical Union (IAC), clearly out of our system.
Comet has already been seen before landing - and can be observed for several months
But before it is yet so far, the astronomers can only observe it in depth. Because, unlike its predecessor, 2I/Borisov has already been seen in his flight, which means that he will be able to be examined from Earth for many months from October to October. "The object will be heard from David to be heard, then it will be heard from Telesaurus until mid-December, and it will reach the greatest brightness of April.
The predecessor of the new visitor: 1I/2017 U1 "Oumuamua".
First findings on Comet 2I/Borisov raise hopes in science
According to the first findings, the comet is estimated to be 2 to 16 kilometers in diameter. At the same time, the celestial body appears to be similar to our comet - because as IAC researcher Julia de Le<0xC3><0xB3>n puts it, the spectrum of the star's coil could be similar to that of our other coils.
The fact that two such objects have already been discovered within just two years may allow for a new pathway to explore certain processes in other solar systems, but this is not the case.
Asteroids keep busy the researchers. Only recently a giant asteroid ran past the Earth and came dangerously close to it.
"Absolutely reprehensible": Rachel Johnson upset about brother
Boris Johnson gets lonely. First his younger brother leaves the cabinet, now his sister whispers in clear words the warlike language of the prime minister as "tasteless". It is not the brother she knows.
"Capitulation", "Betrayal", Treaty": Prime Minister Boris Johnson is under pressure and continues to prepare - at least verbally. During the questioning session in the House of Commons this Wednesday, this was met with massive outrage from the opposition, and in the meantime, more critics have come to their word: dozens of his own bishops and bishops.
The well-known journalist and author told Sky News that her brother used words like capitulation, as if the opponents of an EU exit should be "hanged, elongated, quartered, torn and feathered". She considered this to be extremely repulsive to anti-Paxion's view of the EU.
In particular, she faced the fact that, according to her brother, Jo Cox, a very EU-friendly MEP, who had been murdered by a neo-Nazi a few days before the 2016 referendum, she said, "The best thing to do is to honor the memories of them, by taking them through the Brexit."
Cox's widow also harshly criticized the prime minister. "It makes me sick when Jos name is used that way," he tweeted. The best way to honor her is if you are passionate and determined for what you are going to do. To believe in what you believe - no matter what side you are in.
Only a few weeks ago, Boris Johnson's younger brother Jo had set up his office as Secretary of State and his mandate as Deputy of Tory. "I have been torn between loyalty to the family and national interest in recent months - it's an indissoluble tension," Jo Johnson said.
Johnson's language also came under sharp criticism in the Church. As the Times reports, all 118 bishops and archbishops of the Church of England criticize the language that "this country is not worthy". In a joint statement, they also stated that they should not speak with parliament in this way.
Shakira and Jennifer Lopez performing at the Super Bowl
In the year of its 100th anniversary, the NFL sets a strong mark: In the upcoming Super Bowl half-time show, two women with Latino roots appear, promising "an explosion of fun and energy".
Super Bowl Latina Power: Superstars Shakira (42) and Jennifer Lopez (50) will deliver the NFL Football League semi-time show at the upcoming final, the organizers announced on Thursday (local time).
"I feel incredibly honored and humbled to represent the Latino community in addition to JLo because it has incredible strength in the United States," Shakira said in a video.
The final of the American Football League, which will celebrate its 100th birthday next year, will take place on February 2 in Miami. In the metropolis on the southern tip of Florida, many people live with Latin American roots. Shakira ("Waka Waka") comes from Colombia, Lopez ("Herkun-Her-Toer ist On the Floor").
"I love the Super Bowl putting two women on stage this time - and two Latinas," Lopez said. This sends an important message to all Americans and the world. She promises for the show "an explosion of fun and energy".
The 50-year-old was born in New York after her parents emigrated from Puerto Rico. In the 2000s, she landed big hits with songs such as "Waiting For Tonight" or "Let's Get Loud" and later released songs in Spanish. Lopez also works as an actress.
Shakira became known in Colombia as the star of a telenovela and singer, making her worldwide breakthrough in 2001 with her first bilingual album and the single "Whenever, Wherever".
The announcement of the half-time guests is expected in the US every time with excitement. This year, many also value the selection as a political gesture. After all, the country, not least by the immigration policy of President Donald Trump, is deeply divided.
The Super Bowl is the biggest US sporting event and at the same time a gigantic advertising spectacle. Musicians such as Justin Timberlake, Beyoncé, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Madonna, Bruno Mars and the Rolling Stones caused a lot of turmoil there. It is also common to watch Furweil in the NFL finals, with far more than 100 million in Germany.
Last year there was a lot of political controversy ahead of time. The reason was the dispute over the quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who had refused to rise up in protest against police violence against blacks when playing the national anthem Marohn, and for that reason a few of them had been ripped off with music by President Donald Trump.
An actor and a YouTuber is appointing the ruler of Egypt: but first, Mohamed Ali prefers to stay abroad.
The two men of Islam, who had no influence at all, had no influence at the time of the President of the United Nations, and had no influence at all, at the time of the President of the United Nations, the President of the United Nations, Abdelfattah al-Sisi, the President of the United Nations, the President of the United Nations, the President of the United Nations, the President of the United Nations, the President of the United Nations, the United Nations, the United Nations, the People's, the United Nations, and the People's, the People's, the United Nations.
In the opinion of the president, Mr. Teh<0xC3><0xA8>me, who is currently trying to determine what is going on in the streets. Mohamed Ali, of course, stayed abroad, where he refrained from accessing the security forces, who would immediately arrest him to the police station, while he was only trying to enter the Egyptian floor.
He goes to the head of state directly and in quite rustic language. While the people are hungry, the president is swaying in luxury and lets himself build a magnificent new palaces, it is said. The military leadership, on which Sisi leans on his rule, with its help, he is proud of it, he is proud of it for 15 years.
For the first time since Sisi’s grip after power, many thousands of citizens, among them prominent figures of civil society, human rights lawyers and opposition politicians, who had been arrested at the Protei, and those who had been arrested at the Protei, and those who had been arrested at the Protei, for the first time in the past week.
From the town of Mansura in the Nile Delta, where protesters left the city of Herzogen until last week to tear up banners with the portrait of the president, a massive police presence was reported on Friday. Security forces built up a checkpoints in the city and on the streets of the Nile.
Mohamed Ali encouraged these measures to change his tactics: "Our goal doesn't have to be the Tahrir Square," Ali said in his video camera in Barcelona. "Let's not clash with police officers." But as a retreater, this is not to be understood: "All Egypt is the Tahrir Square."
If the provider promises too much performance
If the internet connection always seems much slower than advertised by the provider, there are various check options.
If you enter into an internet contract, you do not have to blindly trust the speed data of the provider. Customers can check for themselves in the event of noticeable events how much of it is actually achieved.
Finally, the transfer rates promised in advance are part of the contract and should therefore also be achieved, explains the Bavarian Consumer Headquarters.
If the connection seems to be always much slower than advertised by the provider, there are different testing options. Thus, the measurement tools of the Federal Network Agency (BNetzA) measure the actual data transfer rates and compare them with the rate agreed in the contract.
“However, the tests of the suppliers are carried out according to provider-specific specifications and are therefore not uniformly and objectively calculated,” says the Bavarian Consumer Headquarters.
If the connection is significantly slower than announced, customers can set the provider a reasonable period of as a rule of 14 days to produce the promised service. This is best done by written notice of objection.
If this does not work even after a multiple request, customers can cancel and, in some cases, claim damages. However, in the absence of success, only the appeal will help.
First High-ranking Republican for Investigation
As the first high-ranking Republican, the governor of Vermont has spoken out for an impeachment investigation against U.S. President Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important, yes, and where this leads from here, it can be determined by the facts of what P Blocs, which will be determined by the Waffles," he said at a press conference at the Don.
Scott said he was not surprised by the revelations that Trump repeatedly asked Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj in a phone call to investigate the interventions of Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden in Ukraine.
Republicans have so far held back with criticism of Trump for the whistleblower affair; few have recognized discomfort because of it. Scott’s remarks are a first sign of this in Trump’s party. Scott, a moderate Republican, has already resorted several times to anti-violent protection and rewriting of Trump’s policies, e.g.
Spider-Man remains in MCU: Further Marvel movie planned
It was a shock for all Spider-Man fans: at the end of August it was announced that Sony and Marvel would go separate ways in the future. Tom Holland’s Spider-Man would no longer be part of the “Avengers” universe. It was completely unclear how the films around Tom Holland should continue.
Now the surprise: Spider-Man will receive another final third film within the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) after "Spider-Man: Homecoming" and "Spider-Man: Far From Home". This is reported by several US media according to the same.
In the magazine "Screenrant" Marvel Boos Kevin Feige is quoted as saying: "I'm glad that Spideys will continue his way in the MCU. I and everyone at the Marvel studios are very pleased that we can continue to work on it ... He's the only superhero with the ability to keep Spiett to carry on with him in different universes.
But how does it come to the sudden good news? Allegedly, Sony Marvel has submitted an offer. According to industry magazines, the Disney group, which also includes Marvel, would participate with 30% in the revenue of upcoming Spider-Man movies. However, the message is not confirmed.
Duchess Meghan and Prince Harry appear in 'Suits' final
After nine seasons, the series "Suits" has now reached the grand finale in the US. In the finale, there were many Happy Ends and as many cameo appearances. And also the royal couple Prince Harry (35) and his Meghan (38), who followed the sporadically in the series.
One thing ahead of time: Duchess Meghan did not return in the final for a final farewell as Rachel Zane, at least not for new scenes. Instead, some look back showed once again the most memorable scenes with today's Duchess. So, for example, the moments of his failed and his happy wedding.
But also her real husband, Prince Harry, was mentioned in the "Suits" finale by chance, of course in a wedding scene. When Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman, 49) steps straight towards the altar to marry his fiancée Sheila (Rachael Harris, 51).
Aegean: Baby and four other children drown in boat accident
A baby and four other children drowned in a refugee boat in the Aegean Sea. Seven people died in the accident, the Greek coast guard said on Friday. The nationalities are still unclear.
The boat sank near the Greek island of Inousses, which lies between the island of Chios and the Turkish mainland. Four children, three women and five men were rescued.
Hundreds of migrants from Turkey are currently crossing to the Greek islands in the east of the Aegean. Last year, 174 people were killed on this route, according to the United Nations refugee agency (UNHCR). Federal Interior Minister Horst Seehofer has now announced where to visit both countries.
Together with his French colleague and the EU Commissioner responsible, he wants to "inform Turkey about the refugee situation", said Seehofer on Friday. Afterwards, he wants to be able to learn more about the "administrative problems of the Greeks" in Athens.
A spokeswoman for the European Commission confirmed Seehofers’ planned trip with EU Interior Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos and France’s Interior Minister Christophe Castaner on Friday.
Greece continues to receive unusually large numbers of migrants from Turkey, with 654 people transferring to the Greek islands on Tuesday alone, the Greek Ministry of Civil Protection said on Wednesday.
Is the Turkey deal still working?
The increased numbers left doubts as to the functioning of the EU-Turkey agreement, which was concluded in 2016. This provides for the EU to be able to send back all refugees and migrants who come illegally via Turkey to the Greek islands to Turkey. In return, the EU wanted to send one back to Turkey.
However, the processing of asylum applications on the Greek side is difficult due to lack of staff. Lesbos, Chios, Samos, Leros and Kos have almost 29,400 people. According to the Ministry of Civil Protection, the worst is the situation in Lesbos: in a camp with capacity for 650 people are currently under 5200 Migra.
There have never been so many since the entry into force of the EU-Turkey refugee pact in March 2016, state radio reported.
Climate Change: Heat Leads to More Heart Attacks
According to physicians, climate change will put the health system to the test in the future. The climate change will be "very safe" one of the biggest challenges for the health system in the next 20 to 50 years. In the next 20 to 50 years, the temperature will be created in the future.
Green politician should be held accountable for embarrassing photo shoots
The head of the Canadian Greens, Elizabeth May, in the election campaign - was the mug manipulated for this reason?
The Canadian Green Chief holds a multi-way mug in his hand on a photo, but now it came out: the mug was manipulated.
Ottawa/Canada - It's been quite a while since the post has remained unnoticed - and finally noticed yet. The reusable coffee mug with metal straw has Elizabeth May, the head of the Canadian Greens, never been held in the hand. The mediöer was also on the website of the party.
Green boss has to be responsible for photo panes
The National Post then accused May of manipulation and that the party produces fake news to appear more credible on the issue of "environmental protection", and that in the middle of an election campaign for the House of Commons, in which it is also increasingly difficult for Trudeau because of a bribery scandal.
The photo went viral on social media and sparked the discussion about fake news. A user shares a contrast of the photos and writes: "The Greens are manipulating a photo of their chairman to hide their one-way mug."
May was still shocked and insisted on her blog that she knew nothing about this action. To emphasize this, she immediately posted the original: she, in conversation with the citizens, had a cup in her hand. However, the person, who put it up on the photo, was just right, said to the person, was from bamboo. She always had it in her hand.
May writes that she is sorry for the employee who did. "I don't want to call him stupid, but there was nothing to hide," she says to the Guardian and at the same time inherited something from her over-engagemented team: "If you want to edit a picture again?"
The German Greens also got into shitstorms because of their use of disposable plastic or because of flight trips - but their pictures were not photographed, so the head of the Bavarian Greens, Katharina Schulze, ate ice cream with plastic spoons on holiday, as merkur.de* reported.
Influencerin wants free upgrade: lifetime flight ban at Cathay
Jaqueline Ng allegedly received an upgrade from Cathay Pacific via mail, but when she requested it at check-in, she was not allowed on board - and should never be allowed to fly with Cathay again.
Spontaneously get an upgrade for the Business Class - many passengers dream of it. Sometimes they are lucky, and the staff at the check-in offer a change from the Economy Class for free.
This case, however, shows how not to do it: A self-declared influencer has actively asked the airline Cathay Pacific for a free upgrade. On Instagram Jaqueline Ng follows more than 65,000 users. On May 30, she flew back from Taiwan to New York and on June 7.
On the departure flight, Jaqueline refused an upgrade, even though she showed an email in which her Cathay Pacific reportedly offered an upgrade. The letter wanted to have the influencer received from an airline marketing employee. On the other hand, the airline accused Jaqueline.
On the return flight, Jaqueline tried again to get an upgrade for the long-haul flight. This time the woman was supposed to have shown the same mail, but with a different reference number. The staff at JFK airport were skeptical: they also did not agree with the Maque system at the headquarters.
Airline employees at the airport cancelled Jaqueline’s ticket and imposed a lifelong flight ban on Cathay Pacific, which cost her $1,400 (about $1,280) to buy a new ticket to Taiwan.
In her case, the influencer turned to Elliot Advocacy, a company that represents consumer interests, because Cathay had reimbursed her for the price of her original ticket, but Jaqueline also claimed the cost of the new ticket.
But as long as Jaqueline does not submit the metadata of the mail, the case remains clear: for Cathay, the influencer has committed fraud, she remains locked for future flights. The airline's terms and conditions also state that she does not have to pay for the new flight. Jaqueline does not want to satisfy herself with it.
Oil prices reveal after report of ceasefire in Yemen
Oil prices fell by more than a dollar in the shortest time on Friday afternoon. Lastly, a barrel (159 liters) of the North Sea variety Brent cost $61.83 - about 1.4 percent less than on the day before. The price for a barrel of the American variety West Texas Intermediate (WTI) fell to 55 Dots by 1.3 per cent.
The trigger for the course slide was a report by the Wall Street Journal on a ceasefire in Yemen, which Saudi Arabia reportedly agreed to a ceasefire in four areas.
In mid-September, a drone strike on oil facilities in Saudi Arabia had brought down five percent of global oil production. The Huthi rebels allied with Iran in the civil war country of Yemen had complained of the attacks on themselves. Saudi Arabia would have a political response.
Should an agreement actually be reached, one could focus on growth and demand, said Ole Hansen, head of the commodity strategy department at Saxo Bank of the Bloomberg news agency.
A week ago, a barrel of WTI oil had cost up to almost $59, Brent almost $65, and the price of oil was almost $65.
Lastly, Bloomberg, referring to Insider, had reported that repair work on oil plants in Saudi Arabia was progressing faster than expected after the mid-September attack, according to which the production volume again reached a volume of eight million barrels per day and moved again in the direction of the spring.
Recently, there have been several press releases citing insiders who report rapid progress made by the state-owned oil company Saudi Aramco in repair work, but raw materials experts pointed out that Saudi Aramco is currently planning a stock market run and wants to avoid negative headlines.
At the same time, there was some relaxation in the conflict between Iran and Western countries: the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" is more than two months after being captured by Iran and the recently granted release on the way to leave the port. The crew now prepared to leave the port with a s<0xC3><0xA5>fund.
However, the U.S. has announced that it will move missiles and troops to Saudi Arabia, with fears of an escalation between the Islamic Republic and countries such as the U.S. and the United Kingdom raising oil prices at times in recent weeks.
Accusations against Trump are getting worse
In the case of a possible abuse of power by U.S. President Donald Trump, accusations of cover-up against the White House have become loud. Several leading government employees would have tried intensively, after a controversial phone call between Trump and the Ukrainian President. The address of the President of Ukraine, Pelodymyr Selenskyj.
North Korea considers third summit of Trump and Kim questionable
North Korea has expressed doubts that a third summit will soon be held in the nuclear dispute between Kim Jong-un and U.S. President Donald Trump. The meaning and the prospects for success of such a meeting are due to lack of progress in the implementation of agreements at the first summit in Singapore.
The U.S. has so far done nothing to implement the decisions of the summit in the previous year, said the adviser of the North Korean foreign ministry. He also criticised the tightening of U.S. sanctions and the joint military maneuver of the United States and South Korea. But he hopes to come up with a "wise and courageous" decision.
Trump had said on Monday that he wanted to know what a third summit with Kim would bring before he was ready to explain it, but negotiations on the stockpile of the North Korean nuclear and missile program have been going on since the failed second summit between Trump and Kim in Hano.
Prince Harry: Arms manufacturers to help clear mines
With a blue splinter protective vest, British Prince Harry has symbolically lit and destroyed a mine in Angola. Near a camp of the British Halo Trust at the place Dirico, he set up the ignition circuit. But in safe distance, the ignitionists did not explode at all, but at a distance, the sprints of the bombs went off.
Pound under pressure - interest rate reduction expected
British pound under pressure
In the face of an imminent interest rate decline, the pound loses its value against the euro.
Frankfurt's speculations about the Bank of England's (BoE) interest rate coming to a pound sterling increased by 0.4 percent to $1.2269 on Friday.
The triggers of the sales were statements of the banker Michael Saunders. This brought into the conversation a reduction of interest rates, even if a chaotic Brexit could be reversed, as the uncertainty will affect the British economy for the foreseeable time. This statement remains surprising from Broly's Activist. Analyst says that Rieffer's policy is surprising, since Sauder's.
Last week, the Bank of England had already pointed out the burden on the economy by the Brexit hack, without directly signaling a interest rate drop. Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to lead his country even if necessary without a divorce agreement on October 31.
More: With his provocations, the British Prime Minister has taken a high risk, but it could pay off for him, says Handelsblatt editor Kerstin Leitel.
Doping: Other Russian Manipulations Demonstrated
Material from the Moscow analysis lab is being manipulated – this is confirmed by David Howman, former director of the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) and today’s head of integrity of the World Athletics Federation.
At the onset of the World Championships in Athletics, new details of the doping scandal in Russia come to light - and they destroy the little credibility that the Russian sport had regained at the beginning of the year and also only approximately. In January 2019, the Moscow Doping Laboratory finally delivered the required samples.
In December 2014, Russier was revealed to be a systematic fraud in the Russian sport in the second half of 2014. In the second half of 2018, the Russian anti-doping agency (Rusada) had been suspended for three years. During this time, Russian athletes were not completely banned from the world stage. The International Olympic Committee in the second half of the 2016 season, the finals of the second half of the season were held in Rio.
Positive Findings Missing
In the following September, the Wada lifted the Rusada ban, but requested access to the lab and the said samples. The data should give information on the extent of the cover-up of doping cases in state doping. They should help to punish athletes were later punished.
The chairman of the independent Disblon's Integrity Commission (AIU) of the World Association of Athletics (IAAF) has now confirmed that the doping data from the Moscow analysis laboratory has been manipulated. "Yes. We have received the data from David, we have received the data from them nine months ago."
The World Cup is not affected
This confirms the attitude of the IAAF: The Athletics Association is the only organization that holds the ban of Russia. At the World Cup in Doha, 30 Russian athletes start under neutral flag. They had to prove that they are training outside the Russian system and undergo tests.
At the beginning of this week, the Wada had already put the manipulations into space and called on Russia to respond to the allegations within three weeks. Russia now threatens the re-locking of the Rusada and, in the worst case, also the exclusion of the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo.
