Barack Obama will be the fourth U.S. president to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
U.S. President Barack Obama will fly to Oslo, Norway, to spend 26 hours and be the fourth U.S. president in history to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.
The award, medal and check of $1.4 million will be given to him, among other things, for his outstanding efforts to strengthen world diplomacy and cooperation among nations.
The head of the White House and his wife Michelle will land in the morning in the Norwegian metropolis and have a busy schedule.
He will first visit the Nobel Institute, where he will meet for the first time the five members of the Committee who elected him in October from among 172 people and 33 organizations.
The presidential couple's planning then envisages an interview with Norway's King Harald V and Queen Sonja.
The visit will peak in the afternoon at a solemn ceremony where Obama will receive the prestigious award.
He will be the fourth U.S. president to receive it, but only the third to receive the award within the Committee.
The White House announced in advance that Obama would talk about the war in Afghanistan at the award ceremony.
The president does not want to avoid this issue because he is aware that he is receiving this award by being a president who is currently at war in two countries.
He reinforced the war effort a few days ago by sending additional units to Afghanistan, which none of his critics will forget to point out.
At the ceremony, Obama will also receive a gold medal, a diploma and a cheque of ten million Swedish crowns (approximately <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.1 million).
He intends to donate it to charitable works, but he has not yet decided which ones.
His programme will then take him and his wife to a banquet including, in addition to the king and queen of Norway, the head of government and 250 other guests.
Obama was quite reluctant at this price in the beginning.
He mentioned, for example, that he felt that he did not deserve it fully.
He also repeated several times that this is not a prize for himself alone, but for all those who defend the same values as him.
As of the announcement, he said it would be an “invitation to action” for him.
A Nature Defendant Accused of Blackmail
The Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice police have accused the president of the Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice Nature Protectors Society of blackmail.
On several occasions last year he appealed for several construction site procedures and demanded money from investors for his personal profit in exchange for withdrawing his call, said Alena Romov<0xC3><0xA1>, a spokesman for the Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice police.
The president of the Society of Nature Protectors of Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice is Lubom<0xC3><0xAD>r Studni<0xC4><0x8D>ka.
He is currently in custody and is at risk of up to three years in prison.
Waste sorting buckets are not perfumed in Brno
In Prague everyone can sort their drinks packs, while in the villages of South Moravia you fall on sorting benches at every corner of the street.
What's up with Brno?
There, it would take you several minutes before you find the right buckets.
I don't mean that we wouldn't sort the waste in Brno at all.
But I have the impression that the municipal councils of our city, the second largest city in the country, are not sufficiently interested in this problem.
Brno is in the stone age of the sorting of waste not only because citizens can still sort only paper, glass and PVC, but especially because of the number of buckets dedicated to this waste.
Have you ever tried to throw a plastic bottle into the city center?
It’s a science that requires time and nerves of steel.
The only place I have found at the moment is the place of Moravia in front of Potrefena Husa.
That Mr. Onderka and his colleagues do not want me to do so, but it seems to me to be a very small thing.
Not to mention the fact that in other areas of the city it is not a secret either.
So in the end, many of my friends don’t sort their waste.
Par parese.
It's a good way to get to the bennies.
I'm not surprised by them.
I myself, after a party, proposed to go throw away a few bottles of glass and PVC.
Except that I didn't see any colored buns on Kounicova street.
Luckily, I found the right place by taking the tram.
That said, the waste was overloaded.
After all, it is the center of Brno, which is supposed to represent the city best, right?!
It is likely that ecology and so-called aestheticism are not of much interest to the socialists of Brno.
They prefer to buy the city a place in the first hockey league that shames the city all over the country, instead of buying a few extra buckets and offering the sorting of more raw materials for a cleaner Brno.
I’m happy to have been able to reinforce my impression with official statistics after dragging a moment on the internet.
According to data from EKO-KOM, Brno is truly the worst in the entire South Moravian region.
The budget of Paroubek has removed Argentine pensions and sick leave
After the left has increased, despite the opinion of the government, farmers or even civil servants it may be that there is a lack of money for pensions, sick leave or housing savings.
But also for interest on state debt or international judicial proceedings.
This will increase the problems of those who will rule in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the social democrats and communists imposed the increase for certain classes, they were based on the fact that the government would make loans for sensitive spending, pensions or sick leave. "It's just to return the problems to later, mine the land," Janota said.
It should be known that on borrowed money the interest to be paid is increasingly high and that it will have to be returned sooner or later.
The state doesn’t really have a choice to know where to draw money.
If he does not reduce social assistance or his expenses, he will have to raise taxes.
To all that the left has now increased: firefighters, teachers, farmers.
And then, to their children.
People will touch them and should not be afraid for their pensions or their health insurance, of which 1.8 billion have disappeared.
But at the expense of a larger debt of the state - next year it will therefore not lack 163 billion in cash, but more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, the debt will grow more rapidly and with it, interest-related expenditures.
The state will need money to pay it back and it will no longer suffice to slightly increase VAT or decrease maternity leave as the government did in its anti-deficit package.
It will also miss five billion to complete the construction of roads and railways due to the transfer of money to a few groups of voters.
These are mainly sections that have already been decided and started, and it is not possible to modify the projects in order to reduce costs.
At the very least keep them, which is not free either.
This means delaying or stopping thirty large construction sites, and the withdrawal of European funds is also in danger, according to the warning of Karel Hanzelka, a spokesman for the Ministry of Transport.
The <0xC4><0x8C>SSD has proposed to solve the financial deficit very wisely - it will grow in the dividends of the <0xC4><0x8C>EZ (electricity supplier and distributor), which the state has the majority and will feed the transport fund.
The concern is that the amount of dividends is never certain and that it is in no case a bottomless well.
Last year, there were 18 billion that were navigated from the <0xC4><0x8C>EZ to the budget.
Each year, dividends are used to pay for the removal of environmental damage, to complete pension accounts, or as a reserve for the pension reform that is being prepared.
Moreover, this trick increases the real budget deficit to 5.7 percent of GDP according to EU rules.
And it's far from the end of the transfer carnival.
The budget for various compensations to victims of communism and crimes, even housing savings, has decreased by almost three billion.
It is not certain that the state will be able to act without this money.
It's a lottery.
If we lose an international procedure, we will have to pay for it anyway, says Janota.
The minister will then have to save on the department's side or, in the worst case, touch the government's budget reserve.
There is also a shortage of one hundred million in the two-billion-dollar state fund project, which should allow us to track the expenditures of each administration online.
The first stage will start in January.
If the finance minister did not find money elsewhere, the project would have to be stopped and sanctions would take place, Janota warned.
Your next smartphone will master two operating systems.
In the future, Americans are considering a mobile phone that will allow the user to switch from one operating system to another by pressing a single button.
The projects that have been revealed are promising.
Just one button and you’ll move from Windows Mobile to Android in seconds.
It is precisely this possibility that is the goal of the American company VMware, which mainly deals with the development of virtualization software for computers.
We will allow you to manage two user profiles at the same time on your mobile phone.
You can alternate between them, you can differentiate them in personal and professional
The two will work at the same time, Srinivas Krishnamurti of VMware said in an interview with Computerworld magazine.
It was introduced in November last year and it was made a first demonstration a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
Virtualization on smartphones is not a fiction.
VMware has already successfully introduced a test version to journalists, a smartphone equipped with two operating systems.
It is a modified Nokia N800 with 128 MB of RAM, which simultaneously ran the mentioned Windows Mobile and Android systems.
The development of new technologies for mobile phones is booming.
VMware is now collaborating with European and U.S. operators to test virtualization on smartphones, and customers are expected to have access to current devices in 2012.
The lack of snow in the mountains bothers hoteliers
Desert trails are not a problem for ski lift operators alone.
The lack of snow discourages people from booking their ski stays in hotels and guesthouses.
As a result, it is always possible to find free rooms for all winter dates, including Christmas and New Year.
We have a lot of visits on our site.
Internet users browse the offers, ask for the prices but do not dare to commit to booking for the moment.
And if they call us, they immediately ask if there will be snow or mud at Christmas," said Martin Jandura, an operator of the Spindl.Info news portal.
If you want to spend the New Year of your dreams in <0xC5><0xA0>pindler<0xC5><0xAF>v Ml<0xC3><0xBD>n, it is better not to hesitate too much to book.
If you give priority to the savings and the quality of the accommodation comes only afterwards, then you can try to wait a few more days.
The hoteliers of <0xC5><0xA0>pindler currently only offer one week stays for the New Year.
I think they will try another time to place them, but they will also give in and accept shorter periods.
And then the number of free rooms will rapidly decrease," Jandura estimated.
The tourist agency Ingtours du Vrchlab<0xC3><0xAD> also offers free beds for all winter periods.
We are most interested in the Christmas week at the moment, it is not completely sold.
It is still free, say, half of the rooms in our offer.
That’s why we’ve already prepared a few last-minute, cheaper Christmas stays,” said Ingtours director Petr Schiefert.
Vrchlab<0xC3><0xAD>’s travel agency can also offer New Year’s Eve in Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e, but there are fewer places available.
The first fourteen days of February go just as well, the remaining winter stays sell on average.
This year, interest in winter stays has been negatively influenced by the fact that there is still no snow in Krkno<0xC5><0xA1>e.
People are waiting for her to come down.
No one wants to spend winter in the mountains without snow.
If the slopes are covered during the week, Christmas will also be complete,” Schiefert thinks.
Conversely, the occupation of the Horizont Hotel in Pec pod Sn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE>kou is slightly higher than last year.
We have an improvement of about five percent.
There are still a few places left for New Year’s Eve as well as for Christmas.
There is a great interest during the holidays of January of the Poles and February sells well as well," says Karel Rada, director of the best hotel in Pec.
The Omnia hotel near the central car park of J<0xC3><0xA1>nské L<0xC3><0xA1>zn<0xC4><0x9B> is also complete at eighty percent during the New Year period.
On the contrary, half of the beds remain empty at Christmas in the newest hotel in J<0xC3><0xA1>nské L<0xC3><0xA1>zn<0xC4><0x9B>.
This year, we were pleasantly surprised by the month of January, where we already have sixty percent of employment at the moment.
February is a little weaker at the moment but as soon as the snow falls, interest in stays in the Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e will still surely grow, said the director of the Omnia hotel, Erik Sporysch.
However, the hoteliers of the Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e do not have to expect more snow.
On Thursday it will be cooler and if there is rain, they should be snowy in the mountains.
But later, the weather is expected to warm up, reports Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Jakubsk<0xC3><0xBD> of the Hradec station of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
USA: Repetition is the mother of wisdom
It even becomes comical, the hard work with which Barack Obama, president of the reputation of sage, reproduces his predecessor’s strategy on the Afghan question, which he considered himself to be quite simple.
When he finally let his long-awaited doctrine sweat, it turned out that he had copied it on carbon paper since Bush’s Iraq scenario three years ago.
Not content to use in the text even several times the phrase "as in Iraq", he did not hesitate, which is more, to use the title of Bush's January 2007 speech as the title of his own speech: "A new way forward"
At the same time, he personally criticized Bush’s idea of sending new reinforcements into a Iraq consumed by the civil war as being “irresponsible and a catastrophic decision in its consequences.”
The following months, however, showed that Bush’s strategy, which emanated from the recommendations of campaign commanders, was the only possible and likely to be so successful that the newspapers at the moment do not talk about Iraq at all.
This did not improve Bush’s reputation, it said, objectively speaking, he left his successor in a much more favorable final situation than one could have hoped.
Barack Obama hopes that in Afghanistan, the miracle will happen again
It was again the campaign commanders who asked him to increase the military contingent, including the Afghan Operation Commander, General Stanley McCristal, who even harshly criticized the White House's reluctance despite subordination habits.
He asked 40,000 men to make the situation more favourable.
The president hesitated for three months, but in the absence of a better option, he at least swindled the general of 10,000 soldiers.
He was able to fulfill the promise of an additional 5,000 from Europe, even though he had originally counted out of 10,000.
What brings the most problems in Obama’s entire strategy seems to be his intention to withdraw the armies from Afghanistan within 18 months and complete this whole process within three years, and the entire Obama doctrine brings more questions than it provides answers.
Many doubt that an increase in half will bear the same fruit as progression in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal wars of recent years, Iraqi society is relatively well organized and its leaders honor the agreements.
The situation in Afghanistan is marked by the exact opposite - no one can be counted on and no treaty is respected.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare Afghan security forces, accustomed to changing leaders day by day according to what arranges them.
Political institutions, although officially founded, will only remain the dust in the eyes behind which patriarchal ethnic relations will proliferate.
It is particularly complex to balance the interests of various ethnic groups, given the lack of clarity on relations, which are still complicated by Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Even the founding of a “quick-to-action” state, which is the basic goal of the operation, does not seem to be very real.
The timeline of Obama’s strategy is perplexing by his voluntarism.
Over the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only worsened and is currently on the brink of chaos.
Only a purely romantic and out of reality heart can be convinced that the little soldiers sent into the tumult of the war for their "prompt return home" will bring there a real miracle.
From a political point of view, setting a date for the withdrawal of troops is purely irresponsible since the Taliban will consider it the indirect admission of American defeat.
The latest NATO summit has shown that the Europeans' willingness to participate in military operations in Afghanistan is oriented towards the negative.
European politicians do not know or want to explain to their constituents how security in Germany or Italy is linked to a war in the Hindu Kush mountains.
Another factor that can radically change the situation is the evolution of events related to Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the tightened sanctions have no effect on the Iranians, the Americans will face the very difficult issue of resolving the problem through the use of military force.
It will have to be answered, for example, at a time when, according to Obama, America will come to the victorious withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan.
Any such solution, however, will lead to a dramatic turnaround in the Afghan situation.
The only rusty thing for Obama is that he has three years left until the presidential election, and therefore there is still enough time for him to embark on a new strategy, in case it turns out to be a total fiasco.
Goldman Sachs bank executives will no longer receive cash bonuses
Senior executives at U.S. Goldman Sachs Bank will no longer receive cash premiums this year.
The company announced it to respond to strong criticisms of its wage practices.
The group of 30 top executives will receive shares instead of money, which they will not be able to resell until five years.
The actions can be withdrawn from the leaders in case they take too much risk.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs is thus at the forefront of the effort to link rewards with long-term performance on Wall Street.
I guess Wall Street is well aware of the overall sense to be taken, said former investment banker Douglas Elliott of JPMorgan.
The problem lies in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs Bank has become the target of criticism after it set aside nearly $17 billion for premiums over the first three quarters of this year.
For the current year, the total amount of premiums is likely to exceed $20 billion despite the measure announced today, according to Reuters.
With the advent of the financial crisis, the high premiums of the banking sector have become a sensitive political topic in many countries.
Britain announced on Wednesday that it would allocate a one-off tax of fifty percent on bankers’ bonuses exceeding <0xC2><0xA3>25,000.
France is preparing similar measures.
This year, women have won Nobel Prizes in all fields except physics.
There are five women, a record number, who have received the Nobel Prizes in technical and literary disciplines today in Stockholm from the hands of King Charles XVI Gustave of Sweden.
In addition to the four scientists, there was also the German writer of Romanian origin Herta Müller.
Two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, have been awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine with their countryman Jack Szostak for their research in the field of chromosomes.
The chemistry prize was awarded to Israeli Ada Jonath with American Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz for clarifying the structure and function of ribosomes.
The last winner received the Nobel Prize in Economics, the American Elinor Ostrom with his compatriot Oliver Williamson, for their analysis of economic governance.
The only technical discipline that didn’t have a winner this year was physics.
This award was presented today to scientists Charles Kao for his research in the field of optical fibers and George Smith and Willard Boyle for their invention of CCD chips, which are currently the basis of all digital cameras, faxes or astronomical glasses.
Each laureate has received the diploma, the Nobel medal and the certificate of acquisition of the cash prize.
It reaches ten million Swedish kroner in each category. (approximately 1.1 million euros)
If one of them has multiple winners, they will share the reward with each other.
The long-awaited Nobel Peace Prize has already been presented this afternoon in Oslo, Norway, to US President Barack Obama.
In his speech, he acknowledged the controversial nature of his reward since he is only at the beginning of his career and is also at the head of a country engaged in two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
At the dismissal of his policy, he added that in some situations war is essential to achieving peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janota is considering resigning. Klaus invited him to the Ch<0xC3><0xA2>teau
President V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Klaus will receive Finance Minister Eduard Janota on Friday morning, who is delaying his stay in government due to his disagreement with the state budget for next year as voted by the House of Representatives
It is estimated that Janota's budget and perhaps also the position in the cabinet will be on the agenda of their Friday meeting.
Klaus also criticises the budget.
According to him, the deficit is too large, which further exacerbates the crisis in public finances.
It was Presidential Spokesperson Radim Ochvat who briefed the meeting.
Janota wants to discuss his position with Prime Minister Jan Fischer on Monday.
According to the legislation on the budget that will be submitted to Klaus' signature, it is a deficit of 163 billion kroner that the Czech Republic should manage.
However, the House of Representatives on Wednesday validated the left’s proposals for money transfers and increased the remuneration of officials, the functioning of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government blamed the proposals of the Social Democrats for indirectly increasing the budget deficit.
For this reason, a violent disagreement arose between the left, the government, Klaus, and the right, questioning the future of Fischer’s cabinet, which had been formed by agreement between the ODS, the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD and the Green Party.
Critics say that the budget, as voted by MEPs, removes the package of savings measures passed by the Fischer government, which he believes should curb the state's debt.
Klaus, who can ratify the state budget law but does not oblige anything to do so, said today at a luncheon of discussions with entrepreneurs, that politicians have long neglected the “serious problem” of the “irremless deficiency” of public finances.
Now, he believes, there is no favourable solution.
Only a strong government could make an improvement if it could rely on a broader consensus of political parties, according to the president.
ODS President Mirek Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek said the budget is staggering and the government should call into question its future existence.
ODS Vice President Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as told <0xC4><0x8C>TK that the idea of an administrative cabinet supported by <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, ODS and the Greens clearly no longer works.
In his reaction, Prime Minister Fischer called such words "dramatic verdicts".
<0xC4><0x8C>SSD leader Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Paroubek reacted to Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek, saying the budget deficit prepared for this year by the former Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek government is staggering and will exceed 200 billion kroner.
Already on Wednesday, the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD has successfully qualified the ratification of the state budget for next year.
The People's Party was also pleased.
Morgan Freeman to play Mandela in Clint Eastwood's new film
Despite criticism that the main roles are played by American actors, South Africans say the new Hollywood film Invictus - Invaincu will expose the world to a lot of things about the country, its struggles and its victories.
The story is about sport, race relations and Nelson Mandela.
Morgan Freeman, an Oscar-winning American actor, plays the film about the life of Nelson Mandela, a tireless fighter against the racist apartheid regime in South Africa and first black president.
Freeman said it was an eighty-eleven-year-old Mandela who asked him to embody it in the film.
Matt Damon plays another important role.
I said, "If I have to incarnate you, I should be able to see you personally.
The sixty-two-year-old actor who has been awarded an award for his role in Clint Eastwood's mid-box drama Million Dollar Baby has, for example, embodied the leader of an anti-slavery movement that has become so important as ever as a slave and as ever as a fictitious filmmaker, but as a fictitious president of the United States, and even as God in the film.
The former South African statesman has been jailed for 27 years for his hard work in favor of ending apartheid in South Africa.
He was released in 1990 and became president of the country for four years.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus is a Latin word meaning invincible and is the title of a poem by the English author William Ernest Henley published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him.
The film tells the true story of the joint efforts of Nelson Mandela and the captain of the South African rugby team Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois to unify the country. President-elect Mandela knows that his country remains and always racially and economically divided after apartheid.
He is convinced that he can unite his people through sport and decides to unite the rugby players who are among the outsiders in the world ranking.
The South African team will eventually advance to the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked a few years to bring Mandela’s story to the big screen.
“I had no other purpose but to play this role in a way that brought him closer to reality,” Freeman said.
The biggest challenge for me, of course, was to talk like him.
The actor said that if he and the international politician were in the same region, he would have tried to meet Mandela, to have dinner with him, to be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing for him was to hold his hand.
I realized that when I squeeze your hand, I recover from your energy, it transmits and I had the impression of knowing how you feel, he said.
It is important for me to try to become another person.
Matt Damon plays in the film Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Pienaar, the captain of a national rugby team in which there are a majority of white players.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in rugby.
For him, his first meeting with Pienaar at his home was a big surprise.
I remember when I rang at the door of the house, he opened up to me and the first thing I said to Francois Pienaar was: 'I look much bigger in the movie.'
Despite the differences between actors and real models, Invictus under the helm of director Eastwood received positive reviews and even talked about ambitions for the Oscars.
Film critic Todd McCarthy of the Daily Variety summed up his appreciation in these words: "It's a very good story, a very well made film."
In movie ratings on the website rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received 76% positive reviews.
The mystery of the aura in Norway is solved: the Russians tested a rocket
A strange luminous phenomenon of unknown origin has been observed above Norway.
The Russian Defense Ministry only yesterday admitted to having tested an intercontinental ballistic missile not far from the Norwegian borders.
The launch, however, was still a failure and the "Bulava" type missile that was originally supposed to be the pride of the Russian army gradually became the nightmare of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Its repeated presence in the missile tests did not have the expected effect on the success of test flights.
Most of the time, either Bulava didn't fly, or it was damaged in full flight.
Russian newspapers talk about Bulava as a “missile that doesn’t fly”
A missile that doesn't fly but shines
This 13th trial was at the beginning normally.
It was only at the end of the flight that there was again damage to the equipment.
It's obviously the rocket's third-floor engine that exploded.
This time, "Bulava" flew from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donsky, which was sailing under the surface of the White Sea.
This type of missile can be fired from a moving boat and submerged
This is why the mysterious light above Norway caused by an unidentified flying object was probably caused by a defective "Bulava".
The Norwegians did not doubt for a moment that it was a Russian missile.
The generals argue that this time, one cannot speak absolutely of failure.
The first two floors of the rocket resisted and the damage only affected the third.
In the previous cases, the engines experienced failures on the first floor.
Although none of the test launches have gone unnoticed, the Department of Defense management considers that only six out of thirteen have been failures.
This success rate of almost fifty percent therefore fills the generals with optimism and they therefore always say that one day "Bulava" will fly without problems and that it will carry even ten hypersonic nuclear cores with a total weight of 1.15 tons.
The legendary Fetissov signed at the age of 51 a one-year contract with CSKA Moscow
The legendary defender Viatcheslav Fetissov will appear again in a professional match at the age of 51.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and holder of the Stanley Cup will lend a strong hand to his CSKA Moscow team in need and will probably make his entrance already in Friday's match against Petrograd.
Fetissov, who ended his career at the age of forty in 1998, is currently the president of CSKA.
After Denis Kuliash's injury, we urgently need another defender.
Fetissov regularly trains and agrees to help the team.
We still have to settle some details on the form, said club coach Sergey Nyemchinov, quoted by the AP agency.
It has not been specified whether the comeback of the legendary hockey player will concern only one match.
I think Fetissov is one of those who are able to strengthen the minds of other players, said Nyemchinov.
According to AP, in the case of his return to the ice, Fetissov thus becomes the oldest Russian professional hockey player.
In the NHL, legendary striker Gordie Howe played an entire season for Hartford and scored 15 goals and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous quintet Fetissov, Kassatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov is one of the best hockey players and among the most successful.
Under the colors of the Soviet Union he won gold twice at the Olympic Games, seven world championship titles, he triumphed in the Canada Cup as well as in the Junior World Championship.
In the second half of his career, he also received honors in the NHL where he twice held the Stanley Cup.
He has been a member of the Temple of the Reputation of Hockey since 2001.
Hyundai has listened to unions and cancels all overtime
The management of No<0xC5><0xA1>ovice's Hyundai plant agreed with the unions to cancel all overtime.
It is precisely because of frequent overtime that the unions declared a state of emergency on Monday.
Hyundai factory spokesperson Petr Van<0xC4><0x9B>k confirmed this.
However, the management still wants to agree with the unions on a Saturday working again this year.
We cannot give up our production plan, it is essential, which is why volunteer overtime was offered on Saturday 19 December knowing that there would be two teams, said Vanek.
The website Sedmi<0xC4><0x8D>ka.cz indicated that the company offered a bonus of 400 Czech crowns to employees who would be part of the team on Saturday.
It will also be awarded a posteriori for the working day on 28 November.
The company, according to Van<0xC4><0x9B>k, decided to change the way to motivate its employees in exchange for overtime.
Either they receive the supplement for additional hours, or they can ask for a replacement leave on December 28th and thus extend their end-of-year holidays indicated Van<0xC4><0x9B>k.
In addition, all employees present on Saturday will receive compensation for transport costs and for their lunch.
Given the fact that overtime was the most urgent and hot spot in the comments and claims of unions like employees who spontaneously stopped production last week, the management made the immediate decision to cancel all overtime for the month of December, Van<0xC4><0x9B>k said.
Until last week, the employees of the car factory were forced to work almost daily two overtime hours in addition to their eight hours.
The unions intend to cancel the state of strike after signing the agreement.
The next negotiation between the management of the car factory and the unions is scheduled to take place on Friday afternoon.
Trade union leader Petr Kucha<0xC5><0x99> said on Wednesday that they were ready to end the state of strike if they agreed on their claims and signed a joint document.
The situation at the plant culminated last Wednesday when nearly 400 employees spontaneously went on strike due to incessant overtime.
They also protested against the poor wage conditions and alleged gossip.
The management defended itself with the fact that employees had to work in addition to meet the requirements in the production of automobiles.
At the announcement of the strike on Monday, the unions also demanded that workers who stopped production be subject to no sanctions.
The unions are asking the society to reduce the time spent in overtime to a minimum.
In addition, this year they want a reward of 5,000 crowns (about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>209) for these.
The Hyundai car factory in No<0xC5><0xA1>ovice currently employs 2,000 people.
It started mass production last year in November.
It produced about 80,000 vehicles until September of this year, with a production capacity of 200,000 cars per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that works on "hardening" HIV viruses as well
A team of Czech and German scientists is testing new combinations that can slow the proliferation of the HIV virus in the body.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also acts on viruses that have already developed an immunity to drugs.
This reality, in some cases, takes the lead on the fact that the combination does not work as intensively on the common variants of the virus as well as some already available drugs.
It is not possible to cure AIDS at this time.
However, it is possible to radically prolong the life of patients through a mixture of drugs that prevent the multiplication of the HIV virus in the body.
However, their consumption leads to a number of side effects.
In addition, the suppression of this multiplication has the effect of the development of so-called resistant viruses on which the drugs no longer have an effect.
The work of experts from three institutions, the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, the V<0xC5><0xA0>CHT in Prague and the University of Heidelberg opens the way for a way to deal with the resistance of the virus.
They have shown that substances called metallocarbonates act on the protein responsible for the multiplication of the HIV virus.
Metalocarbonates are a combination of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
This combination blocks the development of the virus in a different way than all the drugs used so far and that is why they could overcome the problem of resistance.
The researchers' work leads them to discover new "improved" substances, based on their knowledge of the molecular mechanics of their bindings to virus proteins.
Metalocarbonates have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multi-walled cages are formed by the boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms and connected by a metal atom, in this case the cobalt.
A traitorous and resilient virus.
HIV protease is a protein of the HIV virus that is essential to the life cycle of the virus.
Without the division of the HIV virus caused by the HIV protease there would be no birth of mature infectious particles of the virus.
If we stop HIV protease, we will also stop the spread of the virus in the patient's body, the researchers explained in a press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In their work published in the journal Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, the scientists describe a series of combinations in which two pairs of cages (see table) are connected by a short organic chain, which is then systematically modified.
A little weaker but more reliable.
The effectiveness of this series of substances on the proteases of HIV has been tested in test specimens as well as on its resistant variants, obtained from HIV-infected patients.
On the current version of the enzyme, the effect of metallocarbonates is not as strong as on clinical drugs, however, it does not weaken on resistant versions against which common drugs are often ineffective.
Metalocarbonates, with their unique mechanism of action and their other properties such as their biological and chemical stability, their low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical modifications are therefore interesting combinations to examine further to go towards the development of biochemistry-effective drugs against HIV.
The ODS takes over from Fischer, who defends himself against the budget.
The President of the ODS (Democratic Civic Party), Mirek Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek, called the budget approved for the following year a "spoiler" and said the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should question its existence.
The Prime Minister called the ODS statement a drastic verdict.
He says it takes time to analyze.
ODS spokesperson Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as said that the idea of an administrative cabinet supported by the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, ODS and the Green Party was clearly no longer working.
According to Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as, the head of government should decide whether to rely in the House of Representatives on the minority who is concerned with combating the growing deficit, or whether he is concerned to remain in office with the help of the parliamentary left.
Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as warned that the positions of the ODS and the social democrats in relation to the problem of public deficits are diametrically opposed.
The House of Representatives on Wednesday ratified the budget for 2010, however, with proposals for amendments of 12 billion kroner included by the left.
The House increased money for the salaries of civil servants, the functioning of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government's grievance over the proposals of the Social Democrats was that they indirectly increased the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic is expected to manage a deficit of SEK 163 billion.
The SDS left the room before the vote, thus obeying the government's wish that an amended budget is a less bad variant than an interim budget.
Disappointment and uselessness
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and a sense of uselessness, Prime Minister Jan Fischer said that the government will continue to reflect on the current situation.
Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as is convinced that if Janota threatened to leave office in the event of the ratification of the proposed amendments, the situation could be different.
According to Czech Television, Janota made an appointment Monday with the Prime Minister after his transition to the government:
At the same time, he indicated that he was wondering if he would remain in office.
His disappointment with the negotiations around the budget is the reason.
If Fischer decides to continue fighting the budget deficit, Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as believes that the representatives of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, who imposed the budget changes, do not have their place in the government.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will resign if the House ratifies other laws increasing the deficit, such as those affecting health insurance, pensions, or reform of the Services Act.
Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek: Ministers appointed by the ODS are not in question.
This is the case of the leader of the Fischer government and the entire government.
Ministers appointed by the ODS have done nothing harmful, Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek stressed in a textual communiqué from the United States.
He recalled that the deputy ministers of some ministries were complaining about TOP 09, which voted against the budget.
Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as stressed that if Fischer decides to resign in the face of a fight against the amount of the government deficit, "it is quite logical and correct that it is based on the left-wing majority who is currently in the House."
That said, he should not expect the support and tolerance of the Democrats.
I have not thought about it and once it is on the agenda then I will devote myself to it,” Defense Minister Martin Bart<0xC3><0xA1>k, elected to the government by the Democrats, told reporters from the House.
Prime Minister Fischer flew in the afternoon for a debate at the European Council in Brussels.
The ODS has stepped back at the Prime Minister's request.
Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as also stressed that the SDS would probably have voted against the amended budget on Wednesday if it had not explicitly asked Democratic MPs to allow the budget to vote.
We don't have the feeling of being orphans, we're not small children, he responded to the question of whether the SDS had not been blamed by the party president in the House or in the country during the budget negotiation.
I did not notice that my vote would have failed.
I already knew by the time I gave up my mandate that what would follow in the following months would be a Bolshevikization of the House and the destruction of all that was positive, Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek reacted in person.
According to the new schedules of the <0xC4><0x8C>D there will be fewer trains for the same rates.
The Czech Railways will remove or limit from 13 December some less-loaded express or regional trains and will instead reinforce some others.
The total transport coverage will be reduced by two per cent on the day the new schedules come into force compared to today.
Most tariffs will not change, including the basic rates and the discounted rate.
For example, it is the inhabitants of the Ostrava region who will have more connections to the capital, the Railways will add a pendolino ram.
On the contrary, an express will stop serving Bratislava.
There will also be fewer high-speed trains on the line Prague - P<0xC3><0xAD>sek - <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice, the direct line Prague - Letohrad will be radically reduced.
At the regional level, the largest decrease in transport concerns the Hradec Kr<0xC3><0xA1>lové region by eight per cent in total, while Prague and its surroundings can enjoy an increase.
Two night trains on the Prague - T<0xC3><0xA1>bor - <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice line are also cancelled and the circulation of some express trains on the Prague - P<0xC3><0xAD>sek - <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice line will be reduced to just a few days in the week.
Among the biggest transformations, we can see the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague: for now the inhabitants of Milovice have to change to Lys<0xC3><0xA1> nad Labem.
This is the fifteenth line of the Esko suburban system, the opening of which is possible thanks to the completion of the electrification of the line between Lys<0xC3><0xA1> nad Labem and Milovice.
The long-distance lines to the capital will have their final destination at Prague’s main railway station (Praha Hlavn<0xC3><0xAD> n<0xC3><0xA1>dra<0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD>).
The <0xC4><0x8C>D will introduce more SC Pendolino lines between Prague and Ostrava and trains to <0xC5><0xA0>umperk/Jesen<0xC3><0xAD>k will leave at two-hour intervals.
Travellers will no longer be able to take the Pendolino to Bratislava from 13 December.
The bill this year for regional railways: an additional 200 million kroner.
The express trains are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport and will be paid to the Railways next year in a total of four billion kroner to settle the visible losses, the same amount as this year. The regional trains will be ordered by the three regions that will be paid for them by a total of eight billion kroner next year.
This year, regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
The Railways have recently signed a contract for ten years, so far the duration was still one year.
The Railways appreciate the system, which also explains that they have not resorted to a price increase for the vast majority of transport tickets.
The changes will only affect <0xC4><0x8C>D Net one-day tickets and eLi<0xC5><0xA1>ka discounted internet tickets.
For travellers without a discount card, the price of <0xC4><0x8C>D Net will increase from 450 to 600 kroner.
The price of eLi<0xC5><0xA1>ka will again depend on the route travelled, while until then it was valid between cities of one region of choice and was at a single rate of 160 kroner.
Philippine rebels still hold more than 50 people, children released
The rebels have kidnapped 75 people in the southern Philippines, including a few elementary school students and their teachers.
It was the AFP agency who informed, but who spoke at the origin of only 65 hostages.
The 17 children were released after eight hours, as well as one of the teachers.
The hostage-taking took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
It is reported that about 19 rebels used the hostages as human shields during an escape from the police.
Local negotiators are now trying to find an agreement for the release of the remaining hostages.
According to the AFP agency, the rebels belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is the armed branch of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AFP agency, police first prosecuted the kidnappers following violence caused by a settlement of accounts between two family clans.
The martial law was declared in the province of Maguindanao in the south of the Philippines because of a recent massacre in which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the November 23 massacre linked to the election of the governor's administration were 30 journalists.
The governor of this southern province of the Philippines was arrested on suspicion of involvement in the massacre, as well as his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of the influential Ampatuan lineage.
The island of Mindanao also includes active Muslim separatists.
They, however, renewed peace talks with the Philippine government on Tuesday.
The history of South Africa concerns everyone, according to Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
Clint Eastwood's new Hollywood film arrives in the U.S. in the coming days, the title is Invictus (the official Czech title is Invictus: Nepora<0xC5><0xBE>en<0xC3><0xBD>), and tells a part of the life of former South African President Nelson Mandela.
The role of the world-famous apartheid fighter came back to Morgan Freeman, who was chosen years ago by Mandela himself to embody it.
The second male role of the legendary South African rugby champion was attributed to Matt Damon.
With the arrival of the film in theaters, the feedback of critics and the audience is heard.
Nelson Mandela
Named Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela, he was born on 18 June 1918 in Mvezu, South Africa.
In 1988 he won the Sakharov Prize for his freedom of mind, and in 1993 he received the Nobel Peace Prize alongside Klerk.
He was President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
The film contains high hopes as it is presented at a time when, on the one hand, South Africa is in full preparation for the World Cup, and on the other hand, because the media is agitated by disturbing news about the increase in power over racial conflicts and non-discrimination among residents.
According to the AP agency, the reactions to the new film are for the time being rather positive in South Africa, despite frequent reservations issued to the main roles where Hollywood stars "pavant".
Morgan Freeman is proud of the film, however, in his own words.
I have dreamed of this role for many years and have prepared myself well.
I have also met Nelson Mandela many times in person to be able to – as they say – recover from his energy, he said at the film’s official premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it’s a good thing if you have the opportunity to remember through the film Mandela’s personality and message.
This is the history of the Republic of South Africa, but it concerns each individual, he added.
Wearing the national rugby team shirt
The film based on the story of the novel by British writer John Carlin the title is freely translated. In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the play that gave his creation to the people depicts the South African human rights defender during his term as president.
Morgan Freeman thus tries during the film to collect two racial groups from a long divided population and like Nelson Mandela in 1995 he entered the South African team's national jersey on the World Cup lawn, which South Africa had then won.
To show up on the jersey lawn, which is considered something sacred in South Africa, Mandela had been long ovationed fourteen years ago mainly by the white public and was recognized by white populations.
Hopefully the football championship will be able to bring people together again in one nation, said rugby player Chester Williams, who in 1995 was the only "black" of the national team.
It remains to be seen whether the tense situation in South Africa will improve.
However, the South African whites are skeptical as he recently confided in an interview for LN Christopher Dawson, a rugby fan who fled to Britain.
The championship starts on June 11, 2010.
A transformer worth tens of millions of crowns in flames in the Louny region
A fire engulfed in the morning a transformer from the <0xC4><0x8C>eps company at the distribution center near the municipality of V<0xC3><0xBD><0xC5><0xA1>kov na Lounsku.
According to Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Marvan, a spokesperson for <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD>’s firefighters, there are six units operating on the fire.
They originally intended to allow the transformer to be consumed, but they revisited their opinion and extinguished the fire with a mixture of water, foam and a special substance.
The cause is a technical defect, an internal short circuit of the transformer.
No one was injured and according to the company's spokesperson Pavla Mand<0xC3><0xA1>tova the incident does not jeopardize the safe operation of the transmission assembly.
The damage is estimated to be a few tens of millions of crowns, the exact figure can be known once the fire is extinguished.
According to Mand<0xC3><0xA1>tova, the destroyed transformer will have to be replaced by a new one.
It adds that in ten years of activity, <0xC4><0x8C>eps has not experienced anything similar and that incidents of this type are isolated.
Electricity supplies have not been interrupted, says <0xC4><0x8C>EZ spokeswoman for North Bohemia Son<0xC4><0x9B> Holingerova Hendrychova, the operation of households, administrations and industries has not been affected by the fire of the processing plant.
A.s. <0xC4><0x8C>eps is the exclusive operator in the Czech territory of transmission sets and power lines of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains, renovates and develops 39 distribution stations with 67 transformers transferring electrical energy from the transport assemblies to the distribution assemblies and line routes with a length of 4339 kilometers.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura will file a complaint for defamation against three <0xC4><0x8C>SSD prefects
Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, owner of Student Agency, will file a complaint today for defamation against three social democratic prefects.
And concretely against Michal Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek of the South Moravian region, against Radko Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nka of the Pardubice region and against the prefect of the Olomouc region Martin Tesa<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura pointed it out in Twenty Minutes of Radio<0xC5><0xBE>urn<0xC3><0xA1>l.
The complaint relates to the company's attempt to operate regional railways in certain regions.
All regions, however, ended up signing long-term contracts with the Czech Railways.
All three attacked us and claim that we were doing the fine-tuning, while we only made an offer for what they wanted themselves.
They claim that we are more expensive than the Czech Railways which is not true because we know the prices of the Czech Railways that were signed last week.
So all we have to do is defend ourselves.
This is in exchange for slanders about the Student Agency company, Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura told Radio<0xC5><0xBE>urn<0xC3><0xA1>l.
He also said there was evidence that no region had acted in accordance with European law.
We are preparing a complaint for this for the European Commission.
Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek considers Mr. Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura’s complaint to be a follow-up to his media show, which serves as a free advertisement for his company and his person.
I am, of course, willing to defend my name and the name of my region and I call on the other prefects to do the same.
I suppose this will be an opportunity to show clearly that it is precisely Mr Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura who manipulates public opinion and uses false and false arguments about regional rail transport, Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek says
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura announced last week that he will invest a few million kroner in an advertisement that will mention the unfavourable actions of the regions.
He told Radio<0xC5><0xBE>urn<0xC3><0xA1>l that he would stop the campaign after Christmas and plan to resume it after the New Year.
He said the campaign will target corruption in the broadest sense.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura began its campaign after the regions agreed to entrust the Czech Railways with the operation of rail links for an order of about 150 billion kroner, without issuing a tender.
According to Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, such a course of action is illegal and contrary to the position of the European Court of Justice.
According to him, his criticism of rail transport in the regions even led to threats from a member of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD in Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura.
The only threat was that if we didn't stop, we could lose our bus licenses.
He presented himself as a member of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, I do not know who he is, but I will not say his name, said Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura today to Radio<0xC5><0xBE>urn<0xC3><0xA1>l.
Pneumococcal vaccination will be free and optional
Pneumococcal vaccination will reverse old habits as early as January.
It will be the first to be free and at the same time optional for families.
Voices are already rising, saying mandatory vaccination would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of free pneumococcal vaccination culminate.
The Pharmaceutical Institute already sets for vaccines the maximum prices that will be paid by the health insurance.
Specialists also see clearly in the vaccination process.
A new vaccination.
Free vaccines for children in August.
Since January, children born last year from August 2 can be vaccinated free of charge against pneumococcal disease.
The condition is that they have not yet been vaccinated.
If you started vaccination last year or earlier, you will have to pay for the following vaccinations yourself.
The first dose of the vaccine should be administered between the 3rd and 5th month of the child.
Last year, a quarter of families voluntarily vaccinated their children against pneumococcal disease.
However, the parents paid 1,600 crowns or more for a dose.
The vaccination of the youngest requires four doses.
Experts estimate that every year health insurance spends 300 to 450,000 kroner on vaccine doses.
However, they save on the medical care that unvaccinated children would need.
So far, the state has spent around 500,000 kroner a year on all vaccinations for children.
The reimbursed vaccination was introduced with the "Janota package".
Pneumococci are the cause of inflammation of the middle ear but also of serious infections including meningitis and blood poisoning.
According to hospital surveys, there are up to 28 deaths of children under 10 years of age caused by pneumococcal infections.
Aside from the Czech Republic, about 40 other countries have introduced the refunded vaccination.
Is Vaccination Compulsory?
There are opinions regarding a possible obligation to vaccinate in the future.
From January, it must be regulated by insurance and optional.
For example, the president of the Nahlas association Rudolf Kalovsk<0xC3><0xBD> indicated that mandatory vaccination would be more positive.
Its association has long promoted vaccination against pneumococcal pneumonia.
At an international conference at which our association participated, the specialists were not really satisfied with the fact that we have an optional vaccination.
It's not ideal.
On the other hand, we are happy that we were able to impose at least this.
I think this is a direction that needs to be followed now, Kalovsk<0xC3><0xBD> said.
But the Ministry of Health does not want to change the process of vaccination against pneumococcal pneumonia.
We are not considering it at all at the moment, his spokesman Vlastimil Sr<0xC5><0xA1>e<0xC5><0x88> said.
The optional vaccination has its drawbacks, say the doctors.
Hana Cabrnochov<0xC3><0xA1>, president of the Specialized Society of Paediatricians, acknowledges that a vaccination based on volunteerism has its flaws.
If all children were vaccinated, one could consider a decrease in vaccination renewals "In the situation where the vaccine costs such an amount I understand the decision making vaccination optional," Cabrnochov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
Experts predict that by next year, more than 80 percent of new parents will have their infants vaccinated.
Pneumococcal vaccination also marks a break because it is the first vaccination of children that is funded by insurance and not by the state.
Cabrnochov<0xC3><0xA1> explains that insurances should release funds for prevention, thus saving on possible future medical care.
Doctors will have to buy their own products.
However, this is related to the concerns of pediatricians, who are concerned with the purchase of vaccines.
The original intention was to have the vaccines purchased by insurance companies, with doctors receiving them in the same way as other state-provided vaccine products.
Some MEPs, however, feared that this would allow insurance companies to "deduct the sums from the health insurance."
Thus, doctors will have to buy the products and wait for insurance to pay them back.
It is estimated that pediatricians will have to invest nearly 40,000 kroner per month in vaccines individually, a significant sum.
It will be far from easy, according to Cabrnochov<0xC3><0xA1>.
The son of an American artist involved in a "Museum flight"
Frank Frazetta's son, a renowned illustrator, was accused of trying to steal paintings worth $20 million (<0xC2><0xA3>12 million) in his father's museum.
In Pennsylvania, police said Alfonso Frank Frazetta had been interrogated while he was loading 90 paintings in his vehicle and trailer.
According to her, Mr. Frazetta and another man used a mechanical excavator to force the entrance to the museum, in the Pocono Mountains area.
Mr. Frazetta Senior, 81, is famous for his drawings of characters such as Conan the Barbarian and Tarzan.
At the time of the incident, the artist was in Florida, the Associated Press (AP) reported.
AP quoted a police official as saying the young Mr. Frazetta may have been motivated by a family dispute.
According to a police statement, Mr. Frazetta Jr, 52, claims to have been authorized by his father to “enter the museum, by any means, to transport the paintings into a storage facility,” the agency reported.
Mr. Frazetta Senior denied having given such authorization, the agency said.
The Labour Party advocates an increase in the budget tax.
Ministers defended the tax increase and spending cuts announced in the pre-budget report, despite criticism from the opposition, businesses and trade unions.
The Tories claimed that Alistair Darling "missed" an opportunity to show that he was serious about reducing the deficit by delaying his decisions until after the election.
The Chancellor also attracted lightning by attacking low wages and average wages.
Its main proposals include a 0.5% increase in Social Security and a 1% ceiling rate on public salaries from 2011 onwards.
The Anger of Social Security
The unions protested that low wages are being penalized by a recession they are not responsible for and warned that "problems" were being announced.
The decline in social security - which will get around <0xC2><0xA3>3 billion a year - has angered the business world, because he says it is a job tax while the goal should be a recovery of the economy.
The increase, reserved for those earning more than <0xC2><0xA3>20,000 per year, will affect approximately 10 million workers.
PRINCIPLE POINTS OF THE PRE-BUDGET REPORT
Social Security will increase by 0.5% again from April 2011
The economy will fall further than 4.75% expected this year
New 50% tax on bankers’ bonuses
The increase in the company’s profit tax for small companies has been abandoned
Discounts on taxes on electric cars and wind turbines
Retirement increase of 2.5%
According to Treasury estimates, a person who earns <0xC2><0xA3>30,000 will lose <0xC2><0xA3>90 per year and a person who earns <0xC2><0xA3>40,000 will lose <0xC2><0xA3>190, while a person who earns <0xC2><0xA3>10,000 per year will earn <0xC2><0xA3>110 more.
Ministers said their goal of halving the deficit by 2013 resulted in "difficult decisions" but insisted that 60% of the additional tax burden would weigh on the top 5% of employees.
Stephen Timms, Secretary of the Treasury, refuted an increase in the tax and stressed that a reduction in spending was a “drop of water in the ocean” from what was needed.
"These figures are important, they will allow us to divide the deficit by two, which will be absolutely essential over the next four years," he told the BBC.
Timms said he was confident and that the growth of the economy would resume at the end of the year.
However, Labour's forecasts for economic growth - which will influence the amount it will borrow and the speed at which the deficit will be filled - were called into question after the Chancellor was forced to revise its first figures.
In his speech, he said the economy would likely fall by 4.75% this year - much worse than the 3.5% decline predicted in April - while the loan would be 3 billion GDP higher than the previous estimate.
"Opportunity Missed"
The Conservatives, who will launch a new campaign warning against the Labour “debt crisis” on Thursday, said the plan to borrow <0xC2><0xA3>789 billion over the next six years was not viable.
Ministers have failed to present a credible plan on how to repay, they added, avoiding “cynically” difficult choices until after the elections – which are due to take place in June 2010.
“They didn’t present anything significant about what they were going to do,” said Philip Hammond, Chief Secretary at the Ghost Cabinet Treasury, “They had the opportunity to do it and they missed it.”
"Important announcements will be made after the election, no matter who wins."
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
The Labour Party insists that schools, hospitals and the police will be protected from further cuts, contrary to Tory’s proposals that would lead to a faster and more significant reduction of the deficit.
But the Lib Dems claimed that the money raised thanks to increased taxes and reduced spending would be used to support next year’s spending and not to reduce the deficit, arguing that the plans were “built on the wind.”
Nick Robinson, the BBC’s political editor, said that the schedule of announcements — such as the inflation increase for certain disability benefits in April, mentioned above — would leave the Chancellor facing accusations of propaganda the following year, the money being simply recovered.
However, the Labour Party insists that additional assistance is provided while people are most in need and that the situation will be reviewed in September 2010.
"Failure of the budget"
Although ministers did not publish expenditure details beyond 2011, economists said it was clear that government spending restrictions would only begin to be felt in the medium term.
The highly respected Institute for Fiscal Studies has stated that the Chancellor's figures will involve substantial reductions in many areas in the future, including potentially transportation, higher education, science and defense.
“The pain is actually only postponed,” said its director, Robert Chote.
“The most important announcements will be made after the election, no matter who wins,” added Roger Bootle, Deloitte’s Accounting Adviser.
"This was a false pre-budget report. Markets are well aware of it."
The FBI investigates the "arrests of Americans in Pakistan"
The FBI is investigating the arrest in Pakistan of five U.S. reporters suspected of extremist links.
The men were arrested in a raid on a house in Sarghoda in eastern Punjab province, the U.S. embassy in Pakistan told the BBC.
The FBI said it was investigating whether it was the same men who were reported missing from their home in the U.S. state of Virginia last month.
The U.S. Department of State said it was also looking for information about these people.
Three of them are presented as being of Pakistani descent, one of Egyptian heritage and the other of Yemeni origin.
If they are U.S. citizens, of course, we would like to know what the charges are against them and under what conditions they are being held," said spokesman Ian Kelly.
Katherine Schweit, a spokeswoman for the FBI, said the agency had been aware of the arrests and was in contact with the families of the missing students.
“We are working with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identity and the nature of their activities there, and whether it is really the students who are being carried away,” she said.
The Pakistani embassy in Washington said the men had been arrested in a house belonging to the uncle of one of them.
She said the house was already under surveillance by the local police and that no charges had yet been brought against the arrested men.
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has declined to comment on the arrests, Reuters reported, but said the United States should “cooperate more with Afghanistan and Pakistan to try to de-root the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit people.”
The five students had been taken missing from their home by their families in northern Virginia at the end of November.
Amnesty International condemns Iranian 'abuses'
In the past 20 years, human rights have been as unrespected as ever, according to Amnesty International’s report.
The report presents "repetitions of violations" by the regime, before and after the presidential election campaign in June.
One man cited in the report claimed he had been beaten and burned with cigarettes. Another said he had been threatened with rape.
Iran has denied previous criticisms of its non-compliance with human rights.
Authorities have claimed that such criticisms are politically motivated.
Thousands of people have been arrested and dozens killed in Iran, after the contested election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad led to the biggest public demonstrations since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Dozens have been sentenced to prison sentences and prosecutors say at least five people have been sentenced to death.
Jon Leyne, a BBC correspondent in Tehran, now in London, claims that at the start of the protests, the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, acknowledged some of the allegations of abuse, ordering the closure of the detention center in Kharizak.
But since then, the authorities have not tolerated any criticism, says our correspondent.
"False Confession"
Amnesty International reported on the case of a 26-year-old computer student, Ebrahim Mehtari, who claimed to have been accused of “working with Facebook networks” and protesting the election results.
"They often hit me in the face," he said.
"I was burned with cigarettes, under my eyes, on my neck, on my head... They threatened to execute me and humiliated me."
After five days, he signed a false confession and was released and left in the street, still in blood and half-conscious, Amnesty said.
In August, the losing candidate, Mehdi Karroubi, claimed that protesters detained after the election were tortured to death in prison and others were raped.
The Iranian authorities denied allegations of rape, but admitted that abuses had taken place.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former detainee who said he had been locked in a container with 75 other people, for more than eight weeks, in a detention center in Kahrizak.
Amnesty has agreed that the Iranian Parliament and the judiciary set up a committee to investigate the post-election riots and the government’s response, but it has stated that the mandate and powers of these bodies are unclear and that the results of the parliamentary committee have not been made public.
The group said at least 90 people had been arrested in the past three weeks in order to prevent further demonstrations.
Ski slopes built in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow has been used to turn the Bristol site into a race track.
The Piste in the Park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders to compete for cash prizes.
At the top of the Brandon Hill Park track, a small climb preceded a 100m long track.
John Hickman, a fourth-year medical student, said the view from the top of the track was beautiful but that it was quite intimidating.
It is a beautiful view, with all the lights of the city sparkling downstairs.
Here are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the country - real talents," he added.
Awards have rewarded the best volts - or figures made on the track.
After the party on Thursday evening the snow will be left to melt.
Always them and us.
Is it possible that Islam is French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Some readers will be attracted by this new book, admirers of the author's latest work, "Why the French do not like the scarf" (2006), an elegant and well-documented study on a problem that has divided and concerned the country for some fifteen years and whose effects are still felt today.
Mr. Bowen’s latest book presents a much wider and more ambitious plot.
A good anthropologist, he not only wants to know what politicians and the media are saying about Islam in France, but what is currently happening in the country.
He spent many months in mosques, schools and institutes that now provide in France what Mr. Bozen calls “Muslim spaces” for the 5m-6m Muslims.
He is very good at listening to and reproducing debates between teachers and students on issues that affect them the most.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or in the city hall (or both)?
Should the evolution and rights of homosexuals be taught to young Muslims?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim?
Can a Muslim use an interest-based banking system to get a loan?
It is these practical problems, he says, that are the daily lot, rather than the political dramas that concern the media.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, all unknown to the general public, except perhaps Tariq Ramadan, an Arab Muslim born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate about how to be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They do not push the debate to the end.
Conservatives do not believe in the idea of a French or European Islam.
Intellectuals and activists interviewed by Mr. Bowen are generally in agreement with their legal counterparts of a purist Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia, which today constitutes a small part of Europe’s Muslims.
Mr Bowen believes that the values of Muslims and the secularism of the French might be compatible.
But a compromise can only be achieved with the efforts of each camp.
He wonders how much French politicians (and the virulent guardian intellectual elite of secularism) are really committed to pluralism.
According to him, Muslims were not spoiled, compared to Catholics, Protestants and Jews who also had to make historic compromises with secular republicanism.
Rather than growing pragmatism, he detects a “closeness of key values.”
After reading this book, one is tempted to say "yes, but not yet."
The darkest view in the world
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other place on the planet.
The ice that composes it is melting at an alarming rate, carrying with it a life that cannot survive elsewhere.
Oil, gas, expeditions and fishing are sailing in new open waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now writers in their wake.
In "On a Thin Layer of Ice", Richard Ellis, writer and illustrator, painted a natural history of the symbol of the great north, the polar bear.
Known for the history and complicated policies of whale fishing, he describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers who proved themselves by hunting the white bear.
The encounter of Admiral Nelson, then a courageous 14-year-old aspiring who had to fight only the tip of his musket, is certainly a myth, but the rest is true.
The young bears, captured while swimming alongside their mother, just killed, were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
At the beginning of the 20th century, a famous show brought together 75 bears at the same time.
Even today, the dimensions of a zoo are still usually one-millionth of the area needed for an adult in freedom. the climate is rarely indicated: a polar bear living in Singapore has turned green due to the algae growing in its thick fur.

Mr. Ellis tells the stories of other writers and historians and often comes back to the threat posed by hunters to the survival of the species.
Although banned in Norway, America and Russia, killings continue in Greenland and Canada where helicopter hunters and Inuit Motoski Indians use powerful assault rifles to hunt their game.
Ironically, it is in the northernmost waters of these two hunting nations that ice will remain the longest.
In his new book, After the Ice, Alun Anderson, a former editor-in-chief of New Scientist, offers a clear and frightening summary of Arctic science and a captivating glimpse into what the future may be there.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmosphericists nor oceanographers can accurately report the speed of change.
It's not a mistake to try.
In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Fridtjof Nansen’s pioneering travels provided the first information on the melting of the ice cap.
The submarines of the Cold War then mapped the changes in relief under this.
Satellite surveillance and probes placed on the icebergs are of great help, but most of the work is done by hardened men, camping in the cold.
Mr. Anderson contemplates the extraordinary and tiny world of the Arctic ice tributary system, formed by the freezing-pressed saltwater nets.
But from the bear mentioned above to the microscopic wonders contained in the ice, everything will be lost with the disappearance of summer ice, expected between 2013 and 2050.
“In a few months, it might be our turn.”
Marines among 6,000 people who deposited crowns on graves in Arlington
19-year-old De'Angello Robinson took a seven-hour bus ride to deposit a single crown on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who made the trip from Camp Johnson to Jacksonville, North Carolina to Arlington National Cemetery to decorate the graves, this day was dedicated to greeting men and women who, one day, were in their place.
“In a few months, from where we will be sent, we risk being in their place,” Robinson said of the fallen soldiers.
If that happens to me, I want someone to do the same for me, which is why I'm just trying to show respect.
He was one of the 6,000 volunteers who gathered Saturday morning to deposit crowns on the veterans' graves, in different sections of the Arlington Ceremony Cemetery.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, owner of Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, launched the memorial and other people decided to decorate several hundred graves in the Arlington Ceremony Cemetery.
Now, to continue an 18-year tradition, Morrill and his wife Karen travel each year, stopping in different cities on their way, to hold commemorations in honor of the military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit association, Wreaths Across America, which aims to promote the event in all other states.
This year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 crowns on the graves of Arlington Cemetery, around the Pentagon, on the tombs of Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, in Battery Park in New York City, and on the memorial site for the victims of United Airlines Flight 93 in Shanyksville, Penn.
For the second year in a row, the Walmart Foundation has donated more than $150,000 to buy and transport the crowns.
Charleen Hunt, 70, of Westminster, said she had made the trip to Arlington in honor of her late husband, a career soldier.
Although her husband was not buried in Arlington, Hunt said that for her, this gesture was a way of thanking those who had sacrificed themselves.
It is a small gesture that civilians can make to support our troops, she said.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Embossed in several layers of warm clothing, the volunteers walked between the lawns and the extensive hills of the cemetery.
Volunteers have chosen ancient graves, dating from World War I and World War II, as well as the Vietnam War, as these are not as often visited as the new graves, the organizers said.
The mood was optimistic, while the children were playing and the couples were holding hands, wearing the fresh pine crowns on the gray graves.
Each round crown had a dark green color, with a small red butterfly knot on top.
Closely, there was silence on Section 60, where most of the war veterans in Iraq and Afghanistan are inundated.
The United Service Organizations donated 1,000 crowns to decorate the section but the dark mood of the current wars filled the area.
Individuals wept without hiding, others prayed, and families and friends supported each other in the cold air.
Some read aloud the names engraved in the stone while others leaned to see the small black and white information cards, plunged into the wet ground for those whose grave had not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many weeping mothers on her son’s grave.
She left Zanesfield, Ohio, and had driven eight hours to gather at the tomb of Marine Sergeant David Shane Spicer, who died in combat in July.
No one should ever forget what makes us free...my son paid for it, she said.
"Long after I'm gone, I want someone to remember him."
U.S. Citizen Arrested by Cuban Authorities
The Cuban government has arrested a U.S. national who distributes mobile phones and laptops in the country, U.S. Department of State services said.
The citizen, who has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc., based in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for clients such as the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
The consular authorities as well as the U.S. Interest Section in Havana are trying to gain access to the detainee who was arrested on December 5.
The exact charges have not been made public, although under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or foreign visitor may be arrested on the pretext of being "dangerous."
All so-called revolutionary activities, including moderate protests and critical writings, carry the risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and speeches are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has a growing community of bloggers, led by Yoani S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez, a popular commentator who often writes about how they are husband and she is followed and harassed by government agents.
S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez has made several requests to leave the country to receive awards but has always been denied permission.
The detention of a U.S. citizen may increase tensions between the Cuban Brotherhood’s Communist government and the Obama administration, which is pursuing a “soft” approach to improving relations with the island.
The announcement of the arrest was first reported by the New York Times on Friday night.
The new U.S. policy insists that the Cuban government take concrete steps, such as liberating political prisoners and creating more space for the opposition, so that the U.S. can do the same.
Mobile phones and laptops are allowed in Cuba, although either new and desired consumer goods in a country or the average salary of an official is $15 per month.
Only this year, the Cuban government granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones; they are mainly used for texting or for a 15-minute conversation that corresponds to a pay day.
On the island, the use of the Internet is extremely limited.
It is available in luxury hotels and for foreign visitors in the country, as well as in some government buildings, such as universities.
Cubans who want to connect often need to communicate their name to the government.
Access to many websites is limited.
The detention of an American in Cuba is rare.
Most of the few Americans incarcerated in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug trafficking, says Gloria Berbena, press secretary at the U.S. Interests Section in Havana.
Berbena said she could not provide further information on the arrest.
Arrest and detention are a big mistake.
An activity that, in any other open society, would be allowed -- to distribute mobile phones free of charge -- is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, Director of the Americas program of the Human Rights Watch group, which recently published a severe report on freedoms in Cuba, called "Firdel's leader for both Fir<0xC3><0xA8>re and Castro's misplaced, even in his installation of Ra'ence."
According to Vivanco, an accused is often arrested, sentenced and imprisoned on the same day.
He said any solution would likely be political and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, as the two countries begin to engage in better dialogue.
Pakistani authorities block plot to send men to Afghanistan <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
On Saturday, Pakistani authorities spotted an organization supposedly preparing a plot to send five men from North Virginia to Afghanistan in order to kill U.S. troops, saying they hoped the case would dismantle an important network of recruiters from terrorists who scour the Internet in search of young men.
Investigators said they were chasing a hidden insurgent personality, known as Saifullah, who invited these men to Pakistan after discovering them when one of them made comments approving the terrorist waves on the YouTube video site on the Internet.
Arriving in Pakistan, these men were led by Saifullah who tried to help them reach the remote region of Pakistan’s tribal belt, home to al-Qaida and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence official who was briefed on the case said on Saturday that Saifullah had failed to convince al-Qaeda commanders that the men were not involved in the CIA’s plot to infiltrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they were isolated for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, away from the forbidden mountains of the north-east becoming a refuge from terrorism.
They were considered infiltrating agents.
That’s why they were rejected, said a representative of the authorities who spoke on condition of anonymity due to the confidential nature of the case.
The representative of the authorities claimed that the men were determined and that they were still trying to obtain the necessary permits to gain entry to al-Qaida camps when they were arrested by Pakistani law enforcement.
The case of these five men -- who remain in Pakistan and are being questioned by the FBI -- emphasizes the crucial role recruiters play in identifying potential and perhaps more important terrorists, in determining who to trust.
Since the September 11, 2001 attacks, the U.S. intelligence services have prioritized infiltrating men into the al-Qaida network.
The recruiters of the organization play the role of barrier guards, refusing entry to those who do not show a serious commitment and those who may turn out to be spies.
According to analysts, potential U.S. recruits are closely studied by al-Qaeda.
But they are also very attractive to the group because of their potential access to U.S. targets and their propaganda value.
However, Evan Kohlmann, an expert at the US-based NEFA Foundation, said that terrorist groups also need to be more and more careful in recent years in choosing the people they accept because U.S. intelligence services have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you’re trying to infiltrate someone into these groups, what better way than following their recruitment model that so many others have already followed?” said Kohlmann.
The model is the one that is increasingly on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of protesters in Copenhagen call for ‘action’ for climate
Tens of thousands of protesters marched on the streets here on Saturday, demanding more climate action from negotiators working in the city’s Bella Convention Center congress palace.
The number of protesters was estimated at 100,000 people, but 25,000 according to police estimates.
This event took place relatively peacefully, although a small number of masked activists lit some explosives near a set of government buildings in the city centre.
On this day when little happened during the UN-sponsored climate talks, thousands of activists marched through the city, deploying banners in English saying “There is no planet B” and one in Spanish, stating “The Earth says she has enough.”
Several celebrities joined the protests, including the top Danish model and photographer, Helena Christensen, who said that traveling to her mother’s home country, Peru, opened her eyes to the tearing problems that the country has to face due to the impact of climate change that is already taking place.
That's one of the reasons I decided to join the big march -- to speak out and call on leaders around the world to make the right, ambitious and committed decisions," she said.
It is not an easy task, but it must be undertaken, it is no longer possible to avoid it.
Police prevented protesters from coming too close to the Bella center and said she had arrested 19 people on the grounds that they were wearing a mask or were in possession of pocket knives.
Police prevented protesters from coming too close to the Bella center and said she had arrested 19 people on the grounds that they were wearing a mask or were in possession of pocket knives.
According to a passerby who asked to remain anonymous due to his involvement in climate talks, activists wearing masks and black clothes lit several explosives near the main Copenhagen canal, which is surrounded by a few ministries.
They were launching them near buildings, he said, adding that these were first rockets, followed by "some big explosions".
Inside the Palais des Congr<0xC3><0xA8>s, people were gathered around television screens to follow the march throughout the afternoon.
But it seems that the protesters have failed to awaken the consciousness of key authorities such as Su Wei, China’s climate representative.
When asked if he thought a demonstration would have a positive impact on international deliberations, he replied in English, “In fact, it’s something I wasn’t aware of.
He then continued in Mandarin, stating, "Since the event is important, I can't hear what's going on outside."
He observed that walking may seem harmful or useful depending on the prospects.
It shows the interest of the general public and the different sectors on the subject of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "you can also say that they disrupt negotiations or that they harm the freedom of others."
The results of the tests reveal persistent differences between the breeds
Last week’s federal report on math results brought good news for Washington D.C. public schools.
Although the District is still far behind leading establishments, the report shows that Grade 4 and Grade 5 (cm1-cm2) are much more advanced in the previous two years than in cities such as Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what emerges from the latest figures in the National Assessment of Educational Progress is the persistent gap between African-American and white outcomes, both locally and nationally.
The average results of white Grade 4 (cm1) children in Washington D.C. have increased from 262 to 270 (on a 500 scale), but those of their African-American classmates have only increased by three points, from 209 to 212.
In fact, the success gap increased from 53 points to 58 points between 2007 and 2009.
The progress of Afro-Americans in Grade 8 (4th) generally remains constant, falling only by one point, from 245 to 244.
The average white result was not included in the test results because the sample was not large enough.
The overall view over a six-year period is no more encouraging.
In 2003, the difference between blacks and whites in Grade 4 (cm1) class, when the District's first NAEP report was published, was 60 points (262 to 202).
Although the results obtained by children in both groups increased during this period, the difference was only reduced to 58 points.
Last week, some defenders in the District expressed concern that the rise celebrated by the Director of Education Group Michelle A. Rhee and the Mayor, Adrian M. Fenty (Democrat) were being driven by white students who were already good elements.
That would mean that we raised the aggregate by considering the elements at the top of the scale, which is problematic and embarrassing," said Jeff Smith, Director of D.C. Voice, a nonprofit group that advocates equality in the District's education.
I don’t jump in joy for one or two points earned, said Kwame R. Brown (Democratic Appearance), a D.C. Council Member and whose daughter is in Grade 4, at Eaton Elementary.
Often critical of Rhee’s management style, Brown said the message of test results is that the city’s middle schools desperately need attention.
Really, you always want to see the positive signs and I respect it.
But what scares us is that we don’t devote enough time and energy to our middle schools.
Rhee said the District should continue to find better ways to meet the needs of students in difficulty.
This fall, for example, some teachers have been trained to use a new reading method, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at elementary and early school students who have not integrated the basics of reading earlier in their school journeys and who are quite late compared to their own.
Every day, the Mathematics program, for Kindergarten (maternal) classes at Grade 6 (6th) focuses on real-life games and experiences, as they were set up in the District by former head Clifford Janey, who must also be credited for the NAEP's latest progress.
I just think we need to keep working to offer better interventions to these under-class students, Rhee said.
Others believe that NAEP results raise the question of whether Rhee can continue to raise overall system outcomes while providing money and resources for less successful schools in order to reduce the gap.
This is a dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, an education trainer at the University of Berkeley in California who studies the results of city tests.
The conventional political solution is to dedicate your resources and management reforms to schools located in Washington’s poorest neighborhoods.
Also, this targeting can have political repercussions that hinder this important program.
But the problem, of course, is that like the other Superintendents of schools, she tries to use the middle class of whites and blacks.
We focus on ensuring the development of a system of good schools.
We need to strengthen our neighborhood schools so that all families, no matter where they come from, can be assured that their children can get an excellent public education.
Janey, now Superintendent of Schools in Newark, said in an interview this week that one of the key elements to reducing the success gap was the duration of traditional public school, now 180 days in the Washington District, to be in competition with Charter schools.
It takes about 200 days to have the strength to change, said Janey, who came to an agreement with his teachers’ union last year to get 185 days, which he considers a “starting point” to get another increase in the next contract.
Making Higher Education a Promise of the Future
The bus stopped at Gettysburg College with a long whistle.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, descends and blinks for a moment at the sight of white columns, brick facades and green lawns.
Graciela's parents had only been able to finish high school, inEl Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a university campus.
Also, while she and other Grade 8 (4th) students from the group explored Gettysburg where tuition is $38,690 per year, her attitude was less that of a new student impressed than enthusiastic.
Graciela said she would like to study medicine, as the guide led them to the entrance of the sciences building, and she said, "I'm going to study."
Youpi, really?" she said thoughtfully, when she was told the low ratio of a law professor to a student.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh to visit children during their three-day discovery journey and now they had fully integrated the message: The question is not whether you are going to university:
The question is where.
Although this question still arises widely for the large number of American children born to Hispanic immigrant parents who left high school where they became parents in adolescence, they are also hundreds of thousands to benefit from university education that will allow them to enter the middle class.
In fact, "a second-generation Hispanic" out of five pursues his high school studies -- a remarkable success considering that so many of their immigrant parents, most of them from Mexico or Central America, have entered the United States without finishing high school.
Their success is important, say the researchers, they open the way to the next generations who will play an important role in the country’s workforce.
Researchers who study battants claim that they have a natural affinity with school and an innate need to succeed.
Many are also those whose parents set high goals for their children and who find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
Mentoring programs also play a very important role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her get to college -- especially if her efforts are regular and long-term.
When you look at children from low-income families with parents who don’t have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, any intervention at any time won’t help them, said Patricia G<0xC3><0xA1>ndara, a researcher at Davis, University of California, who studied them.
We need to think about providing a network of support to these children, from kindergarten to high school.
The federal program that funded the visit to the Universities of Graciela is a good example.
Known as GEAR UP (Prepare You), it provides over $300 million a year to local school systems to organize college preparation programs that begin when students from low-income families are in middle school (college) and continue until the end of the year.
Since 1999, the program has been followed by more than 10 million students, with more than 60 percent entering the university, according to the U.S. Department of Education.
Iraq's Oil Ministry Acquires Agreements with 10 Foreign Oil Companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has managed to attract major oil companies to rebuild its troubled infrastructure during two auctions that ended on Saturday.
The 10 agreements reached by the Iraqi Ministry of Petroleum with foreign oil companies suggest that oil companies from China, Russia and Europe are about to play a major role in the re-establishment of Iraq’s oil industry, invalidated by dozens of years of war.
U.S. companies are split with a stake in only two of the 10 auctioned fields.
Seven U.S. companies had paid to participate in the second auction that began Friday.
The only one who had put up an auction has lost.
Two U.S. companies were awarded contracts for the fields auctioned in June.
The low representation of U.S. oil giants in the opening of the oil sector in Iraq surprised analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors, after six years of war, and instead of U.S. companies, Asian and European companies are opening the way, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, an information site on the Internet.
It will take a long time before another offer is made in Iraq.
Security concerns, corroborated by massive coordinated bombings, and political instability as U.S. military troops retreated, have curbed U.S. oil companies, preventing them from entering Iraq with more force, which has the world's third-largest crude reserves.
U.S. companies were, in some cases, disadvantaged by their rivals, in particular the Chinese and other government-controlled energy companies, whose labor costs were significantly lower and who were more willing to take risks because they did not have to account for shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only U.S. companies to obtain contracts with the Department.
The major US companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have maintained strong ties with the Iraqi Ministry of Oil and provided them with their technical advice, have been handed over empty-handed.
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the two main shareholders in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The state-owned Chinese National Petroleum Corp. has more bidding on contracts than other companies and has split up with significant stakes in contracts for two main fields.
We all know that China is becoming a major economy, as well as a technological power, said Assam Jihad, a spokesman for the Ministry of Petroleum.
We are confident that the Chinese company will be on an equal footing with its competitors and will deliver on its commitments in Iraq.
The companies pre-selected to submit auctions made bids that were then compared to the price per barrel that the department agreed to pay to motivate production above the current levels for each field.
One of the main organizers of al-Qaida was reportedly killed in Pakistan
It appears that a U.S. missile, hitting along the border with Afghanistan, killed one of the organizers of al-Qaeda operations this week, U.S. counter-espionage authorities said Friday.
If the information is confirmed, it would be the second deadly attack on one of the terrorist leaders this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arab men suspected of being killed by a pair of missiles fired in their car on Tuesday near the town of Miran Shah, in North Waziristan province, according to U.S. and Pakistani authorities in the region.
Local authorities said the missiles had been fired by an unmanned aircraft of the type used by the CIA, inside Pakistan's anarchist tribal border.
They were driving a white car, heading towards the Afghan border, when the car was hit, said a member of Pakistani civilian intelligence services, speaking on the phone of Miran Shah.
Representatives of the authority said the suspected local activists rushed on the spot and quickly confiscated what remained of "totally crushed bodies".
It was completely impossible for local authorities to verify the identity of the victims, but the two U.S. anti-terrorist representatives gave unspecified evidence that Somalia was among the dead.
Somali was described as one of al-Qaeda's military organizers who led the group's terrorist operations outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
Its role was to organize plots around the world, said one of the authorities who wanted to keep anonymity, citing the sensitive nature of airstrikes inside Pakistani territory.
Given its central role, this probably included conspiracies of attacks against the United States and Europe.
He followed the strategic instructions of al-Qaida leaders and translated them into action plans for possible terrorist attacks.
A second U.S. official said Somalia had progressed rapidly in the ranks of al-Qaeda and had very good relations with other extremist groups in the region.
It may not be known to the American public, but it does not diminish the threat it poses to us and our allies, the second official representative said.
If his death is confirmed, Somali would be the second major figure of al-Qaeda or the second Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, leader of a faction of militants in the tribal belt, as well as three other operators.
The pace of attacks by CIA drones has decreased since the summer, from about six operations per month to two, according to figures advanced by the Long War Journal, a website moderated by a non-profit group.
This decline may be due to improved tactics from terrorist groups that have progressed to reduce their vulnerability while also ruthlessly killing suspected informants, the website says.
UN Special Envoy to Kabul withdraws
The UN special envoy to Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday he would resign from his post in March, at the end of a tumultuous mandate tainted with allegations of widespread corruption during the U.N.-backed presidential election.
Eid’s departure comes as the Obama administration has decided to send an additional 30,000 troops to Afghanistan.
The U.N. envoy said he supported the increase but expressed concern about the U.S. schedule for a withdrawal of troops that would begin in 18 months and would force other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the development of our security forces in Afghanistan, send the right signal to Afghans and remind them that they can trust the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview in Kabul.
Our commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international officials assisting the political transition in Afghanistan.
The military increase must be copied by civilians, he said.
Eide said he would not resign but would simply respect the commitment he made to his family in March to spend only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to warn the United Nations.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now knows he has time to find a replacement.
I just said it's better to start looking for my replacement, Eide said.
When I came here, there was a two-month gap between my predecessor’s departure and my arrival.
According to U.N. officials, Ban has already started looking for a replacement.
The representatives claim that the name Staffan di Mistura has been cited; it is an Italian-Swiss citizen who recently presided over a UN mission in Baghdad and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who previously led UN peacekeeping operations.
Eid’s reputation in Afghanistan was put to the test after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, accused him in September of favoring President Hamid Karzai during the presidential election and concealing evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide denied these allegations but said that Galbraith's accusations - which was thanked - "have damaged the mission because there is already a good amount of skepticism regarding the international observation of the elections."
Eide said he had proposed the appointment of a civilian representative to coordinate the rescue of U.S. forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged UN officials to allow his successor to hire more personnel from the United States and other Western countries than he is assigned to the mission to Afghanistan, saying that this would give them more confidence in how their money is spent.
Eide expressed frustration at the limits of his powers in Afghanistan, saying the heavy UN recruitment regulations were hindering his ability to bring new talents.
The UN rules are such that I have only been able to recruit one person since May, he said.
It's catastrophic and it can't last.
Gates: Iran must face additional sanctions
Defense Secretary Robert Gates said on Friday that the world’s major powers would soon impose “extra-important sanctions” on Iran because of its inability to engage in talks on nuclear ambitions.
Gates, speaking in front of a group of 300 U.S. troops in northern Iraq during a week-long visit to war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, has de-dramatized the possibility of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There is no good option in Iran, he said, in response to a soldier’s question about the possibility of such a break-up.
One of the things that weighs me the most is that if I have learned something in Iraq over the last six years, it is the unpredictable side inherent in war.
The Obama administration considers a set of sanctions that would target Iran’s military and political elite, but Gates has pointed out that some of these sanctions could also affect Iranians on the street.
He said a “set of motivations and punishments” could be needed to persuade the Iranian government that it would in fact be less safe with nuclear weapons because “its people would suffer enormously” from these sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the administration joined European leaders in a warning that Iran will face "probable" consequences if it does not return its nuclear program to the International Atomic Energy Agency in full compliance with the UN Security Council and its agency.
Iran continues to say that it wants to develop its nuclear experience only for a peaceful purpose.
In the Geneva talks on October 1, he indicated that he would resume the dialogue on the reduction of his nuclear program and agreed to abandon a large part of his storage of enriched uranium, in exchange for fuel desperately needed for a medical research reactor.
The administration has pushed such an agreement, a way to build trust on both sides and save time for negotiations.
Since then, Iran appears to have moved away from attempts at a deal — in part, experts say, because Iranian leadership is divided on whether to engage with the United States or not.
Frankly, in my opinion, Iran's stiffening in the face of some of the international community's proposals for which they had actually agreed at the beginning of October, prompted the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, to join on what they had not envisaged, in terms of additional sanctions, the important ones against Gani.
President Obama set December 31 as a deadline for Iran to respond to the proposals, before turning to other options, including the continuation of what Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called “increased sanctions.”
In a statement Thursday in New York, Iran's mission to the United Nations denounced what it calls "unfounded allegations" by some members of the Security Council on Iran's nuclear activities and said it agreed to long-term "continue to meet the global settlement with the United States and five other major countries."
Gates, who was due to return to Washington late Friday, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki in the morning before taking the plane to the rich Kurdish oil region to meet with troop leaders in Kirkuk, Kurdish and Irbil.
Tensions persist between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq, particularly regarding borders, property rights and income sharing.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential conflict to avoid any delays in U.S. plans to reduce the number of U.S. troops from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also wants to calm the Kurds' concerns about the suspension, US authorities quoted Gates as saying to Massoud Barzani, President of the Kurdistan Regional Government: "We will preserve your security, your prosperity and your autonomy within a unified Iraq."
We will not abandon you.”
In aging China, a change of direction
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters telling them, "Mother Earth is too tired to accommodate more children" and "An extra baby is an extra grave".
They learned the lesson so well that the authorities of the Shanghai Government, alarmed by the insufficient birth rate of their city and the aging population, radically changed direction this summer and began to encourage young couples to have more than one child; their reaction was never immediate.
We have already given all of our time and energy to one child.
We have no second left, said Wang, 31, Director of Human Resources and who has an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the single-child policy in China, creating two generations of notoriously unique children with good cheeks and wrinkles, dubbed the "little emperors", a population crisis threatens the country.
According to the United Nations, the average birth rate dropped from 1.8 children per couple compared to six when the policy was implemented.
The distribution of the population, while the number of residents aged 60 and over is projected to explode, from 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 percent in 2050, well above the global average of about 20 percent.
This imbalance is even worse in rich coastal cities with a highly educated population, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and over accounted for nearly 22 percent of the population of registered residents in Shanghai, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission, said that fertile couples should have babies in order to “help reduce the proportion of the aging population and prevent a shortage of labor.”
Shanghai is about to become "as old - but not as rich, however - as developed countries such as Japan and Sweden," she said.
Progressive Attenuation
Written in the country's constitution in 1978, China's single-child policy is, to date, without a doubt, the most controversial obligation introduced by the communist government.
Couples who violate this policy may have to pay colossal fines -- up to three times their annual income -- and be discriminated against in the workplace.
The Chinese authorities have assigned to the police the duty to help the country avoid a dangerous trend for its natural resources, while human rights lawyers have denounced abuses in the implementation of this policy.
In rural areas, some authorities have forced pregnant women of a second child to have an abortion.
In addition, many couples have resorted to selective abortions leading to an abnormally high boy-girl ratio.
In recent years, the responsible authorities of the population have gradually softened their position on the single-child policy.
In 2004, they granted more exceptions to the rule -- including for city dwellers, members of ethnic minorities and cases where men and women are already single children -- and in 2007, they softened many of their hard slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute of Population Research at the University of Beijing, said central government authorities have recently discussed even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the partners is a single child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage births.
In no time, posters encouraging families to have only one child have been replaced by copies of regulations detailing who is entitled to have a second child and how to apply for permission.
The city’s government has sent family planning officials and volunteers to meet couples at their home, and drag prospects under their door.
He also promised to provide psychological and financial advice to those who would like to have more than one child.
According to the family planning official, the response was disappointing.
Disappointing response
While officials in a rural city in the suburbs of Shanghai say they have seen an increase in requests for records of couples wanting a second child after the campaign’s launch, the more urban district reported there was no change.
The municipality of Huinan, with a population of 115,000, for example, still receives only four to five applications per month.
Shanghai officials, disappointed, say that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city, in 2010, is still expected to be only about 165,000 -- slightly higher than 2009 but lower than 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee in Shanghai’s Caolu municipality, said financial considerations are probably the main reason many people don’t want to have more children.
They want to feed their first child, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they would love to have two children and that they are legally allowed to do so.
But like many Chinese, they only have the minimum health insurance and life insurance given by the government.
Without social protection, they say, the decision would be irresponsible.
Westerners mistakenly consider single-child policy to be a matter of rights, said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant from the couple's first child.
It's true, we're robbed of the chance to have more than one child.
But the problem is not just the law.
It's the money.
Other couples cited psychological reasons to explain their hesitancy.
Wang, Head of Human Resources, said she only wanted a single child because she was one of them. "We were the center of the family and we used to have everyone take care of us."
We’re not used to taking care of someone else and we really don’t want to take care of others.”
Chen Zijian, 42 years old and owner of a translation company, says it most credibly.
For couples working for two, middle class, who lower the birth rate, he says, you have to be selfish in order to succeed.
People in their 20s or 30s grew up watching their parents fight in the early days of capitalist China and don’t want to have that lifestyle themselves, he says.
Even a single child requires a lot of time from his parents, he says.
A mother must give up at least two years of her social life.
Then there are the space issues -- "You need to change your apartment" -- and the planning -- "When your child is only 9 months old, you need to write his CV to get a place in the best kindergarten."
Most of her friends are ready for this experience once, Chen says, but not two.
Our generation is the first to benefit from a higher standard of living, he says.
We don’t want to make too many sacrifices.
The United Nations group has draft plans for the reduction of emissions
The UN-sponsored climate conference -- characterized so far by disorganized assignments and mutual recriminations -- came back under the spotlight on Friday, due to the publication of a document highlighting the ambitious reductions in industrial greenhouse gases over the next 40 years.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, underscored the remaining obstacles, as it clarified the way forward.
But it has been seen as a major breakthrough in time-saving negotiations, with more than 100 leaders from around the world arriving next week in Copenhagen.
Written by a special UN working group, the text does not say how much rich countries would give to the poor to support global warming, both in the long run and in the long run.
And it offers a wide range of options for key issues, including how developed economies and emerging new economies could reduce their carbon production and what would be the upper limit of the global temperature rise that managers would be willing to tolerate.
It gives great flexibility to the process, said John Coequyt, Representative to the Sierra Club in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who wrote six pages of the document, studied a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what UN Executive Secretary-General on climate change, Yvo de Boer, described as “the complete picture.”
It shows the guidelines for a possible agreement in which industrial nations would collectively reduce their emissions by 2020, from 25 to 45 percent compared to 1990 levels, while major developing countries, during the same period, would reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 percent.
Together, countries would reduce emissions by between 50 and 95 percent by 2050.
The European Union also restarted negotiations on Friday, promising to provide $3.6 billion a year over the next three years to help the poorest countries adapt to the impact of climate change -- to withstand floods and droughts or to avoid deforestation.
However, on Friday, the same verbal altercations occurred, which have dominated the negotiations since last week.
Todd Stern, U.S. Representative for Climate Negotiation, has rejected any discussion that obliges industrialized countries to reduce greenhouse gases, in comparison with the voluntary efforts made by major emerging economies, if they were not financed by developed countries.
This change is a signal that the Obama administration is becoming harder on China than the Bush administration was two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without efforts and actions from major developing countries, Stern said, who also regretted that the text does not insist enough to ensure that the cuts could be verified by external observers.
Stern made his remarks an hour after Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister He Yafei said the U.S. chief negotiator, either lacked "good sense" or was "extremely irresponsible" for saying earlier in the week that the U.S. would not financially help China's climate retaliation.
With future economic trajectories of major world powers at stake, flaws have emerged both within the Third World and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current battle is more about saving individual economies than saving the planet, with China and the United States arguing about their respective obligations as the poorer nations insist that the two dozen most influential countries ignore the scientific imperatives to do so.
Ricardo Ulate, a Costa Rican delegate, said it was not surprising that major powers are struggling to find out who should bear the costs of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, even if vulnerable countries had become more aggressive in their attempt to make major emitters accountable for their actions.
It is really a game in which a new economic hegemony is developed, said Ulate, who is also Climate Advisor for Mexico and Central America for International Conservation.
Some of these countries more vulnerable to the impact of climate change have indicated that they will continue to put pressure on a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although most of the main participants say the negotiations will lead to at least a political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States, which has 43 members, drafted a 24-page treaty proposal early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, head of the European Commission’s climate unit, said the action of small island states “put political pressure on the entire political process,” in part because they are now unified and ask emerging economies such as China and India to take action.
The debates became an urgent matter, while delegates focused on the fact that they had to resolve most of the issues before the heads of government came to an agreement.
High-level officials such as the Indian Minister of the Environment, Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese Deputy Minister got off their plane and rushed to the Bella Center building to attend closed-house meetings and subsequent information conferences, in order to be able to make claims to the course.
The true image of the gathering -- where 13,000 people enter and leave the Congress Hall every day -- of guitar-player activists presenting night-time performances in countries that they think are swindling, betrayal, and proposals are written and distributed on paper rather than by email is a real challenge.
The intensity is only increasing: almost all the major ministers are here and no later than Wednesday, 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We are entering the court of the greats,” said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Vice President for Global Policy of Conservation International.
The heavy weights are coming.
In Britain, the first train at 225 km/h will redefine Monday’s syndrome
At 5:13 a.m. on Monday morning, a whistle blow will strike the night to signal the departure of a train that will mark a transport revolution in Britain.
The country’s first high-speed suburban train will reach 225 km/h, while it will run from Ashford, Kent, to London St Pancras, covering 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Minister of Transport, will be joined by Lady Kelly Holmes aboard the first Javelin suburban train outside London.
He hopes that the new service will enable Britain to integrate an international network of fast and reliable trains and connect the major conurbations of the Midlands, the North and Scotland to London.
Lost small holes will become thriving suburban cities, business travel times will be much shorter, and the passage of the plane and car to the train will reduce national carbon emissions while reducing traffic jams on the roads.
In theory, the three main political parties adhere to this project.
But the ten billion pounds needed to build a new rail network, the inevitable battle of planning and fears of environmental hazards are likely to curb British high-speed lines.
According to The Times, High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to produce a feasibility report for the government, will return its document to Lord Adonis on December 30.
This will allow it to obtain a detailed map of the itinerary of the next planned step for the high-speed network.
The new line linking London to the West Midlands will be drawn within five metres of the urban area and sites where the impact on the environment could be controversial.
In the countryside, the plan will be drawn up to 25 meters from the final itinerary.
It is also planned that HS2 presents three options for a larger high-speed network, going north.
Lord Adonis will respond in the spring.
The preferred options are highlighted in a Y configuration for which a high-speed line will go all the way to the West Midlands.
The line will be split into two at or near Birmingham, with one branch going west of the Pennines in Manchester and Scotland and another going northeast, to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line will cross Scotland.
"It looks like it will be the best performance option," said a rail professional.
When completed, the travel time between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first branch, which will not open until 2025, will allow all passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to an hour’s journey currently.
The proposals will allow the train to travel at 400km/h, making the UK's fastest network in the world.
The initial route is designed to allow trains of 400m length and can carry 1,100 people.
Up to 18 trains per hour can operate on the London - Birmingham route.
A terminal that can accommodate 20,000 passengers per hour would be needed.
Given the space constraints, it is expected that an existing station will be expanded to receive the high-speed network.
Rail industry experts say that only St Pancras International or Euston offer this possibility.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he believes the project should be implemented, but longer public consultations and planning procedures mean that a final decision will not be made before a general election.
Even if it launches the machine, the network will have to be built part by part.
Trains will first be required to run off high-speed lines on existing rails north of Birmingham, maintaining travel times between London and Scotland of more than three hours.
This solution seems to be the best way to ensure the passage from planes to trains, constituting a benchmark for the rail revolution.
Taxpayers repay <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 loan for Tory orangery
Alan Duncan, a senior member of the Tory parliament, paid the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year to reimburse the cost of an orangery he built in his home in his constituency.
The party official who was downgraded by David Cameron for complaining that members of parliament were "maintained", increased his loan by <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 to build an oak extension to his second home in Rutland.
He was allowed to pay the additional interest, amounting to hundreds of pounds per month, to the taxpayer.
The authorities of the Commons received the complaints at the time and were not questioned by Sir Thomas Legg, who carries out a check on the expenses of the members.Last night, Mr Duncan said that the complaints could not be "clearer or simpler".
Mr. Duncan, one of the richest members of parliament, owns a two-storey house in a village in his constituency of Rutland - Melton.
The surrounding houses have been sold for almost a million pounds.
The ground floor includes a kitchen, living room and dining room, but the emoluments office says Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year, he added a veranda to the house, describing it in his plans as an orange grove.
Neighbors describe it as a "veranda for pleasure".
Mr. Duncan was not asked to provide an explanation for the increase in borrowing during a recent investigation by the Committee on Privileges and Standards into his provisions on advance borrowing.
The Committee blamed him last month for any allegations of non-compliance, following an investigation into his expenses.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan changed the legal certainty of the <0xC2><0xA3>271,406 loan from his London estate to the house of his constituency that he purchased in 1991, the year before becoming a member of Parliament.
The documents published this week show that Mr. Duncan was claiming approximately <0xC2><0xA3>1,400 per month of borrowing interest until March last year.
In April, its applications increased by more than <0xC2><0xA3>1,800 per month.
The interest rate on Mr. Duncan's RBS loan was not changed at the time, suggesting that all increases were intended to finance the loan of GBP 75,000.
The RBS variable standard interest rate rose from 7.94 percent in December 2007 to 4 percent in March this year, without moving since then.
The latest publication by the Commons authorities shows that Mr. Duncan continued to apply for GBP 1,250 in May.
Duncan lost his position as head of the ghost cabinet in September after a reporter undercover filmed him claiming that members of parliament were to survive "on budget" after the spending scandal.
In fact, it’s now national, you have to live “on budget” and you’re being treated like “m...e”
He said: “I spent my money on my garden and asked for a small part, based on what was right.
I could have asked for more, but I didn’t.”
The member of parliament, a millionaire since his former position as an oil negotiator, began to have to explain his expenses in May, after it appeared that he had asked for thousands of pounds for his garden, before agreeing with the expense office that this "could be considered excessive".
An activist dug a <0xC2><0xA3> shaped hole in Mr Duncan’s lawn to protest after it was revealed he had asked for <0xC2><0xA3>4,000 for three years.
Asked about the loan increase last night, Mr. Duncan said: "It was for major improvements, approved both by the expense office and then by Legg."
He added: “There is no problem with the theft or drafting or using the rules or whatever.
It was quite clear, in the rules, allowed, etc.
It couldn’t be any cleaner or simpler.”
Come and see the calendar of the Advent of Brighton
Brighton’s beach cabins have found a new way to promote the winter months, an interactive Advent calendar.
Beyond, an alternative church group that encourages spiritual exploration through creativity, invited 24 owners to decorate their cabin for each day of December, using as a theme, Christmas songs.
The event began on December 1, while visitors were allowed to visit the last cabin, from 5:30 pm to 6:30 pm, every day, with pasta and hot wine served free of charge.
The Christmas songs chosen so far include "I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and The First Christmas", for which the booth presents the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is an unpaid priest from the Diocese of Chichester and Director of Beyond.
He said: “We want religion to be closer to people in a post-Christian society.
"As a Church, why do we expect people to enter a strange old building? It seems to me that the Church should come closer to people and celebrate in a more captivating way.
“The idea of the beach cabin advent calendar came just after a conversation with a few friends, during a dinner.
Brighton is such a creative and vibrant place and we try to experiment and represent it through spirituality.”
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and around the world for climate change
Tens of thousands of people demonstrated on Saturday to call for an ambitious and binding agreement on the fight against global warming, across the globe and in Copenhagen, where police carried out several hundred interpellations.
At least thirty thousand people, according to police, about one hundred thousand according to the organizers, paraded in the cold in the Danish capital, on the margins of the United Nations Climate Conference, tasked with reaching an agreement by Friday that could enter into force on January 1, 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, the Danish president of the climate conference, the growing mobilization on climate around the world, illustrated by these demonstrations, helped make the "political price" of a failure in Copenhagen very high.
The incidents in the Danish capital came shortly after the start of the march, when a group of 300 protesters, fully dressed in black, broke windows with pavements and hammers, an AFP reporter said.
Anti-rebellion police officers immediately intervened without housekeeping.
In total, the police announced the interpellation of 600 to 700 people, mainly according to them members of the "Black Blocs", these ultra-violent groups that had illustrated themselves at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, in April.
The Climate Justice Action (CJA) coalition, one of the organizers of the protest, denounced the conditions in which hundreds of activists were interpelled "without distinction", stressing that a hundred of them "were still held in the street Saturday night and kept the ex-sit position despite.
Parliament party, the court, rather good child, took over the direction of the Bella Center, site of negotiations.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the building, without trying to enter it.
A scene had been set to welcome the planned speakers, before a candlelight vigil with the participation of the former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu.
The majority of the protesters had come by car and train from major European cities, but many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly in blue sky impervious, had formed a first gathering in the morning in Copenhagen at the call of the Friends of the Earth, who intended to form "blue tides" for "justice for the climate".
Today, we are going down the streets to ask for redress of the ecological debt in favour of the South, said Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino activist of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We cannot continue to say: we have time, said Beninian singer Angelique Kidjo.
There are rivers that dry up in Africa, streams where you can walk like you've never done before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, born in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the alter-globalist movement has moved closer to environmental organizations.
French MEP José Bové, a figure of globalism, explained that he had come to Copenhagen to "link climate justice and social justice": "Today, there is no gap between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world".
The Asia-Pacific region, home to many islands particularly vulnerable to warming, had launched the protests.
Some 50,000 people, according to the organizers, had taken to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, a few hundred people, mostly students, paraded in red, planting bandanas boasting solar energy.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, but also in Canada, gatherings of a few hundred protesters have also been held to call for vigorous action against climate change.
In France, the events organized by the "350" network brought together a few hundred people, including in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
A few dozen people gathered in Geneva.
Separatist Abkhazia has elected its president, Georgia denounces a "fairy"
Abkhazia elected its president on Saturday, just over a year after Moscow recognized Georgia's pro-Russian separatist region, while Tbilisi denounced a "fight".
Some 131,000 people were called to participate in this first election after the August 2008 Russian-Georgian war for control of South Ossetia, another Georgian secessionist territory recognized by Russia.
The polling stations closed at 17:00 GMT.
The participation rate was 58% a few hours before the closure, according to officials from the Abkhaz Electoral Commission.
The first interim results were to be announced on the night of Saturday to Sunday.
The five candidates, including the outgoing president, Sergei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which condemned the holding of the vote.
These elections are a farce.
For his part, the Georgian president, Mikheil Saakashvili, "deplores that Abkhazia has fallen under the total occupation of Russia," said his spokesperson, Manana Manjgaladze.
Apart from Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela recognized the independence of this territory of 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world regards it as part of Georgia illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After separating from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict, which killed several thousand people, Abkhazia seeks to show through this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a step in our new life, our new era as an independent state, said Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian who claimed to have voted for Bagapch.
She was among the voters who went to the polling station at a school in the capital, Soukhoumi, in a beautiful white building with a few palm trees in front of the entrance.
The question of Russian domination is at the heart of the presidential in this region with sumptuous landscapes, on the shores of the Black Sea.
Extensive panels showing Bagapch alongside Russian President and Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and Vladimir Putin are installed everywhere in this small territory of 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, in the west of the country, the head of the district, Beslan Archba, reserved a warm welcome to the Russian officials who came to watch the election.
We, the Abkhaz people, are grateful, he said during a small ceremony, alluding to the support of Moscow, in particular the decision to recognize the independence of Abkhazia.
I hope that your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, said Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian parliament, lifting a glass of vodka.
For its part, the opposition represented in the vote by former vice-president Raoul Khadjimba and two businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticises the agreements concluded with Moscow last year, such as the one ceding to Russia control of Abkhaz railways for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, says he does not support either the current power or the opposition.
A majority of 50% plus one vote is required to win the election.
If no candidate reaches this threshold, a second round must be organized within two weeks.
Climate: events in the world, incidents in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people marched around the world on Saturday to call for an ambitious and binding agreement at the Copenhagen Climate Conference, where police, on the one who lives, have called on nearly 700 people on the margins of an imposing demonstration.
Thirty thousand people, according to police, about one hundred thousand according to the organizers, paraded in the cold afternoon in the Danish capital, which welcomes delegates from 193 countries until December 18, in search of an agreement that should come into force on January 1, 2013.
Parliament’s party, the cortege, a generally good child, took over the direction of the Bella Center, where the negotiations are taking place.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the center, without trying to enter it.
A scene had been set to welcome the planned speakers, before a candlelight vigil with the participation of the former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu.
A few moments after the march, a group of a few hundred demonstrators, fully dressed in black, equipped with bricks and hammers, broke windows, an AFP reporter said.
Anti-rebellion police immediately surrounded them and intervened without a household, throwing several of them to the ground.
The police announced the interpellation of 600 to 700 people, stating that they were mainly members of the "Black Blocs", these ultra-violent groups that had illustrated themselves at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, in April.
At the end of the afternoon, a police officer was injured in the jaw by a pavement and four cars set on fire near a squat in incidents that led to the interpellation of about 20 people, according to police.
We have seen the extremist groups, police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen had warned, as the helicopters of the law enforcement forces were turning in the sky.
The majority of the protesters, who came by car and train from the major cities of Germany, London, Amsterdam and Milan, were of European origin.
But many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly in blue sky impervious, had formed a first gathering in the morning in Copenhagen at the call of the Friends of the Earth, who intended to form "blue tides" for "justice for the climate".
Today, we are going down the streets to ask for redress of the ecological debt in favour of the South, said Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino activist of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.

French MEP José Bové, a figure of globalism, told AFP he had come to Copenhagen to "link climate justice and social justice": "Today, there is no gap between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world".
The organization Oxfam mobilized several personalities, including Danish model Helena Christensen, former UN refugee commissioner Mary Robinson, who was to address the crowd.
The Asia-Pacific region, home to many islands particularly vulnerable to warming, had launched the protests.
Some 50,000 people, according to the organizers, had taken to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, a few hundred people, mostly students, demonstrated, dressed in red and wearing bandanas boasting solar energy in front of the Philippine capital city hall.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, gatherings of a few hundred protesters have also been held to demand action against climate change.
In France, the events organized by the "350" network brought together a few hundred people, including in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
A few dozen people gathered in Geneva.
The geo-history is reinforced by the reform of the general high school, according to Chatel
Minister of National Education Luc Chatel said in an interview to appear in the JDD on Sunday that history and geography were "reinforced" from the reform of the general high school, despite the abolition of their compulsory education in scientific terminal.
From now on, primary students will have every four hours a week and the same program for a shared common culture, Mr. Chatel says.
For the minister, "it is necessary to get out of hypocrisy" because, according to him, "the S chain is no longer a scientific chain" but "in general, it concentrates the best students".
The ES and L chains cannot remain sub-affiliates of the S, he continues, emphasizing: "Neither have I heard many historians and intellectuals be outraged at the absence of the history-geography terminal in the technological high schools."
On Saturday, an Ifop poll published in L'Humanité revealed that nearly seven out of ten (69%) French disapprove of the government’s project to remove compulsory education from the history-geography terminal S. Many intellectuals and teachers have also criticized this suppression, as well as the left and right.
On the other hand, the Minister added that it was "no question" to remove the philosophy of Terminal S.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform of teacher training, while 16 organizations (students and unions) called for a day of mobilization on Tuesday to protest the project, which they said was sacrificing the pedagogical training of future teachers.
In Master 2 (M2), they will pass an eligibility test at the beginning of the year that will focus on their discipline, and then at the end of the year an admission test that will focus on their ability to teach, the minister explained.
They will also take internships during the M2 year and will then be a first year in front of students as interns teachers.
If you add all the internships offered before the competition, you already get more presence in front of the students, or more than 300 hours, he continued.
Finally, the minister says that he will propose "the individual right to education, something that does not exist in national education".
He also reaffirmed the plan to remove the school card "by 2012".
At Normale Sup, Experts Have 15 Minutes to Convince About Climate
Fifteen minutes to talk about the challenges of the Copenhagen Summit: this is the challenge that Jean Jouzel, vice-president of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) invited by the Ulm Street Higher Normal School, took up on Saturday morning.
Jean Jouzel, also Nobel Peace Prize winner, inaugurated the first of the “Ernest” conferences, a day consisting of a chain of expert interventions, fifteen minutes each, filmed and open to the public, noted an AFP journalist.
We wanted to do something that catches people and makes them want to know more, said Edouard Hannezo, 22, one of the organizers of this day, who takes his name from the one given by the pupils to the fish in the school basin.
About 20 speakers were selected from among the experts in their discipline and selected for their charismatic side, he said.
Regarding global warming, “we can talk about hours, but we can also talk about key objectives in a few minutes,” Jean Jouzel, who spoke without notes but using charts, told AFP.
This is part of our role as a scientist, he stressed, hoping that the auditors will hold that "the Copenhagen conference relies on an extremely serious scientific dossier."
Videos taken from these conferences will be posted online on the school’s website from 15 December.
The next day "Ernest" is scheduled in February, followed by others at a two-monthly rate.
Delays in payments: anger of prison guards, planned actions
Prison watchdog unions called for "general mobilization" on Friday to demand the payment of premiums and overtime payouts by the end of the year, which were postponed to January for budgetary reasons.
FO-penitentiaire (2nd supervisory union) has asked staff who will not be in service to protest in front of prisons on Tuesday morning and "block them", to "denounce the theft of their debts".
The CGT-penitentiaire (3rd trade union of the profession) calls on them to "meet in general assemblies in the various prisons for strong mobilization", deeming "shameful and unacceptable" the non-payment in December of "overtime, night premiums, Sundays and public holidays" worked in October.
And the first union of supervisors, the Federal Autonomous Prison Union (UFAP/UNSA), "calls for general mobilization (...) to bring back discontent and anger".
The Penitentiary Administration Directorate and the Department of Justice explain that overtime has greatly increased in 2009 and not all have been budgeted, but ensure that the residuals will be paid in January.
The Chancellery said at the end of the day that Mich<0xC3><0xA8>le Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to the supervisory unions guaranteeing that the payment would be made next month.
I am not ignorant of the efforts made by the staff for the functioning and modernization of our prison system, the Minister of Justice wrote in this letter.
I have asked the prison management to put in place without delay a set of measures to ensure that this situation arising from a poor assessment of the number of additional hours does not recur in the future, adds Ms. Alliot-Marie.
The December pay will therefore be slim, except for executives benefiting from the famous function and objective premiums, the Ufap/Unsa lamented, for whom "budgetary constraints have a good back".
This is a pure scandal, the interregional union FO of Marseille has been outraged, announcing its decision to boycott until a new order "all meetings and calls".
Staff will not come to work on their Sundays and holidays if those of October are not regularized in December, idem for overtime, also threatens FO Rh<0xC3><0xB4>ne-Alpes-Auvergne.
At a time when we are increasing our tasks and missions without increasing our staff, it is more than unfortunate to dare to take on staff money, the CGT-penitentiaire de Bordeaux believes.
According to the trade unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, some being less bad than others.
But anyway the account is not there, noted the Secretary General of the Ufap, Jean-Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Forget.
For Christmas, Obama says to offer "cutter tricks" than those he receives
U.S. President Barack Obama, who is about to spend his first family Christmas at the White House, told the little screen pope Oprah Winfrey that he had a simple rule on gifts: “I give things more cute than the ones I receive.”
As part of a special show that will air Sunday night on ABC, the president and his wife Michelle offer a glimpse of how they plan to celebrate the New Year's Eve celebrations in their new and prestigious home.
Even Bo, the little four-legged companion of the family, will be on the sidelines.
The Santa also loves Bo, said Michelle Obama, stating that the dog would "certainly" have a gift, according to excerpts from the show aired in advance.
And Michelle Obama falsely filed against her husband’s claims about the quality of the gifts he receives: “I certainly didn’t, I offered you nice gifts last year,” she taunted the president.
Absolutely, was he forced to concede before replying humorously by pointing his finger at the First Lady’s pearl necklace: “Who gave you this?”
During this one-hour show, in a relaxed atmosphere, with the famous cheerleader who was a fervent supporter of Barack Obama during the presidential campaign, the president and his wife also remembered their favorite gifts as children.
Barack Obama mentioned a 10-speed bike, but also a basketball that his Kenyan father, whom he rarely saw, offered him at Christmas.
“I remember this time I met my dad coming to see us for Christmas and he gave me a basketball,” he said.
It was not until much later in my life that I realized that it was he who gave me this ball.
The First Lady remembered her side of her dollhouse.
I really didn’t know how to organize a house so I had aligned all the furniture against the wall, rather than arranging it around the fireplace, but I loved this little dollhouse,” Obama said.
Johnny Hallyday re-opened, RTL says he is in an artificial coma
Johnny Hallyday was re-opened in Los Angeles due to major "lesions" after an operation in France, but the situation is "under control" according to his surroundings, while RTL claims the singer was placed in an artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was re-opened in the night from Wednesday to Thursday at the Cedars-Sina<0xC3><0xAF> Hospital in Los Angeles after U.S. doctors had found "injuries resulting from the operation" of the disc hernia suffered in Paris on Nov. 26, reparaté told Paris opée's press service, specifying that these lesions.
The singer's press service, however, wanted to reassure itself that the situation was "under control", while announcing that a new medical bulletin would be communicated no later than 48 hours.
According to RTL, partner of the singer's last tour, Johnny Hallyday was reportedly plunged into an artificial coma to avoid "pain and complications".
It is only in 48 hours that we will have a little more certainty about the patient’s condition when he opens an eye, RTL adds.
Asked by AFP, the press service did not confirm or comment on the information.
RTL also claims that “according to some sources” no drains would have been laid after the first operation in Paris.
The rocker had been operated on at the Parc Monceau International Clinic for this disc hernia.
The intervention, scheduled for several days, had been carried out by neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known physician in the artistic environment.
This one was not available Thursday night to comment on RTL’s information.
Following the operation he performed on Johnny Hallyday, the singer was hospitalized Monday at Cedars-Sina<0xC3><0xAF> Hospital in Los Angeles, for an infection following the operation.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, a close friend of Johnny Hallyday, said on RTL on Thursday that his friend was going through "a bad pass", but made sure he didn't worry about the rocker, who is "a beater".
He had called me just before I left for Los Angeles, and I told him it was bullshit because doing twelve hours of flying after such an operation is not playable, said Eddy Mitchell.
On Wednesday evening, the singer's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, had wanted to reassure himself, stating that Johnny Hallyday "reacted satisfactorily to antibiotics" and that the infection was "infected".
Mr. Camus had also said he had spoken with Laeticia, the singer's wife, and had not noticed any particular concern.
But the singer's health problems have only increased since July when he was hospitalized for nine days following a fall on his yacht.
Two months later, to the general surprise, Johnny Hallyday had revealed he had been operated on with a “small colon cancer” and then a slight infection.
At the end of September, the singer resumed as planned his long "Tour 66", presented as his farewell tour.
But since then, every health issue has been heavily commented. Fans and journalists have noticed the difficulty of the singer moving on stage.
In mid-November, his surroundings even had to deny a new hospitalization.
Euro-2009/small basin: Bousquet's first on its fetish distance
Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, triple medalist at the 2009 World Cup in a large pool, won an international title on Thursday over a distance that he particularly likes, the 50 m free-swimming, at the Euro-2009 in a small pool in Istanbul.
The first day of this competition where combinations are allowed for the last time saw only three world records beaten while waiting for a breakout.
One was improved by the Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto on 200 m 4 swims and the other two by Russia in relay 4x50 m 4 swims.
A pity for Bousquet, who was looking at the world record of the 50 m freestyle, whose mark he holds in a large pool (20.94).
On one of the two queen distances of swimming, the 50 m freestyle, it was the 28-year-old Frenchman who made his debut in 20 sec 53 in a final where ten swimmers took the start against eight usually, a first at the international level.
Bousquet beat Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84) but failed to lower the world record (20.30) as he had envisaged.
We can always dream better and in this case, I had said that if the world record was within my reach, I would try it.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers were dressed in polyurethane suits, which will be banned from January 1.
At the origin of 238 world records since February 2008, these combinations end their epic in Istanbul, which hosted the first in 1999, during the same competition.
The use of the combinations did not serve this time to the German Paul Biedermann, double world champion in the big pool this summer in Rome, world records at the key.
The young swimmer did not manage to lower the mark he holds on 400 m free-swimming (3:32.77) but nevertheless forced himself to sign the second best time of his career (3:34.55), ahead of Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
I didn’t really care about this race.
I knew I couldn’t beat a world record this time, but I managed to defend my title and accomplished my mission.
Lobintsev will be a serious rival in the future, Biedermann explained.
US: Zola’s sarcophagus panel awarded $1.5 million
A Roman sarcophagus panel belonging to French writer Emile Zola was awarded on Thursday for $1.5 million, well above his estimate, the art dealer Sotheby's announced.
This two-metre-long, 63-cm-high front panel, dating from the third century A.D., was estimated to be between $150,000 and $250,000.
The marble "representing four dionysian scenes in a sophisticated architectural setting, surrounded by satires and bacchantes, is a rare piece, there are only four or five in the world," Florent Heintz, vice-president of Soyté and antique art auctions, told AFP on Tuesday.
It was sold out of a hundred lots.
The sale is still underway but this lot is certainly the one on which buyers have bid the most so far, a Sotheby's spokesman, Dan Abernethy, told AFP.
The discovery of the acquisition of this marble by Emile Zola dates back to a few days.
The panel remained almost 300 years in Rome in the famous collection of the Borghese family, then appeared successively to the French actress Cécile Sorel, who had made it an element of her bath in his private Parisian mansion, and to Paul Reynaud, Minister under the Third Republic in France and briefly President of the Council.
There was still a 50-year-old shadow area.
Searching the database of the Louvre, Florent Heintz discovered that this panel was part of an "Emile Zola succession" opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of "Thér<0xC3><0xA8>se Raquin" and the fresco of the "Rougon-Macquart".
Attempt to Abort Zelaya from Honduras to Mexico
Mexico on Thursday considered that conditions were no longer met for the transfer to its territory of the late president of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, who was refused a coup d'état by the government.
At the moment, after a phone conversation in the night with President Zelaya, everything seems to indicate that the possibilities for carrying out this transfer are not gathered, said Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa.
Arriving in El Salvador on Wednesday to bring Mr. Zelaya back, the plane of the Mexican government departed to its place of origin, according to a source from the Directorate-General for Migration.
The putschist government wanted to force Zelaya to "resign" and request political asylum abroad to grant him an exemption.
But the fallen president refused, because he wanted to go to Mexico as the head of state in office as a guest.
The putschist government "has experienced a new failure in wanting me to resign from my office ... they wanted me to resign," Zelaya told Globo radio on Thursday, on which he has often expressed himself since the beginning of the political crisis that has lasted five months in the country of Central America.
I can stay here ten years, here I have my guitar, added playing some accords the fallen president, refugee at the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa for two and a half months.
The Mexican Embassy has submitted a request for non-conduct, but unfortunately we cannot accept it because it does not contain an application for asylum, the interior minister of the putschist government, Oscar Raul Matute, said on Wednesday on Honduran radio HRN.
I do not seek asylum from any country, Manuel Zelaya replied in an interview with Telesur, which is based in Caracas.
A possible departure from Honduras will have to be made as the president of the Honduran people, he had stressed.
Mr Zelaya's departure rumours had mobilized supporters of the fallen president, who came together around the Brazilian embassy, where the military reinforced their headquarters on Wednesday.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim has criticized the position of the coup government.
This demonstrates the marginal nature of this government vis-<0xC3><0xA0>-vis international standards, he said.
Zelaya, who had approached Venezuelan Socialist President Hugo Chavez, had been overthrown on June 28, the day he had organized a popular consultation to prepare for his re-election, against the opinion of the Supreme Court, the army and Congress.
Exiled to Costa Rica, he returned by surprise on 21 September and took refuge in the Embassy of Brazil.
If he succeeds, he will be arrested to respond to the crime of "high treason" accused by the justice, according to the Putschist government.
President Roberto Micheletti managed to hold a presidential election on November 29 to replace Zelaya.
Porfirio Lobo was elected during the controversial vote recognized by the United States but contested by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil.
Three days later, Congress voted massively against Zelaya's return to power until the end of his term on January 27.
Wall Street rising, U.S. trade balance fuels optimism
The New York Stock Exchange ended up rising on Thursday, with U.S. trade balance figures showing the recovery of both the U.S. and its partners: the Dow Jones gained 0.67% and the Nasdaq 0.33%.
According to the final closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced from 68.78 points to 10,405.83 points, and the technology-dominant Nasdaq from 7.13 points to 2,190.06 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500 extended index gave it 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1,102.35 points.
We have good news coming from different parts of the economy, said Lindsey Piegza, of FTN Financial.
But this remains anecdotal, she tempered, saying the market was focused on "half-full glass."
For Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors focused mainly on U.S. trade balance figures, “which show that business is improving in the fourth quarter.”
The U.S. trade deficit declined by 7.6% in October compared to September, to $32.9 billion.
Analysts expected the opposite of a sharpening of the deficit.
Imports as well as exports have increased.
The big news is the growth in trade volumes, especially for exports of goods, which reflects the growth of economies of major U.S. trading partners, said Christopher Cornell, of the research firm Economy.com.
On the other hand, new unemployment enrollments in the United States rose against all expectations last week, reaching 474,000 applications.
But over the past four weeks, the average number of new job seekers “has fallen to the lowest level in a year,” said Scott Marcouiller, of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market is down.
The yield of the 10-year Treasury bond rose to 3.482% from 3.423% on Tuesday night and the 30-year Treasury bond rose to 4.492% from 4.408% on the day before.
Cuba: Hundreds of supporters of power conspire against "Ladies in White"
A few hundred supporters of the Cuban government conspired Thursday on the wives of political detainees gathered in Havana for World Human Rights Day, and prevented another demonstration for which about a dozen dissidents were interpelled.
About 40 "Ladies in White", wives or close to political prisoners, were conspired in the street by supporters of the government of Raul Castro as they marched to the center of the capital to demand the release of political prisoners, an AFP reporter found.
Downstairs the Yankees!, "mercenaries!", "the street belongs to the revolutionaries!", "Long live Fidel and Raul!" were chanting, with the hand raised, the supporters of power to the dissidents.
The latter were escorted by civil servants who came "to ensure their protection".
The day before, a similar demonstration had taken place against the "Ladies in White" in Havana, without any injuries or arrests.
But in the Havana neighborhood of Vedado, about a dozen dissidents who were also preparing to protest on Thursday for International Human Rights Day have been interrogated by civilian police, an AFP reporter said.
Police have forcibly mounted dissidents in civilian vehicles that have been ambushed by government supporters, according to the journalist.
Interpellations of dissidents in similar circumstances generally last only a few hours.
Winners of the 2005 Sakharov Prize of the European Parliament, the "Ladies in White" had organized an unauthorized march to "demand the release of all political prisoners", 200 according to the dissent, said one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband Hector Maceda is serving a 20-year prison sentence.
Maceda is part of a group of 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, 53 of whom remain under lockdown.
The Cuban authorities consider the opponents as “mercenaries” or “agents” to the balance of their declared enemy, the United States.
Rarely, Cuban television reported Thursday’s demonstration of pro-government activists against “counter-revolutionary” activists.
Cuba, led by a single party, the Communist Party, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of violating rights and freedoms, including expression.
Forced man kills octogenarian with knife and injures 5 in Clichy-la-Garenne
An armed man with two knives killed an octogenarian and injured five others in the city centre of Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine), at an hour of influx, late Thursday.
According to the first elements of the investigation, the 28-year-old aggressor allegedly struck with two knives and for indeterminate reasons, an octogenarian, in or in front of a pharmacy on 85 Boulevard Jean-Jaur<0xC3><0xA8>s, has been learned from police sources and from witnesses.
Severely injured, the old man, born in 1929 according to a police union official Alliance, died in the hospital as a result of his injuries.
In or in front of this same pharmacy, he then went to a couple, whose wife was pregnant.
The husband, who was about thirty years old, interposed and was injured.
The first two victims, seriously injured, were admitted to the hospital where the octogenarian succumbed.
The days of the other injured are in danger, with vital organs apparently affected, according to police sources.
The pregnant woman then became ill and was reportedly hospitalized “in a state of shock,” according to a police source.
The armed man, who appeared to be under the grip of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, then fled into the street, still boulevard Jean Jaur<0xC3><0xA8>s.
He would have hurt two passers-by, apparently by chance: a thirty-year-old and a four-year-old, the latter severely.
The scenario was confused in the evening.
He was armed with two butcher knives that he was wearing in the cross behind his back, explained on the spot a head of the Alliance union in the Hauts-de-Seine, Arnaud Pressé.
Several passers-by, including young people, according to testimonies collected by the AFP, tried to control the forcibly.
I saw a guy in his 30s in a green jacket.
Three young men tried to intercept him.
They didn't get there because the guy was costaud, reported Alberto, a waiter at a nearby bar.
A crowd fell on him, including a municipal police officer who broke his wrist, he added.
Still, Boulevard Jean-Jaur<0xC3><0xA8>s, at the height of n<0xC2><0xB0>61, two municipal police officers, including their official, tried to interrogate the armed man and were wounded by hand, according to police sources.
The events took place in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where there are many shops.
Passersby came to tell me that there was an injured person outside.
I went out, I saw a 70-year-old person on the floor, I put him in a safe position, and I saw a very important abdominal wound, told AFP Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist.
Five minutes later, a second person, about thirty, arrived, injured with a knife.
These are the national police officers who arrested the man without IDs.
The Nanterre prosecutor's office seized the investigation from the departmental police department of the Hauts-de-Seine (SDPJ 92).
The man was hospitalized on Thursday night.
He had not yet been heard as part of his watch.
A police source did not rule out that he was in a psychiatric hospital.
According to another police source, it took six police officers to take him to the police station in Clichy where he was taken.
He was "in a state of over-excitement" as "all the forcibles of this species whose forces are doubling under the effect of action".
U.S.: Polanski's lawyer calls for rescindation of prosecutions
The lawyer of the Franco-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski again claimed on Thursday in Los Angeles (California, west of the United States), the abandonment of the lawsuit against his client, currently assigned to a residence in Switzerland for a case of over 30-year-old manslaughter.
Chad Hummel, the director's lawyer for the "Pianist", denounced three judges in California's second district court of appeal for serious procedural errors at the time of the incident in 1977.
I call for the charges to be dropped here and now, Mr. Hummel said, before adding that the conduct of the judge in charge of the case at the time, Laurence Rittenband, “was cold in the back.”
According to him, Judge Rittenband -- who has since died -- would have discussed, before passing his sentence, with a prosecutor who would have told him that Roman Polanski deserved prison -- which is a serious mistrial.
This discussion had been revealed in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski, wanted and desired), by the very mouth of the prosecutor in question, David Wells.
But Mr. Wells finally stated at the end of September that he had " lied" to the author of the documentary.
In the event that the court refused to relinquish the proceedings, Mr. Hummel called for a trial to be held, which would allow him to present the evidence of his argument.
The indictment, for its part, reiterated the argument already developed in the first instance, namely that no abandonment of the charges could be seriously studied until Roman Polanski appeared before the court.
The 76-year-old filmmaker fled the United States in 1978, before his sentence was handed down, for "illegal sexual relations" with a 13-year-old girl.
He has never returned to the United States since.
Los Angeles County Deputy Prosecutor Phyllis Asayama said Roman Polanski "must be there to appear at the hearing."
In this case, do we want to send the message, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other defendants, that it is possible to escape?, asked Ms. Asayama.
According to her, the filmmaker "requests a favor from the court, while disregarding his authority".
One of the three judges -- who now have 90 days to make their decision -- also pointed out "that there were other alternatives to the escape."
Mr. Hummel was not the only one to request the abandonment of the proceedings against Roman Polanski.
The victim’s lawyer, Samantha Geimer, also called for the prosecution to end.
Recalling that her client no longer tolerates being harassed at every turn of the Polanski case, she added: "Nobody in this room can say that the procedure was fair.
Thirty-two years is enough.”
Roman Polanski was arrested on September 26 in Switzerland on U.S. arrest warrant.
After more than two months behind bars, he was assigned to residence in his chalet in Gstaad, pending a possible extradition.
Wall Street ends with no direction, slowed by the rise of the dollar
The New York Stock Exchange ended without direction on Friday, in a market torn between better indicators than expected in the U.S. and the dollar rise: the Dow Jones gained 0.63% but the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the final closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose from 65.67 points to 10,471.50 points, while the technology-dominant Nasdaq dropped 0.55 points to 2,190.31 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500 expanded by 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1,106.41 points.
Honestly, the market is very quiet, said Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains within narrow margins, the volume of exchanges has become very low and I think that will remain the case until the end of the year.
The trend has been supported by the publication of better than expected economic indicators, which "helped to improve market opinion on the robustness of the economic recovery," Charles Schwab's analysts summed up.
In the United States, retail sales rose 1.3% in November for the second month in a row and much more than expected.
U.S. consumer confidence also recovered significantly in December, to 73.4 compared to 67.4 last month, according to the University of Michigan’s preliminary estimate.
The indices, however, have been hampered by a further increase in the dollar, at its highest in two months against the euro, which “pulls down sectors sensitive to the economic situation,” said Owen Fitzpatrick of Deutsche Bank.
Technological values have lost ground.
The bond market is down.
The yield of the 10-year Treasury bond rose to 3.540% from 3.482% on Wednesday night and the 30-year Treasury bond to 4.497% from 4.492% on the day before.
The election of Miss World once again in South Africa
After a month’s journey through South Africa, the 112 Miss World candidates are preparing to cross the last straight line on Saturday to realize their dream: to be elected the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion viewers.
At this great beauty fair held for the second year in a row in the vicinity of Johannesburg, five of them have already won their ticket for the semi-final.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Pearl Beltran Acosta of Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo of Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino of Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma of Canada have been elected Miss Sportive or Miss Top Model during their African stay.
It was a real whirlwind.
Visiting beautiful cities like Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Town was extraordinary.
“I’ve seen so many things and experienced so many things!” exclaims Miss Sierra Leone.
This competition, which is taking place for the ninth time in South Africa, is broadcast live from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, on Saturday from 17:00 (15:00 GMT).
I could not have dreamed of a better country to restore my crown.
This experience was fascinating.
I am happy to have experienced it twice, stresses Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the warmth of the southern summer.
For the young Russian, his second stay in South Africa was marked by many exchanges with the candidates and the rediscovery of "breathing landscapes in this country".
After a month of galas, rehearsals, press meetings and safari, the Misses are now focusing on the competition.
Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to follow in the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, elected in 2000 and presenting to this election, as well as those of Aishwarya Rai in 1994, both of whom became Bollywood stars.
It’s every woman’s dream to be crowned the most beautiful in the world, but it’s not just about appearance.
We are the ambassadors of our countries and I want to go home with the crown, launches Miss India with a wide smile.
According to the organizers, music and dance will score this 59th edition.
Candidates will march in traditional costumes and of course in swimsuits.
The show will be hosted by Chinese TV presenter Angela Chow, former South African beauty queen Michelle McLean and Miss World committee head Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it knows how to welcome the world with warmth and pride that it is hard to match, says Julia Morley, president of Miss World.
The candidates went on a safari like last year, visited the famous township of Soweto, but this time by bike, and tasted the local cuisine.
Exceptionally, they also met with South African President Jacob Zuma, who shook hands with them.
Not common for a head of state, note Miss Sierra Leone.
Their most beautiful memory will undoubtedly remain the draw in Cape Town (south-west) for the June 2010 World Cup, a way for the country to promote the event a little more.
I’ve met people I never thought I could get close to.
I will no doubt return for the 2010 World Cup, excited Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
Johnny Hallyday's news is "very positive," according to his son David
Johnny Hallyday's news is "very positive," his son David assured Friday on his arrival at the Los Angeles airport where he was due to go to his father's bedside hospitalized for several days.
The news is very positive.
He is very strong, it is going very well, David Hallyday told the press on his departure from the plane that was taking him from Paris shortly after 13H00 local (21H00 GMT).
The singer's son, the relaxed air, said he was going "very fast" to the Cedars-Sina<0xC3><0xAF> Hospital in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted Monday for an infection following a herniated operation in Paris on Nov. 26.
"The singer was placed in an artificial coma tonight in Los Angeles for comfort, to prevent him from suffering and to be able to administer his treatment," the ministry said.
Johnny Hallyday had already been placed in an artificial coma by doctors at Cedars-Sina<0xC3><0xAF> Hospital in Los Angeles, where he was admitted Monday for an infection following a hernia operation in Paris on Nov. 26.
The singer had to be re-opened on the night of Wednesday to Thursday due to significant injuries resulting from the operation.
His wife Laeticia went Friday morning to the French high school in Los Angeles where their daughter Jade is educated, to attend a school show, an AFP photographer noted.
The head of orthopaedic and traumatic surgery at the Pitié-Salp<0xC3><0xAA>tri<0xC3><0xA8>re hospital, Yves Catoné, announced that he would visit the singer in Los Angeles on Monday.
The producer violently challenged Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who operated on the singer on November 26 at the International Clinic of the Parc Monceau in Paris.
We were told it was a massacre.
Surgeons in Los Angeles said they were outdone, Mr. Camus said.
I’ve heard of a possible upcoming court procedure, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus said that Johnny Hallyday was “going to Los Angeles much too soon, with the permission of the Parisian surgeon.”
I had this doctor in person online who assured me that there was no problem for this trip and it surprised me, given that I myself had two disc hernias, he added.
Shortly before on RTL, he had indicated that the singer was apparently "partie without drain, with nothing", after his Parisian operation.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the artistic environment.
He had operated on the actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before his death, in a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine where he practiced at the time.
In 2007, he also operated on actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to resorb a hematoma following a cerebral hemorrhage.
But he is also a doctor with a reputation for sulfur, convicted several times by the court, in medical cases, as well as for tax fraud and fraud.
Mr. Olivier Metzner, the lawyer for the Doctors' Order, accused him of being "a scrupulous man" prosecuted "regularly" before the Order Council, and who is "far from being recommended".
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux spoke on Friday through his lawyer, Mr. David Koubbi.
He said that the intervention had “perfectly done well” and that postoperative examinations were “normal”.
The operation "was not hemorrhagic and therefore did not require the laying of a drain," he added.
In any case, the singer's tour, whose health problems have multiplied since this summer, seems to be in parentheses.
Obviously, a resumption of the tour on January 8 (in Amiens, edlr) as planned, it seems very short, Mr. Camus said.
The association UDF raises the tone and sums up the New Centre not to use its logo anymore
The UDF association, controlled by the MoDem of Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrou, responded on Friday to the OPA attempt of the president of the Nouveau Centre, Hervé Morin, on the acronym of the former Giscardian party, insisting that it no longer be used on any support, under penalty of lawsuits.
Hervé Morin has publicly announced his intention to recover the UDF acronym, judging that Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrou did not deserve to defend his political legacy after stretching his hand to the left.
The Minister of Defence, whose party is a partner of the UMP, had also planned to confirm this strategy Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
To support his approach, he received the support of MP Hervé de Charette (formerly UMP passed to NC) who claimed ownership of the UDF brand for being the first to file it in 2004 at the National Institute of Industrial Property.
But on Friday evening, the office of the association UDF, controlled by the friends of Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrou who do not want to be dispossessed, came out of its silence to launch a statement to the minister and the MP, urging them not to use the acronym anymore and to pass on the property to them.
In recent days, you have multiplied the statements that you would propose to your political movement to <0x2B>retake <0x2B> the acronym UDF, writes the association in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the bureau, including Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez du MoDem, as well as Senator Jean Arthuis of the Alliance Centre.
You also thought it good to keep track of your activist material and on the guard page of your site, the name of this movement, the <0x2B>New Center<0x2B>, the slogan <0x2B>Today’s UDF<0x2B>, also noted the signatories of the mail.
As you do not know, you do not have any right to use this acronym, explains the UDF office which maintains the NC to "immediately remove the mention of the name of the UDF from any medium as well as from (its) website".
He also asks Hervé de Charette "to transfer the ownership of (the) trademark to its rightful owners".
If you did not, the courts would be seized to enforce the law and the legitimate rights of the members of the UDF, the signatories warn.
In their letter, they stated that the UDF "is a full-fledged political movement since 1978" and recalled that Mr. Morin and his friends had "made the choice" to leave in 2007 "to create a competitive movement, as others had done in 2002, to create the UMP".
The New Centre therefore, according to them, has no right to use the acronym UDF (Union pour la démocratie fran<0xC3><0xA7>aise).
They also recall that the last congress of the UDF voted in 2007 to join the MoDem for three years and the creation of an office to defend "the material and moral interests" of the formation founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, the office continues, "when he filed the trademark", he was "no longer a member of the UDF for three years", but at the UMP.
He takes scandalously and fraudulently advantage of the absence of filing the UDF acronym to do so on his behalf.
This indelicacy is turning into a crime, they denounce, before ironizing about NC's strategy: "It seems to us that in politics, as in life, it is more worthy to make a name for yourself than to try to get out of anonymity by fraudulently taking a name that is not right."
Liliane Bettencourt case: Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois-Marie Banier will be tried for abuse of weakness
The court in Nanterre on Friday decided to judge the artist Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois-Marie Banier in order to determine whether, as accused by the daughter of billionaire Liliane Bettencourt, he took advantage of a state of weakness of the octogenarian to plunder her part of his fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his photos of stars, will be tried on April 15 and 16, 2010 for abuse of weakness, a crime punishable by a maximum of three years in prison and a fine of 375,000 euros.
This decision means that there will be a trial in this case worthy of a saga about one of the richest families in France, in which mother and daughter tear apart while holding the reins of the L'Oréal cosmetics empire.
But the 15th Correctional Chamber also ordered that a medical expertise of 87-year-old Liliane Bettencourt should be conducted collegiately by three doctors.
L'Oréal's successor and principal shareholder has always refused to undergo such a review, at least not under the conditions proposed by the Nanterre prosecutor's office during the investigation.
The doctors appointed on Friday will have to submit a report by March 10, 2010, stating in particular whether Liliane Bettencourt was in a state of weakness and at what periods.
I think she'll submit to it.
I'm going to talk to him about it," Bettencourt's lawyer, Georges Kiejman, said at the hearing.
For its part, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise Bettencourt-Meyers' lawyer, Mr. Olivier Metzner, welcomed the court's decision.
This is excellent news (...) The expertise will demonstrate that he (Mr. Bannier) manipulated this old lady that we have to protect, he said.
For two years, Liliane Bettencourt’s only daughter has been pursuing criminal charges against Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois-Marie Banier, a photographer and artist, who she accuses of having taken advantage of her mother’s weaknesses for years to obtain a billion euros in donations.
For her part, Liliane Bettencourt has always denied being manipulated by the photographer, whom she considers a longtime friend.
While the court was to examine the admissibility of the lawsuit initiated by Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers, lawyers’ pleas sometimes turned to the large family unpacking on Friday.
For example, Liliane Bettencourt’s lawyer reported three letters sent by her client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to her notary, in which she said she was suspicious of Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise Bettencourt-Meyers’ husband.
In the 2003 letter, Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer: "Could you explain to my daughter that I wrote to Bannier once, twice a day for fifteen years.
Francis, I have never been able to speak to him since his marriage.”
For its part, the Nanterre Prosecutor's Office again held that the complainant was inadmissible to act, especially since a guardian judge has refused to make her request to open a judicial protection procedure for her mother in recent days.
Liliane Bettencourt "has full capacity to act in court, she is not under protection and has no guardian.
No one else has to act in his place," said State Department spokeswoman Marie-Chrsitine Daubigney.
The court finally decided that it would rule once the trial took place on the admissibility of Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers.
A management revolution or the end of economic intelligence?
If nothing changes in the governance of large French companies, our struggle for the development of economic intelligence will have been in vain.
For more than a decade, the attitude of the management of large companies towards their employees has been reminiscent of the position of companies towards consumers before the marketing revolution: it is about having employees adhere to the "values" determined from above as they used to be by products, by imposing it on consumers.
By putting the customer at the heart of the company, the marketing revolution has put the strategies of conquering the markets back in place... although the authoritarian temptation to impose disconnected products from customer preference factors regularly returns!
Demobilization of employees can lead to fatal demoralization.
Suicides in France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only the emerging part of a much more general phenomenon that affects executives in particular.
This demobilization seriously jeopardizes the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, including R&D and, moreover, economic intelligence.
Indeed, the IE "requires from all stakeholders (...) a proactive approach and a forward-looking vision"; it requires a commitment on the part of employees that the revenues of authoritarian management are totally counterproductive.
That is why we are calling for a managerial revolution that would be to put employees at the center of the company’s concerns in the same way as the customer.
The Relative Usefulness of Internal Opinion Surveys
Will internal opinion surveys – such as the questionnaire submitted by Orange to its employees – incite this revolution in management practices?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
- Firstly, because I have been able to see that, in the face of a new situation, any structure finally arrives, after many detours, to do priority... what it has always done. !
Secondly, because authoritarianism—one of the pathologies of power—grows proportionally to the importance of its own failures.
- Finally, because most leaders have a simplistic view of human behavior.
From the major engineering schools, they have a mechanistic interpretation of psychology.
They adopt, by intellectual comfort, the old behaviorist theory, recently reactivated by the U.S. "neurosciences" and widely disseminated, without their knowledge, by the institutes of study and the media.
Thus, suggesting that it is possible to maneuver the " levers" (sic) of executive engagement, a recent Ipsos survey published in Le Figaro.fr reinforces leaders in a position of mechanistic governance, unsuitable for today's world.
Identify and measure mobilization factors
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern companies requires adopting a finalist vision of human behavior.
It consists in integrating, in any reasoning or practice of governance, a fundamental finding: for employees, engagement for the company is only possible if it clearly appears as a way to realize part of their dreams, their ambitions, their projects.
Currently, only the studies derived from the Motifunctional Analysis adopt this concept of employee motivations.
These studies have shown that they judge their business based on a pre-determined doxa that allows them, through their perceived image of the company, to evaluate what it offers them to realize their life projects.
By identifying and measuring these mobilization factors, business leaders can control, anticipate and anticipate their "social performance" and put their human resources management "on-the-spot".
In this way, they create a space for concerted development of robust and effective economic intelligence.
Oslo Speech: ‘Just War’ Worth Praise to Obama’s Right
The U.S. right has welcomed the speech delivered in Oslo on Friday by Barack Obama, satisfied that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize defended the concept of “just war” against U.S. enemies.
The Conservatives, who had brokered the award to Mr. Obama on October 9, this time applauded the presidential speech, as did Sarah Palin, a former vice-presidential candidate in the 2008 election.
I liked what he said, said Ms. Palin, a Republican right wing aegis, in the USA Today newspaper, adding that she herself addressed the theme of “sometimes necessary” war in her recently published memoirs.
War is, of course, the last thing I think Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
We have to stop these terrorists all over the place, she said.
Obama, who inherited the two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, on Thursday used Oslo to justify the use of force, a way to explain his decision to send an additional 30,000 troops to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, said the president had done “very good work” in Oslo.
I found that the speech was really very good, the former Speaker of the House of Representatives, who particularly appreciated the mention of "the existence of evil in the world" in the presidential speech, was congratulated.
In some respects, I found this all-in-one historic speech, said Mr. Gingrich, interviewed on the radio show "The Takeaway".
The former president, considered by some as a possible candidate for the Republican nomination for the 2012 presidential election, said he was delighted to have seen "a left-wing president" reminding members of the Nobel Committee "that they would not be free and could not return a peace prize if the use of force did not exist."
For Michael Gerson, George W. Bush’s former pen reconverted columnist to the Washington Post, Mr. Obama delivered “a very American speech.”
In addition to presenting himself as a "citizen of the world" as "he always does", "he spoke like an American president", reminding Europeans "that they live in a security bubble that they did not create and that they do not do much to preserve it," Gerson said.
Among the few on the right not to be convinced, a Bush-era falcon, former U.N. ambassador John Bolton, called the speech “dumb, ampoule and uninspired” on the National Review Online website.
To the left of the president, Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich was alarmed to see Barack Obama justify the use of force.
When war is enveloped in the notion of justice, the massacre of innocents can easily be justified, he warned.
The centre-left press, however, remained lauded for the president.
The Los Angeles Times, while continuing to think that the Nobel Prize was awarded prematurely to Mr. Obama, called his speech "superproduction" even for a speaker known for his talent.
Oslo’s speech “should serve as a roadmap to guide international decisions against conflict, poverty and oppression,” the California daily said.
Obama "spoke the speech he needed," the New York Times said, judging him as "both dark and uplifting".
Routers: three marathons for a deal that saves Christmas supplies
After three marathon negotiations, the trade unions of the road sector and TLF, the only employer organization to have remained to the end, reached an agreement on Friday night that ends the word of the strike and the threat of Christmas supplies.
At the signing session on Friday evening, the Secretary of State for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, "rejoiced" about this agreement, after several negotiating sessions, which began on Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussions, the negotiators left early Friday morning, hoping to sign the text of the agreement quickly at the end of the morning.
And even if three employer organizations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) had knocked on the door.
But it took still more than six hours for a meeting to start at 11:00 for everyone to agree and for the text to be signed at 18:00.
The conflict "would have been very damaging to businesses" and "there was a fear that it would disrupt the end-of-year celebrations," Bussereau said.
The text foresees an increase in wages of 4% for the lowest wages (in local and regional road transport), and 2.9% for the highest (international transport).
In the hourly rate, for low-wages, "we increase from 8.72 euros to 9.06.
It’s not a big deal, but we’re starting from a great distance,” explained Patrice Clos (FO).
Either way, we are going to order our activists that there are no blockades, no blockades of power centers.
But you can still have some recalcitrants that are not happy, he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of TLF, welcomed "a good deal", although it was "difficult to concede the increases on high wages given the international competition".
According to him, the increases will be in the order of 170 euros per month for the low wages and from 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
This is the common sense agreement and respect for employees, Maxime Dumont (CFDT) said, while Thierry Douine (CFTC) welcomed "a historic agreement".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) called it an "acceptable compromise".
The agreement also provides for a revaluation of travel costs of 3%, and the general status of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will, inter alia, address the issue of a 13th month and a modernization of the collective agreement.
Mr. Bussereau recalled that "a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million reduction in employers' fees" was the subject of a government amendment to the draft amending Finance Act for 2009, voted in the night of Thursday to Friday by the National Assembly.
The government will ask the Senate to vote "in the same terms".
The signing of TLF allows the agreement to apply first to companies that adhere to this organization, and secondly to the entire profession, in case of extension by the Minister of Labour.
It will be done "as soon as possible", Mr. Bussereau assured.
The opposition of employer organizations can only delay the process.
The FNTR has denounced a “dupe market”, as the 100 million euros “were already promised to the sector to offset some of the carbon tax”.
The Secretary of State for Transport has forced us to negotiate urgently, not as a result of a shared analysis, but in order not to discourage the turkey eaters of the next wake-up call, Unostra deplored.
For the other, the agreement risks "excavating the grave of a very large number of SMEs in the sector in the next 12 months".
RER A: disruptions this weekend, dissatisfied unions of the proposals of the RATP
Disturbances on RER A, France’s largest urban public transport line, will continue over the weekend, as a meeting on Friday on the 2nd day of strike between unions and the RATP leadership left them hungry for their demand for premiums.
Saturday and Sunday, for this important weekend of shopping before Christmas, there will be trains only between 10:00 and 20:00, due to one in two trains on the central section (between La Défense and Nation) and one in four trains outside the central section.
Interconnection with the SNCF will be suspended in Nanterre Prefecture, forcing travelers to change trains.
Galeries Lafayette, which expects 200,000 customers every day, is delighted that "RATP is making efforts to serve the department stores".
The RER A crosses west of it is the Parisian agglomeration.
The RATP section runs from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one in two trains ran at peak hours, and almost no trains in hollow hours, as planned.
As on Thursday, there was no hustle on the quays, as the Franciscans organized themselves.
Thus in the early morning, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less frequented than usual, especially due to the absence of college students and high school students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, a 29-year-old engineer, explained that he had risen "one thirty hours earlier, to be sure to arrive on time".
The Saint-Lazare station has not experienced saturation, the SNCF said, which had envisaged a staffing of law enforcement agents and forces.
The RER A operated by the SNCF from or to Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or departed from Saint-Lazare station to reach the metros.
New general assemblies of strikers will be held on Saturday and Sunday, which will examine the results, deemed "mad" by the unions, of a meeting with the management on Friday afternoon.
The RER Director proposes to negotiate a specific protocol for RER A on all aspects, working hours, career progression, etc.
This is not what drivers want, who claim a premium due, according to Thierry Garon (South).
The RATP even puts its premium proposals in parentheses, angered the CGT, stressing that the management "was not ready to solve a problem while in road users and the SNCF it is done".
A new meeting is scheduled on Monday for “a broader review of the conditions of exercise of the profession,” the RATP said.
This also led the unions to say that the company was “joking weekend users.”
In the morning, some 150 drivers had invaded an establishment committee at the headquarters in Paris.
It was then that the management, which had hitherto refused any discussion during the strike, had suggested the meeting "in a matter of appeasement".
The conflict threatens to expand at RER B on Tuesday, following the filing of a notice by UNSA and Independents.
The unions demand a premium of 120 euros (Unsa) to 150 euros of which 30 euros variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, South, Independents) and complain about the deterioration of working conditions on this line to a million daily passengers.
The drivers of RER, all in the second part of the career, touch from 2,200 to 2,700 euros gross as well as 600 to 650 euros of premiums, for shifted schedules, Sundays and public holidays.
Turkish Justice Dissolves Pro-Kurdish Party, Heavy Consequences Decision
The Turkish Constitutional Court on Friday ruled the dissolution of the country’s main pro-Kurdish party, a decision that was immediately followed by demonstrations of anger in the Kurdish community, in the south-east of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision could greatly complicate the task of the government, which has just reached out to the Kurdish community to try to end 25 years of conflict.
The Party for a Democratic Society (DTP) has been dissolved because it had become a “foyer of activities detrimental to the independence of the state and its indivisible unity,” Court President Hasim Kili<0xC3><0xA7> told the press after four days of deliberations.
The decision was taken unanimously by the 11 judges, while a qualified majority of seven votes was required to pronounce the dissolution, Kili<0xC3><0xA7> said, adding that 37 party executives, including its president Ahmet Türk and MP Aysel Tugluk, are banned from political life for a five-year term.
The judge also announced the lifting of the parliamentary immunity granted to Mr. Türk and Ms. Tugluk and the confiscation by the Treasury of the party's assets.
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (out of 550).
Its leaders had warned before the verdict that MPs would leave parliament rather than sit as unlabeled parliamentarians.
The decision follows a procedure launched in 2007 by the Prosecutor of the Court of Cassation Abdurrahman Yal<0xC3><0xA7>inkaya, who accuses the DTP of obeying the "directives" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and many countries.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political showcase of the PKK rebels.
The party, however, says it has “no organic ties” with the PKK but refuses to call it a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The Court’s ruling comes as the government has just reached out to the Kurdish community by proposing a series of measures to strengthen its rights, to try to undermine Kurdish support for the PKK and end the conflict.
DTP leaders had claimed that a dissolution could lead to a rise in tensions in southeastern Anatolia, where many protests against the detention conditions of PKK leader Abdullah <0xC3><0x96>calan have degenerated into clashes with police in recent weeks.
Since the announcement of justice, a thousand demonstrators have gathered in front of the DTP premises in Diyarbakir, the large southeastern city mostly populated by Kurds.
Order forces fired tear-throwing grenades and used water cannons, while protesters launched Molotov cocktails or stones, with fronds.
Hundreds of people also protested in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Mr Türk said that the decision of the Justice Department would "deepen despair".
Turkey cannot resolve this issue (Kurdish, ndlr) by banning a party, he told the press.
The government, formed by a party from the Islamist movement, also deplored the decision.
We are in principle opposed to the closure of the parties.
This does not resolve anything, Energy Minister Taner Yildiz said.
This decision is a total torpedo of the democratic openness launched by the government, commented political analyst Ahmet Insel.
One can, of course, expect a reaction from the PKK, he added.
On Thursday, the PKK claimed an attack that had killed seven soldiers three days earlier in northern Turkey, one of the deadliest in recent months.
The first snows may fall.
What Wolfgang Brauburger wants is a very rigorous winter.
But the head of the road sweeping and sanding service (FES) specifies that this is not to bother citizens.
It is simply so that the agents can test the technique of the vehicles and learn how to master them well.
And according to meteorologists, it could be for this weekend.
More than 300 agents and 120 vehicles are ready to tackle snow and ice.
The EDF follows a very elaborate plan here.
Mr. Brauburger explains that as soon as it starts to snow on the city of Frankfurt and the temperatures drop below zero, large sanding vehicles run 20 main routes (called routes A).
This includes high-traffic streets, major arteries, such as the Neue Weg and the Hanauer Landstraße.
Also included are fire access, public transport routes, pedestrian areas and steep streets such as the Atzelbergstraße.
The FES officers begin their service at three o'clock in the morning.
If necessary, the 1040 kilometers of road must be salted with a well-adhesive road foundation, in a maximum of 3 hours.
This is why the EDF service starts at 3 a.m. “so that the roads are cleared when the daily migration traffic begins”.
Where it becomes more difficult, it is when the snow starts to fall at 7:30 in the morning.
This poses problems, the head of the road sweeping and sanding service told us "because no motorist is willing to let the salting vehicles pass."
Then, if there is no more snow, we take care of access roads and service roads - such as the Rat-Beil-Straße.
Secondary roads and side streets come last.
Mr Brauburger knows well that this always causes some complaints.
At five o'clock in the morning, the EDF pedestrian team set out to prioritize the areas deemed dangerous and the passages.
As far as cycling trails are concerned, ESF services are generally not able to handle them.
Mr Brauburger said that there is a special service in Frankfurt which monitors the condition of the bridges between 10 p.m. and 4:30 p.m.
As the ice forms very quickly on these surfaces, the soldering vehicles intervene as soon as the temperature drops below 2 degrees.
It also happens that the police call this special service in case of need.
The cradle of dinosaurs
The Tawa findae resembled other carnivorous dinosaurs: this biped was about 2 meters long for 1.50 meters high, its hind limbs were powerful, its elongated skull was provided with sharp and curved teeth, its short arms ended with falcon claws and it had a louver.
If this species had lived a few million years later, it would have had nothing exceptional.
But, as Sertling Nesbitt of the University of Texas at Austin and colleagues report in Thursday’s Science magazine, the Tawa hallae is one of the first dinosaurs to have these morphological characteristics.
This animal lived 215 million years ago in New Mexico, which was then part of the emerging land of the supercontinent, the Pangea, and was located towards the equator.
Sertling Nesbitt says that the discovery of the Tawa sheds new light on the evolution of the first dinosaurs.
In fact, he informs us about the ties of kinship, the distribution and the characteristics of these.
It was in 2006 that Sertling Nesbitt undertook excavations with other paleontologists at the Gohst Ranch site in northern New Mexico.
Randall Irmis of the Utah Museum of Natural History and a member of the excavation team tells us that they sometimes find a dozen bones in a day, which is absolutely unique to a sedimentary layer dating back to the Trias.
Scientists quickly realized that some of these bones belonged to a new species.
The excavations have updated the remains of five specimens.
A discovery that confirms the theories about the beginnings of the evolution of dinosaurs.
The researchers named him Tawa after the Hopi Indian word for the sun god.
For Sterling Nesbitt, this is an exceptional discovery: dinosaur fossils from the Trias are extremely rare and are limited to a few incomplete fragments of bones.
Not all experts in palaeontology share this enthusiasm.
For example, Martin Sander of the University of Bonn does not find this discovery to be particularly spectacular, but he specifies that it confirms some theories about the beginnings of the evolution of dinosaurs.
According to the current state of knowledge, dinosaurs appeared on Earth about 230 million years ago.
However, most of the oldest fossils are fragmented and incomplete, making it very difficult to classify all the first dinosaurs.
Experts wonder, among other things, when the Saurians divided themselves into three major groups of evolution: the theropods (carnivores) which include the tyrannosaurus and the velociraptor appeared later and from which descend the birds, the sauropods and the herbaceous part of which the herp, the four-footed to the neck, and those which appear to them.
According to the studies of S. Nesbitt and his colleagues, the Tawa was one of the first theropods.
This species has an interesting relationship of both primitive and developed characteristics, says S. Nesbitt.
The researchers found clues to suggest that the Tawa hallae had small air sacs in its bones at the skull level, as did the birds that are descendants of theropods.
These small air pockets make it easier for birds to breathe compared to mammals.
It seems that in the Tawa hallae, the vertebrae were also partially filled with air.
According to Randall Irmis, the Tawa is one of the oldest theropods with small air bags in its bones.
Since the related lineage of the huge sauropods also had airbags and a lightweight frame, it can be thought that their common ancestor already had this beneficial innovation.
Three successive waves of migration to North America.
Since the earliest known dinosaurs lived in South America, the researchers concluded that the Saurians had appeared there.
Therefore, the three major lines of evolution split and spread from South America to the rest of the world, i.e. all of the emerging lands that formed the Pangaea supercontinent.
This seems to be confirmed by the fact that the team of paleontologists also discovered the remains of two other theropods that are not particularly related to it.
The three species cannot descend from a common ancestor that would have migrated, the researchers say.
Alan Turner of the New York Museum of Natural History and co-author of Science Studies magazine says there would have been at least three waves of migration to North America.
There are, of course, some contradictions.
Martin Sander, a palaeontologist in Bonn, says there is an even older species, the Silesaurus, which lived in present-day Poland and belongs to a group of dinosaurs.
According to him, this could give an erroneous view because there are a large number of dinosaur fossils in South America that have been preserved, while virtually none are found on other continents.
On the other hand, how dinosaurs managed to become the dominant tetrapods of the secondary era when they came from a relatively rare collateral line of the reptile branch remains a mystery today.
At the time of the Trias, dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, such as the ancestors of modern crocodiles and many other saurians.
Towards the end of the Trias, the dinosaurs spread throughout the planet thus favoring the development of many new species while others, who were related to them, disappeared between the Trias and the Jurassic.
Such a success, however, is not eternal.
To explain this transformation, Martin Sander sees two hypotheses.
There may have been a massive extinction that the dinosaurs randomly survived while other reptiles would have disappeared.
Or else, dinosaurs were better suited and so they were able to eliminate competition on the ground.
In any case, such success is not eternal.
150 million years later, the fall of a meteorite favoredthe development of a group of animals that had also developed during the Trias and which since then was in the shadow: it was mammals.
The Solidarity of Vienna in Sao Paulo
The list is long and there are signatories from all over the world.
There are professors from the University of Toronto, the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna or Berkeley in California.
There are those from the University of Naples, Québec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The evacuation of the J.W. Goethe University casino by the police of Frankfurt is making waves all over the planet.
278 professors and teachers from J.W. Goethe University as well as other higher education institutions in Germany, Europe and North and South America express their solidarity with the protest students of the Westend Campus.
In a statement written in German and English ilscondemn the police’s intervention claimed by the university’s Steering Committee.
Last week, the President of the Werner Müller-Estler University evacuated buildings occupied by students and teachers on strike after walls and works of art were smashed with graffiti.
Five students were injured during the evacuation.
The signatories said the degradations did not justify "such violent intervention by the police command against the students and teachers who had organized their own classes."
The evacuation represents an "unacceptable breach" of freedom of research and teaching.
Focusing attention exclusively on acts of vandalism serves only to "delegitimize and criminalize the protest" and tries to make the reasons for the mobilization forget.
The University's Steering Committee thus abstained from the debates which would nevertheless be necessary.
The charge of the course requires that the criminal prosecutions initiated be immediately suspended.
The majority of the occupants did not participate in the degradation.
Legitimation of protests
The youth of the Verdi trade union of the services sector and the German Confederation of Trade Unions (DGB) show solidarity with the students.
The protests are only a legitimate expression of growing concern for our own future, said Alexander Klein, the regional secretary for the youth of the Verdi union.
As for the Minister of Science of the Land of Hesse Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU) , she took action and caused the action undertaken by the President of the University and the police.
We thank the President of the University.
Any occupation and degradation of the sites is totally unacceptable, she told the Wiesbaden Regional Parliament last Thursday on the TV show Aktuelle Stunde.
We understand the meaning of the protests but do not accept vandalism, said CDU member of the regional parliament Peter Beuth.
The parliamentary groups of the SPD opposition, the Greens and the Left (the Left) did not share this view.
The CSU takes the pretext of some painted walls to criminalize the protests, said Janine Wissler of the Left party (Linke)
Instead of thinking about the students’ arguments and demands, they are evacuated.
The Left Party has tabled a motion to the Minister of the Interior to submit a report on the conditions for police intervention.
The new "Silicon Valley"
For a long time it had the reputation of a secret city, forbidden to Western visitors.
Zelenograd, one of the ten districts of Moscow, was, under the Soviet regime, a place of search for secret weapons, under strict supervision.
Today, with its 216,000 inhabitants 37 km from the center of Moscow, the municipality has the reputation of being the Soviet "Silicon Valley".
There are important places of production and research in micro- and nanoelectronics.
Since September 2008, representatives from Zelenograd have established links with Riedberg, the site of the Franco-Frankfurt sciences – with the university institutes and societies of the Innovation Center of Frankfurt (FIZ).
There were reciprocal meetings and last Wednesday representatives from Zelenograd and Riedberg ratified a “Protocol of Close Collaboration”.
The signatories were Deputy Mayor of Moscow Juri Rosljak and Prefect Anatoly Smimov of Zelenograd for the Russian delegation, Edwin Schwarz head of the project section for Frankfurt.
In 2010 representatives of the FIZ and SMEs, whose main focus is scientific research, will go to Zelenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchanges.
This is a long-term scientific exchange.
But also economic relations.
It will allow FIZ companies to enter the expanding Russian market.
On the other hand, Russian scientific companies want to get contracts in Germany.
Zelenograd is the headquarters of famous Soviet research institutes and companies.
It houses the Moscow Institute of Electrotechnics, the major companies Sitronics and Rosssijskaja-Elektronika.
The municipality was founded in 1958 as a "planned socialist city" for arms research.
Zelenograd (literally "Green City") takes its name from the wooded hills at the heart of which the research centers are located.
The S21 project: a brake for Stuttgart
The scale of the Stuttgart 21 project cannot be placed high enough.
For his supporters, it is nothing less than “the new heart of Europe”.
S21 is much more than the sinking of a railway station, more than a colossal construction project that will plunge the heart of the capital of Baden-Württemberg into a desperate chaos of construction for a decade.
Stuttgart 21 was born from the spirit of the 1980s.
The main railway stations, with lanes that ended in the city, had the reputation at the time of being the relics of the 19th-century transport technique that had the effect of brake shovels of modern rail traffic because it took a long time to get the locomotives from the back to the front.
Arrival, short stop, departure – that’s what to do.
This is why the main railway stations must disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And also in Stuttgart: a train station, which is about halfway on the Trans-European Railway between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava, hence the slogan "heart of Europe".
The realization of the S21 project will really begin, although the visions of the 80s are no longer long compatible with reality.
Even the most ambitious planners acknowledged that the cost of burying the station in the respective capitals of Hesse and Bavaria was exorbitant.
In fact, the main line stations no longer really pose entry and exit problems since there are modern, reversible trains with railroads and pilot car at both ends.
However, we are now launching the realization of Stuttgart 21 next to the new route of the inter-city line to Ulm.
Regional and municipal policies have taken it away.
The railway company is on the side because it is the taxpayer who is responsible for the costs of the largest infrastructure project in the Federal Republic and not the public enterprise.
From an urban point of view, this project is reasonably justified.
You get an urban space that – if you believe the graphics of computer-generated planners – will be very greenish.
For the rail transport system, the S21 is detrimental.
The passage station and the extension of the section are designed for a traffic of people to which - and this is typical of the 1980s - huge growth was attributed.
At the time, there was no competition for cheap flights.
Modern traffic policy should first focus on the strengthening of freight traffic because rail transport is much more environmentally friendly than by truck on the road.
But the new route, with its inclinations, is not suitable for freight trains.
The S21, and this is much more serious, indirectly concerns many other railway projects.
For example, six billion euros will be swallowed up in the Swabian project.
That's the official figure.
Experts believe that ten to fifteen billion are more realistic.
One thing is for sure, in the next decade this money will be missing for other junctions and congestion points in the network.
The Ministry of Transport lists sixty major projects in all.
One of the most important is the extension of the section through the Rhine valley of 180 good kilometers.
Since 1987 this line has been built in slow motion.
It would be really urgent to put a lot of pressure on the mushroom here.
But the S21 project has the effect of a braking sabot.
The route of the Rhine Valley is about to become the bottleneck of international goods traffic, and this in the heart of Europe.
The Government is reviewing the judgment on the airport
In the Wiesbaden Regional Parliament, the government of the Land mentioned the possibility of appealing the judgment of the Administrative Court of Hesse concerning the prohibition of night air flights.
Economy Minister Dieter Posch (FDP) announced that the CDU/FDP coalition had commissioned experts to review the judgment of the Administrative Tribunal from a legal point of view, which is a document of more than 400 pages.
The Kassel Tribunal had in a written document justified that the Land should adapt the regulations regarding the prohibition of night flights in the event that the plan for the construction of the northwest runway of Frankfurt Airport would be realized.
The permit to land 17 aircraft between 23:00 and 5:00 in the morning, as envisaged by the Government of the Land, is not compatible with the legal protection of citizens against night air nuisance.
The coalition must have decided by January 4 whether it wants to appeal in cassation against the ruling.
The opposition criticises this deadline and tries to pressure the government representative to bring him/her to appeal to the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
The leader of the SPD parliamentary group Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel invites the CDU and the FDP to return to their promise made before the election, which consisted in banning night flights, otherwise it will be conditioned as a total failure to speak a word.
It’s hard to be allowed to keep his word, Green leader Tarek Al-Wazir said, alluding to the FDP’s electoral slogan “We keep our promises.”
Minister Dieter Posch refutes the accusations of Schäfer-Gümbel, who claims that the state government is still trying to authorize night-time flights using "lawyer and robbery".
It takes time to conduct a specific legal review.
The coalition does not want to make a decision on the basis of a "quick first impression".
The decision must be legally reliable, says Stefan Müller (FDP).
The opposition's interpretation of its statements on the prohibition of night flights is completely erroneous.
U.S. Banks Reimbursing Aid
Large US banks, heavily affected by the crisis, are breaking away from their ties to the state.
The Bank of America announced on Wednesday that it had fully refunded $45 billion (more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30 billion) to the Treasury, corresponding to aid granted under the Tarp bailout plan.
The US television channel CNBC said in a report that Citigroup was also considering reimbursement of the aid received.
Banking institutions thus seek to get rid of the restrictions imposed, which accompanied the acceptance of sums, such as the limitation of bonuses awarded to managers as well as the settlement of higher fees.
The Bank of America launched a capital increase through the sale of securities to investors, which brought it $19 billion in fresh money.
The rest of the sum comes from the bank’s cash registers, which are well stocked thanks to the sale of several branches from other sectors.
Last Wednesday night, Kenneth Lewis, the CEO of the Bank of America, expressed his gratitude to American taxpayers: the capital injection has helped considerably to overcome a difficult period.
The banking institution assumed its capabilities by purchasing investment bank Merrill Lynch at the height of the financial turmoil.
The Citigroup also plans to raise money on the financial markets in order to free itself from state custody.
The U.S. bank could launch a $20 billion capital increase as early as Thursday, CNBC reported citing banking circles.
The Citigroup spokesperson did not want to comment on this information.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had repaid the public funds they had received.
Accelerated election
In the end, however, everything happened faster than expected.
Just two weeks after the release of the current editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender by the Board of Directors of the German chain ZDF, the successor has already been appointed.
The committee wanted to vote last night to make the appointment.
Peter Frey, who runs ZDF’s Berlin-based editorial board, was a favorite.
However, the chain did not wish to confirm - officially - the vote in order not to anticipate the procedure.
However, it seems that there has also been a desire not to harm ZDF Supervisor Markus Schächter further in the event that the proposal is not accepted by the Board of Directors.
Frey, who is Schächter’s candidate, needed the vote of 9 out of 14 members of the Commission.
The result of the vote was not yet known at the conclusion of the drafting of this edition.
Two weeks ago, Schächter had proposed to the Board of Directors to extend Nikolaus Brender's contract for five years, but this had been rejected.
Only seven members of the Council had declared themselves in favour of Brender's re-election and seven others had voted against, and Brender's dismissal by vote was a foreseeable failure for Schächter.
Indeed, the CDU, which is a majority in the Board of Directors, had already let it be heard several weeks before the vote, not wanting to bring Brender back to his post.
It was Roland Koch, the Minister-President of the Land of Hesse who had organized a league against the editor-in-chief.
He had refused to extend the contract of the highly regarded editor-in-chief, citing the fact that the rate of listening to the ZDF's newscasts had fallen under Brender.
This is why protests continued to take place, almost until the vote, fusing the growing political influence exerted on the ZDF.
In the end, there were even 35 public law experts who had meddled in the debate and who felt Koch's way of acting was unconstitutional.
But it will have served no purpose.
Peter Frey: Who is he?
Peter Frey was born on 4 August 1957 in Bingen.
He studied political science, pedagogy and the Romance languages (Spanish).
He then worked at the Südwestfunk (Radio organ of Rhineland-Palatinate) and the Frankfurter Rundschau (German national daily).
In 1983 he became editor of the ZDF first in the news magazine "today-journal" (today's newspaper).
From 1988 to 1990 he was the assistant editor-in-chief of the time; then correspondent to Washington in 1991/92, then and until 1998 he was the head and presenter of the "Morgenmagazines" (the bimonthly news show that was presented on the morning of the day); until 2001 he was responsible for the policy.
After Brender’s misfortune, when he had just been voted Journalist of the Year by Medium Magazine, the Greens announced that they would file a constitutional complaint.
Koch's opponent on the Board of Directors, Rhineland-Palatinate Prime Minister Kurt Beck, said last week that the Länder should transform the ZDF's Intergovernmental Treaty so that the governor's personnel proposals cannot be blocked by a partial political majority.
However, Beck does not intend to request the removal of political figures from the ZDF’s oversight committees.
Peter Frey, Brender's probable successor, had skillfully maneuvered with the Board of Directors by vehemently criticizing the commission in its decision to fire Brender.
Thanks to this evidence of journalistic independence, Schächter was able to propose him for the position of editor-in-chief without losing his face, as well as the Board of Directors could elect him without being suspected of placing a political supporter in the position.
In the arithmetic representations of the parties, Frey is classified as a left-wing liberal.
Great Cleaning in Academic Studies
Partial success for students: after a year of educational strike the Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs of the Länder decide to show more conciliation: at a meeting between the Ministers and delegates of the Conference of Rectors, an agreement was drawn up which stipulated that the conditions of work of the Rectors.
In the future, students should be able to complete their studies.
In particular, they agreed to lighten the weight of the examinations: a single examination must allow the chosen study module to be completed.
In addition, the workload will need to be reconsidered to ensure "realistic and acceptable proportions".
The political authorities and higher education institutions wish to facilitate the recognition of examinations between universities and abroad.
The Länder have also committed themselves to organising more flexible common structural requirements for the Bachelor and Master sectors.
At the regional level, there must be no regulation different from one country to another.
Less Exams
Since the start of the student protests in June last year, the Ministers of Education of the Länder and the Rectors of Universities have consistently spoken the word "studyability".
But for the first time, this expression seems to take on a concrete meaning.
The Board of Accreditation has decided to significantly reduce the number of certain examinations: "Each module should normally be able to be completed by a single examination", read in a thirty-page document on future admissions to the academic cycles.
Reinhold Grimm, Chairman of the Accreditation Board, said that by significantly reducing the burden of examinations, we should be able to stop the slippages, which significantly damaged the studyability.
Moreover, "studyability" should be the decisive criterion for the organization of studies in the future.
The modules as well as the background must be carefully examined to see if we can not avoid this feeling of suffocation that is sometimes felt in the choice of courses.
Hamburg / Berlin - According to the latest RAID knowledge on Kunduz, the opposition believes that Defence Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) is guilty of deliberate deception.
Students should “have the opportunity and the room for manoeuvre needed to enable and foster personal initiative.”
The new regulation will concern access to new academic cycles but will also be adapted to existing cycles.
These cycles need to be "re-accredited" every 5 years, which means, however, that it is only in 2015 that all cycles will have been reviewed.
There are 10 competent accreditation agencies throughout the federal territory that depend on the accreditation boards set up by the Länder.
In October, the Ministers of Education had exerted some pressure on the Länder to weigh on the agencies so that the programmes were not overloaded and the examination regime was not too strict.
In some Länder, universities and specialized higher education institutions have already consulted with their regional ministries to take appropriate action.
To date, Rhineland-Palatinate is the only country that has agreed to provide more resources for the development of the Bologna process.
With these funds, universities must organise tutoring programs to strengthen pedagogical guidance offices as well as examination offices and the international relations service.
The Länder and universities have a budget of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>10 million.
In early 2010, the government wants to table an amendment to the Higher Education Institutions Act in Parliament.
As a result, only one exam will be required to complete his studies.
The organisation of studies will need to be more flexible, and the recognition of grades from other higher education institutions must be ensured, and access to the Master's degree must be simplified.
By the end of next year, the "studyability" of all academic cycles will have to be examined.
Last Thursday, the government and the opposition again debated the question of study conditions in the country.
The decisions were appreciated, but criticisms were heard.
The Federal President of the Union of Socialist Students made it known that he would wish that the organization of education policy would no longer take place in the future "behind the closed doors" of Ministers and university rectors.
At the latest after the educational strike, students as concerned persons should be able to express themselves a little.
Future graduates of higher education received the support of the President of the Delegates of the Conference of Rectors (HRK) Margret Wintermantel: "The experience of the students is very useful to us" she said on Thursday during a meeting with the Ministers of Education of the Länder.
For the Education and Science Union (GEW) the decisions made in Bonn do not go far enough. It demands the law and the possibility for each graduate Bachelor to enroll in a Master's cycle.
Andreas Keller, member of the GEW’s Steering Committee, asks that the Länder assure today’s Bachelor students that tomorrow there will be enough places for Master’s studies and as good study conditions as possible.
The Länder therefore need to hire more course managers.
On the other hand, the Ministers of Education did not mention the possibility of easing access to the Master.
More than a note at the bottom of the page on Herta Müller
It is with these words "Arrived in Germany and it's beautiful, almost more control..." that a work of the poet Werner Söllner begins, in which he thematizes in a few disturbing phrases the experiences of a dissident who arrived in Germany who gained freedom but at the same time lost his territory.
Werner Söllner, born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, was first a German and English teacher in Bucharest and then a collection manager in a publishing house for youth before moving to Frankfurt on the Main.
Söllner received various literary awards; in 1993 he held the highly sought-after chair of poetry at the Goethe University in Frankfurt and since 2002 he is the director of the Hesse Literature Forum at the Mousonturm Artist's House in Frankfurt.
He made a lot of talk about him in non-literary circles last Tuesday, at a congress in Munich, whose theme was "German literature in Romania in the mirror and the distorting mirror of your Securitate files".
Visibly destabilized and embarrassed, Söllner made a statement in which he acknowledged before his fellow German-Romanian writers such as Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer that he had collaborated as an informant for the Securitate political police.
In 1989, Söllner received the German Language Award jointly with some of the participants.
Enrollment trials had insidiously begun in 1971.
I am, concludes Söllner, “so someone who has not been able to resist enough attempts to intimidate the Security.”
The poet Werner Söllner is the informant Walter (IM Walter).
Almost simultaneously with the honoring of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller and her exemplary literary dismantling with the mechanisms of the power of dictatorship, the literary scene is shaken and in particular the community of German authors from Romania, by a policing system on politics, clearly shows the abysses and the bass.
Werner Söllner, as far as we can tell from current knowledge, is not only a culprit but also a victim.
In his own Securitate dossier, IM Walter played a role, according to literature specialist Michael Markel after Söllner's confession and refers to the positive influence of IM Walter who had intervened in his favor.
“He was able to get him out of all the difficult situations at the time,” Markel said.
Markel felt the moral need to make this comment.
The form in which Söllner made his statement and in front of this public was unexpected, but the admission of a former dissident of his collaboration with the Romanian secret services is not, in fact, so surprising.
Germany is a pleasant reserve for Security spies had already written Herta Müller in July in the newspaper Die Zeit, after reading the 914 pages of her own file.
It can be assumed that the victims have made speculations and sometimes guessed which real names were last hidden the names of borrowers Sorin, Voicu and also Walter.
Unlike Germany, where in the meantime the consultation of the Stasi files is a reliable process, the attitude towards the legacy of the Security dossier is still very confusing.
A systematic clarification has been continuously curbed and curbed in the past years.
It was only in 1999 that a national council corresponding to the Birthler institution was created to work on the assimilation of the Archives of the Security (CNSAS) but the restitution of the files has been rather delayed since.
Since 2005, there has been a law that defines the management of archives.
The fact that the influence of former members of the Securitate in Romania is still very large is confirmed by the interview of a former head of the Securitate in Temesvar, who, after the announcement of the award of the Nobel Prize to Herta Müller, expressed himself in a very disdainful manner towards the laureate.
She had a psychosis, and at the end of the day she was questioned only once.
The infamy of power thought it could be expressed here, without any genes, under the guise of freedom of expression.
Certainly, many inescapable questions are associated with the Söllner case as it happens so often in a context of hidden guilt.
Why now? Who has been looted? The weighted reaction of the auditors, Söllner admits, gives hope that the continuation of this chapter will be defined more by a thirst for knowledge than by accusations and a sense of shame.
On the genesis of the work of Herta Müller, who received the Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than a note at the bottom of the page.
Riots in the Champions League
We had the impression that a representative was coming there, drawn with four pins coming straight from a nice Christmas party, on which the sportswear manufacturer had spread his goods when the new coach VFB Christian Gross supplied at midnight rose to less than a quarter in a Mercedes class C, which he had just picked up from his hand.
The man, whose bald head attracted attention, let himself be driven into the city which was still foreign to him.
Otherwise our 50-year-old could have taken the wheel himself – he hadn’t drunk alcohol and he wasn’t happy either.
It was a good night, but we had to get back to work tomorrow.
Because now it was about to begin.
The words of Switzerland that we had just signed three days earlier were clear: "We have reached the eighth final well", that is, in the Champions League thanks to our 3:1 against Unirea Urziceni of Romania "but we must not let ourselves be blinded by success".
The “big work” is waiting for us on Sunday.
There, it is a matter of repeating in Mainz the results of the Champions League on a daily basis.
And we will have to overcome the weaknesses that surfaced after Marica (5.), Träsch (8.) and Pogrebnyak (11.)
Lottery draw
The eighth Champions League final (match go 16./17. <0x2B> 23./24 February/match back 9./10. <0x2B> 16/17. March) will be drawn on December 18 in Nyon.
The joy of the fulminant entry into office of Babbel's successor was therefore moderate.
And the joy was not only moderate in those who had brought luck, who had passed on to the destabilized Stuttgart professionals, a flawless motivation and the pleasure of playing.
I went to see the players and I told them that they should focus on their assets, I advised them to be more courageous, explained the “soul plumbing” – Gross – the recipe for success that sounded so good that it no longer did effects with the caregiver Babbel.
He triggered a certain magic, admits Jens Lehmann - Babbel's supporter - "in football when there is a new pulse it sometimes happens things you would never have thought possible."
And Sami Khedira, who, after weeks of breaks for injury, advanced to the rank of the best player thanks to his dynamism, tried to describe the “phenomenon” observed by a proverbial “fresh wind” and the working method of the new leader: “It’s someone who goes into action and demands discipline.
That’s what we need in the current situation.”
But apparently Babbel had missed it.
VfB Stuttgart has not yet crossed the line, warned manager Horst Heldt
At the moment, VfB Stuttgart mainly needs tenacity.
Just like Gross, players and the manager keep on overestimating the victory against a totally outdated and weakened defense of Romanian guests.
They had also won at Glasgow before having a bad awakening four days later at Leverkusen with 0:4, Khedira objected.
Horst Heldt, the manager, reported that they had achieved one of the goals of the season but that there were others that were still far away.
We have not yet passed the difficult course.
That Heldt on his 40th birthday did not have the heart to party, even after the first home win in three months, is due to the weekend events that a television interview of goalkeeper Jens Lehmann made rebound just before the start of the match.
There are decisions others make and not Jens, Heldt would counter, in response to Lehmann's harsh criticism.
He had accused the leadership of style weakness and said that she had decided to change coach under pressure from pubertal fans.
Lehmann had also judged as a sign of lack of sovereignty and jealousy that his free day after the games had been removed from him.
Lehmann’s statements were “marked by pure selfishness,” Heldt said, announcing consequences for the goalkeeper.
They were no longer at risk of becoming friends for the life of these two quadrangels.
In all the cast, they agreed for everything else, that is, without the previous work of the group by the replaced coach, the strong sporting and combative performance would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants were “to a large extent in success” returning Heldt and Lehmann to the choir – and even the man in the plastic bag acquiesced.
World Heavyweight Championships in Athletics
Warm fighting in Bern: Kevin Johnson the challenger constantly provoked the world champion Vitali Klitschko verbally and gesturing.
But after twelve difficult rounds the Ukrainian defended his title of world heavyweight champion according to the version of the WBC federation.
With the unanimous vote of the judges, he made a point.
Hamburg – Vitali Klitschko retains his title as World Heavyweight Champion.
The WBC federation announced that on Saturday night the 38-year-old champion had won a points victory by unanimous judgement against American Kevin Johnson (120:10).
For the third time Klitschko has been honorably defending his title since his comeback on stage in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian had already twice won the title of World Champion of the WBO and WBC federations.
Unfortunately, he did not succeed in the long-awaited KO.
Klitschko, who won 39 times in 41 professional battles, had to confess twice his defeat due to injuries.
The challenger Johnson had to accept his first defeat in the 24th fight.
In the Arena of Bern, in front of 17,000 spectators, the great Klitschko mainly wanted to dictate the fight, from his height of 2.02 meters, by his left.
Johnson, eleven centimetres smaller who, before the duel, had announced the end of the Klitschko era, managed to avoid the hits of the champion, thus impelling Klitschko to put his offensive right into play.
Johnson, too passive in action for a challenger, mostly tried to pass the rounds.
Although he continued to provoke Klitschko in words and gestures, his shots rarely reached the champion.
He is still the second boxer after Timo Hoffman in the year 2000, having exceeded with Klitschko the distance of twelve rounds.
The challenger had made a lot of noise in the Swiss capital before the fight.
He insulted Klitschko as a "vile zombie" who "is not really capable".
During the weighing Friday, the champion could not help provoking Johnson by dropping his nose sunglasses "to be able to see his eyes".
Fourth victory since Klitschko's comeback.
Klitschko has made his fourth appearance since his comeback on October 11, 2008.
After a break of almost four years, he had beaten then-Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and recovered "his" WBC belt that he had previously abandoned without a fight.
This year, defending his title, he won the fight against Juan Carlos Gomez of Cuba and in September against Chris Arreola of the USA.
“I just took a shot in this fight and I’m in perfect shape,” Klitschko said, explaining his quick return to the ring.
His dream is to try to bring together in the family the four most important titles.
His brother Vladimir is a champion of the WBO and IBF federations.
But it is the British David Haye who, having dethroned the great Nikolai Walujew - 2.13 meters - in November, wears the belt of the WBA.
This summer, The Hague canceled a match against Vitali Klitschko that was due to take place in September.
It would seem that his promotional company is considering playing this game now at Wembley Stadium in London.
The Kunduz case
Frontal attack of the opposition: the leader of the parliamentary group of the Greens, Jürgen Trittin, accused the Minister of Defence Guttenberg of lying in the case of the Kunduz case.
The SPD and the Left (Left) parties ask the Chancellor for explanations.
Hamburg/Berlin - After reviewing the latest information on the Kunduz airstrikes, the opposition accused Defence Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) of deliberately concealing certain facts.
The Minister intentionally "formulated a misconception" about the murderous strike of two tankers last September, said the head of the parliamentary group of the Greens, Jürgen Trittin, on Saturday during the news broadcast of the ARD channel "Tagesschau" (the newspaper of 20h).
To be clear, it means he lied.
The order to kill was given to total disregard of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan (ISAF).
That is, in essence, the content of the report that NATO has at its disposal and which was read by Mr Guttenberg, said Trittin.
Last Friday, according to new media revelations, the goal of the strike was actually not to destroy the stolen trucks, but rather to eliminate two important Taliban leaders.
According to the NATO investigative report, 142 people were killed or injured in the U.S. airstrikes launched at the request of German Colonel Goerg Klein, Military Commander of Kunduz.
The Greens, the SPD and the Left on Saturday asked Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to pronounce as soon as possible before the Federal Parliament and to reveal what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Jürgen Trittin and his Green Party colleague Renate Künast are of the opinion that Angela Merkel must say clearly whether the targeted massacre strategy is part of the federal government’s Afghan policy if the chancellery, the army and the intelligence services have approved this new strategy.
The Government's spokesman categorically rejects these criticisms.
The chancellery has in no way influenced the military’s interventions in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, voices were growing to express doubts about the real reasons for the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert, as presented by the ministry.
According to the SPIEGEL newspaper, the information they had given Guttenberg regarding the tanker truck attack was both correct and complete.
Officially, they would have concealed the existence of the NATO report and concealed some disturbing details from the Minister.
In the vicinity of the two senior officials, however, it appears that they have informed the Ministry of Defence of the existence of several reports, including a two-page document by Colonel Klein and a report by the military police.
The "Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung" reports that Wichert has in the meantime asked in a letter for clarification of the facts.
So far, he has not received an answer.
On Saturday, the Department declined to comment on the allegations and referred them to the Federal Parliament's inquiry committee, which was to be formed on Wednesday to shed light on the facts in question.
The Worlds of Dreams
Some see, all awakened, images and hear voices that no one else sees or hears.
It is not only in the mentally ill, or under the influence of drugs, that the boundaries between imagination and reality are confused.
As long as these phenomena manifest themselves during sleep, everything is fine.
When we lie down in our dark rooms, we can unhinder the wildest dreams and fantasies.
However, one who, awakened, experiences a dream state, hears and sees things that others do not perceive, quickly has the reputation in our Western world of being crazy or drugged, or at least being an original.
Such images and voices do not appear only in the mentally ill or under the influence of the drug.
It is our imagination that is at stake: it is the same neural activity that allows us to design homes, paint paintings or write novels, but sometimes it encourages the boundaries between dream, madness and reality to merge.
A conscious state of awakening, taking the form of a dream, can occur in the most diverse forms, at best it is called visions, at the worst of madness.
But even if the trigger and effect differ, the visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiments of the New Age prophet Carlos Castaneda, the second states of shamans, psychoses and hallucinations are attributable to very similar processes.
There are hallucinations or delusions when the balance, neurotransmitter substances of the brain - first of all dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin and acetylcholine - breaks down and the interaction between different parts of the brain is disrupted.
Complex hallucinations and delusional thoughts manifest very often during schizophrenic psychosis.
The force of earthly attraction no longer has power over the person.
Since ancient times, philosophers and physicians have always looked at the relationship between madness and dream.
For Aristotle, hallucinations were a form of dream-awakened; Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, found in 1861 "a great resemblance between madness and dream", for Sigmund Freud the dream was even "a psychosis with all the irregularities, imaginations, and delusions".
We are in the fall of 2001 when Henning T turns into a cartoon character.
Its body is in two dimensions with bright colors.
Earth's attraction no longer has power over him, he's flattening the ceiling.
It feels like a blow.
Behind him were winged, grumpy devil-like creatures, their mouth bleeding, showing their teeth.
They chase him, give him kicks with heavy flamboyant boots, throw him against the walls, he feels pain all over his body.
Toning voices, nasty, screaming, coming out of the walls and the radio.
He can no longer bear those voices that insult him and humiliate him.
Henning T. pulls two cables from his stereo, makes a loop and attaches it to a hook attached to the ceiling.
He climbs on a baffle and passes the loop around the neck.
He's jumping.
The loop is detached.
Let it be a lesson to you, they cry out in a choir to tear off his tympanum. "Go to a clinic and get yourself cured!"
Today, Henning T. is 40 years old, he has experienced six acute psychoses, the last date of 2 years, the first of soon 20 years.
It was triggered by LSD.
Diagnosis: schizo-affective psychosis, paranoid, in addition it is manic-depressive, it takes drugs against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, he has been married for three years.
During the psychosis I experienced terrible fears and deep despairs.
Illusions are a cruel reality.
About one percent of the population suffers from schizophrenia at least once in their lifetime; in psychiatric clinics it is the most common disease after depression.
In a schizophrenic crisis, the people concerned can no longer make the difference between the inner world and the outer world, they find themselves in a state of hyper excitement, which makes them suffer from hallucinations, megalomania, relational madness or persecution.
It is very common to hear voices – voices that command, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are also not uncommon.
The person concerned can no longer distinguish between the important and the insignificant, the brain can no longer filter the disturbing signals, the consciousness is drowned under the sensations.
Like the dream, psychosis opens the door to a flood of ideas and fantasies coming from the deeper layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is centered on the subject, according to Professor Thomas Fuchs, head of the department of psychiatry at the CHU in Heidelberg (General Psychiatry in the Universitätsklinikum).
Schizophrenia is at the center of the situation, all with a meaning centered on it.
At the same time he finds himself in a passive role, he is like in a dream, overcome by events and cannot act on them actively.
This is why schizophrenia often feels threatened, controlled, manipulated.
In general they do not have the ability to adjust reality, illusions are a cruel reality, waking up is excluded.
Experience a hallucination once in your life.
Unlike the dream, according to Fuchs, “the sensory and spatial structure of reality that is perceived during psychosis is fundamentally preserved.”
The delusional thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the alienation of the experience takes place in a real setting.
Why our brain makes this kind of cabriolet is still a puzzle for researchers.
Exceptional situations can cause everyone to temporarily lose their perception of reality, according to Fuchs.
But only a small number of people will develop a psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but studies on twins have shown that genes are not the only determining factors.
The researchers assume that the individuals concerned have minor brain damage.
It is assumed that neuronal maturation of the brain is disrupted at an early stage of development, for example, by a viral infection of the mother during pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
But what remains unexplained is the way the neuronal system anomaly occurs and, moreover, the fact that it does not manifest itself for many years.
Environmental factors also play a role – stress or a traumatic experience can be a trigger for psychosis, however there is a predisposition.
Similarly, hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychoses because they act on neurotransmitters.
When our brains warm up.
What is crazy, says psychology professor Erich Kasten of Lübeck, is that psychotics suffer from their hallucinations and take expensive drugs to get rid of them while others buy very expensive drugs to get rid of them.
The pleasant or unpleasant perception of illusions is often just a matter of point of view.
Kasten has been collecting reports on hallucinations and the phenomena of illusory images for ten years: last year he published his results in a book titled "The Unreal World in Our Head".
Hallucinations are many of the typical concomitant phenomena of psychoses, but also an impressive number of other pathologies.
These include mental disorders such as borderline or depression, but also migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer’s disease or brain trauma.
It is surprising to note that in some conditions even the brains of healthy people are subject to hallucinations.
Hallucinations, according to Kasten, consist of fragments of memories that are normally inhibited.
They take shape when the areas of the brain that process sensory perceptions are hyperactive or not sufficiently repressed; when our brain warms up, but also when there is no stimulation.
Drugs can trigger this condition just like brain injury or psychosis.
But also the lack of stimulus, stress, love grief or other exceptional mental states.
In recent studies, one-third of participants admit to having experienced a hallucination at least once in their life.
In the summer of 2005 Sarah K. is 16 years old, she lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and goes to high school.
A young girl to do everything normal, to be honest.
If there were no images and voices.
During the recreation, it happens that a young boy, thin, with long chestnut hair, speaks to him.
When she responds, her comrades look at her, amazed – no one else sees or hears this boy.
They think this shy girl is a lunatic dreamer but Sarah K does not dream, she is sure.
She wakes up, hears and sees this boy just as she sees and hears the girl sitting next to her on the bench.
It can even sense its presence momentarily.
It's a nice feeling, she finds this nice young man.
Am I crazy?, she sometimes asks.
But she knows well that this young man and the other visions are not real and that they will disappear again.
Appearances at night are generally scary.
Visions are often heavy.
When she is in class, it happens that she is unable to attend the course because the teacher is just presenting a new student in her eyes and ears while he is invisible to others and the teacher is visibly explaining equations to the table.
Appearances at night are generally scary.
When, in the darkness of her room, she waits for sleep that arrives too rarely and far too late, she can often not make the distinction if she is awake or already dreaming, if the images she sees, grizzling faces or the girl with bloody cuts on her arms or legs or legs is found.
Leave me alone, she cries out to these creatures.
She doesn't talk about it to her parents or her friends, they'd think she's crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
She had her bag last year and she lives with her friend.
A year ago, the hallucinations stopped.
Since she came into contact with psychologist Kasten online, she knows very well that she is not crazy.
Madness is also a work of art of desperation.
When a person is socially isolated or doesn’t have enough stimulation, there’s a good chance that they’ll have hallucinations after a while.
I guess since the brain isn't busy enough, make sure there's animation.
Sarah K., single daughter, was afraid of other children when she was little and often played alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at the age of 13 that the man she called dad, since she was thinking age, was not her real father.
These are the same brain areas that are active for visual and acoustic hallucinations, and for real impressions and sounds, so it's very difficult for people like Sarah K to make the difference between illusion and reality. "Every experience," according to Kasten " takes place in the brain, reality is formed from there to start.
Hallucinations are also images that form in the brain, which is why they seem so real.”
For Kasten, night dreams are also a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people are not fundamentally different from those in acute psychoses.
Unlike schizophrenia, a mentally healthy person is able to recognize that fantasies are not real images.
That’s why Kasten advises his patients to cherish hallucinations as a particular talent.
There is only one step between the dream and the hallucination.
In our consciousness-centered world, there is unfortunately a rapid tendency to take imaginary experiments for pathologies, according to Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor at Heidelberg and chief physician at the psychiatric and psychotherapy clinic at Florence Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious, painful disease but which also contains something positive, creative - madness is a work of desperation.
Schmidt-Degenhard studied the form of experience called onychroids, a particular form of dream-awakened consciousness modification.
Onioid experiences are very complex semi-dreams that are perceived as real by the one who sees them and that he cannot differentiate from the dream even when he is awake.
Onioid state of consciousness manifests itself during trauma or in situations of extreme pathologies as for patients with polyradiculopathy who are fully conscious, experience motor paralysis.
According to Schmidt-Degenhard, when a human being is threatened by a loss of self and the world, due to a total and lasting inability to move, he replaces this real situation that undermines his life, with his own imaginary world that is dissociated from reality.
It is a state of mental boundary between dreaming and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to overcome the situation in reality, a change of world takes place but the real situation is represented in the imagination.
It is, in fact, an intense form of means and interpretation, in an intolerable situation in itself, a capacity of organization which is given to us men, so as not to fall asleep in the nullity of loss of consciousness.
Everything is real even later in the memories.
The Zurichian Peter Cornelius Classen, art historian, also describes his onioid experiences in his book "Change of the Heart" as a saving action of the soul.
He is 49 years old, at the time when his conscience goes on a journey of several days after a heart valve surgery followed by a transplant; during this time, his body is condemned to remain immobile in resuscitation.
Claussen dives into a world he has created from all rooms, visits foreign places, travels in time. He sees himself as an old man slumped in a railway sanatorium, a robot at his bedside watching over his health.
He lives in the middle ages among the nobles who make blood-based drugs.
He is kidnapped by a Greek man on a motorcycle who takes him to his country, surfs with his hospital bed in the swamp of the Alps and meets a Korean mobster.
It is completely absorbed in this imaginary world, everything is real even later in its memories.
According to Claussen, these inner journeys are fundamentally different from any dream.
The dream is a completely different state, he writes describing what he has experienced.
Contrary to dreams, memories from mental journeys are of extreme clarity and very detailed even years later.
It can even be said that they are much more distinct and more intense than the real experience.
The intensity of this experience breaks the horizon of our other daily experiences, according to psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Ultimately, onychoid delusions, psychoses, hallucinations, and psychedelic experiences show us how fragile our inner representations of external reality are even in a state of alertness.
Any change in the state of consciousness, summarizes psychologist Kasten "may cause a deformation of what we call reality."
An experience that can also be quite enriching.
The first snows may fall.
Here.
At the age of 27, the children will take over from the publishing house.
Kallen’s appointment as Burda’s CEO is an intermediate solution: in the longer term, Hubert Burda wants his two children to take over the press group, he told the Spiegel newspaper.
The holding company must remain 100% a family business.
Hamburg - In the long run, publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children
The two children will inherit at the age of 27 and are determined to integrate into society, Hubert Burda, 69, told Spiegel.
All the details have been settled in advance.
The question of whether they will be active in the company will arise later.
We will also have to see if they are capable of doing so.
One cannot impose his children on 7,500 employees without knowing if they have the capacity to deal with them.
This would demolish the children as well as the company.
Burda announced last Thursday that he was retiring from the post of President and CEO as early as January and that his successor was Paul-Bernhard Kallen.
Kallen, 52, has been a member of the Board of Directors since 1999.
He was primarily responsible for the technology sector.
Subsequently, he was responsible for the company's capital and after Jürgen Todenhöfer's departure, he also took over as head of marketing, the foreign sector, printing and finance.
So for the first time it is not a member of the family who is at the head of the Burda editions.
Burda’s children are 19 and 17, respectively, and his son Felix, who is now 42 years old, died a few years ago.
Kallen’s appointment also serves to link the next 10 or 15 years.”
Burda states that the holding company must remain 100% in the hands of the family.
The ruins have always taken place in families who have let themselves be driven by a capital bulimia, who have made huge unfortunate speculations thinking they could climb ever higher.
This has never been my strategy.
“I’ve never had a dream universal power,” Burda said.
I absolutely don’t see myself in the role of the country’s tutor as Springer could be and I don’t intend to be part of these international leagues like Time, these companies have taken on much too much importance.
Integral Beauty
Everything you can desire, in terms of beauty and well-being, at your fingertips.
This is what El Corte Inglés seems to have set itself, which has just opened in the Callao shopping centre (Madrid), a multidisciplinary space of more than 1000 m2, dedicated to the care and attention of the body.
The spa, located on the eighth floor, houses prestigious brands such as Hedonai, specialist in laser hair removal, Spaxion, with its relaxation rooms and aesthetic treatments, Luis & Tachi, hairdressers, Marina d'Or, which has a gym, or L'Occitane and its cosmetics.
There is also a feeding range, with in particular a tea lounge, which offers more than 130 different varieties.
Spaxion offers you, among other things, to enjoy a relaxing massage with your partner, while contemplating the exceptional views of the capital, or rent for two hours the relaxation area to organize your own "Beauty Party" with eight of your friends and relax thanks to a jacuzzi session, massages while drinking a drink.
In total, they are 250 m2 spread over 12 rooms, where you can benefit from the most innovative face care, body and hydrotherapy.
For example, cavitation to fight cellulite or vibrating platforms.
The gym also has these devices, as well as virtual "trainers" who guide the steps of the customers, offering them a fully personalized treatment.
It all starts with the introduction of your personal code on a touch screen, located in front of the device.
Several videos then show us how to properly perform our exercise program.
Its director ensures that 15 minutes (heating and stretching included) are enough to make all the muscles of the body work.
And, if after having our body worked, we want to go through the hair salon, the Luis & Tachi brand has a room where we offer rituals of hair repair, brightness or nutrition, all personalized.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to have been the motto of this urban spa, which will be open every day of the year from 10am to 10pm.
Varied Necklaces
Christmas is approaching and it is never superfluous to study the look of the stars to adapt it to our party wardrobe.
The shape of the neckline, very important for highlighting the silhouette, is one of the variables that we must take into account.
Here are some suggestions.
The singer Fergie chose an exaggerated and very complicated decollete. This is not very recommended.
Endesa and Barcelona are equipped with an electric car
The electrical company Endesa, in collaboration with the Ayuntamiento de Barcelona, has created the « Oficina LIVE ».
It is a project aimed at developing and promoting the electric vehicle in the Catalan capital.
The "Officina LIVE" (Logistics for Electric Vehicle Implementation) will define and coordinate the roadmap for the deployment of the electric car in the city and will set up agreements on mobility, by carrying out procedures, coordinating, presenting grants, etc.
In addition, it will develop the MOVELE project, promote the electric car, collect the opinion and work of the sectors involved.
Ultimately, the idea is to launch what will become the transport of the future.
3 “Electric Cities”
But Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the deployment of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville join the project.
These are the three cities chosen by the government, as part of the MOVELE Plan, to launch the deployment of the electric car.
The electrical company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Generalitat de Catalunya.
It aims to promote research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
Among these are activities related to energy, and in particular to energy efficiency.
This is not the only initiative Endesa is taking part in when it comes to promoting the electric car.
The company participates in standardisation groups at the European level and is running a set of complementary projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or GREEN CENIT.
Zapatero envisions “a future of tranquility” for the engine sector
The President of the government, José Luis Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Zapatero, spoke about "a future of tranquility" for the Spanish automotive industry, which, he recalled, is the country's main export sector.
In the presentation of the 2009 Economic Report of the President of the Government, Zapatero recalled the measures launched by the executive during the year to support the automotive sector.
“Without the Automotive Competitiveness Plan, we would have today a landscape of abandonment, closure of some of our main production sites,” the President said.
“Thanks to this plan and the decision of the brands to stay in Spain, in a very competitive sector, we can contemplate a future of tranquility for the future of this industry, which is our main export sector,” he added.
In this regard, he recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, included in the Integral Plan for the Automobile Sector (PIA), allocated <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>800 million to projects of 19 manufacturers and 137 auxiliary companies, which mobilised an investment of more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3 billion.
The Chief Executive explained that this investment was aimed at both the development of new models and the modernization of existing products and processes.
Zapatero also focused on government demand support measures, alluding to Plan 2000E, established in collaboration with autonomous communities and automotive companies.
According to the President, this plan reduced the average emissions of new vehicles marketed on the Spanish market by 6% and contributed to a “strong increase” in registrations, which increased by “40%” in November.
20,000 m2 of collection cars
Madrid hosts the first edition of the International Motor Show, a meeting place for professionals and enthusiasts of the motor world.
This initiative will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 at the Pabell<0xC3><0xB3>n de Cristal de la Casa de Campo in Madrid.
It is an exhibition area of 20,000 m2, where more than 200 national and international exhibitors will be present.
Not only can you find motorcycles and collectible cars, but you will also find at ClassicAuto Madrid articles of all kinds related to the world of the engine.
Thus, at the exhibitors of the pavilion, we can find accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, supplements, magazines, miniatures, etc.
Hundreds of articles related to the collection engine world that will make collectors and curious happy.
Among the participating companies we will find, among others, Cl<0xC3><0xA1>sicos de Mos and Good Old Times, specialists in the sale of cars, Juan Lumbreras, catering, Coupe-Francisco Pueche, sale and restoration of cars, or Cochera Cl<0xC3><0xA1>sicos, specialist of Mercedes Benz.
Outdoor Skill Testing
But the commercial activity of this trade fair will also include parallel activities: gatherings, sports exhibitions, fitness tests, presentations and competitions.
Skill tests with collectible cars and motorcycles will also take place on a circuit arranged outside the exhibition park.
Mazda3 i-Stop: A sustainable sports spirit
Mazda wants to prove that the sporting spirit is not angry with respect for the environment.
To this end, it has just integrated the engine stop and start system on the Mazda3, called i-Stop, a device that, at least for now, is only available on the 150-horsepower 2.0 engine.
This second generation Mazda3 is illustrated by the good score it has achieved as a whole.
Details, vehicle finish, habitability, behavior, mechanics, i-Stop system...
All these aspects are remarkable on the new Mazda3.
Starting with the driving position, it turns out that the front seats have excellent ergonomics and fastening.
The touch of the steering wheel is also particularly pleasant.
Continuing with the set formed by the dashboard and console, we see how Mazda continued in the Japanese trend of creating a futuristic interior design, with many buttons and commands, as well as bright colors in red and blue.
This style reminds us, in part, of the Honda Civic.
That is why we can say that both the Mazda3 and Civic, both Japanese, are in contrast to the sobriety of German products, and especially with the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to overcome.
Continuing with the cabin, this compact Japanese car has more than enough habitability to allow four adults to travel with a high level of comfort.
In addition to all this, a large chest with regular shapes.
The engine’s automatic shutdown and start system, at least for the moment, is only available on the two-litre and 150-horsepower petrol engine and with manual six-speed change.
This engine is a real happiness. It is distinguished by its fineness, low noise, performance and control over its consumption.
Indeed, although the most in demand Mazda3s are diesel models, those that do not drive a large number of kilometers a year should not exclude this i-Stop with gasoline engine, both for its great comfort in speed and for its controlled consumption.
As for the level of equipment, the model chosen for the test is the Sportive, in other words, the model that has the highest number of serial elements.
Among the standard equipments, the Blu-Ray Change Assistant (RVM) which removes the dead angle, traction and stability controls, the speed regulator, the photosensitive interior mirror, the on-board computer on a large screen, the audio-replacement sensors, the parking sensors, the independent air conditioning, the plumber.
In addition, as if this equipment was not enough, this version had the Premium Pack which, for an additional 1,500 euros, includes, among other things, elements of adaptable bi-xenon headlamps and a BOSE audio system with disk charger.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact cars in its class.
It is particularly distinguished by the quality of the materials used, by its behaviour and by its high level of equipment.
In addition, those who do not drive a lot of kilometers a year will be able to opt for the i-Stop version only associated with the 150-horsepower 2.0 diesel engine.
The only drawback of this model is its high price, which is between 21,770 euros for the Luxury finish and 23,270 euros for the tested model, the Sportive.
In return for this important sum, the Mazda3 will offer us every day a great dose of satisfaction.
“First” of luxury
L.A. covers the red carpet of sensuality embodied by Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars have dazzled us more than ever, dressed in models as elegant as sexy for the release of Nine. (Photo: Gtresonline).
Our "Pe", as sophisticated as usual, had opted for a dark "lady".
The Promise of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, it is a device that only allows you to look at his email, without offering the possibility of just seeing some type of attachments or surfing the Internet.
He took advantage of his five minutes of glory in the United States, when Time magazine named him one of the products of the year.
In fact, it is more difficult to see it on the street, but the idea seems interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek offers a very low price and monthly subscription, which is less than half of what it costs, for example, the iPhone’s dated subscription.
Given its success, the company has launched two new devices: one designed exclusively for Twitter, the other with a free lifetime data service, six times more expensive than Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the event The Web, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
He is just as limited as his American grandfather, but has a surprise.
The price of its monthly subscription, about 12 euros, includes roaming throughout Europe.
Those traveling with a Smartphone already know what it means to give up data when crossing a border or desperately look for a cafeteria on the Wifi (or a Fon connection) to be able to view its mail.
The idea of roaming at a fixed price is incredibly tempting and it’s been a long time since it should work.
Indeed, some operators have special arrangements and travel options, but as far as I am concerned, I would have needed to have done a physics thesis to understand them and good glasses to read the small characters.
Repeated reminders by the European Commission to offer affordable roaming rates across Europe have had a barely noticeable effect.
Outside of its country of origin, we hesitate to use the data, and we are not wrong.
That a small device like the FonPeek (it’s always curious that it’s called Fon when it doesn’t have Wi-Fi) offers this type of pricing, means that operators start thinking differently and are studying different proposals that allow them to make their data network profitable.
Kindle is another good example, it includes downloading books and other searches on the Internet.
No subscription and no fee.
This is a connected device and you pay when you buy it and not every month.
And that’s what I hope to see one day for the FonPeek: a lifetime-access purchase option like Peek already offers in the United States.
Not that I want to buy it.
I'm looking at my mail on my phone, thank you.
I wish for it simply because I believe it is a fairer formula for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
Michelle's favorite color
Yellow is arguably the favorite color of the first lady of the United States.
If she went to the office of Barack Obama to the presidency of the United States with a dress and a coat of this color, she has indeed chosen the same to accompany him in the second moment, undoubtedly the most important of her life: the award of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama wore a very similar pattern on these two occasions: in addition to their similar color, a yellow pulling towards the green with brilliant reflections, both times, the outfit consisted of three pieces: the dress, the jacket and the coat, in the same fabric, and was adorned with a large embroidery or a collar.
So that at first glance, it would seem that the first lady of the United States follows the footsteps of the Princess of Asturias and has chosen to return the same outfits.
But the fabric in which the two sets are cut makes them very different.
While it was a thick lace for the taking of office, on the other hand, it was wearing a printed velvet in Oslo.
The accessories are also different: medium-heeled green shoes for the first occasion, and a similar model, but golden, this time.
The hairstyle has also changed: the hair is now picked up while she was wearing it loose the previous time.
75% of working mothers have had professional problems because of their maternity
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for young women who want to be mothers.
This is revealed by the study "Fertility and Professional Career of Women in Spain", carried out by the CSIC in collaboration with the Instituto de la Mujer.
The survey, conducted on 9,737 women aged 15 to 75, leaves no room for doubt: 75% of working mothers have seen their careers limited due to maternity.
The study indicates that there are many differences regarding the start of couple life and the number of children, whether or not the woman works and the type of employment employed.
Those who have no activity outside the home, work part-time or have an unstable job, get married earlier, have their first pregnancy earlier and have more children.
On the other hand, women with stable employment, mainly in the public sector, are repulsing entry into couple life and first pregnancy, and have fewer children.
Women between the ages of 35 and 49 who have a fixed job have their first child, on average, 3.7 years after settling in a couple. This figure rises to 4.1 for those who work in the public sector. "These data show that women who have a stable job needed more time in their lives to achieve it, and bringing them together again.
In addition, the type of employment exercised largely influences maternity, but less the start date of common life,” explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that widens the gap between the age of marriage of women and their first child.
According to the survey, the higher the level of training, the more they get married and have their first child later.
The difference is also maintained among women of the same generation.
For example, in the 35-49-year-old group, those who did elementary and graduate studies were mothers for the first time at 25.1 and 32.1 years on average, respectively.
“Another distinction also appears among women, depending on their level of study.
While those who have completed elementary studies marry and have their first child before finding a stable job, those who have completed middle or higher level studies reverse this program and prioritize achieving a stable job as a prerequisite for marriage and the arrival of an exact child.”
Diane Kruger is well worth it.
L’Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its jealous list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will embody the image of several products of the brand, toning the universal motto “Because I am worth it”.
The protagonist of Merry Christmas, one of the most elegant actresses on the international stage, joins other celebrities registered with L'Oréal Paris, such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penelope Cruz.
Before her, the last to enter this club if selected were the actresses Evangeline Lilly (Lost) and Freida Pinto (Slumdog Millionaire).
In men, the cosmetics brand also has luxury ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey (Dre Grey, anatomy lessons) and Matthew Fox (Evangeline’s companion in Lost).
The prices of British fashion
The British have a lot to say in the fashion world.
Its greatest representatives, creators and models, of yesterday and today, met for the annual award ceremony, which took place in London, at the Royal Court of Justice.
No one missed the appointment.
Former model Jerry Hall and his daughter, Georgia May Jagger, voted Best Model of the Year.
The Poker of Manuel Vincent's
Manuel Vincent offers us in Poker of Aces (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente) about thirty "radiographies" of writers who went through his literary life (and sometimes his other life).
It does not do so according to the foreseeable and understood genres (biographical summary, life and work), but by looking for something similar to the ignition core of the created character.
The journey is exciting and Vincent spares neither the friars nor the illumination.
Delicious pleasure, this book is also an exciting invitation to reading and re-reading.
Let me give you a few moments.
On Albert Camus: “In his pages, I discovered that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual, almost physical impulse, the very one I felt without naming it: pleasure against disastrous destiny, morality without guilt, and innocence without any god.”
On Samuel Beckett: “Nihilist, allegorical Christian, he wrote what he had in his blood, not in his head, between impotence and ignorance, with a dazzling poetic humor, meaningless, like the blade of the knife that almost killed him.”
On Graham Greene: “Our man was inspired by this woman of a passion that lasted thirteen years, in the flesh of which he combined the emotion of adultery with the pleasure of remorse, a spiritual privilege that consisted in reaching heaven by the way of perdition.”
James Joyce: “The Ulysses was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach, one of the eight thousand-meter peaks of universal literature, which must be engraved by the north face, on which the best climbers still let go and always taken.”
William Faulkner: “He was a strange guy.
From himself, he sometimes said that he was the heir to a county landlord and at other times that he was the son of a black and a crocodile.
These two dreams were grandiose.”
On Louis-Ferdinand Céline: “This writer gathered the cry of dement pushed from a bridge by this character of Munch to carry his echo to the bottom of the night of the twentieth century, in his literary form, and he did so in flight from himself and invoking posterity with a violent speech to the asticos.”
On Dorothy Parker: “One day she kneeled down and prayed, ‘God beloved, I beg you to make me stop writing like a woman.’
On Joseph Conrad: “On his grave were engraved the verses of Spenser: “Sleep after the effort,/ after the storm the port,/ rest after the war,/ after life tired, death rejoices.”
About Virginia Wolf: “In her luggage she also carried her depressions.
Her husband accepted very normally that she would tell her that Edward VII was spitting him among the azaleas or that the birds were singing in Greek.
We have never seen a man so patient and in love with a neurosis whose literary talent surpassed madness.
Sur P<0xC3><0xAD>o Baroja : « What did Mart<0xC3><0xAD>n-Santos do if it is not to try to hide Joyce at Baroja ?
What would Benet do if he didn't shoot Baroja by Faulkner?
What does it do if it is not to aspire to the glory of this man so that he may serve as a pedestal for him?”
A cowardly aggression
Last week, my mother, who is about 70 years old, was walking in our neighborhood of the city of Fuenlabrada, when a group of young people between 15 and 18 years old passed by her and our dog, a bloodthirsty, saved from the SPA and weighing no more than six kilos, and without saying a word, they beat him.
Our outrage is immense because we don’t see what’s fun about assaulting a defenseless little animal that, moreover, was in a lattice for free.
We must add to this the indignation of a lady who walked quietly and who, when she hurt these individuals, came to fear for his physical integrity, since an energetic who attacks an animal is able to do the same to a woman, a child, an old man or, more definitively, any person.
The episode took place around 5:00 p.m., on a Tuesday like any other, in a usually quiet neighborhood.
The dog groaned all day.
We have, of course, filed a complaint with the district commissioner's office, even if we doubt that this is of great use and in order not to touch the sensibilities, we just want to clarify that the cowardly killers were Spanish.
The outrage led us to denounce this fact.
We don’t understand what happens to young people so they find it fun to treat a defenseless animal for free that gives us affection, friendship and keeps us company.
We do not know where good education and respect for animals and people have gone.
Michelin and Fesvial, kits for helmet wear
The tyre manufacturer Michelin, in collaboration with the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to encourage wearing the helmet, mainly among young motorcyclists, as both structures have indicated today.
The aim of this initiative is to raise awareness of the importance of wearing the helmet, since it is the only protection element that prevents head injuries, or even death, in the event of a two-wheel accident.
Michelin said the campaign was part of its commitment to road safety, which goes “beyond the design and manufacture of ever safer products”, and stated that it was contributing to this goal through other educational and informational actions.
This new campaign to encourage the wearing of the helmet on two wheels, under the motto “To be or not to be”, will include a first phase during which posters will be distributed in more than 500 motorcycle garages, in order to ensure the widest dissemination.
Lastly, Michelin stressed that road safety “is a constant concern” for the company, because as a tyre manufacturer for two-wheeled vehicles, one of its main objectives is to develop ever safer products.
Sales of light commercial vehicles are on the rise
After almost two years, the light commercial vehicle market is starting to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9,425 vehicles registered in November in Spain represent an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, more importantly, they represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of decline, according to figures from the employer union of manufacturers Anfac and Ganvam, that of dealers.
The good news should, however, be nuanced, since the reference for the comparison, November 2008, was particularly bad, with a decrease of 60% compared to the previous year.
As a result, despite last month's rebound, the registrations accumulated during these 11 months are 40% below those in the previous fiscal year.
Since January, the addition of all vehicles that fall into the light commercial vehicle category (derived from passenger cars, pick-ups, vans, light vans and light trucks) has been 95,853.
The big clouds that affect their demand the most have not been dissipated. In fact, although they are also purchased by individuals, most of the purchases are made by small or medium-sized enterprises, which in almost 100% of cases pay through external financing.
Thus, in addition to the constraints involved in limiting bank credits, other factors such as the increase in the unemployment rate or the persistence of the poor economic conjuncture need to be added.
In the face of this situation and unlike passenger vehicles, aid for the 2000E has served little.
In addition to individuals, self-employed and SMEs wishing to acquire a light commercial vehicle of less than 3.5 tonnes with a level of CO2 emissions that does not exceed 160 grams per kilometre, it can also benefit, but the number of operations speaks for itself.
Yesterday, Ganvam reiterated the need for the administration to pay particular attention to these vehicles and also to industrial vehicles (trucks and buses).
The dealers' association expects a similar year 2010 to the year that ends, for which it calculates a 19% drop in sales (touring vehicles and 4x4).
Emergency braking assistance is now obligatory
As this has happened with the ABS anti-lock braking system and as it will happen with the ESP stability control, emergency braking assistance systems will be a mandatory element on European cars.
They are already mandatory on newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, while for the rest of the vehicles a period of deficiency has been fixed until the end of February 2011.
The measure, imposed by the European Union, aims to strengthen the protection of pedestrians, although, through its mode of action, it can also help to avoid many rear shocks.
The emergency braking assistant acts by increasing the pressure on the brakes in the event of an emergency detected by the system thanks to the kick given by the driver.
But the latter does not always maintain the pressure until the end.
According to a study carried out by car component manufacturer Bosch, a third of the drivers involved in an accident had not been able to press the brake before the collision, and half of them had not benefited from all their strength.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The intervention of the aid, on the other hand, requires the maximum of the braking system, reducing the distance that the car needs to stop.
According to an EU study, if all cars were equipped with these types of elements, up to 1,100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be avoided each year.
This reduction would be even more significant with the popularization of so-called intelligent emergency braking systems: it is estimated that one in four accidents with injured persons would be avoided.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system that, thanks to a radar or camera, detects obstacles and warns the driver, in addition to acting lightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, he assists by increasing the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
If it does not react, and although the collision is inevitable, the device exerts the maximum effort on the brakes to minimize damage.
General Motors postpones plans for Opel until January
While the workers at the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Saragossa) were warned by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva would be launched during the first week of April – probably the 8th – according to Javier Ortega, the northern manufacturer.
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, understands that every point in the plan has been approved in advance by the party concerned.
And this may imply that the final document, which will first be submitted to the workers and then to the governments of the countries where the factories are located, will be postponed until early 2010.
On the other hand, at GM, it is assured that a decision on the sale of Saab should be made in the coming days.
It is therefore not surprising that the Swedish government has tightened the pressure on the American manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to being in contact with potential new buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also aspires to acquire Volvo, but the candidacy of the Dutch sports car manufacturer Skyper, supported by the Russian Converg group, takes on importance.
In the event that there is no agreement with any of them, GM could sell a portion of Saab to the Chinese company Baic.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year if it is not sold is maintained.
At the wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
To design their last and precious jewel, Porsche engineers left the Boxster S and managed to thin it by just under 80 kilos, leaving the balance at only 1,275 kilos.
This led them to pass, in the first place, from the automatic roof, which was replaced by a manual clogged roof, allowing to reduce by 21 kilos, to use aluminum doors like those of the GT3, another 15 kilos less, to take off the air conditioner, to take off the air conditioner, 13 kilos, to reduce the fuel tank by 7 kilos, to fuel tank by 64 kilos.
Finally, they gave up the CDR-30 audio system, gaining six more kilograms and replaced the door handles with fabric handles, saving the remaining kilograms.
Although the model also exists with the dual clutch PDK box, the test was carried out on a six-speed manual box model, mainly on California’s mountain secondary network roads, with particularly torturous turns.
His behavior can only be described as impeccable.
The decrease in weight does not prevent the car from rolling on the ground with aplomb.
On the contrary: it was a long time ago that we had not tested such a small and lightweight model that, at the same time, guarantees as much safety in turns, including high speed.
He is a small athlete, able to warm his muscles at a small speed for the necessary time, until we asked him to sprinter, to brake, to recover and to push his engine again...
This is what we wanted out. Thanks to its direction, as communicative as it is, the car will do what our hands will indicate on the steering wheel.
And she will do it with surgical precision.
Sound of engine at will
The sound of the V6 boxer, with 320 horsepower (10 more than the Boxster S) is particularly successful and can be enhanced with the "sport" option or thanks to a system that changes the engine noise, already used on the Panamera.
The acceleration capacity is brutal, either during shutdown or during recovery.
The suspensions are firm, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The lining of the roads we ran with the Boyxster Spyder was quite damaged, but the car managed the chicken nests well.
The electronic assistants barely made a presence throughout the trip, while on some turns we found ice in the early morning and gravel later in the morning.
Ultimately, an ultra-light car, the most entertaining to drive and which is much more than a simple modification of the Boxster S.
The car will be available for sale in February 2010 at a price of 70,831 euros.
" Bag Girl "
Close friend of Karl Lagerfeld, icon of the Coco Cocoon line and occasional starlet of the house parades, the singer displays her face as a bad girl with as much containment as her Chanel bags.
More than a "Bad Girl" or a "It Girl" is a "Bag Girl".
The Baskonia offers a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral achieved a brilliant victory at 91-82 on his visit to the hard field of Maccabi Electra, despite the numerous absences suffered by the team of Dusko Ivanovic. It is thus at the top of his group, after the great summer show of Mirza Teletovic who, with his eight baskets to three points.
Vitoria's team managed to fill the important absences of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with a large dose of commitment and collective work, although she had to wait until the end to win.
In addition, the great skill from the perimeter, with 16 baskets with three points scored, will largely determine the final victory.
The match started quickly for the blues and reds, who took the lead from the start.
The fact that the first four baskets of the Vitoria team were marked from the perimeter, presupposed that they had jumped on the Israeli field with warm wrists.
English and Teletovic were the main craftsmen in the 18-20 final of the first quarter-time.
The second quarter was on the same tone, but Alava's team chose Barac's home game and Eliahu's work, which was received by acclamations and applause back to his old home, to increase their advantage at the break (34-43).
Teletovic was already starting to stand out as the best player of his team, with 13 points scored, although the "minus six" rating of Splitter already predicted that night would not be the best of the Brazilian.
But in this match, despite the fact that they were on the right track at the break, nothing was played, far from there, and Avala's team wanted to remind Vitoria that one doesn't win so easily on their pitch, and thanks to "Elias' hand", they managed to get into the match.
Eidson and Pnini contributed decisively to the yellows taking advantage of the bright (50-49).
Other Difficulties
The players of Ivanovic, wounded but far from being dead, needed to chain up some skillful actions to take the air, and it was at this time that Mirza Teletovic's machine gun emerged which, with three wickets at three points in a row, and the help of English and Ribas ended with three wickets.
The Avala team came out to play for the whole thing in the final period and English and San Emeterio (60-75) said they were not going to let anyone take what they had deserved during the first thirty minutes.
Nevertheless, Pnini and Eidson, the best of their team, did not resign and tried to support her from the three-point line (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter eliminated due to faults, Ivanovic's players did not rush, defend well, and although the Israelis got closer in the last minute (80-85), the game was already played and the win was missed in Tel Aviv for the first time of the season.
Injuries prevent the Unicaja from delivering battle
Unicaja lost loudly in Greece against Olympiacos and gave him the head of Euroleague Group B, in a match marked by the absence of Unicaja players, especially in the domestic game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
The Malaga team was not frightened by the atmosphere of the Peace and Friendship Pavilion or by the size of the rival, arguably one of the most powerful in Europe and with a large budget.
The game of the first quarter, allowed the Andalusians to dream. An aggressive defense and three baskets with three points in a row, two of the manager Omar Cook and one of Guillem Rubio who dazzled the local team 12-18, in the ninth minute.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of Unicaja, although the local team's arsenal with Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis's home game, allowed to reverse the score of 22-20, in the thirteenth minute, when two players entered Williamley, an action, a start of fighting, between the North-Beamed managers.
The Greek team began to operate by showing its superiority in both camps, while the exit for injury to the English pivot Joel Freeland and the three personal faults of Carlos Jiménez weighed on the Unicaja.
Indoor players and Lithuanian wingman Linas Kleizas, with their three-point basket, dug the 44-32 lead in the nineteenth minute.
An Impossible Resurrection
The third period was particularly offensive for Olympiacos, who, despite the 19 losses, proved superior and even managed to equal the difference of the match played in Malaga 66-48, in the twenty-seventh minute, making the head of the group chancellor.
The Unicaja was trying to overcome the absences and the last exit of the Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, injured during the encounter.
Despite all these problems, Unicaja, thanks to its organization, the three-point basket of Cook, and the support of Lewis, left a bit of hope with 66-57, in the thirty-one minute.
But the victory was virtually impossible because the Olympiacos proved relentless when the players pressed and showed their superiority in centimeters in the area.
Croatian pivoter Nikola Vujcic managed to score 81-62 in the thirty-seventh minute, and Unicaja submitted, accepting the Olympiacos victory.
How much should you be paid according to your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can know the salary they would earn based on their profile, thanks to a new app from Trovit, the search engine with the largest number of classifieds for real estate, jobs and vehicles in Spain.
The “How much should you be paid?” tool calculates the salaries of users from more than 140,000 job offers available to Trovit in Spain, from a form available on Facebook, where you need to register your profession, years of experience, your age and the city where you want to work.
For a week since the app was running, the search engine has detected that the Spanish worker generally “feels poorly paid,” Trovit’s product manager, Albert Ribera, said in a statement.
According to the data available to Trovit<0xC3><0xA0> from its search engines in the UK and France, Spaniards are the least well paid.
A British computer programmer receives <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>45,226 gross per year and a French programmer 31,059, while a Spanish programmer receives <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>24,000.
Similarly, a driver receives 34,247 euros gross per year in England, 25,751 in France and 16,420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the least paid work in Spain is that of a server, with 11,592 euros net per year, followed by that of a seller, with 14,725 euros, and that of a worker, with 15,667 euros.
The most sought-after jobs on the Internet over the past three months are those of a driver, part-time job and social worker.
Brazil sets a date for Zelaya’s departure
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya’s stay in his embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The overthrown president will have to relinquish the diplomatic mandate no later than January 27, 2010, the date of the official end of his term.
Francisco Catunda, the Brazilian embassy's business manager in the capital of Honduras, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows he must leave the embassy, where he has been a refugee since September 21, before that date.
“He is aware that he must leave on January 27th, at the end of his term, he must look for another destination.”
The channel also cited the former envoy, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the deadline: “My position is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the support of the Brazilian government,” Zelaya said by phone.
After the November 29 elections (in which Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, the same week, he tried to seek refuge in Brazil.
The operation eventually failed, as Zelaya refused the political exile condition that the de facto government presided over by Roberto Micheletti intended to impose on him.
Thank you very much
After pink days since last spring, during which asset inflation has been the dominant note on the markets, uncertainty is emerging again, which is not surprising since it is their natural state, in an environment where agents make decisions about a future by an uncertain nature.
The remedy used by central banks to stabilize markets was to monetize debt through the direct purchase of assets and indirectly by providing ample liquidity at near zero rates, so that financial institutions buy assets to mobilize.
Central banks have already confirmed that direct asset purchases have been virtually finalised and, without questioning their non-conformist liquidity policy, are starting to put some sand in the wheels, as the ECB has done, with their one-year bidding next week.
Therefore, investors are doubting the ability of the global economy to maintain economic recovery without heterodoxic measures, and we are witnessing a reversal of risk premium reduction.
Stock market volatility and corporate bond gaps are on the rise again, although they remain far from the paranormal levels they reached earlier this year.
States were forced to socialize private risk and public debt was again affected.
There is again a flight to quality and the United States, Japan and Germany have been the havens chosen by investors, causing an increase in the differences between the eurozone countries and Germany.
Spain was hardly affected by this episode of instability, but then Standard & Poor'sa threatened with a further downward revision of the qualifying of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, a little uncertainty is not bad to silence the defenders of moral risk, who again tried to provoke a case of conscience among those responsible for world economic policy who had curbed the destructive effects derived from the limitation of credit on the destruction of employment.
However, the situation in Dubai resembles a tribal struggle between the emirs to regain their place in power in the emirate, and we have already seen the case of Greece.
A government that hides a public deficit, elections, and a new government that discovers the pot of roses.
Prodi did so in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Dur<0xC3><0xA3>o Barroso.
It would be completely irrational for the Ecofin to save Hungary from non-compliance with its external payments at the beginning of the year and allow a member of the euro area to not comply with its commitments.
What makes sense, on the other hand, is that the Ecofin has encouraged the Greek government to be transparent and makes its citizens co-responsible for the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we hope, we are faced with an episode of transitional risk premium normalization, after a few excesses in high positions, that would be predictable.
In the case of Spain, as long as our gaps in public debt increase as European companies' obligations increase, we need not worry.
If the European gaps were to be reduced and ours continued to increase, then it would be a Spanish idiosyncratic risk.
The Standard & Poor's case is an anecdote. When our predictive indicators force most of the study services to anticipate their recovery models and to revise their forecasts for 2011 upwards, plus the OECD and the European Commission, who are very much in charge with a Japanese model for the Spanish economy.
Again, this seems to be an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish assets, even if for the moment “prudence is the mother of security”.
Connected Sectors
Iberdrola's president, Ignacio S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Gal<0xC3><0xA1>n, was the first to speak yesterday, before the subcommittee of the Congress of Deputies, where Spain's energy strategy for the next two decades is being discussed these days.
After his speech, which was followed by that of the President of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Mr Gal<0xC3><0xA1>n outlined to the press what he had said before the subcommittee at eight o'clock.
For the president of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>50,000 million by 2020 and 60,000 million more between that date and 2030, in case the nuclear power plants in operation today would remain open.
If this is not the case, the necessary investment would not amount to $60,000 but would amount to $95,000.
On the other hand, Iberdola believes that for the next decade, investments should not be devoted to increasing production capacity, but to distribution networks and international interconnections.
Starting in 2020, the issue changes, and the power will have to be increased.
Its focus is on both gas and coal power plants, with mechanisms for recovering carbon dioxide and, above all, on renewable energies.
In this area, it considers that an additional 18,000 MW are needed, along with other "support energies".
Gal<0xC3><0xA1>n, who believes the government’s recently approved Sustainable Economy Bill is in line with what his company is calling for, did not want to attack the Royal Decree to encourage national coal consumption, which contradicts policies to combat global warming.
According to him, there is “a clear long-term bet” in this direction, despite the “punctual” measures, as the president of Iberdrola called them.
However, Gal<0xC3><0xA1>n believes that investment decisions, although they are long-term, must begin to be taken, as they take some time before they reach maturity and a stable remuneration framework is needed to address them.
Ferrovial wins Aer Lingus handling market in ten airports
The Swiss company Swissport, a subsidiary of Ferrovial for airport services on the ground, will play the role of a privileged partner of the Irish airline Aer Lingus, for freight services, in ten European airports where it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are among the most important.
The agreement, whose economic terms have not been disclosed, has a duration of five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Junta de Castilla-La Mancha and the University of Alcal<0xC3><0xA1> de Henares signed yesterday a protocol of collaboration to create the Centre for Innovation of Intelligent Infrastructures.
The alliance expects an investment of 20 million by 2012, of which 50% will come from Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the Centre will be to conduct research on energy efficiency on highways and at airports.
Acciona contests its first motorway in Australia in Hochtief and Bouygues
Acciona is fighting for its first concession highway in Australia, a market in which she already works as an energy company and water manager.
The construction site is a tunnel estimated at 1,700 million Australian dollars (approximately 1,047 million euros).
The French company Bouygues and the German company Hochtief are its rivals.
A 5-kilometre-long tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the East Coast, is such an option to enable Acciona to establish itself in the country as a public works company and highway dealership.
The city council wants to be able to dispose of it by the end of 2014.
After choosing public/private collaboration (PPP) to complete the project, under a business plan under the supervision of Erns & Young, the local administration already has a list of finalists who will be in charge of the construction and operation of the toll.
In anticipation of the presentation of their offers in May, the planned investment amounts to 1,700 million Australian dollars (about 1,047 million euros) and in the final phase three consortia are facing, with a notable presence of European manufacturers.
The group called Transcity is led by Acciona, the only Spanish company in Smoothness, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of the largest Australian manufacturers, while the second, installed in Italy, is one of the largest European specialists in underground works.
Against the Acciona team, the Northern Direct consortium is being built, with the presence of the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and the French construction group Bouygues.
The third and last consortium to pass the test is LBRJV, the capital of which is shared between the Australian Leighton (subsidiary of the German manufacturer Hochtief, which in turn has the participation of ACS), another local company, Baudlerstone (ownership of the German group Bilfinger Berger in Traux, Raiisse special company).
The Australian infrastructure market promises large construction sites and privatizations, but getting in is a big challenge, if not through the acquisition of a local construction company.
A strategy followed by the already mentioned Hochtief and Bilfinger companies, in addition to their Asian references, which remains an unvalidated step for the Spanish giants in the sector.
ACS has just won a place in this market with its 30% stake in Leighton’s owner, Hochtief.
Millionaire Assets
Acciona focuses on a geographical area of greatest importance for the sector, on which it already has a broad presence through its energy supplier activity and in the desalination sector.
Among other assets, it has the largest wind farm, Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria, and leads the grouping of companies responsible for building and managing the Adelaide desalination plant, with a budget of 700 million.
It now intends to consolidate these two areas and take advantage of the synergies to enter the construction and infrastructure management markets.
The toll road, promoted by the Brisbane City Infrastructure Office and the so-called Northern Link (Northern Link), is intended to connect the Toowong Western Highway to the Kelvin Grove Peripheral Road (see map), by 4 kilometres of tunnel trabane.
The schedule set by the administration indicates that the tendering will take place during the summer of 2010 and that the work will begin in December next year.
Despite the fact that this toll road will be open to traffic at the end of 2014, it is not expected that the construction site will be completed before 2016.
The tunnel began to be constructed in 2005.
It will comprise twice two lanes, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Queensland government will contribute $500 million ($308 million) to its funding.
Brisbane already offers jobs in Hochtief
Australia continues to largely fertilize Hochtief, which mentioned yesterday the acquisition of a contract with the government estimated at 154 million.
The company owned by ACS will equip, through its local subsidiary Leighton, the infrastructure of the national high-speed fiber optic network.
This intervention will allow 400,000 people to have quick access to the Internet and provide work for the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has sold the 27-story King George Tower in the city of Brisbane, but the work has not yet begun and Hochtief has completed the sale for $129 million.
In the UK, more specifically in Manchester, she will share with Laing O’Rourke the construction and management of two school groups for 25 years.
The initial investment will be <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>75 million.
FCC awarded a tunnel in Slovenia for $64 million
FCC, through its Alpine subsidiary, has been awarded the construction of a 2.1 km long tunnel for a motorway in Slovenia, for an amount of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>64.5 million.
The company obtained this contract a few days after it was in charge of the expansion of the Bosruck Tunnel (Austria), for a sum of 130 million.
Alpine thus consolidates its experience in the construction of tunnels.
The construction project is scheduled to start in early 2010 and will take 32 months to complete.
Ms. Rushmore is awarded Renfe's advertising
Renfe entrusted the advertising and marketing services of the next two years to the agency Mrs. Rushmore, for a budget of about three million euros per year, the railway operator said.
The contract mentions the possibility of two 12-month extensions each. Ms. Rushmore was selected from among 16 agencies that submitted the tender organized by Renfe, of which four were finalists, including TBWA, who has been responsible for creativity over the past three years.
From now on, Ms. Rushmore will be in charge of the design and production of the campaigns.
A fine of 63 million to France Télécom to curb competition
The French competition regulator has imposed a fine of 63 million euros on France Télécom for its anti-competitive conduct in the Caribbean region belonging to the country.
According to this institution, the operator limited competition in landline and mobile telephony by signing exclusive agreements, tariffs and consumer loyalty programmes on the margins of regulation.
With this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state-owned enterprise, has accumulated more than 450 million euros in fines since 1994, due to the obstacles it puts to its competitors.
The sanctions imposed yesterday have also been increased because the competition authority considers that France Télécom has committed similar offences in the past and that it is therefore recidivistic.
An app store.
On the other hand, the mobile telephony subsidiary of the French company followed the footsteps of other operators and opened an Internet app store, with the aim of increasing revenues that do not come from voice transmission.
Initially, Orange’s app store will be active in France and the UK.
It will have to wait until 2010 for it to arrive in other countries such as Spain.
Their participation in the Champions League has brought 476.4 million to Real Madrid and Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a since its inception.
The Champions League has become a source of revenue for clubs since its inception in 1992.
In fact, Real Madrid and FC Barcelona have won 467.4 million, placing them in third and fifth place among the clubs that put the most money in this competition.
Manchester United are at the top of the list.
Manchester United are at the top of the list.
Winning the UEFA Champions League not only brings glory, it is also one of the main sources of income for the big clubs.
Indeed, the competition has allocated <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5,362.5 million to the 105 teams (including 12 Spaniards) who have participated in the event since the tournament was created, during the 1992-1993 season, according to UEFA information.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona were well served in this division.
The white club was the third on the continent to receive the most money for its participation, and the only, with A.C. Milan, to have won the trophy three times.
The Catalan club, currently holding the title and last winner of the former European Cup in 1992, is fifth on the list.
At the top of the list are Manchester United and Bayern Munich, the two teams that have also charged the most money for their participation in the last Champions League.
And that, even though they lost to Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country in terms of the money reported by the Champions League, although it has won more titles than any other (five, while Italy has won four, England three and Germany two).
Distribution (disambiguation)
This apparent paradox is explained by the complex money-sharing procedure applied by UEFA.
For this year, the organization chaired by Michel Platini expects to win 1,090 million thanks to the Champions League.
Of this sum, UEFA will allocate <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>413.1 million for fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the qualifying matches (including Atlético de Madrid) received <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.1 million.
In addition, those who managed to participate received 3.8 million only to be there, in addition to 550 00 euros for each match played.
There is also a bonus in case of victory (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>800,000) and equality (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>400,000 for each team). Those who arrive in the eighth final receive three million each, the eight teams who arrive in the fourth final receive 3.3 million.
The last four teams will each receive $4 million.
And the champion will win 9 million, compared to the 5.2 received by the other finalist.
Thus, under fixed payments, a club will earn at least 7.1 million, and a maximum of 31.2 million.
On the other hand, Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a paid <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.5 million for winning the European Super Cup in August.
But in addition, there are variable payments, to which are devoted 337.8 million.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each television market.
The Spanish market is one of the most important, and has four attractive places.
The previous year’s champion took 40% of the money spent, 30% for the second, 20% for the third and 10% for the fourth.
The other game will be paid based on the number of matches played during the current year's edition.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million euros for 29.9% of Sos.
The Nueva Rumasa Group listed the details of the share purchase offer by which it intends to acquire a maximum of 25 to 29.9% of Sos' capital.
A percentage that does not require it to launch a Public Procurement Offer (OPA) for all securities.
Specifically, Nueva Rumasa offers 1.5025 euros per share, which will be disbursed in 10 years and will be paid at a rate of 1% per year for this postponement.
Yesterday, the shares of Sos ended at 1.85 euros; the offer of Nueva Rumasa therefore rated the company 18% below the market.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the actual valuation of Sos.
The offer is conditioned by the appointment of eight of the 15 advisors.
The Jerez Group gives a 15-day deadline for shareholders to indicate their interest in the sale of the securities.
The CNMV said it had not been informed of this offer, although the company of the Ruiz Mateos claimed that it had contacted the regulator.
If it took place, the disbursement would amount to 611.7 million, while the capital of Sos is 254.27 million.
In the meantime, Sos is continuing the restructuring of its direction.
In an attempt to stay out of possible purchase offers and going and coming judges from its former directors, brothers Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s and Jaime Salazar, she announced the election of Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Luis Jord<0xC3><0xA1> as director of internal audit.
A decision that makes her the first woman to hold a leading position in the food business.
This is a newly created position that will depend directly on the group president.
And it is not without controversy, as the company remains immersed in the legal battle for the alleged diverting of more than 230 million Sos to Salazar companies.
Moreover, the possibility that Sos reveals new diversions of funds in the coming months cannot be ruled out.
Regarding credit to Salazar, former advisers Ildefonso Ortega and <0xC3><0x81>ngel Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez Noriega (representatives of the CCM and Unicaja) said yesterday before the National Audience that they had been informed of the diversion of 212 million without knowing the destination.
The CNMV authorizes the OPA to exclude Paternina presented by Inversora Mer
The National Securities Markets Commission (CNMV) yesterday authorized the exclusion OPA presented by Inversora Mer on Federico Paternina on 9 October last.
The supervisory body explained that it was authorizing this operation because it understood that its terms were in line with existing standards and that it considered the content of the explanatory note submitted “sufficient” following the amendments applied on 2 December.
The CNMV clarified that the offer concerns the acquisition of 550,008 shares of Federico Paternina at a price of EUR 7.65 per share, representing 8.95 % of the share capital, consisting of 6,142,786 shares admitted to trading on the Madrid and Bilbao stock exchanges.
It further explained that 5 592 778 million shares had been immobilized and could not in any way be transferred before the closing of the tender, of which it indicated that the price had been fixed by Federico Paternina, in accordance with the provisions of the current standards.
New Tools for the Expertise of Cars
In these days of bad weather and accidents, car garages are not the only winners.
Every day, thousands of cars that have been damaged are brought back to a garage, where an expert must assess the damage suffered and the cost of repair.
Each disaster is different, and calculating the cost of parts and labor time can be a long and complex task.
Calculate by hand the cost of a repair between 20,000 and 30,000 euros, including parts and labor can take two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the assistance of the latest computer tools, it would be a matter of minutes.
This is why almost 100% of experts use these types of systems.
Disaster assessment and maintenance services and solutions providers are dedicated to collecting information provided by manufacturers, then processing it and offering it to their customers in the form of a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, from the North American group Solera, is the leading company; 80% of the estimates are made with its products.
The other competing companies in the field of evaluation tools and the development of information on the sector are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data provided by manufacturers is far from simple.
According to Eduardo Vel<0xC3><0xA1>zquez, Sales Director of Audatex, the company in Spain with 63 manufacturers and importers, and each of them provides them with information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed continues to increase, so that in the last five years, more versions, variants and powertrains have been launched than in the previous fifteen years.
When a new car comes out on the market, these companies get to work.
This is a very difficult job, because you have to catalog each of the thousand parts of the vehicle and register its price.
In addition, a “smart” graphic image of each model is established on which one can click on the different parts of a tourist car.
If it is a massively sold model, the work can be ready in a week if the process progresses very quickly.
If it is a low-sale car, it can take three or four months. Currently, Audatex has complete information on 99.2% of cars marketed in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models, for example, they have information on Porsches, but not Ferraris or Lamborghini.
With regard to vehicles in circulation, the figure exceeds 99%.
To do the documentation and database development work, Audatex has eight centers spread around the world (in Spain, France, Germany, USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), and each of them specializes in certain brands.
The national headquarters is located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (usually mechanics experts) work simultaneously on three computer screens.
Audatex invests $90 million each year to develop these databases.
Every month, 2.5 million data is recorded, and customers receive updates every two days.
The development of this huge flow of information allows these companies to give them different uses and offer various products.
The most common application is about repair and maintenance, but depending on the country, there are also tools for handling broken parts or to calculate the venous or residual value of a car.
The only company that has a guide that informs about the value of used cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer it in our country, but it does in the United States.
In view of the products offered by Audatex, it is easy to get an idea of the type of support it can provide to professionals in the sector.
This company offers ten different tools, the flagship product being AudaPlus, the standard disaster assessment solution for experts.
It includes cars, motorcycles, light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it takes into account the estimated repair times by the manufacturer or the paint scales.
This tool is purchased according to its use, for each estimate.
The highest cost is 5.75 euros, for customers who use it little, a maximum of ten times per month.
Then, each insurance company, which carries out thousands of expertise, negotiates its price with Audatex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow the total identification of a vehicle and the equipment with which it came out of the assembly line, only thanks to its chassis number.
AudaGlass focuses on vehicle glasses, and AudaSubastas is an open server for the professional sector on the Internet that allows bidding on vehicles declared wrecks.
Its statistical service is very useful for identifying trends, conducting geo-demographic analyses or knowing common problems by brand or model.
It is possible to study, for example, how many models of a particular brand went to the garage for a breakdown or how many suffered serious damages for a given period.
GT Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of tool.
It markets, among other things, Gt Estimate, which is also intended for experts and provides digital images, as well as access to the official parts, prices and times of the manufacturer.
GT Motive is a company of the Einsa Group, founded in 1971, as a provider of services and solutions for damage assessment, breakdowns or maintenance.
The GT Evaluation Guide is a historical reference product on the market.
The company works with 24,000 users in garages, 3,100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Its turnover increased at a rate of 20% per year over the past three years, and it made a turnover of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>10.8 million in 2008.
At the beginning of last year, she began her process of internationalization, with the establishment of an office in Paris.
Audatex was born in Germany in 1966 and settled in Spain in 1979.
According to sources of the company, 62% of its turnover is realized in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38% in North and South America. It works with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 garages, of which 3,000 are located in Spain.
The global turnover of the Solera Group (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will be $557 million, up 3.3% from 2008.
In our country, the company will receive 19.1 million euros, or 7.2% more than last year.
In 2005, the Solera Group was listed on the US$1 billion stock exchange, today its shares are valued at a total of US$2,400 million.
Since 2007, it has been sidelined with the New York Stock Exchange and is part of the Standard & Poor's benchmark index.
Internet Auction of Accident Cars
Last October, the Solera Group bought Autoonline, an Internet platform for the sale of cars, motorcycles and special vehicles.
The transaction involved a cost of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>59.5 million for 85% of the company's capital, which could be expanded next year to the remaining 15%.
The goal of the acquisition was to offer more value-added services to its customers, with the possibility of accessing a huge international market.
This estimation and sales service is exclusively aimed at industry professionals, such as insurance companies, experts, rental companies, garages, cash registers and professional sellers who need to be registered before they start performing operations.
This platform was established in 1996 in Germany and manages more than 650,000 operations across Europe, including 500,000 in Germany.
Its main markets include Spain, Greece, Poland, and Turkey.
There are currently more than 1,500 sellers and 4,000 registered experts on the site.
It manages 3,000 ads per day and on the Spanish market, 100 new ads are published every day.
According to Spanish law, a car whose chassis number has been removed can no longer circulate, but on the other hand, some parts that are not damaged can be used as spare parts.
Collecting cars can be re-registered, although they have been removed, after complex procedures.
Garage quotes in four stages
With the Auda-Taller tool, the Audatex company ensures that the user gets a quote in just four steps: identify the vehicle, search for the spare part, create a quote and generate it.
Ease of use is an essential element of these systems, especially to convince older professionals who, to a greater or lesser extent, are reluctant to use new management techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, including 666 tourism, 109 off-road vehicles, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Of course, to use it, a computer and an Internet connection are required.
Once the model to be repaired has been identified by its chassis number, a real graphic image of the model in question appears and the required part is selected.
The user can include variables such as labor price, increases or discounts, then he can print the quote to hand it over to the customer.
AudaTaller is not an estimation tool like AudaPlus, but a reference catalog.
The main difference between these two systems is that the one intended for garages does not include the estimated working hours.
The cost of using this tool for the garage is 350 euros per year, which may be subject to a credit.
Currently, the company Audatex is working to make these images in three dimensions.
This is an innovation that mechanics see with a very good eye, since it will allow, for example, to select a door and turn it to see the inner face.
