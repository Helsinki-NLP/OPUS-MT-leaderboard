The Republican Party's Strategy Against Obama's Re-election
Republican leaders have justified their policies by the necessity of combating electoral fraud.
The Brennan Center, however, denounces such a fraud as a myth that election fraud is less common in the U.S. than the number of people who die from lightning strikes.
Republican lawyers have recorded only 300 cases of election fraud in the U.S. over the past decade.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on electoral participation.
In this sense, these measures will partially undermine the American democratic system.
Unlike Canada, in the United States, individual states are responsible for the organization of federal elections.
And in this spirit, most U.S. governments have been promulgating new laws since 2009, which make it harder to vote or register for an election.
This phenomenon was recorded in the aftermath of the November 2010 elections, during which 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states were added.
As a result, 180 bills restricting the right to vote in 41 states were submitted in 2011 alone.
The new electoral laws require voters to submit a photo ID and a U.S. citizenship document.
In addition, these laws restrict the period for early elections, invalidate the right to enroll in the list of voters on the day of elections, and deprive citizens of the right to vote by registering in the criminal register.
Prior to the 2006 election, no U.S. state required a photo ID to be submitted to voters.
The first state to implement this requirement was Indiana.
The Constitution of India was ratified by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2008.
The Republican authorities hastened to extend the process to other states.
Over the past two years, they have supported such bills in 34 states in order to force voters to submit photo IDs.
It should be noted that, unlike Quebec, U.S. citizens do not have a universal identity card, such as a health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of U.S. citizens, i.e. 21 million people of voting age, do not have a photo ID issued by their state government.
In addition, there are no such identity cards for about five million new voters in 2012.
In addition, the purchase of the required identity card often costs more than a hundred dollars.
The new restrictions are disproportionately affecting mainly young people, members of minorities and low-income people.
25% of African-Americans, 15% of people with income under $35,000; 18% of citizens over the age of 65, and 20% of voters between the ages of 18 and 29 therefore do not have the required photo ID.
And that's not all.
Students who are known as voters for their gift to Democratic candidates are not allowed in several states to use their identity card with a photograph exhibited by their school.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of hunting or fishing clubs who choose more Republican candidates to use the cards issued by these clubs in the elections.
Until 2004, no state required a nationality document in the elections.
The first such requirement was introduced by Arizona.
Since 2011, about 12 states have passed laws that require voters to prove they are U.S. citizens.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting the number of votes cast by the Hispanic minority.
It should be noted that two out of three Hispanics prefer the democratic side.
In 2011, Republican legislators backed laws in eight states that repealed voter registration on election day.
They also restricted the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to voters wishing to enroll.
These constraints have consequences.
For example, during the 2004 general election, campaigns for voter registration helped to register about 10 million people.
Measures taken after 2009, however, caused a 17% drop in the number of new voters registered in 2010 compared to 2006.
Republican lawmakers in the other five states then passed laws aimed at shortening the period for early elections.
For example, during the 2008 Florida general election, African-Americans made up 33% of voters who voted in advance, although African-American voters in that state were only 13%.
The same was true of the Hispanics.
They made up only 11% of all voters, but 24% of citizens who voted in advance.
On the other hand, whites, who represented 76% of all voters, made up only 46% of voters who voted in advance.
Of course, democratic legislators and their supporters have been very strongly opposed to passing laws that restrict the registration of voters.
Democratic governors have blocked several bills with their veto.
In order to suspend the most controversial laws, the U.S. Attorney General even intervened.
In some cases, they were able to limit the damage.
For example, laws requiring the submission of a photo ID only 16 of the 34 states adopted.
However, the newly introduced rules will inevitably make it difficult to exercise the right to vote in 2012.
Democratic critics primarily talk about the prerequisites of the passed laws and consider them an obvious attempt to influence the results of the 2012 elections in key states.
A 2011 Brennan Center report shows that the states where these laws were passed represent 171 of the 270 votes in the voter turnout needed to win the presidential election.
It is too early to declare with certainty that these legislative changes at the electoral system level will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential election.
But one thing is certain today: these new provisions will have an adverse impact on electoral participation.
In this sense, these measures will partially undermine the American democratic system.
Detection of prostate cancer: do an examination or not?
The PSA test produced flawed results, which were incorrectly negative or even incorrectly positive, which led to unnecessary medical interventions.
All this further increased the hesitancy of men who had already been so reluctant to go for examinations at all.
Let yourself be investigated or not?
We asked for the opinion of two experts.
In studies conducted in the United States, a high rate of contamination between the individual groups tested, it is therefore difficult to interpret these results and make valuable recommendations.
Another study, this time European, found a different mortality rate between the patients who underwent the examination and those who did not.
This study also showed that after a 12-year gap, those who did not go to the study had a 30 to 40% higher risk of metastases.
Therefore, I recommend an examination from the age of 50 or from the age of 40 if your immediate relative had prostate cancer.
The most endangered group is also African-American men.
The key is to make the right decision as soon as the cancer is discovered.
There are aggressive types of cancer and such types that are incurable.
Therefore, it is necessary to correctly explain to the patient the degree of danger of his type of cancer, offer him possible alternatives, do not necessarily treat prostate cancer, which does not have a long-term impact on life, and in these cases rather focus on active supervision of diseases.
Today, many men who have been diagnosed with cancer are not being treated because their type of cancer is not aggressive and does not threaten their lives.
We propose to them rather to carry out active supervision and in case of progression of the disease we offer them treatment.
More and more often and with greater accuracy, we define the criteria that help in deciding which species to treat and which not.
However, I recommend that you take an exam.
However, it is important to conduct an interview with a doctor and determine whether it is appropriate to undergo an examination or not.
In cooperation with the International Urological Society, the Movember movement has created a tool that allows evaluating for and against in connection with the PSA examination.

Preventing disease
Unfortunately, there is no miraculous procedure for the prevention of cancer.
Despite advances in research, it seems to be the best way to reduce the risk of disease by adopting healthy lifestyle principles.
It is estimated that if everyone ate healthy and moved enough, up to 30% of cancer cases could be prevented.
“If everyone stopped smoking, this figure would rise to at least 50%,” said André Beaulieu, a spokesperson for the Canadian Cancer Research Society.
On the other hand, it is estimated that about 10% of cancers are caused by heredity.
However, a percentage is still completely unexplained.
For the Canadian Cancer Research Society, smoking continues to be a priority, even as the number of smokers is decreasing.
Cigarettes account for 85% of lung cancer cases.
They are also a risk factor for several others.
This is extremely detrimental to human health.
"There are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec today," André Beaulieu said.
Exciting Fact: Ten years after a smoker stops smoking, the risk of dying from cancer is reduced by half.
Weight:
According to the SCC, obesity and obesity are another risk factor for the occurrence of the disease.
They increase the risk of breast, colon and rectum, esophagus, pancreas and uterus cancer.
“Research shows that regular physical activity protects against colon cancer for the rest of your life,” the report adds.
Nutritional
The organization also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
When consumed too high, it can lead to an increased risk of colorectal cancer.
It is also advisable to avoid lice for which the same applies.
Preserving meat by ingestion, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
“They can cause damage to the body’s cells and lead to the development of cancer,” the report adds.
Vitamins
Recently, various scientists have focused on the link between vitamin supplements and cancers.
However, the research has not yet come to any clear conclusions.
Studies focused on vitamin E are contradictory according to the SCC.
Although one of them says there will be a reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, other studies say it is more likely to increase.
Even the effect of vitamin D on cancer has not been clearly demonstrated.
Mr. Beaulieu further insists on the importance of talking about his concerns and family precedents with his doctor.
"To undergo an examination does not mean that you will have cancer."
Higgs boson explored
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs boson triggered a legitimate start last summer.
There is an opinion that this boson is involved in the mechanism that is responsible for all the matter in the universe.
And this is the last particle whose existence predicts a standard model - our best or "less bad" explanation of the nature and behavior of matter - which, however, has not yet been empirically observed.
However, there is still no 100% certainty among physicists that it is Higgs's boson.
There is no doubt that we have at our disposal an entirely new particle, which is very similar to the Higgs boson, as predicted by the standard model.
The new data released this week during the great physics congress in Kyoto confirms it, but it is still missing all the data so that we can be absolutely sure.
However, let’s assume it’s Higgs’s boson, since the risk of error appears to be small, and let’s look at what it actually is.
In this world, there is an absolutely undeniable law that says that two things cannot occur at the same time in the same place.
This rule cannot be bypassed – and don’t try too hard on it, otherwise you’ll get hurt.
Although particle physics is a very strange world, it turns out that a similar law applies to it: Pauli's principle of excretion, according to which two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time, if they are in the same "quantum state" - this "state" of the quantum state is roughly made up of them.
It divides the physics particles into two categories.
On the one hand, we will find organized citizens, or fermions, who obey the Pauli principle.
And at the other end there are bosons, subject to the anarchists, who do not appreciate anything at all - certainly not this principle, which means that they can be calmly in the same place at the same time.
These bosons are further divided into two groups according to the device (by the way), which is The Particle Adventure, in the laboratories of Berkeley: the mesons that we leave unnoticed here, and the "force particles" by which great natural forces are distributed, and with which Higgs's son is the god.
However, it must be said that these bosons are not as exotic animals as you might think.
If you are reading this article, it is thanks to a boson with an unusual banality: a photon, or "light particle", which is the "carrier" of electromagnetic force.
Because when a particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes its direction, it "disrupts" the electromagnetic field in this particular place, much like a rock thrown into a pond.
Electromagnetic waves (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.) are generated from this "disruption" and this wave is nothing but a photon - and therefore one of the bosons, "force carriers".
A more stable field
It is also the case with the Higgs boson, but with the difference that a different field, the Higgs field, is required to "disrupt" this boson.
This Higgs field is much, much more stable than an electromagnetic field; to excite it it is necessary to achieve very high energy values, much like the frozen level of a pond, already only a very large basin is blackening.
For this reason, it is necessary to use such a huge part accelerator as an accelerator in the CERN laboratory - a large Hadron accelerator with convex bands is a circle with a circumference of 27 km! - in order to develop such energy.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is used again to explain the relationship between Higgs and matter.
Neither all particles nor all materials react with an electromagnetic field.
Some, for example, magnets, do so, but others do not - a piece of paper, for example, will never be kept alone in the refrigerator.
And yet, not all particles react with the Higgs field: those that do, have a certain mass, while others (such as photons, let’s look at it) don’t.
And Mrs. Nov<0xC3><0xA1>kov<0xC3><0xA1> asks, what are all these researches that "will bring us"?
From the point of view of science, it is a confirmation of the validity of the standard model (SM), which allows physicists to examine any discrepancies between the observation and predictions of SM.
In addition, not many physicists literally wish to be able to find them, because the slightest difference could open up the space of "new physics" and close some gaps in the model.
It should be noted that the model still has huge flaws, it does not provide any explanation of gravity (hear!) or dark matter, which makes up about 80% of the cosmic matter (hear!).
However, the CERN facility has not yet discovered such contradictions.
Responsibilities
The responses of this research in the daily life of Mr. and Mrs. Nov<0xC3><0xA1>kov<0xC3><0xA1> can only be predicted very difficult, but it would be a mistake to assume that there will be none.
Look: In the early 1960s, pioneers of lasers in Bell's laboratories had no idea of the revolution that their work was already triggering.
They assumed scientific use, but nothing else.
Physicist Willard Boyle - who worked at Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who created the first permanent laser beam (previous beams were pulsed) in 1962, I've already said - the laser was initially considered such a "toy".
Just imagine that...
In addition, the application can also result from all the tools that surround the research.
For example, the same Willard Boyle created a small light sensor in 1969 during his work focused on optics.
This sensor, although Boyle hadn’t planned it at first, now serves as the “eye” of all digital cameras in the world and won him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2009.
Of course, this does not mean that activities around LHC necessarily have to change our lives, but it does mean that one really never knows...
Palliative care - The best way to get out of life... <0x7C> Le Devoir
Through its Commission for a Decent Death, Quebec has recently been involved in a crippling question concerning the end of life.
The debate should continue soon, and at the same time the bill is going to be drafted.
There is still a lot of work to be done in this crucial area.
Le Devoir magazine tried to look at this question in more detail.
Less than a few weeks ago, Mr. L. was still living alone in his apartment in Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that fed him gave him a two-year delay.
"They gave me five years of life and it's already seven," he says without emotion on his bed at the Victor-Gadbois palliative care house in Beloeil, where he came the day before.
"But it's still a shock, you can't prepare for this," he adds.
The disease has done its work: the immense weakness makes it impossible for him to take himself to the toilet or to eat himself.
Resignedly, he looks at the tasty looking breakfast and agrees that we will help him eat.
He is brave and even smiles, talks with strangers, stops at him, brings him drugs, offers him a bath.
Courage to an ordinary death.
"My biggest wish is to get rid of the diarrhea, it humiliates me," he confides.
A few hours later, a team of doctors found a cure for his problem.
“In one’s life, one learns that men urinate,” says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois facility.
Returning to the stage of a child is an unacceptable humiliation for some people.
"It depends on the abilities of the person" whether the return will be accepted, the psychologist claims.
In the opinion of many people who deal with palliative care, the crucial moments take place in the very core of such a return.
Patients who enter the home with palliative care Victor-Gadbois, all suffer from cancer.
Their prognosis is a maximum of three months of life.
At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses who care for them does not provide them with so-called "therapeutic" care.
In the case of Mrs. A., 89 years old, the worst fear is to die "of suffocation with full consciousness".
The disease has allowed me to discover my children.
"I have good kids," he adds.
"I don't have any wishes in life anymore," she says, and then she lets us put her breathing apparatus in.
However, he is still looking forward to the last visit of his son from Italy in the coming days.
In the Victor-Gadbois home, in cooperation with a group of volunteers, the body is provided with the help of nutrition.
This is what palliative care looks like if nothing else can be done.
To make death more comfortable.
In Québec, one bed of palliative care per 11,700 inhabitants falls.
That's very little if we realize that we're all going to die one day.
Here life continues in optimal conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors at home.
Whether it’s a level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
When a person dies, he can be given a brandy or pepsi, for example, according to his taste.
Diabetics may no longer have to monitor their sugar levels.
Death is a part of everyday life here.
They brought Mr. X's beer last night, who died later that night.
This morning, his son drinks beer in honor of his late father.
“We are helping patients as well as their loved ones,” says Nathalie Savard, Director of Care Services.
In Victor-Gadbois' home, days go by, but they don't resemble each other.
In addition to a thirty-nine-year-old man who rejoices in his last meeting with his family thoroughly grounded on pillows, while drinking to him in his honor, a sixty-year-old tragically dies of the possibility of converting to all his parents, a wife, and two children.
“For six months now, there have always been three to five beds that are designed for people with cancer under the age of 45,” says Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of patients who come to Victor-Gadbois’ home come from their homes, and 47% from hospitals.
Problems with access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, i.e. care designed to alleviate suffering once the sick person reaches the final stage of their life, whether at home, in the hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as Victor-Gadbois Home and the Society for Home Palliative Treatment of the Grand Montreal Area, specialize more or less exclusively in the care provided to oncological patients.
And it is this crucial lack of access to health care in Quebec that leads to the fact that many doctors specializing in palliative care are concerned about the adoption of the euthanasia and assisted suicide law.
Since October, a manifesto has been in circulation, signed by top palliative practitioners such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, in which they prove their disapproval of such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, Quebec’s health care system is not powerful enough to ensure everyone has access to quality palliative care before it is possible to agree to euthanize.
She says she recently experienced a patient who spent 14 days on the emergency room in huge pain, without anyone taking the necessary steps to relieve her.
It is feared that patients will not be asked to die because they do not receive adequate care.
And at the same time, many oncologists take care of their patients until the last minute, regardless of the adverse prognosis.
The chances of Hél<0xC3><0xA8>ne Richard's survival were already minimal when she left the demanding chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I had finished my treatment, she replied that she regretted that I had stopped fighting, she told us.
And she told me it was over!
There is no omnipotent care
Dr. Martel estimates that 90% of the patients who want to die thank their attending physicians for not fulfilling their wishes when a team of palliative bitches relieved their pain.
However, it is necessary to say that palliative care is not necessarily omnipotent in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care at the Grand Montreal Home Palliative Care Society, patients avoid pain treatment in 8% of cases.
At the very end of life, doctors often use palliative sedatives, which the patient sleeps until the moment he dies, either in a collision or whether the sedative is administered permanently.
It cannot be imagined that we do not perceive this part of suffering.
The patient, who will not be relieved of pain, will have more and more access to palliative sedatives.
The sick who are not given a sedative always say the same thing: "I want to die."
But that doesn’t necessarily mean “I want you to give me euthanasia,” rather, “I want you to get rid of my pain.”
The implementation of this report allowed a grant for journalists from the Canadian Institute for Health Research.
Extensive real estate scandals in Quebec
Travel officials, construction and public works entrepreneurs, political party lobbyists, and experts in the Italian mafia are still telling what they know about the amazing "system" that mixes construction, civil servants, public officials, and politicians.
This "area" came to Quebec taxpayers very expensive especially between 1990 and 2000.
“It’s interesting how the system has disintegrated since we’ve taken fundamental measures,” said Jacques Duchesneau, a Quebec lawmaker and former police chief in Montreal.
This led to a 2011 scandal based on a consistent investigation into the misappropriation of funds in connection with Quebec’s road construction contracts, which the then liberal Quebec Prime Minister Jean Charest approved only after long delays.
The Duchesneau report confirmed the direct link between industry, opaque party financing and corruption of government officials.
“Since the start of the investigation in 2010,” he says, “only the Department of Transportation has saved a billion dollars on contracts,” when some people kept their instincts on track to get a share of them!
Charbonneau’s commission “has already led to the resignation of two mayors,” adding that it will “discover the cunning of some people.”
Standing Corruption Combating Unit established in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, established in 2011, also engages in combat with its army of government inspectors, investigators and analysts.
In addition, the police “Marteau’s Family”, which since 2009 ensured that the Montreal “cash cartel” significantly mitigated the influx of orders...
In recent weeks, they have carried out a number of inspections and accused a number of municipal representatives of fraud and corruption, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a suburban municipality.
Next on the list is Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned as mayor of Laval, the third largest city in Quebec.
He is suspected of repeatedly accepting payments in exchange for public contracts.
Formal indictments have also been received by transport engineers from Montreal and entrepreneurs of Italian origin, such as Tony Accuras and Lino Zambito.
Lino Zambito sparked a sensation by explaining to the Commission the "system" of procurement.
During these years, he himself dedicated 3% of the value of the contracts he acquired in Montreal to a Mafia-linked broker who then transferred the money to the Union of Montreal, for which he was running Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
After 2000, Zambito was generous to all parties and devoted more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (approximately 68,000 euros) to the provincial parties, but especially to the liberals who were in power at the time.
He also admitted that he was organising illegal fundraising for former Liberal Vice Prime Minister Nathalie Normandeau.
Contracts with cash flows, the prices of which have exceeded
In Montreal, the “system” of corruption worked very chile.
Gilles Surprenant, a former transport engineer, described him in great detail before the commission: over ten years, he received gifts from construction companies, invitations to tours, golf tournaments, to restaurants, hockey matches and pockets worth a total of $736,000 in cash.
Other public officials in the transport sector admitted that they had to pay their rewards for overestimating invoices by 30% to 40% through untrue multi-tasking.
Mayor Martin Dumont's party organizer then accused Tremblay of unrepentantly closing his eyes on a simultaneous budget that brought dirty money into his treasury.
Based on these revelations, Tremblay resigned in early November, bringing Montreal into a massive crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was among the first Montreal MPs to issue a warning signal.
As mayor of the Rivi<0xC3><0xA8>re-des-Prairies district in the east of the island, it has been campaigning against the sale of municipal land purchased for $5 million and sold for... 1.6 million to promoters right in the middle of a thriving real estate business since 2010.
70% of dirty money in election campaigns
About the investigation, which will finally be launched, he says that "it draws behind the lines in an attempt to understand the functioning of the promoted ant system to stop gangrene and seize the culprits."
The process is “painful, but positive.”
We are in the wound-cleaning phase, but it is necessary to set up our own investigative unit in Montreal and to ensure supervision so that these dubious practices cannot return.
It's like cleaning up.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau himself says that “public officials have kidnapped hundreds of millions of dollars,” but he is particularly concerned about the role of “ambassadors informed of this lie” if they did not get into these checks!
He estimates that 70% of funding for Quebec’s election campaigns comes from dirty money, and ironically adds, “I heard it’s just a weak repudiation of reality.”
The Quebec government is proposing to limit donations to parties to $100, but it does not resolve the situation: "Until election spending is strictly limited, dirty money will disappear from politics."
It proposes a comprehensive control of the system of public procurement and party financing: "We can no longer go down; if we focus boldly on the essence of things, we can rebuild on a firmer basis and with greater control and compliance with the laws."
If this story has overshadowed the image of Quebec and Montreal abroad, Duchesneau recommends everyone who laughs at him to look at his own yard...
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
This season you and PSG have set a whole new tempo.
How do you explain this development?
It can be explained by the fact that all individuals have gone into themselves, or by a completely new dimension of PSG.
Big players have come to us.
I get along with them every day.
The technical team also helped me a lot.
Every day these facts allow me to increase the level of the game.
And it's easier in games.
In football, everything is going so fast.
I'm not losing my mind.
From my beginnings as a trainer at INF Clairefontaine to my transition to Saint-Etienne, I have always moved on an individual level.
So you're taking advantage of the competitive environment introduced by Carlo Ancelotti...
The efforts of this summer are used to playing matches at a very high level.
They also know that every workout is essential.
And it follows that a player like me then has a greater appetite for the game and wants to give maximum performance.
And besides, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot in terms of my position.
He has assistants like Claude Makelele, who played on the same post as me.
And does Ancelotti have the decisive word at the right time?
Oh, sure.
Ancelotti has the respect of all technicians.
Today he has no equal in the 1st league and is among the best European coaches.
He has a lot of experience and has won a lot of titles with top teams.
He also worked with excellent players.
I think he’s going to win more titles in Paris.
In January, I had a calming conversation with him.
I've had a number of injuries.
The trust it gives me is another reason for my performance.
What do you think of the first season of PSG?
In the first league, Lyon took the lead.
But we're still hanging out.
One of our main goals is the Champions League: we moved very easily to the finals.
What is your club’s goal in this competition?
We'll try to go as far as we can.
Anything can happen now.
But we certainly want to be a tough competitor for high-quality European teams.
We want to win our qualifying team in front of Port first, so we can play in return at home.
Can PSG become a big European club in the short term?
The budget is already...
In order for Paris to become a great European club, it must win titles and enter history.
That's not the case today.
On the financial side, PSG has the means to achieve this goal.
And would it be a big failure not to win in the 1st league as it did last season?
Of course, that would be a big disappointment.
We really want to win a league title this year.
We were still missing a lot last season.
In May, we were disappointed because we were determined to win.
We had a great season.
We have scored 79 points.
Usually, with 79 points you are a clear master...
But another club, Montpellier, had an even more amazing season.
I think it will be successful this year.
“Although great teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are trying to win the title, I think we have the weapons at our disposal to defeat them.
Do you think the media expects too much from PSG?
It is not unusual to expect a lot from us given what has been invested here and what players we have.
We totally accept that.
The fact is, if we beat Troyes 4-0 at home and still find something in the newspapers, it's not exactly pleasant.
You ask yourself, what more people might want from you.
Of course, you can’t win 4-0 every weekend.
We are not FC Barcelona.
We're trying to set up a game style.
You need time to build a team.
In the Champions League, we proved that we can play.
Take a look at Manchester City, who didn’t make it to the finals for the second season, but also invested a lot of money!
Due to the amount invested, you could expect to have 15 points ahead of the others!
You're insulting the other clubs and the French league.
The clubs of Lyon and Marseille, which did not do much last season, moved to the next phase with the new PSG.
This shows how amazing the 1st League is.
I hope that in May we will be able to smile and say that in spite of all the difficulties, we have managed to win.
It seems as if PSG relied on Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s performances in everything.
It is good that it is said that there is an "addiction to Zlatan".
This means that Ibrahimovi<0xC4><0x87> is very powerful and gives a lot of goals.
That's why he came here to prove he's a star of the first league.
Everywhere he went, he proved himself to be a great player, a world star.
In our team, we respect both the player and the player.
He also respects the people around him.
What he has achieved is truly exceptional.
This also led others to increase their own level of the game.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, also allows others to grow alongside him.
How did you experience Euro 2012 with the French national team?
As a disappointment.
I really wanted to play in this tournament.
Unfortunately, due to the injury, I could not play as I imagined.
But I've experienced it, and I've come out stronger.
Today, I also play good matches in the national team.
And I've been hoping for that since I got to the national team.
We have learned from what happened in Ukraine, and today we owe ourselves to make our performance exemplary.
How do you look at the first months of Didier Deschamps leading the national team?
The results speak for him.
In qualifying for the MS, we are in the right place.
The coach chooses strictly, they are close to the players and can inspire for victory.
And so was Laurent Blanc.
I don't want to compare them.
Blanc achieved his goal by qualifying for the Euro.
I hope Didier Deschamps will bring our team to Brazil.
Is the 1:1 draw of October 16 in Spain a solid starting match?
This game has given us confidence.
We all fought for the team.
Before this shock in Spain, I have not experienced such a match in my career.
Bitcoin allows you to pay and sell without a bank
All the negatives of current financial transactions based on central banks, identified transactions and the costs of processing between recipients.
As it is often true within these technologies, there is a clear political outlook: the belief that the existing financial system built on banking monopolies leads to financial crises.
Bitcoin, whose inventor is Satoshi Nakamoto (pseudonym), represents both virtual money (but transferable to dollars, euros...) and a secure transfer protocol similar to BitTorrento, which allows file exchange between the pairs of partners.
Thanks to 15,000 computers connected to the network, approximately 200,000 transactions have already been registered.
About a thousand websites already accept bitcoins as gifts or as a means of payment.
The price of bitcoin first reached a maximum of $30 (23 euros) in June 2011, five months later it fell to $2, today it is moving at the border of about ten dollars (a summary of the rates is shown on bitcoincharts.com).
Compared to the world’s exchange for real money or financial products, this is nothing impressive.
And yet the European Central Bank (ECB) is interested in this fact in its report on virtual finance, which was released in October.
Bitcoin describes itself as “the most unsuccessful virtual money”, “competitive dollar and euro” and “a common money trick.”
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual money in that it is like “credits” used to proceed in a video game that a person gets a game or can buy (and sometimes exchange it back).
The social network Facebook has also developed a similar system.
Each month, however, the central authority monitors and processes individual communications.
In the case of Bitcoin, all network nodes are book depositors of ordinary accounts, controllers, money issuers, and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users actually takes place between two e-mail addresses by e-mail.
However, the user can choose a different address for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity.
A file of information related to this transaction is electronically signed by a dual-key encryption system.
In this way, the network can verify the transaction’s eligibility.
Thanks to the contents of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the exchanged bitcoins exist in the public ledger of ordinary accounts, which is distributed throughout the network.
The key phase is to record this new transaction in this book.
It takes place by solving a mathematical task assigned to computers, the solver of which, some temporary central banker, will be entitled to fill this additional line.
This is the cutting phase of a file; i.e. the transformation of a huge file into a shorter and unique digital footprint.
Computers "take over" this new transaction and add a number to it, only then they "split up" the whole.
The goal is to find a number that provides a specific print (e.g. zero at the beginning).
Once this number is found, the other nodes easily check its accuracy.
The transaction will then indestructibly appear connected to the chain of all other transactions; any modification would have changed the print.
If the user wants to pay twice the same money for fraudulent purposes very quickly (up to ten minutes), the network will only confirm one of the two transactions - the second will be abandoned because each of them has a different footprint.
The computer that solves the challenge will win 50 bitcoins.
In order to prevent inflation, this reward is divided regularly into two, probably by the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is thus limited to 21 million, but can be divided by up to a hundred million, so the space for margin here is...
The difficulty of a given task also increases with the increasing level of calculation.
The network has already experienced its ups and downs.
Websites that provide services for Bitcoin have been hacked and there has been a robbery of stored bitcoins.
“The used coin does not concern the protocol itself,” says Pierre Noizat, who founded Paymium, a real-money payment company using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also monitors the possibility of laundering dirty money thanks to this anonymous service.
But this problem also applies to cash.
Notable players such as Wikipedia reject the gifts of this nature.
Others, like the WordPress blogging platform, accept them.
Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizmann Institute in Israel recently analyzed a book of ordinary accounts and proved that almost 80% of bitcoins are not circulating.
In November, “huge discounts” were launched.
“Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged,” says Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul dealing with the conversion of bitcoins to gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of a pedagogical book about this money, has great confidence in the potential of this technology as a transactional network.
Its system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (with real money) or contactless mobile payment, but uses the Bitcoin system to authenticate transactions that are cheaper as a result.
In addition, the carrier manages its identity and can thus remain anonymous.
The system is easily set up for merchants where there is no need to install new terminals or software.
It is enough to provide an address that can be "photographed and recognized" by the phone, Pierre Noizat said, adding that he already has thousands of users.
There is a general movement of questioning of hierarchical systems and the transition to more horizontal systems.
“Before Bitcoin is implemented, it will take a while, but 2013 could be decisive,” he predicts.
Furthermore, in its report, the ECB envisages a reassessment of the various risks that are now considered to be increased if this type of money is successful.
We're out of Afghanistan.
What's next?
French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and U.S. troops are expected to follow by the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to take control of its territory and for the Afghans to choose their own future and not expect everything from us.
The people in the Afghan countryside suffered the most damage, which we punished because we considered them terrorists.
And we, too, have lost 88 soldiers killed, and all of them wounded and crushed.
The Taliban are made up of foreign extremists, former leaders who have fled to Pakistan, but they are often rural people who reject the presence of foreign armies as in Soviet times.
They just want to defend their ancient and archaic traditions, even though jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks have joined them.
They now experience tolerance and frequent help from local rebels, but if Western forces withdraw, their support will decline.
The departure of the French troops from the Nijrab base, which I watched from the tops of the mountains planted by almonds thanks to French loans, was arranged.
Convoys of trucks and armored vehicles arrived in Kabul without being attacked by a helicopter.
From the end of 2014, the Taliban will no longer be so active in Kabul.
Since their unstoppable process in 1994 to 1996, the conditions have changed considerably.
At that time, Kabul was empty and the land was in blood and fire as a result of fighting between different resistance groups.
Their takeover of control of the country was then considered as a kind of liberation, a return to security.
The Afghans paid the price for the eclipse of these rural people, who were completely controlled by Al-Qaeda, but their situation has not improved until our time.
The former Mujahideen, the Afghan government and the current Taliban agree on an effort to keep women in a subordinate position.
The main deputies from the war against the Soviet forces returned to power in 2001.
They became merchants, took over state land that they sold as construction land to refugees from Iran and Pakistan, and took advantage of huge U.S. contracts for subcontractors.
They discredited themselves; most of them were never even in combat.
According to what I've heard in the campaigns, people yearn for a government that won't be formed by thieves.
Many young people want to leave as those who have been able to take advantage of American generosity will leave: the escape of capital is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and its associated ideologies.
During their exiles in Iran or Pakistan, they knew the modern world and were fascinated by its benefits.
About 65% of the population is under the age of 25; Kabul currently has a population of 5 million, a fifth of the total population.
In the cities, public schools are full, girls and boys go there.
These young people will have to be given work, they no longer want to return to the eclipse of the former parties or to the corruption of some representatives.
Everyone, including the armed opposition, likes mobile phones; television and Turkish TV shows that show the modern world, they watch everywhere.
The army is already present.
Will the authorities that stand at the forefront of it be considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the war against the Soviet army are already restoring provincial militias that will be out of control of central power.
Afghanistan, a mountainous country with a strong local identity, should enjoy some degree of decentralization following the example of Western states, but the US wanted to turn it into a centralized state with a strong presidential influence, so the post of prime minister, which existed in the state of 19th century, was abolished.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, especially not on the occasion of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, his country has been heavily dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and earlier.
No industry has been able to restore, no dam is working, no essential irrigation system is repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced except fruit and vegetables.
Priority is a private initiative.
In a country destroyed by three decades of wars, governmental control of infrastructure would be necessary.
Rumors have spread that Afghanistan has a huge wealth of impoverished wealth.
And it just gave me the feeling that the western states were here just to take over it.
Without energy to process iron ore ore or copper on site and without means to transport raw materials across mountains, however, no mining of gravel can take place.
The Chinese have almost abandoned the Mes Aynak copper mine and given international archaeological teams (supported by the World Bank) the opportunity to explore the vast Buddhist area to retain the role of the most important employer in the province.
One day, it will also be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which a large part of imports and exports depend, to restore normal relations.
The departure of the French forces was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement envisages the continuation of common types of assistance: girls' and boys' lycea, French departments at universities, French institute, military, legal, health and agricultural cooperation, support for archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, there has been an initiative "to gain heart and soul" trying to reconcile the difficult task of helping and military activities, within which the service "civil-military steps" of the Ministry of Defense (Cimic) was then operated in the field of the Confederate troops, which was not abolished in the field of France in 2012.
These works, involving a large number of local workers, helped to suppress the uprising: irrigation, wells, drinking water, foresting, fruit trees, soil protection and the expansion of the cropland.
What memory do we leave behind after two billion euros of military spending?
A much more modest budget would contribute to improving local living conditions, which are very challenging in these valleys, which are often at altitudes above 2,000 m.
The embassy received dozens of written requests for small-scale agricultural aid from local communities in the province of Kapisa.
In order for these farmers to be free from insurrections led by foreign groups, they wish, in their words, to obtain a small amount of civic assistance in their favour, which would be properly monitored and touched directly.
Difficult work on the Egyptian Constitution
President Muhammad Mursi has moved on to the next game of poker.
While Egypt remains the most divided in its history due to the proclamation of a constitution that temporarily grants it unlimited powers, it has decided to play a vabank.
On Wednesday, he announced, regardless of the opinion of all others, that the Constituent Assembly will approve the final text the next day.
Less than a week ago, the head of state granted this meeting another two months to complete the necessary work.
For almost two years, Egypt has been using a provisional text, which has been supplemented many times, weakening the country’s constitutional stability and leading to legal agreements.
This new initiative has only further strengthened the country’s fragmentation.
From the opposition point of view, the president continues in his "autocratic delirium", continues to "violate his word" and "weakens the law".
However, his supporters assure that it is a means of tackling the constitutional and political crisis as quickly as possible and accelerating the transition process.
There should be a referendum in two weeks.
This is a very short period of time that will force the Brotherhood to withdraw from the intention of explaining the text to the Egyptians article by article.
For the president, it is also a way to regain national and democratic legitimacy, while the whole country is rejecting protests.
As confirmed in an interview with the American weekly Time, Muhammad Mursi seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote in favour.
Particularly because this hastily organized vote puts the Egyptian people before an ultimatum: “Either approve my text, or I will have unlimited powers”, which should otherwise end after the adoption of the new constitution.
And in this special atmosphere yesterday, 85 members of the above-mentioned Constituent Assembly, with a large majority of Islamists, approved the text.
Most of the Liberals were absent in the vote.
In mid-November, not long before the constitution was announced, they knocked on the door with no opportunity to express their views.
Human rights defenders, civil society or members of religious minorities imitated their step.
In order to achieve resilience, 11 people from the ranks of substitutes were quickly supplemented yesterday morning.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
It is not surprising, then, that the articles of the Constitution were often voted unanimously.
Commentators further suspended the fact that one of the many disputes that day revolved around... hours of prayer, when some members of the committee argued that the hours in the meeting room were not properly arranged.
The text, which was voted on last night, consists of 234 articles.
The subject of general attention, Article 2, ultimately remains consistent with the 1971 version of the Constitution and states that "the principles of sharia law are the main source of law".
The Salafist parties, for which the introduction of Islamic law is one of the key requirements, hoped to replace the term "basic" with the term "rules", which would allow stricter application.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been corrected is a sign of their good will and respect for other parts of Egyptian society.
“Hypocrites,” oppose the liberals, who see only the rhetorical problem in it.
According to them, the Islamization of the Constitution takes place through other articles.
They focus in particular on Article 220, which entrusts al-Azhar University with an advisory role, in particular on matters of checking compliance with Sharia law.
According to Egypt expert Sophie Pommier, it is disturbing because "the people elected to speak are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
You can see the beginnings of theocracy.”
The fears of liberals are even more exasperating by the fact that the next rector of the university should be less moderate than the current one.
“So far, there has been no specific religious repercussions.
By virtue of this constitution, Egypt remains a civil state.
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text are not Ulamians, but university workers, many of whom have graduated in French schools," said Alexis Blouet, who is preparing work on the constitutional transition in Egypt.
However, he agrees that "there may be contradictions as to the interpretation of Article 220, since the terms used in it belong to the religious dictionary.
In particular, there is a reference to "fiqh" [Islamic legal science, ozn. red.].
And in the future, the question may arise, to what extent civil judges are competent to express themselves.”
The text approved yesterday, in addition to the religious pages, is highly criticised for the extended powers granted to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood insists that there has been a significant restriction on them compared to the former regime.
Another controversial place: the powers entrusted to the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military representatives, the verification of the defense budget will not be carried out by the parliament, but by the National Defense Council.
Furthermore, military courts will not prohibit the treatment of civilians, as demanded by the Association for the Protection of Human Rights.
These associations speak of their doubts in the context of the text, which they believe is directed against freedom.
The criminal act of harassment is preserved and the insult continues to be prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially for the press.
In addition, no article deals with the protection of women, emphasizes Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture referred to in Article 36.
This word was not mentioned in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian president was scheduled to speak on television last night, protests are scheduled for this afternoon.
The supporters of the head of state will then demonstrate on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists are waiting for holy places, the butterfly of the world and the sea from a saturated solution of salt
The Promised Land combines the size of biblical truths, modern comfort and intact nature.
AaF has identified five of the most important reasons why you should visit Israel.
Worshiping the Holy Places
Visit the Jordan River, where Jesus was baptized.
It is claimed that to all who enter this "race" the mercy of God descends.
And Galilee - the place of Jesus' miracles: turning water into wine at the wedding, walking on water, calming the storm and filling the nets.
Here, too, Jesus appeared to His disciples and after the Resurrection.
But the most holy places are in Jerusalem.
Believers here will pass through the Way of Pain, or the Way of the Cross of Jesus (Latin: Via Dolorosa).
It begins at the fortress of Antonia - Pretoria - where the trial took place, passes through the streets of the Old City, and leads to the Temple of the Tomb of God on Mount Golgotha - to the place of crucifixion, to the stone of anointing, and to the place where Jesus was buried.
Here is the symbolic Christian doll of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of mankind.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem was built in the place where, according to Christian legend, the tree from which they made the cross to the crucifixion of Jesus grew.
In Jerusalem there is also the most sacred place for the Jews - the Wall of Complaints, the rest of the temple that was destroyed by the Romans in 70 A.D.
According to tradition, people of different denominations here leave notes with wishes, which are then fulfilled.
Taking the Path to the Vertical
The ruins of Masada's fortress remained a secret hideout from the enemy that Herod the Great built in 25 BC for his family.
The ruins are located on cliffs in the mountains at an altitude of 450 m above sea level.
Only those who are engaged in climbing can reach it with their own strengths.
The others will be taken to this historic mountain by a rope.
And in the north of the country, at an altitude of 1600-2040 m there is the famous ski resort Hermon, which experiences a huge influx of tourists in the winter months.
A shuttle bus transports tourists to this ski paradise from the foothills of the hill.
The total length of the mountain slopes is 45 km.
According to ancient legend, the pagan gods were supposedly living on the top of the mountain.
Visiting Unique Museums
There are about 300 museums in this country.
You can’t visit all of them in one trip.
But at least five of them, the most interesting, are definitely worth a visit.
Among them is the Museum of Israel, which is located near the Knesset (parliament).
It contains ancient Cumberland manuscripts or scrolls from the Dead Sea, which were found in the caves of the Jewish Desert, and about 500,000 archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
The Museum of Art in Tel Aviv is also worth a visit.
In his exhibition, the Impressionists and Expressionists Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall, Picasso are widely represented.
In Akkon you can visit the Al Basha Museum, which presents to visitors several rooms of ancient Turkish spas with figurines of spa users and spa nurses from that time.
In Caesarea, a unique private Rally Museum is worth a visit, where you can admire the statues of Dal<0xC3><0xAD> and Roden.
There are no guides or souvenir shops here.
Entrance is free and gifts are strictly refused.
The Fifth Museum - the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv - tells about one of the most dramatic pages in history.
The most tragic part of the museum - the Children's Memorial - was built in memory of 1.5 million children who were murdered in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You will go inside - and you will find yourself in complete darkness.
The stars are blinking.
The names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they died.
Ukraine is also mentioned here.
Improving Your Health
The three main resorts of Israel are located on the Mediterranean, Red and Dead Sea coasts.
Each of them offers swimming pools, water parks, dolphins and oceanariums.
Interestingly, you can swim in the Red Sea even in the winter months, because the water temperature in it does not fall below 21 degrees Celsius and the air warms up to 23 degrees.
The Dead Sea is even warmer, and people bathe in it all year round.
The Dead Sea is by the way the most peculiar sea in the world, located at the lowest point of the planet - at a level of 417 m below sea level.
The azure water in it is a saturated saline solution that easily keeps even people who can’t swim on a level.
The surrounding landscape is unrealistically beautiful.
Go here to undergo treatment with the use of salt water - brine, and medicinal sludge, which can treat health problems with dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes, to cure your hearing nerves.
Touch the Mystery of the Ancient Past
It is protected by the ancient part of Tel Aviv - the town of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
They were crossed by a famous sea route connecting Egypt, Syria, Anatolia, and Mesopotamia.
The mentions of this city are found in the oldest Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, this is the place where Noah built his ark and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with whom they lived a long and happy life.
Tourists indeed love toys in the narrow streets, named after the signs of the zodiac.
It is said that if you press against the walls in the alley of the "your" sign, your luck will be favorably inclined.
In Jaffa, you may meet newlyweds who come here from all over Israel and even from other countries to be photographed.
And in Caesarea - in the city of King Herod - you can walk through the Roman theater and "take" the fortress of the crusaders.
In Roman times, Caesarea was the capital of Judea and the seat of Roman prosecutors, including Pontius Pilate.
The carefully reconstructed theatre is used today for evening concerts and opera performances.
Tourists, in a word
If you are going to Israel, you do not have to worry about your imperfect English: in this country about 30% of the population speaks Russian.
On the way it is better to take money not in euros, but in dollars that you can easily exchange for shekels (now there is 1 dollar about 3.8 shekels).
There are mainly buses, but in Jerusalem there is a high-speed tram and in Haifa there is the only metro line in the country with six stations that connect the lower city to the upper.
It's basically an underground cable car.
Travelling by all types of urban public transport costs 6 shekels, for which you can drive with a seating 1.5 hours.
In Israel, according to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is celebrated on the Sabbath.
From Friday evening until sunset on Saturday, it ceases to work in markets, in shops and in public transport.
And on Sunday morning, the work week begins.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels you will only get kosher food: with the exception of pork, seafood, fish without rinds and dishes containing combinations of milk and meat.
They offer a large selection of dishes from lamb and beef, soups and desserts, prepared from coconut milk, traditional Jewish chashi hummus, various types of sauces, balls from milled chickpeas - falafel, fruit and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs on the streets of Israel.
That’s why there are a lot of fertilized cats here who gracefully “walk according to their taste”.
In the evenings, you can see them sleeping on the roofs of parked cars.
Predatory cats love populated places and with taste they are allowed into every delicacy.
Renting a car will cost from $37 per day (Hyundai Getz) to $188 per day (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Plus insurance - $15 per day.
And renting a bike will cost around 15 shekels a day.
Tickets to museums cost an average of 30 shekels.
Expressed Numbers
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
Recognizing the country and rest came the most citizens of the USA, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine.
The promised country visited 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists from January to October 2012, which is 51% more than in the same period in 2010, before the visa cancellation on February 9, 2011.
"Big and powerful" announces it to Moscow: emigrants will save money on language
While MPs and human rights defenders are still debating the law on compulsory language tests, there have already been scammers in the country who sell “fake” certificates.
Every year, 13 million foreign workers arrive in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to make enough money to support families at home.
On December 1, the law came into force, according to which every working migrant will be required to pass the exam of Russian language proficiency.
For the time being, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the services, housing and municipal sectors, lifestyle and retail.
However, the FMS promises that in time, the relevant tests will be mandatory for all visitors.
However, the exams will consist not only of language skills, but also of Russian history and the foundations of law.
Language skills will also need to be confirmed in order to obtain and extend a work permit.
The exception applies only to citizens of countries where Russian is the official language.
This law does not apply even to people who successfully achieved certification and obtained an academic diploma until the dissolution of the USSR in 1991.
Use, Conviction and Protection of Rights
The network of test sites will work under the auspices of Pushkin’s Institute of Russian Language, the University of Friendship among Nations, the Moscow State University, the State University of St. Petersburg and other Russian universities.
Migrants can pass exams in all cities; already more than 160 such centers are open in Russia.
The initiative to support the introduction of testing was also supported by the members of the State Duma and the FMS (Federal Migration Service).
But before the law came into force, human rights defenders were able to ask the press many times the question: and what will it actually bring?
What will change the obligation to know the language for the Russians and for the visitors themselves?
So, most importantly, according to the representatives of the migration service, it will reduce the number of people suffering as a result of "other work."
Many people today talk about the protection of the rights of migrant workers, explains Viktor Sebelev, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the FMS of Russia in Tajikistan.
The protection of their rights should be started before they leave.
Only an organized recruitment system will allow 90% of the problems of foreign workers to be solved.
Problems arise in emigrants without a profession, without education, who do not know the language and do not have a medical examination.
Without knowledge of the language - he says with conviction Sebelev - the future migrant is condemned to clashes with dishonest people, who, under the pretext of helping him, will secure a "command" to the terrible, narrow shelters, in which he will be 14 and dozens of other documents without him until the month, as he himself, pays.
We receive a lot of complaints from our migrant workers.
"They promise one thing in their homeland, but when they arrive they will be deceived, they will confiscate their passports, they will not pay the promised wages," Tolib <0xC5><0xA0>aripov, head of the Tajik Labour Migration Administration, said in a statement.
Don't give up!
Less so, many citizens of the Central Asian republics, who intend to go to Russia for work, recognize that they not only do not know the language of the country they want to get to, but do not even have experience with a given job.
Of course, it is not their fault, but rather an accident: only very few Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford at least a reasonable basic education.
After all, their families also need something to feed their children, not to mention the fact that they need to be properly dressed, dressed, and equipped for school.
As children grow to a productive age, they must go to work at the first opportunity.
Without knowledge of the language it is difficult - they admit.
"You feel humiliated and degraded."
It is true that with regard to the Law on Language Testing, human rights defenders point to one important thing.
Testing will be carried out only for those migrants who have a legal status.
If they don't have it, they won't pass the exams, and they won't get any more official work.
In the meantime, the majority of migrant workers are living in Russia illegally as they were in the past.
"Welcome, or Unauthorized Entry Prohibited"
Many of the incoming workers say that getting official status in our country is not at all easy.
The reason - bureaucratic obstacles and all those language difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money: from 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
But a fake registration can be obtained quickly and only one and a half thousand.
Russian police officers know that we have essentially fake documents, without registration, and that is why there are cases of extortion.
"They require a hundred, two for cigarettes, tea," Umed Chuskadamov, a citizen of Tajikistan, told reporters about his experience.
"Come on, don't be lazy, buy a painting"
On the first day of the language law, it was found that false documents of migrants are not only documents of registration.
FMS employees have already obtained several false certificates for the completion of the language test.
Forged documents are printed on plain color printers.
Of course, they did not get to the new owners for free: each of the migrants in the hope that it will facilitate the problem of passing tests, paid for this document seven thousand rubles.
This is two and a half times the amount of the official test: it will cost migrant workers 3,000 rubles.
The main task of the near future is thus to secure the system from corruption, so that workers cannot simply buy documents, government officials and human rights defenders agree.
Meanwhile, government authorities can promise foreign workers who did not pass the tests for the first time, the time it takes to complete the basics course in Russian.
Visitors who do not speak Russian are expected to work in areas where there is no need to actively negotiate with people.
MVD (Ministry of the Interior) does not bring into circulation the illegal arms market
The proportion of criminal offences involving the use of legally held weapons is very low
MVD Russia is presenting a proposal to tighten the law in relation to the owners of civilian weapons.
It is a reaction of the government authorities to recent events: the instigation of the shootings at weddings, which took place without victims, and the massacre prepared by Moscow lawyer Dimitri Vinogradov, which resulted in the deaths of seven people.
Police want to ban the wearing of dangerous weapons in public places and increase the age from which a license to carry weapons can be obtained - from 18 to 21 years.
The idea is supported by the head of the Duma Security and Anti-Corruption Committee, Irina Jarovaja, who promised that changes to the Weapons Act will be submitted to the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is satisfied with the fact that the Russian state authorities are trying to deal with the problem by "throwing the screws".
An open letter has appeared in the network, the authors of which - representatives of various social shooting organizations - demand the rejection of the "nonsense tightening" of the law.
The percentage of smuggling with registered weapons is minimal, said Vasily Lesnikov, a lawyer and criminalist in an interview with the Russian BBC.
According to statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, 142 offences were committed in the six months of 2012 using firearms registered by the bodies of the Ministry of the Interior, while a total of 1168 thousand offences were committed during the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that the tightening of the legislation in the field of civil weapons does not make the perpetrators move to the "black" market.
According to their words, at present, any weapon can be found in Moscow at a low price.
Currently, the Ministry of the Interior claims that the situation with the spread of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from the races to the officers
The "black" market with weapons is supplied with several channels.
The main channels are five, says Colonel Victor Baran<0xC4><0x9B>c, who worked for ten years at the workplaces of the Ministry of Education and General Staff.
Screenshot of the pages that accept orders of weapons
The first of them - "military or military road", that is, a weapon that was withdrawn during the fighting in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were also stolen by Russian officers and the Caucasians themselves," says Baranec.
Another type of "black weapons" are weapons stolen by criminals from security officials.
Baranec explains that this includes thefts from police warehouses and weapons stolen directly from employees of the authorities involved in criminal proceedings.
Illegal "mainly" get on sale from military warehouses.
In many military warehouses, explosions often occur.
“It’s been proven that some fires were set up intentionally – to cover up the manke,” says the former soldier.
According to Barance, the arms manufacturers are also making their contribution.
“Currently, private arms companies are being created that are not competitive in the international market, and they are discarding the weapons they supply to the black market, including Moscow,” he said.
Another source of "black market" is smuggling.
A particularly large number of guns and machines come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.
“There’s their production, sometimes the weapons are produced in small-scale production, and the mafia has formed that organized their smooth production,” explains the former soldier.
Where's the gun coming from?
Experts have summed up the approximate share of individual sources of illegal arms supplies to the "black" market.
The report on this issue was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Public Administration Design.
The specialists analyzed the reports of the Ministry of the Interior and the Russian Statistical Office, criminological literature and data on public data portals focused on the topic of weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, according to researchers, come from military and executive bodies.
Half of all weapons were found on the black market "by officials whose work is linked to weapons," the report said.
According to data available to researchers, 17% of weapons come from armed conflicts, in 14% of cases there was the theft of weapons during their manufacture, 5% is "black archaeology".
The salesman-consultant of one of the arms stores, who asked us not to mention his name, is convinced that the weapons found in black "archaeology" excavations long ago no one buys - they're just too old.
Most of the time, he says, sellers go directly to military warehouses for new shipments.
Through the flagship, the interested party will buy a unit, such as a TT gun.
You order a gun from him and he sells it to you through the fence.
"He'll take her to the city and sell her for 900 euros for a piece with two tanks," he says.
"The truth is that the police are good in the picture, and therefore whenever they start burning their plan in the light of criminal acts, they will make a check purchase from illegal arms dealers," the advisor adds.
"Like in a luxury store"
Sellers and buyers often find each other through their acquaintances.
I visited websites and blogs until there was a guy who offered me the opportunity to go to the "Experimental" platform, where there will be a man who would take me to the "corner" where we will act together.
I learned the price mainly until then.
Military reporter Viktor Baranec
If I want to get a gun, I need a friend who knows the way out, says the salesman - a counselor. - I have such a friend, but I do not trust him fully.
The sellers in the market are, but there is also a need to go, hypothetically "from Mr. Ivan Ivanovich, who asked me to deal with the daughter's tooth has fallen out."
And now I'm going to get there through the person I'm sure of.
He'll only give it to me because he knows I won't give it to him.
Beginners are looking for weapons in a variety of ways.
Former soldier Viktor Baranec tried to buy illegal weapons in the mid-1990s, when he was working to publish on the subject.
The schematics did not change according to his words.
They gave him an album with photographs where it was "everything you thought of".
"I felt like I was in a luxury store," the soldier recalls.
The buyer, according to the word Baran<0xC4><0x9B>ce, does not offer rabbits in a bag - you can try everything.
I, a potential client, just don't buy - we're going with the seller to the woods and we're going to build a target.
"They give me the opportunity to shoot, and when I'm convinced that the gun is shooting well, we're starting to act," he said.
Tray on the sofa
Search engines on the Internet will take you to websites and groups on "Contact", where it is offered to buy weapons "for different purposes".
No documents or personal meetings are required for this.
"It's enough to have a certain amount of money," they write in the ad title on the website "Buy a combat gun or machine gun".
On this site, users leave their notifications and ask questions.
And the sale to minors?
"Of course without a license," asks the user "Ivan" (the inscription is preserved).
"I buy TT.Moscow" - briefly formulates the request "Fedorenkov."
The Federal Security Service has recently decided on a huge network of stuck websites and people who want to buy a military weapon can grab a shovel.
People swarm like hungry fish in a trench, and then they catch coal in Siberia.
Military intelligence officer and senior military officer Viktor Baranec
I have heard of such schemes: websites are usually registered outside the scope of the Russian laws.
People are taking orders.
The buyer makes the payment via ATM.
"In response, the seller will send him a photo and a description with instructions on where the weapon is hidden," said Dmitry Kislov, a spokesperson for the NGO "Right to Weapons".
Viktor Baran<0xC4><0x9B>c confirms that after placing an order on the website you can remain unarmed and find yourself behind bars.
The Federal Security Service has recently decided on a huge network of stuck websites and people who want to buy a military weapon can grab a shovel.
“People are smuggling like hungry fish to the bait and then getting coal in Siberia,” he confirms.
Makarov for $100
When buying illegal firearms, experts estimate that you will pay between $100 and $900.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the NGO "Right to a Gun" you will buy a gun Makarov for 100 to 300 dollars.
You have to wait up to a month and a half.
The weapon is dispatched from warehouses to long-term storage through medium-sized warehouses.
According to the official statistical office, the number of these crimes in Russia decreased by 7% compared to the period January-October 2011, and amounted to 22.9 thousand cases, and the number of explained cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, 7 explosive devices and explosions.
In the U.S., fast food and supermarket workers strike
Working at the cash register operated by "McDonald" will pass up to a quarter of all American teenagers
In recent days, a wave of low-wage protests has risen in America in Walmart hypermarkets and in restaurants of popular fast food chains such as "McDonald", "Burger King", "Taco Bell", "Wendy's" and "Kentucky".
So far, no one can predict whether this wave will turn into a wave nine, or whether it will soon disappear.
The whole campaign is supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing social organizations.
In addition to raising the modest salaries received by Walmart and fast-food workers, the aim of the organizers of the protests is to create in them in their trade union organizations.
At present, this economic sector is virtually untouched by the trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
The events began last week after Thanksgiving Day, a so-called “Black Friday” when cheap sales orgy hit America, captivated millions of people, and in some cases was accompanied by fights.
On this day, some employees of Walmart, which employs 2.2 million people worldwide, left their workplaces and demonstrated, together with trade unions and left-wing activists, multinational chain companies whose goods are targeted at people from the lower and middle classes.
Walmart sells everything around the world, from diapers to hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
Products in its stores are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That’s why many low-wage employees at Walmart stores only shop at work.
Availability and assortment of goods have made Walmart one of the largest companies in America.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell goods so cheaply, partly because it pays its employees little.
They also complain about poor working conditions, such as the lack of automatic trolleys or manual scanners.
Black Friday protesters called for a pay raise and complained that the costs of health insurance provided by the company rose sharply from $30 to $100 a month.
A typical Walmart employee gets $9.5 an hour, but that doesn’t correspond to the amount of expenses, employees say.
Scientists at the University of California, Berkeley, prove that if Walmart raises its average salary to $12 billion an hour, it will cost the company $3.2 billion a year.
That’s an average of 1.1% more than this company spends on salaries now.
If Walmart moves the wage increase fully to the shoulders of consumers, every visit to the store will cost just 46 cents more.
In a year, customers will spend about $12.39 more than today.
Walmart’s lawyers point out that the protest took place in only nine countries and should not cause virtually any damage to the company.
"Black Friday" in the company's stores lasted from 8 p.m. on Thursday until midnight the next day, and during that time Walmart sold about 5,000 items of goods per second.
In total, its cash registers carried out nearly 100 million transactions on Black Friday.
Dan Fogelman, in an interview with the left-wing Huffington Post website, said the jobs had left “less than five” Walmart employees, and that the protest was “another media sensation” organized by the unions.
"Uninhabited cash register!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where their goal was not Walmart stores (they are not very popular in this advanced city, and therefore almost not here), but "McDonald" and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald says he sells billions of servings, and then he doesn’t even pay you sickly and doesn’t pay you properly for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, New York City City Council member
Currently, the minimum wage for work is $7.25 per hour in accordance with federal laws and regulations of the State of New York.
Fast food restaurants are gradually increasing this salary, but only slightly, and on average, their New York line-up earns $8.90 an hour.
In this expensive city, no one has a lower salary.
I don't understand how you can live in New York for that kind of money.
About a quarter of U.S. teenagers who work behind the desk after school work part-time and live with their parents will work at "McDonald".
Few people see their main source of nutrition in it or plan to stay there for too long.
Currently, I am constantly meeting in conversation with the employees of "McDonald", who complain that they have to live on this money and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, there is a comment on the Wall Street Journal forum, the author of which notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know how to feed them.
The protests, which began at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday at "McDonald" on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashiers and chefs in fast food businesses start receiving at least $15 an hour, more than double their minimum amount.
They also called for the establishment of trade unions in the area of fast food.
U.S. law prohibits the administration from preventing the establishment of trade union organizations and punishing trade union activists by harassment and dismissal.
On the other hand, administration rarely makes life easier for them.
However, implementing a fast-food trade union organization in companies is also difficult for objective reasons.
One of the main reasons is the unusually high fluctuation of employees.
Disagreement
On that day, loud protests were also held in a number of other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The highlight of the event was a meeting at McDonald's in the afternoon near Times Square, where several local democratic politicians, notably city councillor Jumane Williams, performed, who said: "McDonald's not selling billions of servings, and then he's not selling billions of servings to you.
The demonstrators also received the support of other prominent New York Democrats, such as Bill de Blasio, a candidate for mayor of the city, who said that "we must stand up together to support the fast-food workers in order to achieve a fair reward for their work!"
As the New York Times described it, it was the largest event of its kind in the history of the American fast food industry.
But only a few hundred people took part in it, although by no means all of them were fast food workers, who employ tens of thousands of people in New York.
Whether this event will become a spark that will ignite the flame of the mass movement is still unclear.
"In the meantime, the brain manages to cheat on average"
Among fans of modern virtual reality technologies is a popular theme of augmented reality; lately it means to perceive the world especially through the edge of special glasses.
At its annual conference earlier this summer, Google presented the working model of the novelty, and in November it was announced that Microsoft had also filed an application for a relevant patent.
An interview with the leader of the group of interactive 3D technologies at the Cambridge lab of Microsoft Sharam Izadim reveals that the glasses are already a thing of the past for the scientists of the company.
Attraction is the perspective of manipulation with virtual objects in the air with bare hands, the creation of virtual public spaces.
- Please tell us in the framework, what is your research team doing?
“We are dealing with human-machine interactions, but at the same time we are trying to push the boundaries of that interaction.
Humanity has so far stuck in the phase of working with pixels on the flat screen, at most sometimes touching the screen with a finger.
We want to look 5-10 years ahead and anticipate significant changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors - this is a step forward, and almost no Xbox today is for sale without Kinect sensors, because it is very interesting for everyone to control using gestures.
- What else awaits us in the future?
- Despite the fact that the Kinect system has transferred the interaction to the physical level, a lot of the interaction still takes place on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input flow of information has improved (the system receives more data), but the output flow is not so far apart.
We’re trying to change that, we’re actually working on three-dimensional imaging systems based on different technologies, including projective ones.
It is necessary to let the computer world into our physical world, to make it more real.
For this purpose, however, it is necessary to know not only the user, but also the space around him.
Then we will be able to add virtual objects to the real world in a much more convenient form.
And first of all - to hell with those stupid virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think about voice control?
That's a popular thing, but isn't it overrated?
- Of course, it cannot be considered as a whole - the question of privacy arises, because we do not always want to inform others around us about our activities and intentions.
In fact, all types of interaction with computers are good, but in their own environment.
For example, for controlling the device in public places, we had a project in which we thought about gestures, but not about swollen ones, only about such sluggish ones, short ones.
The gesture would not be taken by the camera of the device, but by a bracelet that would monitor the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is large, but theoretically it can be reduced to the size of the watch.
In general, however, the future has a mixed type of control, such as gesture <0x2B> voice.
- How's that?
For example, how do you ask me to give you this can of lemonade?
You will say it and show it at the same time.
- I'm usually just talking.
- Oh, that'll be very difficult to recognize.
- So you want to get users to adapt to what the machine can or can't at the moment?
- It's not necessary at all, but it's a mutual rapprochement.
I think that in the near future we will have to work primarily on the development of new types of sensors that can more accurately detect human reactions.
These can be, for example, laser sensors that provide relatively good depth resolution, this is very important.
- If you have to talk about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your requirements for modern cameras?
Is there not enough resolution, depth or something else today?
- Essentially, the current generation - that's what we can reflect on in our work on three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get 8 megapixels at a speed of 1000 f/s.
But it's not just megapixels themselves, it's like a nut and a depth.
With the current view of the matter, all current technologies are insufficient for us - this allocates the work to the designers of algorithms.
So we have to keep in mind not only the resolutions in the X and Y axes, but also Z.
So the speed, the number of shots per second, is also very important.
The human movement is quite dynamic and the current data flows of 30 frames per second are frankly a little bit, especially for gestures.
Stephen Betishes from our lab in Redmond made a touch sensor with adjustable processing delays of 1 to 100 ms, while current, serially produced sensors are closer to the second value (60-100 ms).
Not everyone understands the extent to which it affects the interaction of a person with a machine.
For me, the equivalent of such a device would be very useful in the work, I just don't need so many touches, but I need some images per second extra.
- And it's not necessary to increase the number of cameras?
- Kinect now uses three "cameras", one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the other - a receiver of the reflected signal.
And already the third camera - it is actually a common sensor of the visible band.
It is not used to determine the depth of the object.
A larger number of cameras could potentially solve the problem...
Or worsen it, because it would increase the necessary amount of calculations performed.
It would be nice to create a flexible Kinect analog system, play with camera positioning curvature and see how it will help determine the three-dimensional position.
“As far as I can remember, Microsoft (unlike Google) did not present its glasses publicly.
Don’t you think that when it comes to everyday use of augmented reality technology with special glasses, it’s one of the most promising platforms?
- Of course, walking and constantly holding the smatphone in the raised hands is not very convenient, but I think: the strongest option would be the "portable" form of a reality extension, when it would be possible to switch the platform clouds at any time, and the giveaway for the lens to the smartphone.
Goggles - this is a very personal device, in which there is their strength (disgusting things only you see), and at the same time also weakness - augmented reality based on glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects at the same time with other people.
- Imagine for a moment that manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark in "Iron Man" but also to a common mortal.
There is one problem that critics often point to: there is no touch response!
Hands don't feel anything!
What are the responses your group is preparing to this challenge?
In my lectures, I often say that augmented reality is the seventh successive breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think that complementing the touch sensations could be the eighth breakthrough.
So far, one of the interesting tricks is used - the use of the second hand as a certain kind of background for displaying.
It records compression in an excellent way!
But there are also technologies that are really aimed at adding sensitivity to these "images in the air" - for example, the interference of several directional ultrasonic rays at the defined point where the finger is located, it creates a tactile sensation, but it's still very weak on the fo itself - as if it were
There is also a wrist strap that affects the nerve ending in the fingers - also a promising direction.
- Have you tried to trick the brain yet?
To think he feels what it seems he should feel at the moment when he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried it yet.
Here there is another challenge that will be fought for a long time - how to get a person who is physically in a very tight space to believe that he is walking in an open platform, practically infinite space - we are also working on the concept of sledgehammers, non-sledgehammers.
If brain deception becomes a target, then the work is for many years to come.
That’s what makes virtual reality work so appealing to researchers – a lot of things are in the very beginning.
Vkusov language instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" is a continuation of the project "St. Petersburg avant-garde", dedicated to the citizens who are at the forefront of the avant-garde of culture and art.
At the top of the list were already significant figures of the art scene of St. Petersburg, whose exploits exceed the city, often find recognition in Europe, without reaching the all-Russian reputation.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the stunning artist Cyril Miller.
The whole town knows Cyril Miller – a bearded man who is dressed in red, whom you meet here at the Russian Museum, here at the Summer Garden, here in fashionable pubs and on vernissages.
Cyril Miller’s paintings, wherever they are displayed, always attract audiences.
Cyril Miller is one of the purely social and philosophical storytellers of Petrograd, the creators of new mythologies.
Cyril Miller - this is a striking man of the St. Petersburg avant-garde of the late 80s and early 90s.
In addition to being an urban man, his appearance on the streets evokes a smile on the faces of citizens, raises everyone’s mood.
Recently, he took the bottle and became a bottler of St. Petersburg, because in this complex role he matured his entire Bohemian life, philosophy and image.
- Cyril, why are you walking around the city in red and not in yellow or turquoise, for example?
- I chose the red color as a designer dealing with appearance and image.
In this world, the red color represents a compromise between the artist, the imagemaker and the public.
Although it is generally true that anything that differs a little from gray arouses aggression and arouses bad traits.
But my provocations are focused on getting the conversation started.
The whole history of my provocative actions is, above all, an invitation to discussion.
- And when did you realize you had to be an artist?
- At an exhibition at the House of Culture in N<0xC4><0x9B>vsk<0xC3><0xBD>, where my work was exhibited.
I understand what my path is.
At that time the wave of old free and informal artists passed, and new, free types of artists I could not understand.
I made friends with the artists of the new wave, with the post-Gazonians who brought us to "Pushkin's 10", and there were no other waves.
It attracts me to the theatre, to dress, to music, to all genres except words.
- And it all merged into your art-clinic... - It was important for me to be in the center of the culture of St. Petersburg, where all the best creative powers should be gathered.
In 1995, I took a place on Pushkin 10, and there was a musical and artistic club, a Bohemian club, home to the St. Petersburg bohemian.
There was born many:NOM, Tequila Jazz, remember how they brought the string with the project "Ucho Van Gogh".
The string and its friends sang under the plywood light songs, dressed in adjoining tricots, in the middle of them composer Igor Vdovin, who is now in fashion.
When the band started playing live, it became "Leningrad".
Trachtenberg conducted many programs of the Halo-Galician times.
We gave them Trachttenberg, with which began his great career, basic education and professional training he obtained from us.
Gallery "D 137", club "Griboyedov - that's the sound of Art Clinic.
This is where our employees and regular guests left.
I'm a hero of the last century, when culture meant something else.
In 2000, the survey was organized in the press, the special prize was "People in our city".
In the "Artist of the Year" nomination, I was named myself, which ended my peak.
In the new times, according to the old rules, work is unpleasant, I am the man of truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
In recent years it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are different things today, you can be popular, but not too cultural.
- Your works are characteristic in a recognizable way.
- Many of my paintings - these are hits, in which the actuality and pervasiveness is vividly captured.
I'm going to have a program exhibition "The Russian Museum in the Clowns".
Clowns are a timeless category.
I used to be social, today being like that is painful and terrible.
But in the clowns everything is erased, tragedy is recorded.
I love grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, to save the world by way of totalitarian disguise in order.
Today, people meet according to clothing, orient themselves to the external mechanics, not to the internal man.
Or maybe you can't give him a hand and you have to spit in his face.
And the deception will be removed by dressing.
- We recently saw you as a city bottlenitor.- A cultural city should have such a hero.
And who should he be, if not me?
- And can commercial art be beautiful?
- At present, the commercial, useful art should be thorough, tactful, sweet.
There is a breakdown of cultures.
People used to meet in dungeons, the bohemian loved one, simple other people.
Today everything has broken down into micro-society, today it is very difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred-dollar banknote to please everyone.
Today, you have to think about who you like.
Today, every cultural hero has its own 100 fans.
- And a few thousand spectators will come to Stasi Mikhailov!
- He's got fans coming up, he's getting involved in the sexual social sphere.
And 300 people will come to the cultural land, and 10,000 will not come, and as a result, less management, less money, it will ruin everything.
I have fans, the main thing is that no one's clamoring them and not violating what's experienced.
When I was young, I painted pictures of a collector hanging on the wall with Falk and Larionov.
I started with pictures that people usually end up with.
Nowadays, people often get confused.
They say: Spiritual culture, consumer culture.
There is no consumer culture, it’s somewhere else.
I am a man of culture of yesterday, I grew up on the examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, refused money for drawing paintings.
And I'm for that kind of culture.
- Cyril, what's missing in St. Petersburg?
- Good experts in culture.
There is such a concept: an agent through culture.
Not every one of them is interested in culture.
At the time of proper tsarism, this was not the case at all, the tsarists may not quite understand the culture, but they understood that it was necessary to support real experts.
There are good consultants in Moscow today.
We have people in St. Petersburg who could be experts, but they are stuck somewhere in the corner, because we need great experts who will properly value these experts and lead them on the right path.
Today, the taste buds thrive.
The same Erarta, but it differs in that they honestly say that we do not accept all modern art, there are artists who should look for other museums.
- What do you think Petterburk is?
- Petersburg - it is not the capital of culture, in Moscow there is much more culture, there is the right soil.
And at our level, art is doing poorly.
We need cultural land, but there are more writers than readers here today, that’s wrong.
In Europe, there are a lot of people who are curious, who like to go to exhibitions, concerts.
With us, such a layer is only weak.
We need art to become a fashion business, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project is implemented with the St. Petersburg grant
Born in space.
The land is in danger.
Global warming or collision with a deadly asteroid.
Caravans of space corps with aliens on board are on their way, looking for a replacement planet.
In order to save humanity, the main question arises: how to keep your family in a state of trouble or on a substitute planet?
I don't think the choice is big.
In fact, there are only two planets that can be conquered, even if only hypothetically.
"It's Venus and Mars," said Vladimir Surdin, a senior scientist at the State Astronomical Institute P. K. Sternberg (SAISH).
However, while there are better conditions for life on Mars, temperatures on the surface of Venus reach 500 degrees Celsius.
Living there is only possible at high altitudes or in the orbit of Venus... in the universe.
To solve the problems of reproduction in space, scientists began with flora.
A half-century ago, experiments were carried out on plants.
The four generations of oak grown on the orbit are no different from their earthly relatives.
Then the insect was taken to orbit - a very small fruit fly of Drosophila.
In 1979, crocodile eggs were sent into space to check how the embryo develops in a state of free weight.
At the exit we get an absolutely normal bird.
But then the problems begin.
"There is a problem with the fact that this bird has to find support, have to stand on its own legs and start moving," says Vladimir Sychev, head of the laboratory at the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IBMP) RAN.
If they do not find support, the birds fall chaoticly and make squirrels.
After 10 hours, the instincts of freshly plucked birds have completely disappeared.
The birds did not respond to light or sound.
And the problem was that in four days they just died.
"Twice we let the birds crawl, but then we refused, because it is simply impossible to work with them there," comments the failure of the experiment with chickens in the universe Vladimir Sychev.
The last "miniarcha" flew the animals into orbit 16 years ago.
Experiments will continue in the spring of 2013.
In the biosatellite "Bion" but there will be only beings of one sex.
An experiment was conducted with rats that were already pregnant broadcasting to space.
They didn’t find anything supernatural there.
"It was only on biosatellites, but again - this is a unique experiment and such experiments need to be carried out," says Vladimir Sychev.
After landing on Earth, the cosmic rats were born a offspring.
Approaching the problem of propagation directly in space has not yet succeeded.
It's a difficult task.
Animals, when they lose their normal environment, simply cannot realize their sexual instincts.
Humans, unlike animals, can, in principle.
Homo sapiens is ruled by abstract thinking and is able to create an appropriate emotional background.
For ethical reasons, similar experiments are not carried out.
But women have been flying into space for 50 years.
The greatest danger was the Tere<0xC5><0xA1>kovs.
The most precious thing that humanity has is the female body.
Our Tea Party flew away, and no one on Earth could tell if it would survive a flight into space.
Will she be able to give birth to a baby after such a flight?
"No one has answered this question yet," said veteran of the Vachtang Vachnadze space industry.
In June 1964, more than a year after flying into space, the first woman cosmonaut Valentina Tere<0xC5><0xA1>kova gave birth to her daughter.
The father of the child was the cosmonaut Andrijan Nikolayev.
In 1988, the son of the second woman cosmonaut Svetlana Savické was born, who visited the orbit twice and also worked in open space.
However, the risk remains.
We have only a few cosmonauts who, after many years, have been born and grow healthy offspring.
"In addition, it can be dangerous even during orbital flights," says cosmonaut-pilot, Hero of the Soviet Union and Hero of Russia Valery Polyakov.
Yet humanity must inevitably seek new ways in the field of biotechnology, radiation protection and the creation of artificial gravity.
The CPK Hydro Laboratory is a mandatory stage of flight preparation.
Here, in conditions of zero attractiveness, cosmonauts master the habits necessary to work in the open space.
Water mimics the state of weightlessness.
Although for adults, water is a comfortable, but in a way strange environment, it is a natural food for young children.
Little Ichtiands seem to confirm that life on earth comes from the ocean.
There is a correlation between the fact that the baby is on average 9 months in the mother’s fetal water and that it is then easier for them to get used to the water.
In principle, this is logical, because from the moment of birth, from the moment of that first excavation, only 2 weeks pass.
"It's very little to make the baby forget something," says newborn swim instructor Marina Aksenov<0xC3><0xA1>.
In short - if for a newborn baby the state of weightlessness is more natural, then for women the more natural inevitability is gravity, an attractive force.
In a state of weightlessness, the abdominal muscles, the pelvic muscles, the ability of the body to expel the fetus, is very quickly decayed.
This can be ignored if the stimulators of muscle activity during childbirth will work.
After all, it is possible for the birth to take place in a special chamber in which the mother's organism expels the fetus.
"What's next?" asks Valeri Poljakov complex questions.
On the other hand, the baby also needs artificial gravity.
If the earth's attractiveness does not affect the organism, it cannot properly shape the skeleton or the system of muscles.
A newborn on the orbit is not possible to dress as an adult in a special suit with a load in which he could train.
He will simply be deprived of what he absolutely needs for his development.
“If we go with you to an experiment that will allow the birth of a child in a foreign environment, we will bring to Earth a person with a disability who will be completely unfit for the local environment,” Igor Pestov, the head of the IBMP RAN Bioethics Commission, predicts.
So the birth of children in the universe is only a theoretical question today.
But one day there will come a time when it will become a reality and when the Earthlings will leave in their crusts on a distant planet that will become the home of their cosmic-born offspring.
NK<0xC3><0x9A> chief: Control of the Swiss system failed due to politicians
In the context of public procurement, the Czech Republic has good inspectors and quality legislation, but it is flawed in its application.
In an interview for Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz, Vice President of the Supreme Control Authority Miloslav Kala said this.
“The law will never be perfect, but it has to be the right application – that’s what I think is missing,” Kala said in a statement.
Similar conclusions are also suggested by the joint inspection of Czech and German inspectors.
As an example of incorrect practice, Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>ase's approach to the so-called "swarch system" is cited.
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS will not bother the entrepreneur with its controls - is it banned or allowed?
“The law has to be set up in some way, and if it prohibits something, then even the prime minister cannot prevent an authority from acting, which has the obligation to monitor and enforce obligations,” says Kala.
At a meeting of the Control Committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you spoke about a joint project between the Czech and the German side, in which the legislation on public procurement in both countries was compared.
What exactly was it about?
This is a parallel control that we started about two years ago.
To put it simply, European legislation regulates the way in which public contracts are handled, followed by individual national legislations and then by the practice itself.
We have put all this together, and although the checks have not yet been completed, we have shown very interesting differences - in general, the legislation may be "more stringent and more perfect", but the practice itself is better in some parameters in Germany.
It is therefore confirmed that it is not enough to create more and more precise rules, but it is necessary to focus on the application of law itself.
What can this project do for you, what does it mean for you?
It is precisely this kind of joint control that could help us to stop making efforts to clarify the laws, reduce and improve the limits, if it does not have such a positive impact.
Efficiency means getting the right thing at a reasonable (but not always the lowest) price to avoid enrichment and, if necessary, criminal activity.
But by lowering the contract limit, we don’t necessarily have to achieve that.
Perhaps the system counts with so much "paper" that those who want to look for holes in that system will draw them from it much easier than if the limit remained higher.
You are talking about domestic problems with the transposition of legislation relating to public procurement into practice.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there an authority similar to our NKU, or is it set differently?
As far as the authorities are concerned, like the NK<0xC3><0x9A>, the Bundesrechnungshof, which is organised in the same way as us, also has a college, is only formed in a slightly different way, but in principle both authorities are acting in the same way.
The powers are also to a certain extent similar, but in that Germany has a federal arrangement, so does the Court of Auditors, even at the level of individual federal states - in that the system is slightly different from ours.
The BRH can only control federal money, represented by state funds.
Public funds, which are managed by the regions and municipalities, are controlled there from the level of the Federal Courts of Auditors.
As far as legislation is concerned, is it simpler than ours?
In general, I would not like to compare it without specific data, but in some respects Germany has been described as a model, but it cannot be said for sure that it is better in everything.
Is it also necessary to have better controllers?
I'm sure not, but I'm saying again, I don't like that comparison.
But it has to be said that even countries that we consider to be model are facing a whole host of problems.
Otherwise, it wouldn't be of any benefit to them to cooperate with our office, would it?
With regard to domestic legislation, what the new Public Procurement Act meant to your office, are its impacts already manifest in some way?
Due to the fact that the validity of this novel is relatively short, it is not yet manifest in our control actions.
Because we do ex-post checks, it is necessary to expect a certain delay.
We are noticing this until now only in the process of preparing future controls - we have launched our new tool "detection of risks of inefficiencies", through which we have penetrated almost 14,000 public contracts, and we have analyzed them - there the changes will of course manifest themselves in the form of typographical changes, because the limits, the conditions will change.
Therefore, do you consider the adoption of this law to be a benefit or an additional burden on the bureaucracy system?
I think this law is definitely a step in the right direction, and I hope it will be confirmed.
The problem that may arise here is that the rules will be "strict" and will not be able to be followed.
Already in the course of the operation of the previous rules, controlled persons are obliged by the provider (for example, in the case of regional operational programmes by the regional council) that any non-compliance with the Public Procurement Act constitutes a breach of budgetary discipline.
Does the law need to be tightened in this way?
I don't think so.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse it, and not punish those who make a formal mistake that has no impact on decision-making.
Such a system will only create more pressure on the bureaucracy.
So how do you get out of it?
Let's see where the road doesn't lead.
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS will not bother entrepreneurs with the controls of the so-called "switch system" - and what does it mean?
Is the swirling system banned or allowed?
After all, the law must be set in some way, and if something forbids it, then even the Prime Minister cannot prevent an authority from acting, which has the obligation to monitor and enforce its obligations.
He can say, "We'll change the law and allow it," but he can't say we're going to act like nothing.
The Public Procurement Act has fairly strict rules on what is to be formally done - which is correct in order to protect public competition.
But on the other hand, it is tragic when the person with the best offer is excluded only for formal deficiencies.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be the right application - that is what we lack in my opinion.
The roads are crowded, but mostly downhill.
In several places of the Czech Republic, the roads are cold and also snowy.
Most of the time, however, the tickets are downhill, somewhere with increased caution.
Karlovy Vary
In the Karlovy Vary region this morning the roads were downhill, but the places were cold and also snowy.
The temperature dropped between five and ten degrees below zero, but is expected to warm slightly during the day.
The snowfall in the region has stopped and only a weak layer lies in the lowlands.
On the ridges of the Pear Mountains, however, there is about 30 centimeters of snow.
The places were also lower visibility due to fog, according to the dispatch data of the regional motorists.
R6 highways and first-class communications are now accessible in the region without restrictions.
However, caution is in place, for example, on some bridges, where the surface may be shallow and slippery.
All second and third-class roads, including mountain roads, are also accessible.
But in some parts of them there are still remains of ice and places of trapped snow.
Above all, in higher positions, it is necessary to pay increased attention to driving.
Pardubick<0xC3><0xBD> and Kr<0xC3><0xA1>lovéhradeck<0xC3><0xBD> kraj
On some roads in eastern Bohemia there is a risk of frost, in higher locations and on the mountains there may be a layer of snow on the roads, the Directorate of Roads and Highways informs on its website.
Drivers warn drivers about freezing, it can be formed especially in the higher locations of the Pardubice region.
Findings can be around Lan<0xC5><0xA1>krouna, <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Orlic<0xC3><0xAD>, Poli<0xC4><0x8D>ky, Svitav or Vysoké Myt, especially on second and third-class roads.
Chemically treated roads I/43 and I/34 at Svitav.
The snow is especially on the roads in the Giant Mountains and Orlicky Mountains.
The snow cover is in the highest positions on the roads in the districts of Rychnov nad Kn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE>n<0xC3><0xA1> and Trutnov.
In eastern Bohemia today it is mostly clear to semi-clear without precipitation.
Temperatures usually range between minus three and plus one degree Celsius, a weak wind blowing.
Pilsen Region
The roads in the Pilsen region are downhill this morning, but places with increased caution and driving needs to be adapted to the weather.
This is cold in the morning, temperatures range between three and nine degrees below the freezing point.
After previous snowing and subsequent cooling, some communications may be fraught.
Drivers also have to rely on fog, but visibility will gradually improve.
This is according to the information of the dispatch of the regional motorists.
The D5 motorway is almost unrestricted, but increased caution is recommended by traffic managers between 80 and 131 kilometers.
Most first-class roads have a dry and frozen surface.
In the south of Pilsen and Tachovsky, however, there may be shallow sections.
Communications of the second and third classes are damp, and also in this case, a warning on cold sections applies.
Drivers should be cautious, especially on less frequented roads in the <0xC5><0xA0>umava area.
Olomouc Region
With the snowfall on the road, drivers now have to count towards the highest positions of the Olomouc region.
After the chemical spill, she remained on the Red Mountain saddle and on her way to the Videl Cross.
Drivers drove into the terrain during the night of snowfall, and about three centimeters of snow were snowed in Shumpersk, according to road administrators.
In other parts of the region, tickets are usually available without restrictions.
"On <0xC5><0xA0>umpersk there is snow in the highest positions.
With the snowfall on the <0xC4><0x8C>ervenohorsk<0xC3><0xBD> saddle, drivers have to count towards Jesen<0xC3><0xAD>k," said the <0xC4><0x8C>TK dispatcher of the Shumper Road Administration.
Even at night, their colleagues in Jesenick went out into the field, and the roads to the highest locations are now, according to them, after chemical treatment, naked and wet.
In Olomouck, the roads are unrestricted, but in <0xC5><0xA0>ternbersk, drivers should be careful in wooded areas where the tickets have remained damp.
<0xC3><0x9A>steck<0xC3><0xBD> region, Liberec region
Several hard-to-pass places are reported today by motorists in the north of Bohemia after the morning.
In addition to several places with attacked snow or with a glacier, the mountain road from Telnice to Kn<0xC3><0xAD>nice na <0xC3><0x9A>steck is also closed, according to the police database.
Temperatures are maintained even in the lower positions below zero, so ice and snow are likely to endure on the roads.In the lowlands, especially south-east of the Czech Middle Mountains, on the contrary, there are no problems and the roads are usually dry.
Operational complications have not been reported yet.
The occurrence of glaciers is reported by motorists especially from around <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>t<0xC3><0xAD>.
According to meteorologists, ideal conditions for her were at night - during the day rain and melting snow, at night clear and frost.
Unfavourable conditions are also reported on the I/13 road at the border of the <0xC3><0x9A>steck and Liberec region.
The closure from Telnice to Kn<0xC3><0xAD>nice was forced by the bent branches of trees, which were bent down to the road under the snow.
<0xC5><0xA0>imon Ornest: We want to gather positive energy at concerts
What do you think about the end of the world in less than a month?
It's just one of the other alarming messages that we people like to catch.
“Together with The Tap Tap, we’re making fun of it and saying we’re the only band in the world that can gather enough positive energy to keep the end of the world away or prevent it.
In December, you will also organize a completely unique project of three concerts towards the end of the world.
Can you introduce it to your readers?
This is a national benefit action that we have been planning for two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential of the end of the Mayan calendar announced on December 21 at 11:10 a.m.
The day before 20 December from 9 pm, 3 concerts will be held simultaneously in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end around the time when the Mayan calendar will end on the island of Kiribati in the Pacific, which is in the time zone 12 hours before us.
Who came up with this idea?
At first it was probably my idea, then we came up with everything together with our artist Honza Augusta.
In addition to accumulating enough positive energy and preventing the end of the world, we also want to think together with the public about the state in which we will one day pass this world on to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar, we have also created a unique collection of items of shoes, shirts, bags or original keys towards the end of the world, which people can also support us by purchasing at www.e-tap.cz.
The Tap Tap band, along with other performers, also sang a so-called anthem against the end of the world, which is called "The End of the World Cancelled".
She’s already very popular on YouTube, does she also sound at these benefit concerts?
Of course, and in the end, that is, if we succeed and the end of the world does not happen...
It is sung by all the performers at all three concerts at the same time.
The anthems will also be combined in a unique live broadcast on Czech Television.
The lyrics to this song written and the main role of Jesus in the clip is played by Thomas Hanak, also singing in it Xindl X...
How did you get to work with them?
We are also collaborating with other figures of the Czech cultural scene, since we organize a lot of benefit events and concerts...
We are trying to get them involved in these projects.
It turned out that most of them are interested in and enjoy working with us.
What will the profits from the concerts towards the end of the world be?
On the equipment of the barrier-free educational center Studeo, which we have been implementing for the sixth year with the civic association Tap in the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute.
The students of the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute are regularly visited by lecturers and are engaged in activities that are fun and interesting to them.
The students themselves do not have the means to go to the lecturers themselves, so we try to enable them in this way.
Within the framework of the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ki Institute, a separate building will be created in the future, to which we will move with this project.
At each concert, several musical groups and performers will perform.
What did you choose them for?
We tried to put together a program that would address all generations, including children.
For example, Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan B<0xC3><0xA1>rtou, The Tap Tap, Mari<0xC3><0xA1>n Bango and Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Such<0xC3><0xBD> will perform in Prague.
All details can be found at www.kpks.cz.
Are you planning any similar “bombastic events” in the future?
In May we will perform for the first time at the Prague Spring, so we will definitely prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year we would also like to play in the Czech National House in New York, and I personally, when we are already in the United States, would like to link this with the performances in Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are not minimalistic, so far you have performed in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow, for example.
The Tap Tap is a group made up of people with disabilities.
How do you manage these journeys logistically and organizationally?
It’s not as bad as it seems at first sight.
We have five members on the electric trolley, its trolleys have to travel in the luggage compartment, further with us of course we drag a large amount of cargo and a bucket with tools...
However, so far it has always worked out without problems, both <0xC4><0x8C>SA and British Airways were perfectly prepared for us to wonder how many times.
Even in Moscow, from which we recently returned, it was without problems.
Thanks to trips abroad, you can compare how individuals differ in accessibility, public access to disabled people and the like.
What have you met so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London, and other places where everything works better than we do, we were in Russia and saw that everything in the East is still in its infancy.
Opposite Prague, Moscow is a very barrier, here it is still unusual for a person to move on an electric trolley himself in the city center.
There is no such thing as the fact that you prefer a wheelchair in the elevator.
Fortunately, there are already civil associations that try to draw attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
What, on the contrary, do we still have to do to reach more developed countries?
There are a lot of things we're still behind...
However, it is important to note that the improvement and improvement of the situation always depends on the efforts of the people concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is quite common for people with a severe disability to move independently in public, to go to the toilet, to the museum, anywhere.
However, it is not very common for a large number of people with disabilities to actively participate in social life, on the contrary, we are a little ahead of that with The Tap Tap!
Respect for the public or disability is one thing, but only when we become important athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers will things really start to change.
So far, these are unique cases of people who have a strong will.
The band The Tap Tap is currently very popular, but let’s go back a few years, what made you start it in 1998?
I joined the Jedlick Institute as an educator, where I had many young people around me who were interested in doing something.
And since I am a musician myself, I play saxophone, among other things, so I founded an interesting music ring together with a colleague.
Well, over time, what our moderator, Ladya Angelovi<0xC4><0x8D>, says, got out of hand (laughs).
But has popularity only come in the last few years, or am I wrong?
It is true that it helped us when we started connecting with famous singers and also actively working on the promotion of the band.
We realized that work that is not visible, in essence, does not exist.
In addition, thanks to contributions from the European Union, we can afford quality lecturers, equipment and so on.
Was your goal to get it up with The Tap Tap so high?
From the beginning, I felt the potential for something else to be done.
Showbusiness is full of things, where one imitates the other.
It’s logical in a way, everything new is taken care of and it takes a long time.
Things that are unique are very few, but I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us for the first time is, of course, regret, that is natural...
But this pity is absolutely useless, because people with disabilities are not suffering from all the abandoned beings that we have to regret.
They are people who can live a full life and develop, of course, provided they have the means to do so.
I'm saying that if something happens to people with disabilities, it's not just a shift for them, it's a shift for society as a whole.
Has this success also helped you by being a strict boss, as many people have labeled you?
If we want to do quality work, we need to be uncompromising in many ways and require a certain discipline.
But I think that's perfectly normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic performance and a head in the clouds, and when they find that they have to go to the rehearsal twice a week, do preparations, and spend a lot of time traveling to concerts, the excitement is quickly leaving.
But this is how it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and wants to achieve something.
The band The Tap Tap currently has 20 members.
How many were there at the beginning of 1998?
Only one Angelovica.
We are an open group, people are leaving and coming, that can't be prevented.
Whoever has the will and the taste, always has the door open for us
It will take place the day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012 from 21 hours
Incheba arena, Brno Fléd and Ostrava Plynojem will be held in Prague with the participation of 12 bands and other musicians from the Czech Republic
At the end of the evening, all three cities will be connected by telemost while singing the band's song The Tap Tap "End of the World Cancelled"
The purpose of the concert is to raise funds for the equipment of the multifunctional barrier-free education center STUDEO at the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute in Prague in the amount of CZK 25 million
Entrance to the concert is 400 CZK, children under 12 years have free entrance tickets in the pre-sale Bohemiaticket
Poland and space.
Last week, Poland was accepted as the twentieth member of the European Space Agency at the meeting of the ministers of the countries of the European Space Agency, as the second country from the former Eastern Bloc countries (after the Czech Republic, which became a full member of ESA on 12 November 2008).
Poland began close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and over the next few years participated in a number of projects of the Agency.
Of course, Poland’s journey to space began much earlier.
Polish enthusiasts devoted themselves to spaceflight before the Second World War; but they did not always meet with understanding.
I recall, for example, A. Sternfeld’s lecture at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory, which on December 6, 1933 presented ideas from his pioneering work Entering the Cosmonautics.
The ideas of the young engineer (born 1905) left the listeners cold and after years <0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934, Sternfeld received the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch Prize for his entry into space in France.
The mentioned doctor Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became a great propagator of astronomy and cosmonautics.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish journals and wrote a number of books devoted to these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski became a world-famous propagator of cosmonautics and his contribution was also appreciated by the fact that one of the craters on the opposite side of the Moon was named after him.
As early as 1925, a railroad trench was built in Poland, which was to be equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, the author of the proposal is not known and the details of the project are not known.
It is not even clear whether the rocket should have been used to start the trench or to slow it down.
Information about this dredge is only known from the periodic press.
From 1933, the Polish artillery began to circumnavigate with missiles.
The research was provided by the Weapons Technology Cell in cooperation with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfk and Prof. Gustav Mokrzyckieg.
From the preserved materials, it is clear that the research has reached the stage of practical testing.
However, with the arrival of the German troops, the research was interrupted.
In 1937, a design of a photoelectric fighter rocket was published in the professional press, designed by the engineer Rohozinski, and the following year the work of the Leliwy-Krzywoblock<0xC3><0xBD> air torpedo and aeronautical bomb was published.
Both projects were intended for the military use of rocket engines.
Shortly before the war, the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (TIC) was responsible for all projects of military use of missile technology, which coordinated all the work.
The committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of activity, its activities ended the beginning of the war.
After the war, other papers on space science appeared in the Polish press thanks to the work of the Polish Astronautical Society (Polskie Tovarzystwo Astronautyczne).
For the first time mention of the company is made in the November 1954 issue of the journal Problems, which contains four more extensive articles on astronautics.
In one of them, from Prof. M. Subotowicze, it is proposed to create a society that will deal with cosmonauts.
Projects of artificial satellites were already under way at the time, and it was clear that space research was a promising field.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronautical Society (PTA) has sought to join the International Astronautical Federation (founded in 1951) and PTA has become a regular member already in the fall.
And the following year, the first president of the PTA Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959) became vice-president of the International Astronautical Federation.
He held this position until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, PTA has contributed significantly to the development of the highly successful RM (Meteorological Rocket), which became the first Polish rocket to conduct scientific research.
The first RM-1 was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on 10 October 1958.
The rocket with a reach of 1800 meters was about 80 cm long and its weight was less than 5 kg.
Later, an improved version of the RM-1A was built and in the summer of 1959 two-stage RM-2 missile flight tests were launched in the Bled Desert.
The rocket was 1.4 meters long and weighed about 11.5 kg.
Another type of development was to be able to do real scientific work - the RM-34 rocket was to have access to 14.5 km and its task was to monitor altitude winds.
However, in 1962, further development was halted.
The successor to the first RM missiles was the Meteor-1 rocket developed between 1962 and 1965.
The rocket was conceived as a two-stage, its total length was 510 cm and its starting weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types were developed (labelled Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), which differed in size of space for scientific instruments.
In the Meteor-1A rocket was available space of 0.4 liters, Meteor-1B of 0.34 liters and Meteor-1C of 0.62 liters.
The maximum access for all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Meteor-2 rocket was developed at the Aeronautical Institute, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had a starting weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a payload of 10 kg up to a height of about 60 km.
Subsequently, the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were built.
It is also necessary to mention the entry of Poland into COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the creation of a national COSPAR committee two years later.
Poland was also involved in space exploration on Soviet artificial satellites under the Intercosmos programme, and in 1978, Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimir Remk.
The repeal of the Public Works Act is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court repealed the Public Works Act.
The resolution sparked a live debate in public.
It will certainly be interesting to look at this issue from a broader perspective.
Liberal-oriented economic systems in the EU, as well as in the globalised world, are based on the principle of more unregulated competition.
In its effect, this means that the individual economic departments, the national economic systems, are in permanent conflict with each other.
The cause is the principle of free trade and the free, unrestricted movement of private capital along with ruthless financial speculation.
Influenced by significant differences in labour prices, price tensions occur.
By this concept, it is necessary to understand the situation in which the manufacturer tries to keep up with the importation of cheap goods in competition by "stimulating" the price of the competitor in order to squeeze on a larger share of the market and thereby increase its own profits.
On a mass scale, this means for most entrepreneurs either to transfer production abroad, or there to buy cheaply, or to disappear.The result is high unemployment in countries where labor prices are high compared to other economies.
Since private capital has no social responsibility, and therefore the responsibility for the unemployment produced by it, the social expenditure of the state necessarily increases.
The whole situation is reinforced by the complete unwillingness of business owners to pay taxes and thereby to compensate for the economic and social damages that he caused in pursuit of profit.
The situation is so well known that it is not necessary to provide specific statistical data.
The ruthless practices of private capital create a situation in individual economies where the governments of individual countries are forced to enter into mutual competition with a view to artificially lowering the social level of their own population in order to attract foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments are giving private capital a share of its own population, irrespective of social decline.
This is especially evident in the changes in the laws in force.
The objective is to economically force the own population to adopt a price dictation of private capital, especially in the area of wages.
On the one hand, this is a system of economic coercion in the case of long-term unemployment, on the other, by restricting the rights of workers in the field of labour law.
The result is growing poverty, along with an increase in the disparities between the poor and the rich.
There have been public food outlets in the SRN for many years for the poor, who cannot enjoy their own work.
The number of these people is already going to millions.
In the context of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, it is quite common for properly-employed people to receive such wages that they have to be paid to an existential minimum.
Such a scandal was also published in the case of auxiliary employees of the Federal Court.
The austerity measures of virtually all the southern EU states undoubtedly lead to the same situation where people under the pressure of a catastrophic social collapse are forced to either emigrate as it was in the 19th century, or to make a living on the edge of society for a sum of money.
But here it is necessary to ask where it comes from.
If it comes from other EU countries, then poverty moves from one country to another, or it doesn’t come at all, because Chinese, Indians, Brazilians, or Turks, Moroccans, or Egyptians, or Africans are still working for a fraction of the European wage.
This applies to the whole of Latin America.
Liberal theories and the media argue that the state cannot participate capitalistly in its own economy, that a controlled economy leads to an economic catastrophe.
Private capital insists on the view that the state must not interfere with the economy by directing interventions.
Then it is necessary to ask whether private capital does not influence, now it actually governs politics and thus the whole state in its own selfish sense.
Here is a clear answer that is yes.
Evidence is the existence of virtually omnipotent and ubiquitous lobbying in all states.
The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, providing mutual benefits, legislation, where virtually everything is criminal, but nothing criminal.
In the SRN, the situation is such that state ministries for lack of funds order the drafting of bills to private law firms, which are closely connected with the industry.
These bills are then approved in the Bundestag.
All power thus does not come from the people as the constitutions of the Western type proclaim it, but from financially strong groups preferring their own interests.
It is clear that liberally oriented democracies are now rapidly getting into the situation, as Appianus describes it in his work Crisis of the Roman Republic during Caesar and Pompeii: "The state has long been in complete disintegration and the authorities have been occupying themselves with violence.
For bribes, illegally gaining honor and using stones or swords.
The energetics and corruption of the situation were rife without any obstruction, and the people went to the elections with a pre-sold vote" ..."characteristic people did not contest the office at all, so that one day as a result of this upheaval, he became himself a man for eight months without consuls."
Conclusion As in antiquity, the present society is based on the ruthless preference of self-interest, regardless of the whole-society interest.
Private capital is no longer able, by its very nature, to understand and apply the benefit of society as a whole.
The result is now, as it was then, an unprecedented decadence of elites without any effort for deeper reforms.
We must therefore look for the causality of the rise of fascist and communist regimes in the ruthless liberalization of the economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.
In the current state, the demise of these systems in favour of liberal democracy can be seen as a certain pause with the expectation of the next round.
Particularly disastrous is the fact that the current elites are completely ignoring the possible hundreds of thousands of lives lost in the future, humanitarian and social disasters that we are already witnessing together with crimes against humanity as we know them from old and new history.
The repeal of the Public Works Act is not a solution, at least not permanent.
Under the pressure of competition at both international and intra-European levels, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for ways to further reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The solution is targeted political-social reforms, which strengthen the state’s capital participation in the economy, strengthen the influence of citizens on the government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society in favor of the state.

"Nothing can and will never come out of violence" Sting in Fragile's song, whose main verse in the chorus is "Let's not forget how fragile we are"
“If my sons didn’t want war, there would be none” – Gutel Schnaper, Mayer Amschel Rothschild’s wife, 1849
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, there was, as always, a lot of reaction.
One stands behind Israel, argues for its right to self-defense, and the Palestinians fit into the role of terrorists, the other supports the Palestinians, argues for the racism of the Israeli state, the genocide of the Palestinian Arabs, and the State of Israel fits into the role of a terrorist state.
I do not want to think about who is in the periodically recurring waves of perpetrator killings and who the victims are, after all, the people of Israel today, including the self-governing territories, were born into the current political situation and did not experience the onset of violence.
I want to offer my readers a look behind the curtain, a look at who, above all, has been served by 95 years of tension (calculated since the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) on a small piece of the Middle East country.
Some of my thoughts are supported by the available historical facts, some of them are derived on the basis of my own understanding of who or what group of people is the main promoter of the events of modern history.
The history of mankind is, first of all, the history of the struggle for power.
In every epoch we can track down some of Alexander the Great's or Napoleon's.
What is not so obvious is whether it was always these personalities who controlled their steps completely autonomously, or whether there was someone behind their throne who directed their actions towards a predetermined goal.
We must admit that we live in a time when world wealth is concentrated in the hands of several individuals and that this concentration of money and the power resulting from it could not have occurred in the lifetime of a generation.
Among these astronomically rich families stands out one that could be considered the head of the octopus (if anyone else is standing above them I do not know, but I do not rule it out) - Rothschild.
Not much is written about them.
Of course.
The first news agency (Reuters) was bought as early as the 1990s to stop the association of their name with the highly criminal acts they were behind, which for them always meant consolidating power, multiplying wealth, or both.
They have major stakes in almost all the central banks of the world and against countries where the stakes in the central bank are not waged or are preparing for war (before the invasion of Afghanistan it was 7 countries, after the invasion of Iraq it was 5 countries, after the centrifugal ban, after the overthrow of Gaddafi there were only four.
Whoever tried to resist this family, he died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to restore the status of the Rothschild Central Bank to the Bank of America, began to issue his own (understand the government's) money during the Civil War, and was assassinated in 1865 at the theatre.
JFK began to spend his own money and wanted to cancel the Fed, he was murdered in 1963, MP Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue the Fed for triggering a major economic crisis in 1929.
Their desire for global power led from 1859 to 1871 to formulate a plan of three world wars by a mason of the highest, 33rd degree of dedication by Albert Pike.
The first war had the task of eliminating the great monarchist state units in Europe, the second was to remove the colonial domination in particular of Great Britain, and the third was to lead to the reduction of the world population somewhere to 0.5 - 1 billion people, so unicorns (such a number of slaves for their convenience and luxuries) and not suffice for their convenience.
The method employed by a group of the wealthiest families led by the Rothschilds is to trigger a crisis and then offer a solution (order ab chao – order from chaos).
These solutions, however, are false and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see the founding of the Fed to avoid repeating crises such as the one they provoked in 1907).
So after they managed to start the First World War by assassinating the Habsburg successor R-U Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed Imperial Russia by launching the Bolshevik Revolution.
The First World War ended with a sudden, military and economically unfounded, capitulation of Germany (no longer needed war for the destruction of imperial Russia) and the subsequent disintegration of the Central European power, Austria-Hungary.
In order to facilitate the outbreak of the Second World War, the bankers of politics, in the form of a meager war, allowed the Germans to create a very latent conflict situation by imposing huge war reparations on Germany, thus creating a presupposition for the radicalization of the masses, and then, by force, they had sufficed to push the Germans to the point of force.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds encouraged the establishment of the Zionist Movement, one branch of which sought to establish a Jewish state, preferably in the area of historic Judea with Jerusalem as the capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour Declaration, already mentioned, created a prerequisite for the mass immigration of Jews into Palestine, and began to take place in the first clashes with the local Arab population.
There have been terrorist attacks on both sides.
The Second World War broke out, whether Hitler had escaped from the chain on which international bankers had initially held him, or all he had planned to do was hard to estimate, the suffering of the European Jews in the concentration camps in any case created a prerequisite for acceptance.
Israel was officially founded in 1948, and just as war reparations made by Germany for World War II, the declaration of the State of Israel created the focal point of the Third War.
If international bankers succeed in launching it, the Jewish nation will, as in the latter, be victims in the first line of battle, now along with the Arab or generally Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of strife and chaos not only within the country, but also internationally (let’s take a look at how sharply people divide into supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is the culprit and who is the victim of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, where injustice breeds injustice in an endless chain of violence, when the greed of individuals and their desire for global power stood at the beginning of everything?
Here it is necessary to distinguish the simple inhabitants of Israel from their leaders, because, as with us, international bankers encourage people to choose exclusively their own candidates in elections.
The current prime minister of Israel is the prime minister of the Israelis, the prime minister of the Israelis, the prime minister of the Israelis, the prime minister of the Israelis, the prime minister of the Israelis, the prime minister of the Israelis, the prime minister of the Israelis, the prime minister of the Israelis, the prime minister of Israel, the prime minister of Israel, the prime minister of Israel, the prime minister of Israel.
As David Rockefeller said in 1994, “All we need is a general crisis, and people will agree with the new world order.”
The new world order in their conception is the world of masters and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population serves the convenience of a handful of financial aristocracy.
A world where every newborn person is implanted at birth a chip that makes him a fully controlled being.
And he causes all, both small and great, and rich and poor, and free and slave, to be given a mark on their right hand or on their forehead, so that they may not buy or sell, which is not the name of the beast, or the number of its name.
It is necessary to understand: who has reason to count the numbers of the beast.
This number is the number of a man, and it is the number sixty-six."
Argo: When It's Worst, Call Hollywood
In November 1979, a mob of Islamist students occupied the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and captured 52 diplomats as hostages.
They were to be released in exchange for the overthrown Shah Mohamed Réz P<0xC3><0xA1>hlavi, who fled to the United States after the revolution, who had been the patron of his regime for decades.
For the U.S. administration, the situation did not offer a positive outcome - throwing a scoundrel overboard could not afford, because it would thus fundamentally jeopardize the trust of allies in other countries.
However, the release of hostages in Iran, where the revolution led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, was not possible.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which later deepened the failure of the attempt to free the hostages by force.
The prisoners were eventually released after 444 days, after the negotiations were mediated by the Algerian government.
Their fate at home sparked a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiment.
Debakl in Iran contributed significantly to the loss of Jimmy Carter with Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film directed by actor Ben Affleck Argo describes one episode of the story that brought America a small victory.
Just before the embassy was occupied, six staff members fled from it.
They ended up in the residence of the Canadian ambassador after a difficult periphery.
The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities, managed to get them out of Iran, helped by an extravagant cover story – they went to Canadian passports as members of a film crew who inspected the country’s sci-fi location.
Combination of genres
The plan, devised by Tony Mendez's "exfiltration" expert, also called for Hollywood's cooperation.
To make the legend credible, a film project was written in specialized magazines, press conferences were held, a fictional production company had a real office.
The details of the operation have long been hidden, the film is based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck's film is a special combination of several genres.
On the one hand, a realistic political thriller, at the same time the so-called "caper movie", the story of a successful piece, underwear - an example can be a series of Danny's partners.
In this way, the moods - on the one hand, the documentary sequence from Tehran (in the title sequence, iconic period photographs of the events and the way in which the same situations were presented in the film are shown - are not big differences in this).
On the other hand, lightened Hollywood passages, settled with irony and a slight overlap.
And then the scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions -- the men in suits, they discuss the situation at the tables, in the hallways of the office, on the phone...
Ben Affleck has remarkably managed to restart his career.
The smiling actor became a respected director, and his acting ceased to be a target of ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature film, after the dark crime Gone Baby Gone (2007) and the thriller City (2010).
At the same time, it is Affleck's first film that does not play in the director's hometown of Boston.
Feeling for the atmosphere of the place was one of the characteristics that the director's older films promoted above the Hollywood standard.
And Affleck is also showing it in Argu, where Tehran "plays" Canada.
The best scenes in the film take place in the streets, while reconstructing real events - the opening sequence of the embassy's fall is impressive in its clarity, which at the same time conveys the emotion of confusion and unpredictability that arise when clear-cut events take place.
A similar effect is achieved by Affleck and his collaborators in fictional scenes (fake staff in Tehran’s bazaar).
Too many events in too many places <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
The director also had to deal with the fact that the story told doesn’t actually offer much in the cinematic sense of exciting scenes.
Quite successfully he works with it almost, sometimes he comes up with something to reality - everything is no longer so elegant (the scene in which the imminent crisis at Tehran airport turns off the phone call in America and the chase after the wound seems quite attracted to the hair).
The weakness of Arga, however, is the disconnection resulting from the need to show too many events in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in the roles of Hollywood collaborators, but their characters would deserve more space and are not the only ones in the film.
Affleck's film loses its dramatic momentum, it is a film that can be watched with mild interest, appreciate the realization and retro style evocative thrillers of the 70s.
But it's hard to break.
As a reminder of one so far living history in a certain way, as well as a proof of how exaggerated the notions of omnipotent and omniscient secret services are, but enough.
Rules for inflating balloons, bananas and circuses
The website www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which annually publishes a survey of the most absurd bank charges, has now decided to announce a competition for “the most absurd regulations or ideas from the EU workshop”.
"This is the latest event where the EU plans to adopt a 40 percent quota for women in the leadership of major European companies," said Patrik Nacher, the organiser of the survey.
Among the nominees is, for example, the recent decision of the European Court of Justice to unify the rates of insurance for men and women.
So far, women in life insurance prices have been favored because they are objectively less risky for insurance companies.
“Another incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be nominated by the end of this year.
The vote itself will then take place until the end of February 2013," Nacher said.
Controversial EU regulations include the mandatory mixing of biocomponents into fuels, which, as a result, harms nature, and the ban on the use of reliable mercury thermometers simply because they contain relatively small amounts of non-drying substances in clays, clays from clays, or a directive on the size of clays.
Critics have also previously faced a de facto ban on the use of the term "salmon butter" or the exclusion of classic bulbs from sales.
High-quality bananas should be 14 centimeters long.
The EU apparatus often decides under the pressure of the commercial or industrial lobby, the requirements of which in Brussels are usually defended by a state or group of states (the Czech Republic is now also under the threat of a veto by its banks).
The interest of the lobby was also due to the fact that, for example, bananas of the highest quality had to be at least 14 cm in length in the Union and were not allowed to exhibit "anomalous curvature".
The European Commission has defended itself by harmonizing only the hitherto inconsistent national standards that have complicated trade.
The EU has already softened the rules on fruit and vegetables despite the resistance of some states, pointing out that the existing directives lead to food waste.
A candidate for the poll may also be the last year’s EU regulation, which says that inflatable balloons sold must be warned that children under the age of 8 must not inflate without adult supervision.
The EU has relied on US research here that balloons among toys are the leading cause of children's deaths from suffocation.
Similar restrictions now apply to children up to 14 years of age when blowing into pilgrimage shovels.
Curious ideas are also born at home
It is quite absurd, then, that the rule applies to European officials themselves - anyone who has an official function in the EU cannot use the name Macedonia because of the sensitivity of the issue to Greece and must speak of FYROM (Former Republic of Yugoslavia).
Bankovn<0xC3><0xAD>poplatky.com, in cooperation with the Association of Liberal Economists, nominated Laissez Faire for the survey in addition to some of the above absurdities, including the EU regulation on the volume of food supplies in the territory of the Member State.
The EU has set the maximum volumes of foodstuffs that could be found in the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our entry into the Union.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the determined volumes in canned mushrooms, for which it was threatened with a high fine.
The organisers of the survey were also interested in the idea of paying some countries for not having the sea, and the idea of granting grants to the request for a grant.
However, these ideas did not arise in Brussels, but in Prague.
"We're handicapped by the fact that we don't have a sea.
We will ask the European Union for a refund," said the then Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) in autumn 2004.
As an argument, he stated that a lot of grain was born in our country and as a result of the so-called intervention purchases, full warehouses were to be built that he had to export.
For having the Czech Republic go to ports, the EU had to pay us hundreds of millions of euros, according to the Palais.
The European Commission finally welcomed the Czech Republic by organising a tender to buy grain from countries that do not have access to the sea.
The grant for the grant was offered to the municipal Ministry for Local Development, managed by Minister Pavl n<0xC4><0x9B>mc (US-DEU), specifically to go to the writing of the application for the grant from Brussels.
EU: Bizarre regulations are an exception
While regulations are easily the target of criticism in the Member States, the EU's efforts to regulate and at the same time to improve the functioning and development of the Union as a whole deserve recognition, according to a number of experts.
A more serious problem, for example, according to experts, is the drawdown of EU grants on projects that have nothing to do with deepening European integration, but which have been forced by Member States in budgetary negotiations.
The emotion among the Czechs is also aroused by the fact that, like other EU countries, the Czech Republic has to fight in Brussels for the right to a specific designation of its traditional products, and it does not always succeed in this match.
Although the Czechs, after six years of fighting with the Germans and Raku<0xC5><0xA1>ana, adopted the designation of Olomouc shapes, the local rum, whose tradition dates back to the 19th century, had to be renamed by our producers to a native.
The names of rum can only be carried by products from cracked distillate, and not from sugar cane.
In the official list of registered EU products, the company of world-famous feta and gorgonzola cheeses, marzipan from German Lübeck or Parma ham have already been found, for example, carlover dryers, cherry and cherry hops and hops.
The EU trade mark can then also be proud of pardubic peanuts and mustard tubes.
People want me to save the republic, but I'm an amateur, says Okamura
Senator, how come you think you want to run for president?
I'm not talking about being a senator or president.
If it worked without problems in our country, I'm not running anywhere.
But I can no longer see how the country has been robbing for the last 20 years, how thieves are running around, people are raising taxes and retirement age.
I had no ambition to be a politician.
But when I see something I don’t like, I try to come up with a solution to change it.
And since I’m 40 years old and an independent non-party, I have no choice but to run for senator or president.
You've reached the Senate, but soon you've gone to the Castle.
Don't you turn your back on the people who chose you?
I've been saying all along that I'm going to fight for the castle according to the results of the Senate election.
I later stated that if I was elected senator, I would run for president.
But my goal is not a function, a function is a tool for how I can realize my vision.
That is why I need as much influence as possible and as much mandate as possible.
The problem, however, is not only that we as a nation serve in a restaurant and on television, but that we send out everyone who wants to try to change.
In addition to this, media that honors a person and that blurs the freedom of speech with the freedom to lie.
It may have been said about me that I was paying journalists or that I was an advisor to Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Paroubk.
Let's go to your visions.
You have fought for the castle with these tangible and criminal responsibilities of politicians and the return of property confessions of more than twenty million.
You need to change the law.
As president, however, you have no such authority and only the Senate as a whole can draft laws.
How do you want to solve this?
When I, as a citizen, lobbyed for guidance to be a free business, it was successful.
The problem is politicization - when someone comes up with a good proposal on the left or right, they are reluctant to accept it, and that's what holds the citizens back.
As an independent non-partisan, I have much more potential to get support from all parliamentary parties.
My advantage is that without party boxing and dogma, I can take something that is best for our country from each side and apply it.
Do you consider yourself a right-winger or a left-winger?
From the Czech point of view, it seems to me that people rank me rather to the left.
It doesn't matter to me whether it's a little left or a little right.
It is important to me that we move forward.
I don't care if anyone belongs to the left or the right, but I want to connect people.
I will always support any public good solution, even if it is proposed by the KS<0xC4><0x8C>M or ODS, and I will also be against bad ideas.
You're wrong when someone tells you you're a populist.
But don't you prove it by what you said?
When you create a business plan in a company, you also have some ideal goal and vision.
And that's what you're trying to get closer to.
Some may call it populism, but all the proposals I’m talking about are already working in the world, or have been talked about by major experts.
But without the support of the parliament, you will only have passwords.
You won’t be able to do that in politics in the long run.
Or do you think that if you go after people and talk to them, you will be able to enforce, for example, criminal and material responsibility?
I don't have a choice.
Convince politicians, journalists and the public and try to get them on their side to push for it.
If I am elected president, there is no problem in organizing a television broadcast where I ask the presidents of the parliamentary parties to legislate material and criminal responsibility for politicians, officials, judges and public prosecutors.
And they might have to tell me why they don't want her.
When there is a strong personality that will name the impurities, you can push on the political scene.
Take the direct election of the president, it was a result of public pressure.
I'm an amateur, I'm not a genius, I'm not an intellectual.
For my opinions and visions, I try to find allies.
I have just started politics and I will try to get the majority support for my program.
I'm trying to move things on my own, but if it doesn't work out, I'll finish in six years and go back to the private sector.
It sounds like Okamura is supposed to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know that I will not do anything in one person, so I have visited a number of well-known people, whether they would also not run for the Senate.
I went to Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, who refused because of the amount of work.
So at least I supported investigative journalist Jan Lorenco, who was covering up scams with light heating oils.
I've been running with people who are really dissatisfied, but now I'm in trouble.
Sixty percent of the people did not go to the election, and those who went mostly elected representatives of the establishment.
There are only two independents in the Senate.
The people have appealed to the Senate so that the changes will be difficult to enforce.
Yet I will fight for my visions, such as the direct choice of mayors or Heitmans.
Are you considering setting up your own party?
I haven’t thought about it yet, because I don’t have the time to check the clean past of every potential party, and I don’t even have the money for it.
I don't even have the money for the presidential campaign, there's only 20,000 on my transparent account.
You don't have the money?
You're talking about property confessions, what's yours?
Private property is estimated to be around $60 million.
In Prague I have land for about 25 million, an apartment for ten million, another apartment for eight million, a collection of works of art for about ten million, Aston Martin for 3.5 million and <0xC5><0xA0>koda Superb for a million, and then I have a few million in my account.
By the way, I have Aston Martin because it was my boy's dream - I've always liked James Bond, who drove in the car, was gallant to women, and at the same time fought against evils and vices.
You drive an Aston Martin, you have $60 million in assets and you don’t have the money to campaign?
You say you want to change the republic, but you don't want to spend too much of your own money on it.
That's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Is that what I owe you?
I've already hit 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I don't have any sponsors, indicates that I'm probably not that interested in my program.
And I have no obligation to pay for my campaign.
The cost of the campaign is basically what I'm going to get for the Senate salary.
But I wouldn't make it out of it, for example, I wouldn't be able to pay my son for an English school that costs 30,000 a month.
If I just want to make money, I'm not running anywhere.
So you're going to keep doing business so you can live?
Didn't you say you'd silence these activities?
But it has nothing to do with the salary.
As I promised, I have partially shut down my activities.
For example, a travel agent will become my representative in the spring.
People would want me to be a Samaritan who will save the republic.
But I also need to live on something.
How much as an entrepreneur were you used to taking per month?
Two hundred to 400,000, which I'm taking on.
And if I were president, I'd end my business.
The entire interview can be found in the Saturday edition of the Law.
MVRDV architects are proof that real adventures don’t just take place in the head – for example Spijkenisse and the recently built Book Mountain – 2 pictures
"The building looks cheerful, it looks futuristic. Finally there is something interesting to see again," says Lisette Verhaig, who walks around the edge of the road.
Stefan Spermon, an IT technician at a nearby big business, says: "Of course, the house is nice."
But I wonder why we still need a library for today.
They all have internet, iPads and e-books.
No one goes to any of these old-fashioned libraries voluntarily today, right?
Spijkenisse, a residence in close proximity to Rotterdam without any of its own work opportunities, which is not even worth a visit, holds a special record.
This village with 80,000 inhabitants has the lowest level of education in the whole of the Netherlands.
In order to resolve this stupid situation, a few years ago, the decision was made to contribute to general education and to build seven beautifully painted iron concrete miniatures of fictional bridges, which are depicted on euro banknotes.
The success of the educational offensive, however, was not dizzy.
And so the city council realized that there is only one way to become masters of statistics: we must have a library!
Winy Maas of the Rotterdam architectural studio MVRDV, master of insanely daring column graphs and creator of funny, often even cynical buildings, took the thing with the usual calm and at a competition in 2003 he appeared on a paper under five books.
And while the commission was still looking around and shrugging its shoulders, the bold Maas made his presents on himself by size and ended his activistically justified speech with the words "Dear City Town!"
So this is my proposal at the Book Mountain in Spijkenisse, so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the mountain was completed for 30 million euros.
It is part of the revitalization project, which also includes underground parking, supermarket, post office and several adjacent residential and semi-detached houses with a total of 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November, the Book Mountain was awarded second place "Best Library of NL 2012".
The project is also nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
The small town gray, which has not yet been able to offer more than a postmodern pedestrian zone and an unusually ugly town hall, behind which you would rather expect a dairy farm, is thanks to this a bit richer in contemporary architecture.
Above all, however, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in the history of its existence.
A long way to the book
First impression: a reading eldorado under the cover of cheese.
A lift rides through the mountain massif, but you will discover real spatial and reading passions only when you walk through the topography.
On all sides, the glass interior is bright and clear, the floor made of burnt cabriolet and the elegant street lanterns clearly express the atmosphere of the public square.
The urban environment is perfect.
You see the park benches, the dog and the boys and girls playing football.
And everywhere books, books, books.
“Normally there are shelves with books along the facade and in the middle is a large dark space, which is usually inconsolable and impersonal,” says Winy Maas.
We built the classic spatial configuration upside down and pushed the reader’s space out from the inside.
The inside of the book mountain is skillfully used: in the center there are offices, an internet library, a chess club, an ecological center and a central home appliance.
A special comfort is the black shelves for books, which are once a wall cladding, once a parapet and sometimes a fence of stairs.
The appearance, structure and smell are foreign.
Over the unknown building material, even architects and construction engineers will be involved in twisting their heads.
“We wanted to work with recycled materials here,” says Joop Trouborst, project manager at Spijkenisse, at the request of Standard magazine.
And so, one day, we came across a suitable agricultural waste product in a fresh farm.
For many years, in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands, a millimetre of synthetic matter has been used as a base under the roots.
It is inexpensive and time efficient.
Thin textile will last one, two seasons and then mature to dispose of into bulky waste.
For the library, the rune - for the first time in such a quantity - was slit on plates with a thickness of four centimeters.
Under the influence of heat and pressure, the so-called Landbouwplastic (KLP) is dyed into a dark, homogeneous and load-bearing material that smells a bit like a new car and a bit like sports shoes.
After 105 steps you will get to the top.
At the end of the almost 500-metre long journey, you will be rewarded not only with fantastic views of the city, but also with Dutch croquettes and ficuses in pots.
They care about the atmosphere, but above all about the correct humidity of the air in the mountains of literature.
Gifts for a new soul
“You might not believe it, but this house is a demonstration project in terms of ecology despite many glass surfaces,” says Trouborst.
It warms and cools with ground heat.
Although the Mountain of Books stands under a glass cover, the sun shines inside only briefly, even on sunny days.
Wide adhesive wooden brackets, which stand perpendicular to the glass facade, serve as a shield and capture much of the sun's rays.
The climate in the room is very pleasant.
With the rest he can handle fully automatic roller shutters.
Stefan Spermon, the initial skeptic in the IT industry, has already visited the new library.
And Lisette Verhaig was already there.
And also the traditional Chinese medicine teacher Cynthia Bogarde, who even calls Boekenberg "the long-awaited soul" Spijkenisse.
Reason: Every resident of the city was invited to the opening a few weeks ago to donate one book from his personal fund.
First, the optical gaps were to be filled in the not yet fully equipped library, which currently counts 70,000 pieces.
The concept proved itself.
The shelves are full.
“There’s nothing worse than a half-empty library,” says architect Winy Maas.
"I think that thanks to our invitation, every resident now has a certain relationship with the new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it was just for decoration.
With this, the MVRDV succeeded in the royal discipline, which in the professional jargon is called the formation of identity.
Spijkenisse wrote the history of literature.
No matter how young or uneducated they are.
This is the starting point for identity.
Szabo: "Germans have to play a bigger role"
Germany abstained from the vote when deciding to accept Palestine.
According to the expert on relations between the United States and Europe Stephen Szaboa, Berlin is balancing on the narrow edge of diplomacy.
Deutsche Welle: Germany first signaled earlier this week that it would vote against the proposal for the observer status of Palestinians in the United Nations.
But then Berlin abstained from the vote.
- Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis did in Gaza.
Now, of course, Germany has to be cautious about its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I don’t think he will support the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence – without, of course, being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it came to the establishment of a no-fly zone.
In the end, NATO came forward.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear stand on serious international issues?
Yeah, that's right.
The reason is that he is changing his foreign policy, from a policy that was so-called US-led, to a German foreign policy.
The situation is all the more difficult because Europeans do not have a coherent and unified policy.
The Germans are between the two fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they are still occupying themselves in their role, but they are on their way to a "normal" foreign policy.
The foreign policy they have in France or in the United Kingdom.
What exactly does “normal” foreign policy mean from the German point of view?
It shows willingness to take positions that are independent of the positions of the United States or European partners in the case of national interests.
I think that German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, i.e. exports and its relations with certain areas, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany’s economic interests are to a certain extent different from those of other great powers, and therefore Germany must defend its interests.
Did economic interests influence the position in the Middle East conflict and vote in the UN?
First of all, Germany has a large trading site in the Middle East, especially in the states around the Persian Gulf.
Therefore, it must be careful not to intimidate the public, but also the elites in the Arab countries.
Anyway, that plays a role.
But I would not like to attach too much importance to it, it is not a completely unilateral relationship.
This, however, plays an important role in the German considerations.
Did Germany’s relations with the US hurt when Germany abstained from voting in the event of both important decisions, such as the Palestinian vote?
I think that there is a great understanding of the German attitude in Europe and even in the US.
That is why I do not think it was as dramatic a breakthrough as in the Libyan question.
Hopefully, Germany will get a bit of respect from that.
This indicates that he must be considered an international player and that his interests must be taken into account.
There are different views on the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
The U.S., on the other hand, has clearly voted in favor of a veto.
Are there differences of opinion between the United States and many European nations?
These differences have always existed as a result of U.S. domestic policy.
I think that the Obama administration probably has a considerable understanding of the European stance.
But as a result of the political situation there, this attitude cannot, of course, be made public.
I don’t think the differences in opinion are really as big as they always seem.
When you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, Obama is not at all very enthusiastic about Netanyahu’s politics.
Is it not difficult for Germany to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the US on the one hand and with the position of the most important partners in the EU on the other?
I think that's what makes it hard for the Germans.
For the Germans, of course, it would be a little easier if there were a coherent and unified European policy, which is not currently happening.
They cannot therefore be part of the broader line and instead have to move things forward from their own position.
That’s what they do with the euro.
I believe that Germany will take on a leading role in the future and will push Europe towards a European position.
This is not easy for Germany, of course, because of relations with Israel.
This has always been a sensitive topic.
But I think it is clear to the Germans that they have to play a more independent role.
Does Germany see itself as a major international player? Does it even want to take on the leading role?
Or is the leading role for Germany still difficult?
Germany is still not used to it, it is still unpleasant, and for this country, for obvious reasons, it is still difficult to play a bigger role.
For example, when we look at the European crisis, whenever Germany takes on a larger role, anti-German sentiments arise.
This does not make it easy for the Germans.
It’s actually an old problem: we don’t want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
In this respect, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It must be acceptable for a variety of neighbors and opinions and it is not easy.
The influence of the United States in European politics is now steadily decreasing, but the EU is not currently filling this vacuum.
The Germans will have to play a bigger role.
Even if they don't like it, it's unpleasant and will make them even more unpopular - c'est la vie!

"Protection of brands" in China: when Puma and Armani are suddenly Chinese
Armani is a world-renowned brand, also Polo Ralph Lauren.
What is Armani Polo?
Behind this is a designation that is completely officially registered in China, but has nothing to do with the original company.
However, it enjoys protection for as long as it is not challenged by the real owners of the brand.
And even then, it is not clear whether the rights are domesticated.
“It’s increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China,” says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing’s office, who specializes in violating the rights of protection in the Far East.
Every week there's a new case on my desk.
A few more letters are enough for counterfeiters to sign up for their trademarks.
For example, the Gucci brand becomes Lu-Gucci and instead of Prada, they register Prada-Kny.
In this way, German companies, such as the manufacturer of sports goods Puma, are also legally copied.
Pattloch opens the organizer with the registrations of the trade mark office in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company was left there to protect the Zegna DF Puma brand, an artificial name that also parasitizes the Ermenegildo Zegna fashion house.
The Chinese are known to be world champions in copying and infringing intellectual property.
In large cities, there are several-storey shopping malls in which counterfeits are sold almost exclusively.
However, Pattloch’s cases are different, and on behalf of his mandates, he is acting against the Chinese companies being given the full official right to use a mark that is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "Bang Mingpai", an associate brand.
This word focuses on "Bang Dakuan".
That's what we mean by women who hunt rich men.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
“It hurts the trade, we have to fight it,” Pattloch urges.
"The mark will dissolve, the exclusive position will disappear, the damage to the image is huge."
The financial losses and judicial costs of the affected industries go to millions, especially in the case of expensive sample products.
According to market research firm CLSA, China, with a volume of 15 billion euros per year, is the third largest market for luxury goods and the fastest growing market.
However, the deletion of dubious records in the trademark register can be difficult to achieve and something is worth it.
The procedure can last for up to nine years, with uncertain results.
Pattloch talks about cases in which the court rejected the lawsuits, because the name has become a "market reality" after a long period of time.
If the plaintiff is unlucky, he has to pay the plagiarism because he damaged his mark in China, Pattloch says.
Sometimes there is the law of the jungle.
Well-known cases also concern graphical elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal dispute with the construction machinery manufacturer Sana, a company that recently took over the German pump manufacturer for the Putzmeister concrete mixture.
To this day, the Chinese are allowed to use an emblem that resembles a Mercedes star.
The company Geely, which bought Volvo, originally used a blue-white logo that resembled BMW. The dispute was settled, Geely had to change the logo.
The manufacturer of the fashion goods Lacoste lost in China with counterfeiters from Hong Kong and Singapore, who turned the famous crocodile in the opposite direction.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
Although the CTMO Trademark Office admits that there were shortcomings in 2010 due to too few employees and spaces.
But last year, it was reported that “the course of the work process has returned from the emergency situation to normal.”
For example, the number of unprocessed opposition proceedings fell by 22 per cent.
57,000 of these cases were closed, 75 percent more than in the previous year.
However, there are still 81,500 complaints pending at the office.
Something to do about it is expensive.
As is often the case in China, these are impressive numbers.
In the past year, more than 1.4 million applications for brand protection have been submitted to CTMO, which is almost a third more than in 2010.
That’s a record, and that means China is running the list of new applications all over the world.
This also applies to the number of all valid trademarks - a total of 5.5 million.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan was selected for fees.
Simply put, each application costs an average of 1280 yuan, or 160 euros.
Starting a dispute against it costs several times, as the case of the German family business Freudenberg shows.
The group has been fighting the Chinese plagiarism for more than seven years.
Although the Germans achieved the fact that his illegal production of imitation car parts was abolished.
However, the counterfeiter continued to secure Chinese rights to the Freudenberg brand.
We ourselves would neglect this, because in Germany the surname cannot be protected, says Hanno Wentzler, CEO of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The Trademark Office of CTMO also rejected the Munich company’s objection.
In two other instances, Freudenberg has won the rights, but the opponent in the dispute continues to fight today.
You have to be very careful.
The matter is now being discussed in the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident that the case will lead to a good end and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says, “Driving is extremely expensive and costs us a lot of time, money and nerves.”
Internal costs cannot be calculated. In the archives of the company, they even had to look at 100-year-old files in order to submit evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg, on the other hand, in vain offered a "high six-digit amount in euros" in order to settle the dispute.
“You see what that means for us,” says Wentzler.
The threat from the Far East also threatens to affect Europe.
And that's when imitators secure unprotected marks there.
One Chinese manufacturer, for example, wanted to register the designation Freudenberg for shoes and leather in Germany.
This area of business has long since been abandoned by the Group, yet it has been able to reverse the registration.
“You have to be careful,” says Wentzler.
He and his lawyer, Pattloch, advise German companies to be very careful when trading with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trade mark law; rather, foreigners should “report everything that is worth protecting in any way, even in China,” Wentzler says.
Otherwise, it can be much more expensive than registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg were to be subjected to a trademark in the last act of its drama, then it would probably have to pay the license fees on its own behalf, explains Wentzler.
Or we will be pushed out of the market in the contested segment.
World AIDS Day: Blowjob, Singing, Help
In Heidelberg, the Imbongi choir tries - and in Swaziland, orphans are happy with their parents who died of AIDS.
The story of a connection that exceeds much more than 8733 kilometers.
First, there’s the butt: cowboy high boots, basketball boots, women’s boats and men’s moccasins look for tact on the parquet and quickly find it.
One-two-three-four.
Then the voices of the singers - alt, bass, tenor and soprano - slowly rise up, mummy and fight each other.
29-year-old conductor Fiete Hoff almost lifts it out of his textile boots when he joins his voices with his woolly wild gestures.
In the music hall of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the Imbongi choir is rehearsing a new song.
Fifty singers and singers between the ages of 23 and 69, from the researcher of human genetics to the native.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy song, every choral voice has a different text and also in a very foreign language - Zulu, spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Self-Help
Unaids, the United Nations Programme to Combat AIDS, estimates that around 34 million people around the world are infected with HIV.
Of these, 23.5 million live in South Africa.
In Swaziland, there are 245,000 orphans after parents died of AIDS.
HIV-positive is already more than 40 percent of the population.
For 180 orphans after parents who died of AIDS, the Voices for Africa Association found patrons in Germany in the village of Esitjeni.
Seventy of them attend secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros per month you can take over the patronage.
It guarantees the child a school uniform and one warm meal a day at the Gogo Center.
In Zulu, Imbongi means “the narrator of stories” or “the one who boasts.”
No one in this room can speak fluent Bantu, just sing.
For almost a decade, he has been practicing the chorus of songs in this foreign soft language and sometimes also bringing them back to where they originally came from: South Africa.
At an aerial distance of 8,733 kilometres from Heidelberg, in the northeastern part of the Swaziland, the village of Esitjeni is dependent on the power of the German choir.
Forty percent are infected.
There are about 2,000 people living there, some still in plain clay or straw huts, a large part of which are children.
More than 300 of them no longer have parents because they have been exposed to HIV.
In Estonia, it can be seen in the small, shattering of the whole of Swaziland: the highest rate of HIV infection, the lowest life expectancy in the world according to UNICEF.
A male foreskin cut, which demonstrably reduces the risk of infection by half, is not accepted by the population.
More than forty percent of people in Swaziland carry the virus with weakened immunity. It is not uncommon for them to die in their early thirties.
This village was discovered by a congregation on a joint trip through Africa in the spring of 2005, but especially the members of the Imbongi saw many children on the streets, who lacked not only parental care, but cleaned everything: food, clothing, education.
Without schooling, they have no chance at all in a poor country.
At first it was still a private deployment of individuals, which for a few euros a year allowed the child to send to school and give him one warm meal a day.
A year later, however, the association Voices for Africa was founded, which has since taken care of orphans and parents who died of AIDS, almost professionally.
Facts about Sexually Transmitted Infections
What are the most serious sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial SPIs include syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea.
Common viral SPIs are HIV, human papillomavirus, herpes genitalis or hepatitis.
Cells and itches are part of the parasitic SPI.
Who is among the most affected people?
Syphilis and dizziness occur mainly in men who have sex with men.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, at least four out of five cases of syphilis reported in Germany are transmitted by sexual contacts between men.
In heterosexual adults, they are sexually transmitted diseases that occur frequently, chlamydia infections, trichomonas, candidiasis (fungus), drip and human papillomaviruses.
HIV is relatively rare among heterosexual adults, but about 20 percent of people newly infected with HIV belong to this group.
Chlamydia infections occur significantly more frequently among adolescents than among other population groups.
According to European surveys, three-quarters of all infections affect young people between the ages of 15 and 25.
In addition, human papillomaviruses are often present among adolescents.
How did the number of infections develop?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases need to be reported.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of people infected with syphilis has more than doubled from 1,697 diseases in 2001 to 3,698 diseases in 2011.
The number of people newly infected with HIV has been declining since 2007.
In 2011, there were about 2,700 cases.
That's about one-tenth less than a year earlier.
What Are the Symptoms of Sexual Illness?
Infectious diseases can cause genital ulcers, difficulty urinating, discharge, abdominal pain and blisters or warts.
However, they often do not cause any pain or other symptoms, and therefore remain unnoticed.
How is it possible to protect yourself?
The risk of infections can be reduced by condoms, but they do not offer 100% protection.
Because the causes of sexually transmitted diseases can also be partially transmitted by infection from impurities and close physical contact.
Therefore, experts recommend regular examinations, especially in the case of frequent alternation of sexual partners.
In the case of early diagnosis, it is possible to cure most of the SPI and prevent subsequent consequences.
Thanks to the patronage, charitable gifts and, last but not least, the honoraries that the choir earns by singing throughout Germany, some money is raised.
“We have already sent about 200,000 euros to Estonia,” said Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
Money from Germany is managed in the village of Zodwa Dlamini, a self-confident woman who can make a living.
It also ensures that orphaned children find shelter, for example, in some of the grandmothers.
Gogo, as the Zulu says to old women, are the backbone of the village.
Some of them also took 14 orphans, gave them a roof over their heads, and made sure that the children arrived in school uniforms on time every day.
The children, who no longer have anyone, go to a shelter in Khanyisila, a lonely woman paid by the association as well as two chefs who cook for more than 200 hungry children each day.
Voices for Africa also founded a sewing school, built two chickens and, together with the American health organization PSI, arranged for many people in the village to be tested for HIV.
Although the disease is so obvious in the whole country, everyone is silent about it.
King with 14 wives.
“AIDS is absolutely taboo,” says Annette Lennartz, “because it has to do with sexuality.”
Actually, it's pretty weird in a country where the king officially holds 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his immeasurable lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
This state-approved lifestyle is also responsible for, among other things, the fact that the HIV virus has spread so rapidly in recent decades.
But also many migrant workers who spread the virus across the country.
Annette Lennartz says condoms are free on every corner, "but no one uses them.
Culture is different - unprotected contact."
To support cultural exchange at least a little, the Imbongi choir travels once every two or three years together in South Africa and sings songs full of sadness, combativity, confidence in the future and confidence of blacks, which many in the southern tip of the apartheid of the black continent know.
A bus full of white people singing songs in the language of blacks - such an award not only brings mood and joy, but has already shed tears in many wild border soldiers.
The road always leads to Esitjeni, where the singers visit the children over whom they have patronage.
Although you can hardly find this village on maps, in the valley of the Ezulweni River it is more than known.
"Go to Esitjeni, there is light," people say there.
And when you go back to Heidelberg, which is from here an aerial line of 8,733 kilometers, to the horny singers at the Bergheimer Straße rehearsal, you see that the light is shining here too.
Messenger: NASA discovered on Mercury led
The Messenger probe has found evidence that there is ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice cover could be as thick as 20 meters.
The U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has proven the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is located closest to the Sun, there is also frozen water, according to three studies published on Thursday by the expert magazine "Science".
The Messenger probe has found evidence that there is an ice cover in the region of this planet, which lies in a permanent shadow.
It is said to be at least 30 centimetres long and possibly up to 20 meters thick.
This water probably came from comets or perhaps even from asteroids that crashed into Mercury.
But let’s not forget the finding of ice related to the existence of life on this planet, said lead scientists working on the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help us to explain how water and other basic elements of life got into other areas of the solar system.
Sondes, telescopes, and small robots like Phoenix, an unobserved alien, take part in exploring the depths of the universe.
From time to time, images will be sent to Earth, a small window into infinite distances.
The image comes from a photographic device developed by German scientists at the Max Planck Institute.
Eight planets of our solar system, in addition to the dwarf planet Ceres.
Just like Pluto, which orbits the Sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not, according to the 2006 International Astronomical Union’s new definition, a “planet.”
This cut-out from the infrared image of Spitzer's telescope shows a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars. The oldest stars look like blue dots, the worst identifiable are pinkish-colored "newcomers" in the birth hall of the stars.
This region where stars form - scientists call it unromantic W5 - was discovered by Spitzer's telescope in the constellation Cassiopeia at a distance of 6,500 light-years.
This changing heat of dying stars was captured by NASA's Spitzer telescope.
The inner ring is made up of material that the star exploded during the process of dying.
In the giant Trifid Nebula, which is 5,400 light-years away from Earth, a new star is formed from the gas and dust.
The photo of the galactic "column" was taken by NASA's Spitzer telescope.
The Pleiades constellation, also called the Seven Sisters, is visible to the naked eye at night.
Thanks to the telescope, the colors are better.
The Helix nebula may appear to the observers on this infrared image as a red eye.
It is located at a distance of 700 light-years from the constellation Aquarius.
Its similarity to the earthly part of the world brought this nebula the name of North America.
The combination of normal and infrared photography is the cause of unusual coloring.
This "baby" among the stars was able to capture in full beauty the infrared detectors of Spitzer's telescope.
Saturn and its rings: how they were created is one of the greatest astronomical mysteries.
Perhaps they are the remains of Saturn’s moon, which disappeared without a trace 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the largest and sharpest images of the Hubble Telescope: the Milky Way Galaxy
The images of spiral galaxies, according to their coloring, become real works of art.
The image, published by the European Southern Observatory, shows a few thousand light-years away Trifid Nebula in the constellation Shooter.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (divided into three parts, triangular), because the dark strips of dust divide the gurgling heart of this starry nursery into three parts.
In the constellation Hadonos, astronomers have photographed the prediction of a cosmic collision: 400 million light-years away from Earth, a woman becomes the nucleus of two intersecting galaxies and must inevitably collide.
The birth of the star was recorded by Hubble's telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
Anyone who doesn’t like technical abbreviations can call it the Southern Windmill.
A photograph from Hubble's space telescope shows a cut-out of the Iris Nebula in the constellation Cephea.
This 1,400 light-year distant nebula consists of dust particles that are ten to one hundred times smaller than ordinary domestic dust.
This image was composed of optical and X-ray images of various telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes that is 430 million light-years away from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, was recorded by Hubble's space telescope for NASA.
This larger spiral galaxy is called UGC 1810 by scientists.
This nebula is home to the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way.
The cradle of stars gives rise to constantly new growths.
Also, these stellar clouds, associated with the nebula Rosette, give birth to new young stars, 5000 light-years away from Earth.
In this brightly glowing galaxy with a small black hole, there is no dust yet, only gas.
Scientists believe that it was only formed shortly after the Big Bang, when hydrogen was predominantly present throughout the universe.
Our Views of the Universe: The Most Important Telescopes
The telescope was supposedly invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey, who used it to observe the stars a year later before Galileo Galilei.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have been constantly increasing – and the views they mediate are becoming deeper and deeper.
The largest telescope in the world for 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, was Hale's telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego.
The mirror in this picture had a diameter of five meters.
The Large Binocular Telescope is located in Arizona.
It allows you to look into the universe using two mirrors, each of which has a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior of Gran Telescopio Canarias on one of the Canary Islands - La Palma is huge. Only a mirror measures a diameter of 10.4 meters.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented to save costs.
Nevertheless, its diameter reaches about eleven meters.
The disadvantage of the inexpensive construction method: the telescope is secured by a hook at an altitude angle, thus limiting its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is also located at an altitude angle.
Its peculiarity is the high amplification of the light flow.
This, despite the relatively small diameter of the mirror, equals the world’s largest mirror telescopes.
Using a radio telescope in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, scientists in space are searching for extraterrestrial signals.
This radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
In the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI) - the search for extraterrestrial intelligence - can help any computer owner who will make its computing power available.
View of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) observatory in the Chilean Andes.
The Very Large Telescope stands here and honors its name.
This telescope with a total of four mirrors can also illuminate the medium infrared spectrum.
The European Extremely Large Telescope is also planned at ESO’s Chilean Observatory.
Its main mirror is to have a full 42 meters and is to be composed of almost 1000 mirror elements.
However, the images can be counted first in 2018.
Two Kick telescopes on Hawaii's Mauna Kea volcano were considered to be the largest in the world until 2007.
They offer two mirrors, each with a diameter of ten meters.
Keck's telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which, in addition to them, also looks into space using the Subaru and IRTTF telescopes.
A new giant telescope is to be built on Mauna Kea, with a 30-metre diameter of a mirror.
Here you can admire it in the picture.
But the most important impressions from the universe are conveyed to us by Hubble's space telescope.
It has been providing us with footage of distant worlds since April 24, 1990.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been searching for extrasolar planets – especially those that are habitable.
On February 2, 2011, NASA announced that 1,235 candidate planets had been detected since the mission began.
The image documents the latest preparations before the launch of the Kepler Space Telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will first be launched into space in 2018 aboard the Ariane5 rocket.
The primary mirror of the space infrared telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope is to look for the light of the first stars and galaxies after the Big Bang.
Scientists believe that there is ice on the southern pole of Mercury.
However, there are no reliable data for this, as Messenger orbits this planet much closer to the north pole.
Radar measurements have shown that there is ice on Mercury for decades.
Thanks to the Messenger probe, which was launched in 2004 and is the first to orbit Mercury, scientists are now confident.
Drink butter every day and you will live to be 168 years old
In southern Azerbaijan, many people will live through the biblical age.
There is even a museum of longevity.

In southern Azerbaijan, many people will live through the biblical age.
There is even a museum of longevity.
Searching for footprints in a country where 97-year-olds are still relatively young.
The ride of the Taly<0xC5><0xA1> Mountains can be called wildly romantic.
The microbus crawls along the road with many turns along densely forested hills, ravine rivers and simple rural constructions.
Everything is green and juicy, it almost looks like we're in the Schwarzwald.
However, this is the furthest south of Azerbaijan. The border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
Here lives a Caucasian ethnic group of Talys, of which it is not very well known, except that it speaks perfectly Persian and Azerbaijani and lives a very high age.
The final stop is Lerik.
This town is home to a monumental architecture from Soviet times, which does not fit into the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe do not come here. Arrival from the Azerbaijani capital of Baku is too difficult.
It takes eight hours for 323 kilometers, because the road is only one-way.
The fairytale wealth for which the country owes oil to the Caspian Sea has not yet come to the countryside.
However, Pilate Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik wants to become a tourist attraction.
“Baku celebrated the Eurovision Song Contest in May – and next year we will have a festival of the oldest people in the world,” says Fatulajeva.
She is the director of the Museum of Longevity, probably the only one in the world.
Here is documented the life of almost eight dozen Talys from the surroundings, who are over a hundred years old. Fatulayeva shows a black and white photo.
This is my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
At the age of 136, he gave birth to a child.
However, the controversial star of this museum is the shepherd of sheep Shirali Muslümov, who was supposed to be 168 years old.
The birth certificate does not exist.
And given the fact that the oldest person with the documents was 122 years old, the age of Muslim seems extremely doubtful.
"He was born in this area in 1805 and died in 1973," explains Fatulayeva.
The man was said to have been married three times and had 23 children, and at the age of 136 he still had a daughter.
Wasn’t Shirali Muslim wrong at the age of a few decades?
However, Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, also heard about the elderly people in Central Asia.
“A lot of older people also live in some areas of China, in Japan, or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan,” Scholz says, “in Sardinia, too, there are extremely many very old men.”
However, due to the lack of evidence, no scientific evidence of age can be provided, especially when the matrices are missing.
Every day a glass of melted butter
The fact is, though, that people in the area around Lerik are experiencing the biblical age quite often.
Currently there are 20 people who are over 100 years old.
So why are so many people living in the South?
The Azerbaijani guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains this with the peculiar genes of the Talys.
The director of the Fatuljev Museum, on the other hand, believes that it consists in nutrition.
However, the fact that it is the caloric diet of Talys, who love meat, bread and especially dairy products and many of whom drink a glass of dissolved butter every day, is so healthy, from a bromatological point of view, it does not seem exactly credible.
Or is it the original way of life that keeps people young? Rubaba Mirzayeva lives in Cengemiran, a small village near the town of Lerik.
At 97 years old, she is still relatively young at this latitude.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region.
He sits on the ground with a butterfly, which he constantly caresses.
There are eight people living under one roof, including one of Mirzay's sons and daughter, both of whom have long been grandparents.
There are also two small children walking around.
In the kitchen, tea is prepared for guests, which is served in typical belly-shaped glasses of "armada".
Mirzaeva’s white teeth make up the perfect line and under the hat she hides a long dark blonde copy, which her son proudly reveals in front of us.
I've always washed my hair with milk, so I didn't like it and they kept their color.
"I've never used shampoo either," Mirzayeva says.
A monthly pension is enough to live
She always ate only what came from her own yard, tomatoes, potatoes, toys.
I haven’t bought any food in the supermarket in my entire life.
Then she tells me about her husband who was in the army.
The worst was during the Second World War.
But everything improved when the helmet was taken over by the "loved father" Gejdar Aliyev.
Propaganda sounds strange from an old woman's mouth.
However, the cult that is made around the figure of the father of nations who ruled his country as a dictator knows no bounds in Azerbaijan.
He was in power until 2003, then took over the reins of his son Ilham.
At least the elderly in Azerbaijan do not suffer from emergencies.
Mirzajeva receives a pension of 230 manat each month (approximately the same amount in euros). This is an income from which one can benefit well.
And perhaps the long-awaited son of Mirzaya is also right: "Old people are enjoying great seriousness in our culture."
They live in the midst of a large family, they are loved, cared for, and happy.
If there is no reason to stay alive as long as possible
The concept of “human rights” is missing in the Constitution.
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Uncontroversial demonstrations in Cairo revealed the country’s deep divide.
A future constitution based on sharia law is being debated.
The Egyptian president did not spare the pathos.
We need to create a transition.
"And for us to succeed, I am responsible, in front of people and before God," he said on state television.
His speech was addressed to the entire nation, but above all to Christian Coptics, liberals, enlightened Muslims, and secular persons.
All of them, so far hopelessly puzzled in a confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a “godly state” on the Nile issued for the mercy of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohammed Mursi almost apologisingly said that he temporarily limited the powers of the Constitutional Court and expanded his powers to “save the revolution.”
But what the 61-year-old engineer, who holds a doctorate from the American University of Southern California, really wants to save, the Egyptians and the world are not clear about it.
Should the judiciary be deprived of power?
The 234 paragraphs, which the head of the Constitutional Assembly, with the majority of Islamists, hastily approved in a fifteen-hour night marathon, are partly worrisome.
As in previous constitutions, it is also said in this proposal that jurisdiction is based on “the principles of Islamic law.”
But what does "basics" mean?
This was and is a matter of interpretation, and it can be feared that Islamists will use this ambiguous formulation and the legal free space associated with it for a more rigorous interpretation of the Shariah.
At least this illuminates a new paragraph: In all matters relating to the Shari'a, it is necessary to consult with the University of al-Azhar, which is the most important Islamic institution in the country with a great influence on the whole of Sunni Islam.
It may not, but it may mean that the clergy will exercise oversight over the legislation, which would bring to justice the de facto deprivation of its right.
There is a lot of interpretation in the Constitution.
The problem is also that the civilian jurisdiction of the military courts should continue to be maintained.
These courts served under Mubarak’s government to suppress the opposition.
After the fall of the dictatorship, up to 11,000 civilians were in military custody.
As stated in the proposal, the state should also protect “the essence of the Egyptian family and promote its morality and values.”
This is so inaccurately formulated by the legal side that, with the help of this paragraph, state institutions could even control the content of film art and literature.
In understandable speech, it means nothing but censorship.
In fact, no paragraph defines the explicit equality of men and women in writing.
Therefore, another paragraph prohibits the harassment or slander of the Prophet Muhammad and his envoy.
However, it remains unclear what shame is and how it will be prosecuted.
Equally doubtful is the formulation that it is forbidden to "injure people".
Is the president’s cartoon or a joke at the expense of legal experts enough?
A matter of interpretation, like so many others in this proposal, which Mr. Mursi will submit for signature and, according to his words, will "very soon" present to the Egyptians for the purpose of a popular vote.
"The Revolution is Back"
For several weeks now, the opposition has been forming against the excesses of Islamists.
Tens of thousands of people gathered in an unusual gathering on Friday night in Cairo’s Tahrir Square and vowed to destroy the constitution even before it came into effect.
"The revolution is back and we will win," said Hamd<0xC3><0xAD>n Sabb<0xC3><0xA1>h<0xC3><0xAD>, who placed third in the presidential election.
Nobel laureate and former Director-General of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed Baradej said the draft constitution belongs "in the rubbish of history."
Through the short message service, Twitter accused followers of Mursi of wanting to carry out a "coup against democracy".
"If he declares a referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him," opposition official Jasir Said said.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers is not yet punished," Egyptian opposition politician Khalid Ali said in a statement.
Several judges announced they did not want to oversee the referendum, which would become invalid.
“The Qur’an is our constitution.”
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood declared a protest, but with caution not on Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other bank of the Nile in front of the Kahir University.
It was attended by many covered women and supporters of Salafists who shouted, "The people demand the application of God's law."
They called to Mursi, "Clean the earth," and said, "The Qur'an is our constitution."
The struggle for sovereignty over the symbolic square of Tahrir, where it all began, would probably trigger a state similar to the civil war.
Mursi’s followers obviously didn’t want to risk it.
The Muslim Brotherhood said opponents and proponents of the draft constitution had expressed themselves loud and clear.
Now is the time to let the people at election hours decide which direction the country should go.
The majority is considered to be in favour of the proposal of Islamists.
"The word 'human rights' does not occur once"
The forced constitutional dispute, which is supposed to continue until February and integrate all social forces, is rumored by Hafiz Abu Sa'd.
An eighty-year-old human rights defender and president of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) defended members of the Muslim Brotherhood when they were behind Mubarak in prison or standing in court.
Not because he shares their ideology, but because human rights are indivisible to him.
He was beaten, convicted, and imprisoned for that.
"And there are no words in the new constitution now for 'human rights'," he complains in an interview for "Welt am Sonntag".
Mursi's extension of power to all three power constituents in the state forced this lawyer to resign.
These measures are a scandalous offense against the democratic rules of the game and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the president has actually canceled it," Sa'da laments.
But without civil society organizations, democracy cannot work.
Sa'da also feels abandoned by the international community, which is watching the battle of ideological factions on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
That could be his revenge.
A protester in Tahrir Square warned: "You have created a monster that you can no longer control."
Norsk<0xC3><0xBD> rakfisk: The Most Smellful Fish in the World?
The five million people living in Norway enjoy one of the highest living standards not only in Europe but also in the world.
Could the secret of the country’s success be linked to a local appetite for extraordinarily fragrant fish?
Take a few overgrown cheeses.
Place them in the middle of a pile of dirty and wet football equipment.
Leave it for a week.
This will give you a paralyzing scent of raccoon, one of the biggest Norwegian delicacies.
I'm in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There is snow here, beautiful views - and the ubiquitous smell hangs in the air.
Rakfish is a salty shrub fertilized in water for up to one year - it depends on how much you want the fish to smell.
As it gets dark and it starts to get cold, the Norwegians here in Fagernes begin to meet at a festival dedicated to how to say it best, the most compelling food.
"You dream of it raw and then you drink it with a glass of aquavit," says Havard Halvarsen, a local professional firefighter, but also the so-called "Racfish General", who is responsible for the festival.
Everywhere around us people eat small cubes of fish and drink them with a large amount of alcohol.
“Some people prefer aquavit rather than raccoons,” says Harvard.
The drink can overwhelm the smell.
I'll try a few pieces.
If the fish can avoid your nose, it's not so bad - it's like a piece of sushi that was on the long way by bus.
Rakfisk is a product of very different times when there was poverty in Norway, and because there were no refrigerators yet, the fish were soaked in airtight vessels with water and salt in the fall.
Then in the middle of the winter, when they were well-fed, they pulled out and ate - the senses were undoubtedly fattened with alcohol.
Just one generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country and look for work, most of them emigrating to the United States.
At present, the population is growing rapidly – more than 13% of immigrants are attracted to large amounts of work, high earnings and a vast care system.
The inhabitants of Sweden, an old rival, who was much richer than Norway before, flock to the country for work.
Rakfisk is seen as something important, indispensable, albeit a rather fragrant part of the Norwegian past.
It is one of the more expensive foods on the market.
Even if it's expensive everything - a small glass of beer or a sandwich will cost you 9 pounds ($14) per piece.
Norway often fails to get into global reports - and it seems that most of the population is compliant with it.
The name of Anders Breivik, a right-wing racist extremist who shot 77 men, women and children last year, here people still mention with disgust.
Instead, the shooting is called the “July 22 incident.”
The Norwegians can hardly believe that in their peaceful country one of them was capable of such brutality and murder.
Norway’s current wealth lies in the growth of one of the world’s largest oil and gas industries from the early 1970s.
"But oil isn't the only reason we're doing so well," says our waitress Anna, who, with her long blonde hair and surprisingly blue eyes, is a prototype of Nordic well-being.
We are, as you say, considerate people.
Its English, as well as the English of most of the people here, is absolutely flawless.
We don't pretend, we don't like showcasing.
Norway handles its oil wealth very carefully - in addition to a small percentage, most of the money from this sector is invested in a special fund intended for future generations.
When all the others in the years leading up to the global financial crash threw away money they didn’t have, the Norwegians had ropes tightened on their citizens.
“As long as we can ski in the winter and go out on excursions in the summer, we’re happy,” says Anna.
"And eat raccoons," he adds with carefree laughter.
I'm standing in the snow on the front for something to eat - I've had enough of a racket.
Such a lotion burger is certainly something else and is beautifully juicy.
But in the evening, the smelly fish is here again.
The hotel where I live is one of the many places where raccoons are served for dinner and where guests choose the best, or rather for the smell of the most demanding fish.
They have a connection to a live TV broadcast, in which the moderator with the butterfly is surrounded by a plate with a shelf.
It's like a Eurovision Song Contest.
"What score do you have for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thore-Juergene?"
"Here's our score, Havard."
There's applause and laughter.
From the chair falls a man, perhaps capable of an aquavit.
Or maybe evaporation from all those fish.
Enrique Pena Nieto from Mexico has a hard start
As upcoming Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take office, Will Grant of the BBC looks to the challenges he faces, and to the mixed expectations of his fellow citizens.
Transportation in Mexico City is particularly bad at the moment.
In the city, which is stuck even in the best of times, steel barriers have been erected closing several key routes to the capital and causing chaos on the roads.
However, the aim was not to prevent those arriving to get to work, but to prevent protesters from accessing parliament.
On Saturday, the new President of Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the presidential sari and take over the leadership of the nation.
He's facing a challenging task.
While Mexico was doing well economically at the time of the resignation of Felipe Calderon, the country is in the grip of a drug war that has already claimed 60,000 lives in six years.
“My government has a great commitment to the Mexican people in reducing violence,” President Pena Nieto told U.S. President Barack Obama in the Oval Office earlier this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this goal.
Before shaking hands with the US president, President Pena Nieta gained political experience as governor of his home state of Mexico.
The views of the new leader are also different in his old homeland, the people and the vast state surrounding the capital.
A direct man.
For example, in the rural town of Valle del Bravo they remember him in a good way.
Citizens attribute to it the development of tourism in the resort and the construction of infrastructure.
You can now reach the city by one of the new highways that Pena Nieto had to build. These highways are a huge improvement over the hollow and rugged highways that used to be here.
The plates with his name also hang on the wall of a modern sports center and an impressive interactive museum with a theme of climate change.
“We expect it to bring real and lasting change,” says friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a state legislature on the side of President Pen Nieta, the Party of the Institutionalized Revolution (PRI).
In particular, we hope for the interesting and real changes in the field of security and the economy that our country so desperately needs.
After 81 uninterrupted years in power, the PRI party was pushed out by Vicente Fox.
Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, there is much to be expected inside the party of Enriqua Pena Nieta.
And it rejects the expression of the opposition characterizing the new president as a man without material content.
He is a very direct man, very interested in the excellent vision of the country.
He's a great statesman, and above all, he's a man who can listen.
But on the other side of the state, this is not the impression that many people have of its former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the tiled streets of Valle del Bravo cannot be more apparent.
Stuck under the highway junctions in many, it resembles the suburbs of the capital of Mexico itself.
And the problems in the self-governing community are also persistent and urban.
Earlier this year, the army was called to help cope with drug gangs operating in the neighborhoods, particularly inflammatory violence against women.
In the last two years alone, dozens of murdered women have been dumped in vacant places next to a huge garbage dump.
At the time when Pena Nieto was governor, more than 1,000 women were murdered in Mexico, much more than in the notoriously violent city of Ciudad Juarez – a place that is synonymous with the murder of innocent women.
At best, Pena Nieta’s critics say that he failed in his office to adequately address the issue of women’s murders.
And in the worst case, his leadership accuses him of closing his eyes.
In a concrete house typical of a crumbling neighborhood, Irinea Buendia shows me photos of her deceased daughter Mariana Luna and suppresses her crying.
According to the official version, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
Her family, however, believe that she was murdered by her partner.
“When I arrived at her house, it looked like someone had washed her body,” recalls Mrs. Buendia.
There were marks on it after the blows, and the postmortem stiffness had already begun.
As her mother tells the story, Mariana looks down from the picture on the wall, right next to the cross, on which is a single word: "Justice".
However, this, as the family says, is exactly what was given to them.
The state authorities treated me as if I were an old man, a troublemaker and a princess.
They want you to just accept what they say and keep quiet.
“But that can’t be right when there have been so many mistakes and omissions,” he says.
The sherpa, which President Pena Nieto will receive on Saturday, is accompanied by a great deal of responsibility.
In the past six years, tens of thousands of families in Mexico have been hit by violent crime, and the new president has promised that during his tenure in office, he will be his priority.
"I hope he will be the same president as he was the governor," said PRI Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
However, this is exactly what the families of victims in Ciudad Neza fear the most.
Bradley Manning has not complained of ill-treatment, says military prosecutor
A military prosecutor is trying to refute Bradley Manning's claims regarding the gross treatment in custody.
The hearing focuses on Manning's stay in a military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
The defense wants the case to be dismissed on the basis of the gross treatment of Manning in prison.
The military is accused of stealing thousands of secret documents.
The U.S. military prosecutor is trying to prove that soldier Bradley Manning, who is accused of leaking the largest secret material in U.S. history, has missed many opportunities to complain about the rude treatment he allegedly suffered in military custody.
Military prosecutor May. Ashden Fein at a cross-examination of Manning's soldier at a preliminary hearing in Ft. Maede, Maryland, claimed that records of weekly visits Manning had with the unit's officers did not leave any officers behind in a nine-month prison in Quantico, Virginia.
The cross-examination, which took place during a hearing on a motion by the defence to reject the case against Manning on the grounds of gross treatment at the time of the incarceration, which is a self-sufficient punishment, took place the day after Manning testified of the incarceration.
A military intelligence analyst, who was arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of secret documents while serving in Iraq.
The material was then posted online on WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning was the source of her information.
At Friday's hearing, military prosecutor Fein, along with Manning, passed forms that officers filled out after meeting with Manning at a prison in Quantic, where he was held in a high-security regime from July 2010 to April 2011.
Officers asked Manning questions and recorded his responses to them.
When asked by Fein on Friday about these forms, Manning admitted that he valued the treatment by his guards as "excellent" and the overall treatment at the facility as "very professional".
The forms do not show any complaints of ill-treatment, even though Manning’s officers directly asked how he was treated, Fein said.
Manning replied that he had expressed concerns about the various problems orally, and that the officers who visited him spoke to him about these concerns and suggested that they would be addressed, but the problems were not recorded.
"They had "no problems" (after discussing their concerns), and that didn't necessarily mean I didn't mention them," Manning said.
Judge Colonel Denise Lind also asked Manning why he had not complained about his treatment of his person in January 2011 at a meeting with the Commission assessing suicidal thoughts, which he had expressed several months earlier in the form.
Manning replied that during this meeting his intention was to achieve a reduction in the "prevention of injury" regime.
The military stated that it used this restrictive regime (one degree under surveillance due to suicide) for its protection and the safety of others.
"I wanted the guards in custody to know that I was okay and that I wanted to cancel this injury prevention regime... so that I could enjoy the improved quality of life as I saw it here," Manning said.
Manning testified on Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was held almost two months before being transported to a detention facility at a Marine base in Quantic, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said he was considering suicide in Kuwait, and once there he fainted because of the heat.
He said that the fact that he was not allowed to know what was going to happen to him and what was going on in the surrounding world was very overwhelming.
"My world has only smelt to the Arifjan base, to the cage," Manning said on Thursday.
I thought I'd die in that cage.
Manning said he spent most of the days (at least 21 hours, but often more than 23 hours) in a small cell without any company.
Manning said that he was allowed only one mattress, a blanket, hoods, some clothes and glasses.
He said he was trying to walk because sleeping or just lying down was against the rules during the day.
Manning said he always slept with light from the outside of the cell in his eyes.
He said that if the guards could not see his face when he turned to the other side at night, they woke him up and had to turn back.
Manning's lawyer filed a formal complaint about the treatment of a soldier by Manning in January 2011.
Manning was transferred to a military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011.
On Friday, Judge Manning also asked about the charges he made in Thursday's statement regarding the fact that after being forced to sleep one night in his cell in Quantic nude, he was also forced to stand naked in front of guards and other co-detainees at the morning count.
Manning stated that he was not allowed to cover himself with his blanket during the count.
In a Friday interrogation, Judge Manning said he had decided on the orders of his guards that he had a blanket that he could hide, but admitted that no one had given him an order to put it down.
On Thursday, Manning said he was forced to sleep naked last night because he tried to show the officer that he was not dangerous.
Manning said he told the officer that he could use a belt from his underwear or his hoodie to hurt himself, but he didn't.
Manning testified that his underwear, eyeglasses and glasses had been removed from his cell that night.
His lawyer hopes that the judge will take into account his experience during his imprisonment and that in the event of his testimony before a military court, the start of which is expected at the beginning of next year, he will significantly reduce his sentence.
The defense said it plans Manning to plead guilty to lower-crime charges and to fight other charges because they are too extreme.
The start of the hearing is scheduled for this week, the military prosecutor is expected to defend the conditions of detention as justified.
The Pentagon stated that Manning had been held in compliance with the rules regarding all detainees held in custody with maximum caution.
The charges against Manning include aiding the enemy, illegally causing the publication of intelligence documents on the Internet, the transfer of information relating to national security, and theft of public property or records.
If he is charged at all points, he can be sentenced to life.
The Crisis of Mexican-American Identity
He says many people have been forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities there.
Mexicans tend to blame those who have left; they remind them of difficult times, he says.
Navarrette says Mexican Americans are laced between two worlds.
On my last trip to the capital of Mexico, I barely penetrated the crowd and arrived at the space for the immigrant agenda, where I encountered a problem.
The arrowheads point to one of two fronts: one for the Mexicanos and the other for the Extranjeros.
I stood there for a few seconds and didn’t know where to go.
I grew up in California, and I've been called "Mexican" my whole life.
It's an ethnic abbreviation, the same as when my friends in Boston call themselves "Iry" and my friends in New York call themselves "Italy."
So I later ended up being labeled a "Mexican American."
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's home, there was no need to use abbreviations.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish well enough to be able to handle both sides of the conversation in this language.
But I don’t have a native speaker’s vocabulary and I can’t get rid of the American accent.
So I pulled out my American passport and stood in front of the "Extranjeros".
I was thinking about the moment when this week newly elected Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited President Obama’s White House.
They had on the agenda the usual issues that are discussed when the leaders of these two countries meet: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why Mexicans are as likely to stay in Mexico as traveling to the United States.
It wants to unite with the United States and Canada and create a trade bloc similar to the European Union in North America.
And Pena Nieto vowed to continue the Mexican war against the drug cartels, even though he did not provide any details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of hostile feelings.
Most Americans probably never thought of the fact that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders under the threat of arms to rewrite half of Mexican territory to the United States.
But for Mexicans who think in the span of centuries, not minutes, remarks are ubiquitous.
So a minute after the U.S. representative says something a little bit critical about Mexico, you'll hear in the Mexican press and among the elite complaints about how Americans interfere with their neighbor's sovereignty.
And the children of Montezuma will step on the warpath.
And yet, the real challenge for Mexico is the relationship with more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
Do you want to talk about hostile feelings?
There's a lot of them.
In Mexico, there are winners and losers, people who the country offers opportunities, and others who don’t.
The only reason that so many people with Mexican roots live in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that at some point in our family tree there was a person, perhaps a parent or grandfather, who was denied the opportunity to move to Mexico.
And more often than it seems, this person corresponded to the profile - dark skin, poor education, origin from a poor village, etc.
We are their descendants, and we are loyal to them.
Not to Mexico.
And even though we now live the American dream, we go to good schools and we have a good job, we can never forget the fact that we live the American dream, not the Mexican one.
Our identity may sometimes be unclear, but our loyalty is not.
It's against the United States.
And besides, we are aware that many of the elite Mexicans who belong to the ruling class do not like us.
This feeling is mutual.
They see us as a reminder of humiliating defeats, and they see us as a subordinate race that is not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our attachment to Mexico will never be strong enough.
In their opinion, our existence is only about failure.
If our families didn't move to Mexico, they'd never leave her.
And we would now find ourselves not trapped behind a silk curtain, with good life in the United States, but still with lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and legally arrived in the United States as a child, reminds me that there is tension between Mexicans and Mexican Americans, because Mexicans understand who they are, and Mexican Americans don’t like it.
Although she is a citizen of the United States, she sees herself as part of two countries.
And at the same time, many of the Mexican Americans I know don't feel like part of one.
We love listening to Mexican bands, Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You get the best of both countries, but you don’t have roots in either one.
In Mexico, they look at us as Americans.
And in the United States, we are considered Mexicans.
And to make relationships even more complicated, some Mexican leaders want to reconnect with the diaspora, and some of the intelligence I learned on my trip.
They want Mexican Americans to work for Mexico as “temporary ambassadors” and represent Mexican interests in the United States.
We should tell our American compatriots how great it is to visit this country, and press on the political leaders to strengthen relations with Mexico.
No, no, no.
Well, that's not gonna happen.
There's too many hostile feelings.
And thanks to income inequality and widespread corruption and drug violence, many of us are not sure that this is a great country.
I feel like it's up to you, amigos.
That's fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not willing to forgive the United States for the way they dealt with Mexico a century and a half ago, they must accept the fact that some Mexican Americans still feel disapproval of the way they have been dealt with in a close manner with their family members.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're more "Mexicans" than I thought.
Old Battles, New Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could still be a precarious basis for peace.
Can there ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another round of bloodshed suggests that every such event is in vain.
Among the usual useless speculations about who started it, many buildings were turned into rubble, killed more than 140 Palestinians, mostly civilians, and six Israelis. And for the first time hit rockets from Gaza near the city of Jerez. Tel Aviv, Israel's capital,
But even though it seems that the Israelis and the Palestinians have been trapped in their long-standing conflict, the Middle East is changing all around them.
The Arab Spring has changed the old order and Palestinians and Israelis, whether they like it or not, are caught in the chaos that has arisen in the region.
Maybe it'll make their fight even more bloody than ever.
However, there are reasons to think that it can disrupt their deadly patty situation.
A war that is neither won nor lost.
At first glance, there seems to be not many reasons for optimism at the moment.
Even if the ceasefire, which was closed on November 21, was sustained, the fighting from this week strengthened the cranes on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamic movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will claim to have forced the Israelis to retreat even though Gaza suffered defeat.
Despite the killing of several Hamas leaders and the closure of 1.7 million Gazans in one of the most pitiful and populous corners of the planet, Israel has failed to destroy Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas is gaining influence on the West Bank, another piece of Palestine, which is currently run by its entrenched rivals from Fatah, a more moderate Palestinian faction.
In addition, the leaders of Hamas can very well judge that the time is on their side.
The Islamists throughout the Arab world gained greater influence, so Hamas gained powerful and rich friends.
Turkey, once the closest Muslim ally of Israel, has joined the side of Hamas, as well as Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic countries in the Gulf.
The blatant people of Hamas say that the Islamic crescent is swarming around Israel, north of Lebanon, where Hezbollah’s party/military is ruled, through Syria, where rebels, who are increasingly cloning to Islamism, can bring down Bashar al-Assad to the Hajj, to the Jordan.
And above all, on the southern wing of Israel, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under the leadership of President Muhammad Mursi in Egypt, far more populous and key Arab countries, changed the balance in the region.
Husni Mubarak, a secular despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had no time for Hamas.
On the contrary, the Brotherhood is a cousin of Hamas and its leaders are more influenced by public opinion.
In future diplomacy, Hamas may appear as a player who cannot be ruled out by either Israel or America.
On the contrary, Israel’s hardline supporters will come to the opposite conclusion.
In military terminology, Hamas was put back in a box.
The Israeli anti-missile system of the Iron Dome proved its worth and many Hamas missiles were destroyed.
Israelis can sleep better - for a while.
In diplomatic terminology, America is as relentless as ever, and many European countries have also blamed Hamas for launching the last round of violence.
And most importantly, Israel prospered, especially under the leadership of Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, who mostly ignored the peace process.
Although rockets from Gaza have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has been relatively calm from suicide bombers, in part thanks to the wall that intersects the West Bank, the main part of what may one day be a Palestinian state, and protects the predominance of the Palestinians and the Jewish settlements.
Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud party joined an even more radical group led by Avigdor Lieberman at the start of the January 22 campaign, is in a good position.
Why spoil the pro-Palestinians by giving them their own state?
If they really ruled on the West Bank, wouldn’t they fire missiles, as their countrymen in Gaza did?
It'll be better if we keep them behind the wall and hit them when they're shoving their heads out.
Perhaps supporters of the hard line will win, but the Arab Spring can change their calculations.
Although Islamists who gain power in Egypt and other countries do not love Israel very much, their main priority will be to deal with domestic problems.
Israel’s defense spending is higher than the spending of all four of its Arab neighbors combined.
The start of a new war with the local superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments to heal their economies.
The fact that President Mursi has been working with President Barack Obama to achieve a ceasefire is a good sign and may be the beginning of something new.
The Israelis should also look at the situation from a long-term perspective.
At a time when the rest of the Arab world is becoming more democratic, denial of Palestinians’ right to self-determination of a gunpowder court that must one day explode in Israeli-occupied areas — just like a bus that exploded in Tel Aviv last week.
Right now, the repression is weakening democracy in the Jewish state, and the demographics are exacerbating this situation as the Arab population grows.
The bloody outbursts of Gaza every few years in order to repress Hamas will increasingly collect a diplomatic tax.
Both sides need incentives from the outside.
The answer is what reasonable people on both sides are saying, most of the outside world, and these newspapers: two states where Israel will surrender territory for security reasons.
In the short term, there is little hope that the ceasefire will give pressures from outside at least a little more influence on the enforcement of this matter.
Egypt, which, along with Turkey and Qatar, must push for a ceasefire on arms supplies to Gaza, has a better position than ever to convince Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders with the exchange of parts of the country and shared Jerusalem.
Arabs from the outside must also push for a reconciliation between Hamas and Fatah.
This would have done more than just an immediate offer of virtual state sovereignty at the United Nations to create a Palestinian state.
President Obama also has a role to play in getting Israel to the negotiating table.
In his first term, he neglected to present his own peace plan.
Now, back in the White House, he seems to be equally obnoxious in his entry into the process.
That's sadly short-sighted.
America has a vital interest in a stable Middle East.
This means a peace settlement between Israel and the Palestinians.
In Australia, the laws on nasty cigarette packaging came into force.
The unsightly green boxes, which are the same for all tobacco brands, are depicted warnings for smokers and sick parts of the body.
Australian laws on the ugly packaging of tobacco and cigarettes, the first of their kind in the world, came into force, and the logos and colours of the brands replaced with general olive green boxes with ugly images of sick body parts and depictions of birth defects of children and unborn babies.
In addition to various health warnings and pictures, the only difference between boxes of brand names that are printed in the same small font is mandatory from Saturday.
This is the most stringent regime in the world regarding tobacco packaging.
The Australian federal government claims that the goal is to discourage young people from smoking by disposing of this bad habit.
It relies on studies that show that if people don’t start smoking by the age of 26, there’s a 99% chance they’ll never start smoking.
"Even in very young children, you can see that he understands the message that tobacco companies are trying to sell to them together with their product," says Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that, for example, showed that children associate a crown in a logo with the idea of being a premise to it.
While Australia has one of the lowest numbers of smokers in the world and the changes will have only a small impact on the profits of multinational corporations, other countries are considering introducing similar measures.
The tobacco industry lobbied hard against the introduction of these laws.
Tobacco companies have argued that this law will increase black market trade, which will lead to cheaper and more affordable cigarettes.
“This legislation will have serious unintended consequences,” said Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Counterfeiters from China and Indonesia will bring a lot more of these products, which will be sold on the Australian streets.
Others claim that the laws have increased their trades.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family-owned company, said the demand for silicone cigarette wraps to cover up nasty boxes was two months ago, when British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, and Philip Morris of the United Kingdom of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and the United Kingdom of Great Britain of Great Britain of Great Britain of Great Britain of Great Britain of Great Britain of Great Britain of Great Britain of Great Britain.
Ha said that Zico has sold nearly 6,000 units to wholesalers and expects new stocks.
It's a good deal for us.
As a possible drawback, the experts state the popularity of social media in the demographic group that the plan focuses on.
Following a number of Australian laws banning television advertising, sponsoring sporting events, and demanding that the majority of retailers hide cigarettes from a direct eye, tobacco marketing has moved online.
Australia has banned online advertising carried out by local companies and websites, but it cannot restrict foreign websites.
“If you’re a marketing worker in the tobacco industry and you only have this small space left to promote your products, online space is an unbeatable place for you to be,” says Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Ms. Freeman noted an increase in brand ratings on social networks such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, conducted by the “average Honda.”
We have to ask, is this just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigarettes and gave himself the job and created this video, or is there a marketing company involved in it?
British American Tobacco Australia says the industry has focused on how it imposes new regulations rather than marketing.
The industry has gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic for violating new regulations – countries within the World Trade Organization declare that trade is unfairly restricted, despite the fact that none of the countries with Australia is significantly insignificant.
The SOO decision is expected to be adopted in mid-2013.
Minister Plibersek says the government has been conducting talks with other governments that are considering similar legislation on packaging.
Canada was the first country to introduce mandatory warning photographs in 2001.
Now they have expanded to more than 40 countries including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
The UK, New Zealand, the South African Republic and India are considering stricter laws.
A lot of smokers in Australia resist.
The pictures have no influence on me.
I'm just ignoring them.
“Just pull out a cigarette and push the box back,” says Victor El Hage when buying a box with a photo of the tumor in his mouth.
Honestly, there's only one reason I quit smoking, and that's my little daughter.
James Yu, who owns King of the Pack traffic in the centre of Sydney, claims that it’s harder for him to get into the shelves thanks to the unified boxes.
"It took me one hour to load, now it takes me four hours," Yu said.
"The government should just ban them completely, and then we would say, 'OK, that's the end, let's close the barn,'" he said.
In a world of constant connection, it’s not so bad to be bored
The last Thanksgiving day I unexpectedly spent five hours at the airport when our plane was in mechanical trouble and we had to wait for the arrival of another plane.
So we had a lot of time to think about boredom.
I won't lie to you.
Waiting half a day at the airport for the next flight is pretty annoying, despite the distractions of books, magazines and iPhones (not to mention duty-free shops).
But some scientists and experts on child development are increasingly coming up with praiseworthy boredom.
They say it’s good for us (and our children) to get bored sometimes.
This forces the brain to go in interesting directions, which can promote creativity.
And since most of us are constantly connected to some screen these days, we don’t have a chance to enjoy.
Should we be bored to support it?
Oh, yeah.
Oh, no.
But I'll get back to that.
First, like many people, I assumed that boredom is a fairly new phenomenon that occurred with the advent of more free time.
But as Peter Toohey, a professor of Greek and Roman history at the Canadian University of Calgary, says, he is the author of Boredom: A Lively History (Yale University Press, 2011).
"In fact, boredom has a long history," he said.
On the walls of Pompeii was found a Latin inscription about boredom, dating from the first century C.E.
And then there’s the question of how we define boredom.
The difficulty is that it has been defined and discussed in many different ways, said John D. Eastwood, a professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After looking at the research literature and presenting the idea to a target group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as an experience “I wanted to do something that would satisfy me, but I wasn’t able to do it.”
boredom differs from apathy in that a person is not involved in anything, but would like to be.
He says that in apathy there is no need to do something.
He says that the core of boredom is “the disruption of the attention process associated with bad mood and a feeling of slowly running out of time.”
Toughness can be a lot like depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that while they may have a relationship with each other, boring people tend to see the problem as the environment or the world, while people who are depressed see the problem in themselves.
Sometimes we think we’re bored when we’re just having trouble concentrating.
In their study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", which was published in September in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues pointed to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a tape on which the person read an article from the journal.
Some bands heard a loud and unrelated television program in the next room, others heard it so quietly that they barely noticed it, while the third band did not hear it at all.
Those who listened to the television program quietly reported more boredom than the other two groups - they had trouble concentrating, but were not sure why and attributed these troubles to boredom.
When trying to focus on a difficult or compelling task, distractions can lead to boredom, said Mark J. Fenske, a neuroscience professor at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when you do something boring, "such as looking for bad parts on a factory line, distracting music can help you not get bored."
In fact, he said, now we know that twisting and squealing, which is often seen as a sign of boredom, can actually help fight boredom and keep people more physically alert.
“The research shows that children who are allowed to squirm learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to sit still,” said Professor Fenske.
We've all been bored at times - the delay of my flight, the humming speaker, especially the boring movie.
But some individuals have a better chance of getting bored than others.
To help measure boredom, scientists in the 1980s developed a "Boredom Proneness Scale" (Boredom Proneness Scale).
The degree includes questions such as: "Many things I have to do are repeated and are monotonous," and "I have so many interests that I don't have time to do them all."
Using these scales, the researchers found that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, especially when it comes to the need for more and different external stimuli.
However, teenagers are generally inactive.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day.
He found that 32 percent of teenagers reported being bored in school and doing homework, while 23 percent said they were bored when they were not in school.
On the other hand, 3% of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson said he did not know whether the percentage expression of boredom would be now, 21 years later, higher or lower.
But he said he knows that "teening is the ultimate time for boredom", which is largely due to the fact that children and young people are not given much control over what they want to do.
So back to my original question: "Is boredom good for you?".
As research shows, sometimes not, because in its extreme form, it can lead people to take absurd physical risks, play gambling, or abuse addictive substances as a way to mitigate it.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers have been discussing the connection between boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying the problem for more than two decades.
“Nudity is the brain’s way of telling you that you should do something else,” said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at NYU.
But the brain doesn’t always know the most appropriate thing to do.
If you get bored and use this energy to play guitar and cook, it will make you happy.
However, if you watch TV, it will only make you happy for a while, not for a long time.
So if your child gets bored and you give him an iPad, he won’t get bored anymore, but he won’t learn how to have fun or drive alone, Professor Fenske said.
And "this separate management is being transferred from one situation to another," said the professor.
Your child will not only learn how to entertain himself, but will gain greater self-control in other areas.
I don't think we really want to celebrate boredom.
But we shouldn’t be too critical of her.
Rather, our goal should be to feel comfortable when we are out of reach of the constant clogging of activity and technology.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"We accuse her of needing to be bored even more, but boredom is a painful, restless desire to be associated with something meaningful," he said.
What people are actually looking for, he said, is a way to relax and enjoy your free time.
"In an environment where we're constantly overstimulated," he said, "it's hard to find ways to have fun when the noise goes off."
There's No Handbook on the New Marijuana Act in Colorado
Nineteen-year-old Anthony Orozco, a college student and soccer player from southeastern Colorado, faces criminal charges for something that will soon be legal across the state — for holding a few grams of marijuana and the pipe he used to smoke it.
Mr. Orozco said that one September day he was traveling with several friends in Lamar, on the plains near the border with Kansas when he was stopped.
After a police officer found marijuana in his car, Mr. Orozco was given a summons for possession of drugs and equipment for drug use – minor offenses that cost him $100 per fine – and a court date was set for him.
"They treated us like criminals," said Mr. Orozco.
But he's a criminal?
In the weeks after Colorado’s vote to legalize small amounts of recreational marijuana, the response of hundreds of smaller drug cases depends on the location rather than the law.
Hundreds of cases of marijuana possession violations have already been abolished here and in the state of Washington, which has approved similar measures.
The police department has stopped accusing adults aged 21 and older of holding a small amount that will be legally allowed after the law comes into force in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors in more conservative Colorado districts have said they will continue with existing marijuana-related cases, and are still accusing people of holding them.
At the same time, several cities from the suburbs of Denver toward the western mountains are voting to prevent the opening of new, state-licensed marijuana stores in their communities.
"This is going so fast that I don't know what's going to happen next," said Daniel J. Oates, chief of police in Aurora, east of Denver.
Heads down and regulators in the state of Washington.
And they are looking for instructions on how to set up a system of licenses for cultivation, production, distribution and sale - all by December 1, 2013.
They say that Colorado, whether good or bad, is ahead of most states in regulating marijuana, first for medical use and now for recreational use.
“Colorado has a more regulated market, so it’s going to be a good guide,” said Brian E. Smith, a spokesman for the Washington State Alcohol Licensing Board.
But as Mr. Smith admitted, no place or system can do more than suggest what might work.
"There is no real precedent that we could follow," he said.
The Washington Act, so-called I-502, takes effect on December 6, which also leaves an annual vacuum during which there will not yet be a state licensing system, but legal holdings do.
And there are tricky mechanical issues that need to be solved during this time, such as how to balance the state’s directive on “adequate access” to licensed marijuana with its ban on cannabis trade up to 330 meters from schools, parks, playgrounds or children’s playgrounds.
“There will be no more difficult placement of licensed cannabis trade than in urban areas, especially in the metropolitan area of Seattle,” said Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the Center for Legal Cannabis, a recently-founded research group.
On November 21, Aurora Chief of Police Oates sent an e-mail to his officers informing them that the city prosecutor would no longer prosecute the offences of holding a small amount of marijuana for every citizen over the age of 21, and that the police "will be immediately indicted" for the charges.
Chief Oates said police would enforce city laws regulating medical marijuana growers and would continue to prosecute drug dealers and dealers.
In Weld County, North Colorado, District Attorney Ken Buck presents a stricter view.
After the vote, he said his office would continue to pursue cases of marijuana possession, mostly as a way to push users to seek treatment.
Currently, 119 people are facing charges of holding 56 grams or less of marijuana, although many of them are facing further charges.
“Our office is under an obligation to prosecute criminal offences that were criminal offences at the time of their occurrence,” Buck said in a statement.
The reaction was complicated even in places such as Mesa Rural District, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative.
The police in Grand Junction, the county's largest city, no longer accuse adults of holding a small number.
The district attorney, Pete Hautzinger, supports this decision, but has also decided not to reject all ongoing detention cases.
"I don't think I'm wasting my time by continuing to enforce the law until it changes," he said.
Although 55 percent of Colorado voters supported the measure, bringing recreational marijuana into the hands of the government and the legal system will never be easy.
And contradictory reactions across the state have revealed, in view of this great state green experiment, a deep divergence among local officials.
For district prosecutors, this is a “cultural barrier,” said Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver who represents the marijuana holding defendant, and a local spokesperson for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.
"They've wasted so much of their lives chasing people that they still can't really accept that it's legal," he said.
As the first states to rely on a small amount of marijuana as alcohol, Colorado and Washington are on track to become national drug legalization testing cases.
Advocates and state authorities are planning new borders for legalized sales while also anxiously awaiting instructions from the federal government, which is still planning to consider selling and growing marijuana as federal crimes.
Advocates for the legalization of marijuana hope that the Ministry of Justice will cheat.
Despite several arrests of medical marijuana vendors and patients taking it, which attracted attention, the federal government has mostly left medical marijuana stores in Colorado, Washington, and 16 other states in operation.
While anti-drug agents are likely not to knock on the door to catch a small bag of drugs, it is likely that they will deny the state-regulated recreational marijuana trades allowed by new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, the president's former pro-government policy adviser.
Several cities in Colorado are not waiting for federal authorities to proceed.
Even before the election day, some local governments have approved a moratorium on any new trade in marijuana, although it will take about a year before any trade can open.
The city of Montrose in the west of the state last week proposed a six-month ban and is likely to come into effect next week.
“We don’t want to be in a situation where we give someone a license and then we’re going to have a big federal issue,” said Bob Nicholson, a city council member.
Our community voted against this addendum.
We are looking at what the community voted for, as opposed to what the state voted for.
There's a lot of questions.
Petronella Wyatt: "I was forced to leave Oxford because I'm a conservative."
Today’s students are not the only ones being attacked for their opinions.
I don't remember ever dreaming of studying at the University of Oxford.
Both my father and my older brother studied at the university, which I thought was the world’s largest headquarters of knowledge, a modern winding Greek symposium motivating the two pillars of civilization, free thought and tolerance.
And in the late 1980s, two weeks after I graduated from Worcester College, where I wanted to study history, I packed my suitcases and returned to the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and cried.
My friends have been confused.
The Evening Standard newspaper claimed that I gave up because I had objections to loving students in the next room.
Writer A. N. Wilson disheartenedly declared that I had left because I was forced to drink from broken cups.
The truth was less comical.
I ran away.
Yes, I ran away because I was the subject of systematic harassment and intimidation.
Not because of my somewhat bizarre name or the fact that I came from a private school.
I was persecuted for one reason, and in this cradle of supposed enlightenment it was both bigoted and barbaric: my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a high-ranking advisor to Margaret Thatcher and I was a Conservative Party supporter.
You may be wondering why I'm pulling it out right now.
Just because the latest reports suggest that the new generation of students right from the center suffers a similar persecution.
The institutionalized and growing hatred of conservative students at Oxford is so great that last week a group of these students sought the same protection of equal rights as gays, people with disabilities, and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Corpus Christi College’s Younger Persons’ Association (JCR) claim that because of their political views, they are “often actively isolated, exposed to personal attacks, and shown that they are not welcome.”
They call for the creation of a position in the University Committee on Equal Opportunities, which would ensure that their views can be freely communicated.
The recent BBC Two documentary Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right (The Fairytale Land: Young, Intelligent and Right) about the student political event, which the Conservatives portrayed as bizarre and neo-Nazis, did not help their situation.
The show featured graduate Joe Cooke, a former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA), who drove Rolls-Royce, was dressed in a silver suit and had a stick with a silver head.
At other colleges, conservative students say they are being treated as “victim lambs” because of the introduction of higher education.
Twenty-year-old Luke Black, vice president of the Nottingham University Conservative Association, told Sunday newspapers that "leftist influence on universities is growing.
“People think we’re like Bullingdon Club without meeting us at all.”
Twenty-one-year-old student of history at Corpus Christi Samuel Roberts, who stands behind the movement for greater protection, says such a climate is "unpleasant", while nineteen-year-old OUCA President-elect Stephanie Cherill says that in the approach of JCR members from the right to the center.
"This poses a threat to the atmosphere of intellectual discussion, as well as to the good living conditions of members," he says.
During my first few weeks in Oxford, I was a one-member minority.
I joined in September 1986, 18 years old and embarrassingly shy.
Hatred for the Conservative Party was the most deplorable.
A year earlier, the university voted to refuse the honorary degree of former student Margaret Thatcher due to cuts in funding for higher education.
Even the Stalinists would tremble with fear from the atmosphere.
During the first few days of the introductory week, when new students interact with each other and with the professors, I got to taste the melon that was supposed to come.
I have found that not only do the professors silently approve of the pupils’ popping, but they also gladly participate in it.
The policy of mining strikes, privatization and government resistance to sanctions against apartheid in the South African Republic has been brought into the wood-coated audience.
My first lecture was about translating the French text from the 18th century into English, and I was not prepared for what followed.
"Mrs. Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph."
It was pretty hard on me.
Professor Pitt, a little man with a face like a cake cake, was very galley.
"Do the Thatchers refuse to learn French, or are they just stupid?" he asked.
The other students were stunned.
I had tears in my eyes.
“I suggest that you take some basic French lessons in your spare time, if you’re not too busy with social affairs,” Professor Pitt said.
Damn, I went back to my room.
At dinner at school, I was sitting alone when I felt a slight slap on my shoulder.
He was a second year student named James, who introduced himself as a member of OUCA.
"I know who you are," he said politely.
I'm afraid it's true.
Anyone who is suspected of conservatism is a target.
It's bad enough for me, but they know your father's close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's gonna be even worse for you.
Most of the conservatives pretend to be Labourists.
Later in the local pub, I tried to pretend cowardly.
I kept insisting that I disagree with everything Thatcher said.
This trick turned out to be unsuccessful.
A first-year student in philosophy, politics, and economics, who (what an irony) went to Eton, said, "You're the daughter of a fascist pig."
You're infected.
The other students took note of him.
I was twisted, dirty.
"How do conservatives love each other?" one asked.
They beat each other, don't they?
I felt the way homosexuals must have felt before the liberal legislature of the 1960s.
Could I ever live a normal life in Oxford?
Would I be forced to meet with like-minded people only after dark?
Do I have to become a laborer and suppress my natural inclinations?
Three years have evolved before me as a purge of ignorance and isolation.
The only openly conservative professor was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history who resided in my faculty.
He was hated not only for being conservative, but also for being Margaret Thatcher’s foreign policy adviser and one of the speakers.
He almost wasn't there.
He hated this place for its provence and pettyness and for its inclination to a Marxist-determinist view of history.
In 1997, he took up the position of professor at the University of Bilkent in Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he said.
I began to travel from Oxford to my parents’ home in London, looking for shelter from my uninterested metropolitan friends and family.
I told my father I hated Oxford and why.
He couldn't believe it.
During his studies at Oxford in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said patheticly.
They wouldn't do that, not in the city's dream mood.
Even my communist friends have always had perfect ways.
His damp eyes shuddered.
Try it again.
I'm sure it's a joke.
I'd break my heart if you left.
Tired of frequent trips to London, my emotional resilience deteriorated.
My friend, also a supporter of the Conservative Party, was under pressure and gave up his beliefs.
The following week, during the course of the lecture, when another professor of history in complete seriousness declared that I was the "enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.
Even though I was getting red in the cold, I admitted that “parents brainwashed me” and called them “old fools.”
The relief was only short-term.
The nail in the coffin of my Oxford career got stuck by my father.
At that time, he wrote two columns in Murdoch's newspaper every week.
My door was locked.
I stepped inside, and after five minutes my persecutors gave it up.
When they left, I packed my suitcase and caught the first train to London.
I never came back.
You can call me a dead weak man.
But no 18-year-old girl or boy should be subjected to such intimidation and poisoning in an educational institution.
What is even more tragic, however, is that it was Oxford, from which not only came the 14 Conservative premiers, but which is also hiding behind the undeserved reputation of a place with equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentine prefers elegance rather than glory."
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino: Master of Fashion", which was launched this week in London, ABC spoke to Nata Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisz and other famous customers of the Italian designer.
Somerset House, the former residence of Isabella I of England, is the only place in the British capital to host the exhibition of Valentin Garavani.
The designer confirmed this at the launch of the festive retrospective "Valentino: master of fashion creation", which represents more than 130 top fashion models created by his studio over the last 50 years.
"I love this castle," he says with his unmistakable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a story in which "il signore" Garavani is the only protagonist, but could not have been written without his esteemed clients.
Valentino has always felt enchanted by the rare and distant world of aristocracy.
The first exhibition hall, which lasts until March 3, is full of private correspondence and photographs with signatures of the most important nobles, from Princess Salimya Aga Chan to the Greek Princess Maria-Chantal and Margaret of England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino exhibits these personal memories as trophies of his social rise: from the simple crater from the town of Voghera in northern Italy to the idol of the international "bohemian creamers".
To love the royal family is not a bad thing.
“They at least don’t spit cigarettes into a great carpet, like some wonderful pop-music celebrities do,” says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisz.
In the 1960s and 1970s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is an impressive host and guests enjoy it abundantly and with elegance.
"We were all very pleased when we were invited to his cottage in Gstaad," explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen and a close friend of forgotten beauties like Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
“Valentino always preferred elegance rather than glory.
And yet he is a star.”
Valeria Mazzov<0xC3><0xA1> presents Valentina
The charism of the designer is not forgotten by the Argentine model Valeria Mazzo.
“It’s been many years since we went to him for dinner after a show in Piazza di Spagna in Rome.
There were twenty of us, and between us, Sharon Stone and John Kennedy were younger.
In every detail of his apartment, his decoration, his food, his music, he reflected in everything and he felt his spirit.
All the invitations were made to feel important and loved," recalls the top model who started working with him during the Paris Fashion Week in 1995.
"He will never get out of fashion because his designs are works of art," he concludes.
Inspection of decorum
Gravani’s life is not a story of obsessions, but of truly repetitive love.
He loves people with good education and better titles and they love him.
One of the galleries of Somerset House was reconstructed into a special seventy-meter-long passage that offers a change of roles: a visitor turns to a model and walks the passages to observe the "audience" of the dreams that he has in his "Valentine's paintings in a painting with a dress chosen by Ken.
In the audience of manequins September names such as Sibilla Luxembourg, Gloria of Thurn and Taxis, Mette-Marit Norsk, Rosario Bulgaria and Sophie Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and designer in 2006
Many of these clients say that the first Valentine is like the first love, "you can't forget it".
"I remember it perfectly.
They were pants, shirts, vests "gillette" and jacket from the autumn-winter collection from 1971-1972.
It was a gift he made for me,” says Naty Abascal, one of the designer museums.
"I give him preference over others for his femininity and great love for women because it underscores our beauty," the former Duchess of Feri added.
"I really like the colors they use, they brighten up a lot and give a "sharp" face.
Proportions are perfect.”
Even the princess and fashion icon Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg can't forget how she first dressed Valentina.
When she was a teenager and living in Italy, she wanted to be an adult and have the opportunity to wear one of his evening dresses...
It finally came at the end of the 90s.
"I bought my first dress from Valentin to celebrate at the castle of my cousin, Prince Edward de Ligne.
They were red dresses that had skirts with lapels, a laced waistline and a shoulderless top.
It was a dream that became a reality," says the widow of Rodrigo d'Arenberg.
“Valentino is lazy to fashion, his passion is timeless,” explains the Italian aristocrat, whose life unfolds between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess d'Arenberg has stored the designer's festive dress "very carefully... because the dress is not only a dress, it is also a set of memories that they have in them".
"King" of fashion
The golden nail of the exhibition at Somerset House are Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding dress from her wedding to Paul the Grecian in 1995.
The creation of these silk dresses ivory-colored with embroidered beads, twelve types of different lace and a four-and-a-half-metre-long tuck took four months of work and 25 "hollows" (as the designer calls his lace).
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the largest authority of the specialized press, these dresses represent the milestone of the top fashion of the late 20th century, "the return of clients from high society".
Valentino, blinded over the years by the elitist "savoir-<0xC3><0xAA>tre" is now his best example.
Garavani as Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest award in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres and awarded by the Order of the Honourable Legion accumulate as much honour as any of the spouses of his clients.
“My attention has always been drawn to his choice, his calm, his well-groomed, and his perfect appearance,” Princess d’Arenberg admits.
"The last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Orsay Museum.
He was at the table with Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, my great friend.
He was flawless, time left no trace on him."
When the princess says so...
The Hardest Craft in the World: Sulphur Carriers in the Kawah Ijen Volcano
For four euros, Indonesian volcano carriers gamble with their life and health as they carry 70 kilograms of sulfur down steep stone paths.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and there are those who literally work in hell.
This is the case of Anta Wijayi, one of the 400 miners who earn their living by extracting sulfur from Kawah Ijen volcano in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
For this reason, every day they have to travel to the bottom of the crater, where sulfur gases escape from the interior of the Earth and when in contact with air, they move to a solid state.
After cutting out large blocks of sulfur, which together weigh up to 70 kilograms, he carries them on his shoulders in two bamboo baskets along steep stone paths.
To the summit of the volcano, which stands 2,386 meters, it is only 250 meters, but exhausted carriers take over 40 minutes to climb up the tortoise, because they maintain balance and carefully consider their steps to avoid slipping and falling into the abyss.
They know that any twitching could cost them a life, as it happened to a French tourist who crashed from the Kawah Ijen rocks years ago.
Miners in Kawah Ijen earn five cents for every kilo of sulfur they extract
When they are up, they make their way around tourists who photograph them as if they were monkeys in a circus, and tirelessly carry heavy baskets to the weight that the mining company placed slightly below, at an altitude of 1,850 meters.
It is the company PT Candi Ngrimbi, which has been mining in the volcano since 1960 and has never paid its employees more than 662 Indonesian rupees (five cents) per kilogram of sulfur.
Then he sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) to the petrochemical industry, as this necrosis has its place in everyday life and is used for the production of lighters, fun pyrotechnics, cosmetics, dynamite and even sugar bleaching.
“Because they usually weigh 70 kilos, we will earn about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each trip,” explains Anto, who usually completes three trips a day.
One trip takes him three hours and in the end he is destroyed, but he can earn 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) per day.
Although this seems to be a negligible amount for such inhuman efforts, it is three times what he would earn in the field.
"The daily salary of miners here is very high. For example, for the collection of coffee you pay 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) per day and the salary for fourteen days is two million rupees (167 euros), " explains the carrier, who previously worked on the tourist island of Bali as a bricklayer.
There was his salary of 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) per day and the work was not so difficult, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for a serious reason which is in Indonesia, which I converted to as convincing as I was to silver.
Anto has asthma, poor breathing, coughing, and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases
At the age of 27, Anto risks his life three times a day in the Kawah Ijen volcano, whose sulfur has already begun to tax on him, although his face is protected by a special mask and glasses.
He has asthma, poor breathing, coughing, and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases that escape from the volcano.
That’s the price you have to pay to achieve your dream.
“I’m going to be working for another two years because I want to open a business or study Spanish or French,” he said.
This sympathetic and intelligent young man who has been overtaken by fate could be a tour guide, waiter or receptionist in a hotel, and instead does the job of a carrier.
She shares a dirty wooden hut with other carriers and wakes up every day at two o’clock in the morning, because the sulfur doesn’t cease to shine at night and its characteristic yellow color turns into blue and September dark.
Despite the darkness around, Anto rushes into the crater and illuminates his way through a small lighthouse, which he has attached to the helmet and bought it for his own money.
About 400 carriers carry sulfur from the bottom of the crater on their shoulders
Although the company has high revenues, due to cost savings, the company has not mechanized the extraction of sulfur, nor does it provide the carriers working on their own and with such an effort, no equipment.
In fact, they don’t even get a share of 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) from the photo surcharge, which, along with a ticket for 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros), is selected by nature park guards from tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
“This job is for cattle, not people,” says Madrusin, a 42-year-old state-run carrier who has been working at Kawah Ijen for three decades, since he left school.
He manages to lift up to 110 pounds and assures us that he will endure working "as long as he can" because he needs money to educate his three sons between the ages of 18 and 10.
I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano has been my whole life
Although sulfur burns the throat and stings in the eyes, when the wind unexpectedly turns and catches the miners in dense eruptions that come out of the volcano, the miners are so asserted that none of them complains that they are suffering from a sore throat after a stroke of severe diseases.
Unainik, who balances his basket on his back, can only weigh 50 kilograms at the age of 53.
Every day he and his colleagues extract 15 tons of sulfur in the volcano, which three trucks then take a steep road between the ponds to the warehouse in Tamansari, 18 kilometers away.
"I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano has been my whole life," Unainik said, opening a wide mouth with several missing teeth.
Of his five sons, the oldest, thirty, also earns by lowering the sulfur.
Time is running out, but the constant misery of one of the heaviest crafts in the world persists from generation to generation – crafts that perform human mules in Kawah Iljen.
Singapore is looking for a baby to save the economy
Singaporeans are seduced by the fact that they do not have children, for career, stress and the cost of living and education.
"The population of Singapore needs to grow."
I'm married and I'm a native, you're my wife and you're a native, so let's do our civic duty and bring a new life to life.
It may seem unbelievable that this slogan is part of a menthol candy ad, but still – or perhaps that’s why – the video in Singapore was massively spread on YouTube earlier this year.
These phrases are part of the rap, which uses local phrases like "we put the beech in the oven" as a mockery of Singapore's fertility rate.
The advertising agency BBH, which created the video, hopes that they will be able to alert them to the problem in a funny way.
Artistic director Douglas Hamilton said he wanted to use the influence of music to make people fulfill “their civic duty.”
“It’s all about the internet, so it had to be fun and fun.
This is the country's biggest problem.
We are the worst in the world in reproduction of our population, so we had the feeling that it was a topic that we had to touch on.
We knew that the government had tried a lot of things like expanding perfumes with pheromones or organizing dating parties.
Many of these ideas may have been creative, but not fully functional.
So we thought, why not do the most creative thing possible, like rapping, to solve this problem."
1.2 Children
The one who doesn’t take it too lightly is the Singaporean government.
It will spend $1,300 a year to encourage citizens to have more children.
The government package for marriage and family provides up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and allocates financial benefits.
All of these measures had a small effect.
Singapore is a wealthy city-state with advanced technology in Southeast Asia, also known for its representatives’ conservatism and strict social controls.
The birth rate in Singapore, in terms of population classification, is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time the birth rate exceeded 2, which is considered the rate of recovery, in 1976.
Why don’t Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of the Department of Marriage and Family of the National Population Office, says it’s because of “better education” and “a broader range of career opportunities.”
“So people have a broader range of options when it comes to life goals and priorities, it’s not just marriage and family,” she explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to an increase in the number of free people and to the postponement of marriages and childbearing, resulting in a reduction in the birth rate in Singapore.
While efforts to drastically increase the influx of immigrants within the framework of immigration policy have been made as a measure against the decline in population, this has provoked dislike among the locals.
On some Singapore websites, there is an undisclosed xenophobia against many new immigrants, especially the Chinese, who are criticized for maintaining low wages and a small effort to integrate.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why last year the government party of Singapore recorded its worst election result since the beginning of independence.
After the elections, efforts to address the problem with quotas and higher fees for foreign workers appeared.
Unexpected consequences
While the decline in fertility rates has known impacts on national economic growth, tax revenues, health spending and immigration policy, there have also been certain unexpected consequences in the case of Singapore.
The government is trying not to build so many small houses.
For example, it began to influence the real estate business.
The Office for Urban Development has begun to regulate the number of small apartments known as "shoe crabs" that can be built in certain urban zones.
These apartments have an area of 46 square meters and had great success in sales.
However, there is concern that these apartments may support a youthful lifestyle and discourage developers from building large family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, CEO of EL Developers, claims that their “bottlenecks” sell much faster than larger homes.
“They’re more popular, so they sell days to weeks faster than larger-area homes.
That’s why they’re much better for our cash flow.”
However, he admits that the new standards set clearer rules for developers who were previously limited when they wanted to offer too many small houses in one project.
<0xE2><0x99><0xAA> Too stressed <0xE2><0x99><0xAA>
Singapore is a city state.
While these new rules could be aimed at increasing the nation’s fertility rate, an interview with Singaporeans working in the financial district of the city centre suggests they won’t have a big effect.
“People are still under stress, homes are expensive, as well as education, which is why many people postpone it,” says the young official.
"Let the others have children.
But it’s important for me to rely on my own money and time,” says another, about 20-year-old, young man.
Men and women mention careers, stress, and cost of living and education as reasons to prevent them from having children.
So no matter how the government tries to force citizens to have children, it’s the Singaporeans who ultimately have the final say about the founding of the family.
What I'm Private Offline I'm Private and Online
It's privacy.
According to a dictionary issued by the Royal Spanish Academy, it is something of a personal nature or an “area of private life that everyone has the right to protect against any disturbance.”
What is privacy for a person under the age of 16?
How does he apply this definition in his daily life and on social networks?
Does he understand the dangers he is exposed to when he publishes things on the Internet that he would certainly not tell anyone during normal communication?
Journalists from elPeri<0xC3><0xB3>dico interviewed five boys and girls between the ages of 10 and 15 who are frequent Internet users.
In four cases, they considered the concept of privacy as "something entirely personal" on a personal level and as a "user name and password" if it was a social network.
“My biggest secret I wouldn’t disclose,” says 10-year-old Jorge in an effort to explain the importance of privacy in places like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had accounts for two years.
“They’re very secretive secrets, my mom might know about them, but not the whole world,” she says.
"I'm putting nice pictures or pictures on FB as we play.
I also talk to my friends there.
“I wouldn’t share a photo that wasn’t mine, or a photo that would make someone laugh,” she said.
This boy realizes that it is wrong to publish obscene photographs, photographs of naked people, or photographs of crimes, or to write humiliating or gross comments.
Jorge says he knows all 35 friends he has on FB and his nine followers on Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
Among them is a mother who has the name and password of one of the accounts.
“I’ve set up a Twitter account so I can express my opinions and write interesting posts.
I don’t know if anyone will answer me, I’m just giving them there,” he adds.
“Social networks are fun, I can talk to relatives who are far away or quick to communicate with friends,” he says.
Without hesitation, he says he would never accept a request from an unknown person.
He wouldn't even care if someone recommended him to someone he doesn't know.
The case of 14-year-old Joseph is different.
This teenager owns accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask networks, and on the latter network admits that he doesn’t know 20 people on his friend list.
“I’m not afraid of it because we have something in common, like music,” he says.
According to this boy, none of them mentioned anything to him, nor did they ask for his address or phone number.
“If they insisted on me or demanded it from me, I would simply remove them from my account,” he admits.
José signed up for Ask after reading the recommendations on Twitter.
These guys are not strangers to the experience of what is now called cyberbullying.
"A well-known friend has been blackmailed on social media.
They threatened him and asked for money.
He never knew who he was," he said.
According to Jose, the victim did not log out of the account.
"You're just activating the private mode."
It then explains a series of steps on how to set up your account safely.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would post pictures of famous people in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
"Of course I would do it if someone bothered me or just wanted me to.
Even though I know it's cyberbullying," he says.
<0xE2><0x80><0xA2> Key questions
Marielos Porras, a teacher of English and a graduate of Education and Teaching, believes that in order for children and adolescents to be properly oriented on social networks, they must understand that the main goal of these networks is to inform them.
“The Internet was created as a means to search for information, but when social media appeared, the rules of the game changed.”
Marrielos Porras notes that academic Marc Prensky, a graduate of pedagogy at Yale University and the author of the article Digital Natives and Digital Immigrants, introduced these concepts to explain this phenomenon.
“Digital natives are children and young people who were born at the time of this technology.
We are digital immigrants, we have to teach them, and we are still learning ourselves,” he says.
He explains that this is a complex topic, "because we ask them to recognize what is appropriate to spread, publish and say, and what is not, at an age when they are not yet mature."
Also, to be – as far as the environment is concerned – considerate, at a time when what they most desire is to be a favorite, to have thousands of friends and not to think about the consequences,” he adds.
According to this specialist, the most effective way to show children and adolescents what privacy is is, is to ask questions that force them to think.
"Telling them not to do anything doesn't work," he adds.
Furthermore, Marrielos Porras mentions some of the options: There are things you wouldn’t tell a stranger, so why do you do it on the Internet?
Or: Would you like it if someone posted your photo the way you posted it to a friend?
Do you know what others are publishing about you?
When you point out people in the photos of the celebration, did you ask these people for permission?
And one more thing: Do they all need to know what you’re doing all the time?
Another point is to make them realize that they have to behave in the internet environment as well as outside it.
These are the same rules.
“Man is ruled by respect, morality, and other principles outside of the internet, and the same should be done on social media,” he says.
Surveillance
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, first-degree teacher and educational counselor explains that it is necessary for parents of children to carefully read the rules of social networks.
“If they understand each other’s deceptions, they have a good basis for talking to children about the consequences that setting up an online account can have.
For example, in terms of age or what is allowed to share or publish,” he says.
The Guardian is of the opinion that it is key to remind children of the traditional rule of "don't talk to strangers".
South America’s Summit ends and the Declaration of Lima has not been published
The sixth Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) in Peru ended today without a statement from Lima, which was announced and allegedly signed by the seven presidents present.
EFE has repeatedly tried to gain access to the document signed at the sixth meeting of the Heads of State and Government of the Unasur organization, but representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the presidential offices, who initially determined that the document would be published after the summit ended, said in a website later on.
They further stated that the content was published by Peruvian President Ollanta Humala in several short press releases.
Journalists had limited access to information throughout the summit.
During the meeting, a video of the presidential assembly was broadcast in the press room without sound with a message of "confidential meeting, transmission of sound prevented".
A small amount of information available to journalists was provided by the presses of some governments that were present at the talks, but not by Peruvian speakers.
The only document published during the hearing was a list of the presidents who took part, which led to hundreds of journalists from various national and international media calling for more information.
Later, the Peruvian presidential office emailed the media with a "final statement" from the summit, but it is only a statement by President Humala, not an official document that concluded the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the third summit of South American and Arab countries (America del Sur-Pa<0xC3><0xAD>ses <0xC3><0x81>rabes, ASPA) and even on this occasion, the originally promised Declaration of Lima was not published, although the press was fervently requested.
On the official website of the ASPA, it can be found that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities sought to ensure broadcasting for all journalists, but completely avoided the influx of information.
The summit ended, among other things, with a joint commitment by Chile and Peru to adopt a judgment of the Hague Court of Justice, which resolves a border dispute between the two countries.
Peruvian President Ollanta Humala and Chilean President Sebasti<0xC3><0xA1>n Pi<0xC3><0xB1>era met during a regional meeting and confirmed that they will respect the decision of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which will begin Monday by hearing the defence speech of both sides to discuss the dispute that started for Santima.
"We will challenge and enforce a judgment that will resolve the dispute that we are discussing today in this international court," President Humala said, along with his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile has been, is, and will be, a country that respects international law, peaceful settlement of disputes, conventions and international courts," Pi<0xC3><0xB1>era said.
The confirmation by the two presidents that they are subject to the decision of the International Court of Justice was made public after Colombia adopted the Bogota Pact this week, expressing its submission to the judgments of the International Court of Justice, which ruled on the maritime borders with Nicaragua.
The summit was held without the participation of the presidents of Brazil (Dilma Rouseff), Venezuela (Hugo Chavez), Bolivia (Evo Morales) and Argentina (Cristina Kirchner).
Paraguay was expelled from Unasur in 2011 after the dismissal of then-President Fernando Luga and did not attend the meeting.
Host President Ollanta Humala was tasked with starting the morning speeches and ending the summit in Lima shortly after noon.
The president read the final document informing that 16 agreements had been accepted and planned to work on 31 projects between South American countries, with investments in the amount of $17 billion.
In addition to the agreements adopted, UNASUR member countries will take "important steps towards the goal of South American citizenship, which is why the stay agreements are extended."
He said he supported actions to improve “cooperation in the fight against civil insecurity and international organized crime, to improve the availability of medicines and cheap internet in all corners of South America, and to jointly and effectively take action against the risks of natural disasters.”
When Europe is in crisis, “economic consolidation (Latin America) should not have the winning essence, but should serve to expand our productivity and show our nations a better future,” Humala added.
"We have decided to prioritise a group of 31 symbolic projects that will improve the transport connections of different places in South America, especially rural and border areas... so that our countries are better connected and create new economic ties," the president said in a statement.
He noted that five of these projects concern Peru and the transverse axis of its territory from the coast to Brazil, and two others concern better links with Ecuador, but did not provide further details.
The final document also touched on the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve to bring it back to the Union of South American Nations," from which it is currently excluded.
Another of the issues raised by the summit was the need for Latin America to remain a prosperous and peaceful area that is holistic and has good neighbourly relations.
In this sense, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said before attending a regional meeting that he hopes to meet with his Nicaraguan counterpart Daniel Ortega on Saturday in Mexico to respectfully discuss the International Court of Justice’s ruling on the dispute over the dispute.
"It is possible that I will meet with President Daniel Ortega tomorrow," Santos said.
"We will discuss all solutions, none of which are excluded, nor a treaty with Nicaragua that would require negotiations with this country," he said.
"I hope that I can tell President Ortega to conduct the negotiations in the most civilized and considerate form possible," Santos said.
Santos and Ortega will meet in Mexico on Saturday to attend the inauguration of President Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>i Nieta.
During the summit, the EU Defence Ministers met in advance to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus on defence in the region.
Members of UNASUR are Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay, although the latter country is currently excluded.
Peru is the interim chairman of this regional bloc.
Rafael Correa: South America must learn integration from Europe
Ecuador's President Rafael Correa announced today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal in which "South America, in this case, really, must learn from Europe".
Correa, who attended the sixth presidential summit of the South American Union of Nations (UNASUR) in Lima, said on state TV Peru that Europeans "killed themselves during World War II" and in other conflicts, "but now they are practically one country".
In this sense, he defended the project of creating South American citizenship, which is supported by the member countries of Unasur.
"The free movement of citizens and workers must be achieved within any South American country that is already underway among the members of the Andean Community, but there are still backward areas that want to bring us back to the past," he said.
The President of Ecuador has said he agrees to regroup the Organization of American States (OAS) on the condition that it reduces the influence of the Anglo-Saxon states and takes into account those who signed the San José Human Rights Pact.
“Those at the forefront never commit to anything, and we South Americans will sign everything.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is funded by the United States in Washington," said Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, in a statement on political asylum.
President Correa confirmed that he did not regret this decision because he did not betray his principles, and respected his "deep democratic values and human rights".
He added that at the time "there was a reasonable suspicion that Assange could be extradited to a third country regardless of the ongoing process".
In addition, he criticized the Swedish court, which asked him to be interrogated on Swedish territory for an alleged sexual offence, with "own Swedish legislation allowing the Lond<0xC3><0xBD>nn<0xC3><0xBD> to conduct interrogations in a videoconferencing speech that could be echoed by a large audience".
Correa said there was a risk that Assange’s physical and mental health would deteriorate.
"I haven't spoken to him since he's at our embassy, but the ambassador has informed me that he has minor lung problems, but nothing serious," the Ecuadorian head of state said.
“But it’s likely that his physical and mental condition will deteriorate because he’s confined to a small space with no possibility of movement in the fresh air.
That would mark everyone's health," he added.
President Correa noted that the solution to the asylum granted to Assange since June at the Ecuadorian embassy in London on the basis of a permit that allows him to travel to Ecuador is in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and the European Courts of Appeals.
"We do not negotiate on human rights, we do not use such a word in this case, but there have been constant discussions.
The solution to this problem is in the hands of the UK, Sweden and European courts, because Assange’s lawyer, Baltazar Garz<0xC3><0xB3>n, leads a series of trials in various European courts,” he said.
He said that “if the UK issues a leave tomorrow, it will all be over.”
And if Sweden hears Mr. Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy in London or via Skype, as the legislation there allows without problems, and as has been done in other cases, tomorrow this problem will be ended."
Correa used this situation to present himself as a defender of freedom of the press, explaining that he definitely does not tolerate “undermeaning, bad intentions, and lies that undermine freedom of expression.”
“The greatest enemies of the free press are not us, who are subverting and overthrowing politicians, but the bad journalists in the service of profit, oppression and blackmail,” he said.
From this point of view, he expressed joy at the fact that neither such journalists, nor bankers, nor hegemony countries, nor the bourgeoisie control Ecuador, and suggested that if he was re-elected, he would "continue the changes led by the right way and the right way".
President Correa also backed the decision to keep Paraguay's veto on membership of the Unasur Union at least until its next elections, arguing that the whole "must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and coup-conduct enshrined in legality" because in fact it "destroyed the paraguayan legitures."
Ecuador's president also said he considers it "completely appropriate" for his Colombian counterpart Juan Manuel Santos to negotiate with Nicaragua on the maritime borders between the two countries now, at a time after the judgment of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which ruled in favour of the Nile.
The judgment is not currently accepted.
"This is a problem between the South American and Central American countries.
Conflicts are inevitable, but the will to walk together must be overcome.
They need to be judged broadly in order to be overcome and be able to move forward."
He also expressed hope in the settlement of the maritime border dispute, which is being settled in the same court of Peru and Chile, and expressed the view that "it is right for Latin America to seek international instances if both countries are obliged to make a judgment, however difficult it may be".
In connection with the possibility that he will run in the next presidential election in Ecuador to run for a third term, he noted that he perceives this option "with great optimism and joy, even though it is sometimes very difficult".
Correa said that if he loses the election in February 2013, he will step down from public life.
“I have never personally cared much, but such an unfair situation as socio-economic poverty in Ecuador can only be corrected by political power.
“My political movement believed that it was I who guaranteed this probable victory, so we have to accept this responsibility,” he said.
"If I win, it would be my last presidential term and then I would leave politics.
When we lose, I expect the same.
I've already decided," he said.
Correa also mentioned the new medical treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez in Cuba.
“I just spoke to Venezuelan Vice President Nicolas Maduro, who says that President Chavez went to a scheduled routine treatment and his return to Cuba was expected after the campaign ended.
This is not a recurrence in the president’s state of health,” he explained.
The Head of State of Ecuador attended today the sixth Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), which was concluded by calls for greater regional integration with a view to maintaining development, equality and security.
AIDS victims are now the result of a late diagnosis.
Fabrizio was 21 years old when the result of his test was confirmed: HIV positive.
"It was as if a lightning struck me," he recounts, in memory of a moment of truth, which the doctor tried to "seduce" a little, but apparently unsuccessfully.
The boy kept it secret from his family.
He decided to take his disease on his own and began to inform himself about it, with such a commitment that he had already celebrated his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the earliest patients of the HIV Unit at the Civil Hospital in Guadalajara (HCG), which he came to in 1994 after several battles with the disease.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) since the age of 22, which was something unimaginable in the early 1990s, when there were a lot of doubts, few treatment options and a larger stigma.
At the time, even the director of the clinic of the Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) did not say goodbye to him, "because he had a cut."
At the time, having AIDS was synonymous with death.
Now it is possible to survive with this syndrome and live fully.
However, there are many people who do not know about their disease and come only when the virus has caused the destruction of the organism and transmitted the immune system, and then become victims of accidental infections.
31 years since the advent of AIDS in the world, or at least from the first documented cases, "it is a great success that the length of life of a patient who does not start treatment in a timely and appropriate way, is not the same as in the information given to the patient," said Jaime Andrade.
Infectologist and AIDS specialist Andrade Villanueva explained that scientists have concluded that since 2008 AIDS is not a death sentence, but that the duration of survival and full life depends on the degree of disability of the immune system of patients who have been diagnosed with the disease.
Simply put, this means that a person who is diagnosed with HIV at the age of 25, according to this knowledge, “can live without problems up to 75 years of treatment,” the doctor explained in an interview.
To highlight this progress, it is worth recalling that the average life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years.
Although mortality has declined significantly in recent years and, in Mexico, the number of people who died from AIDS has fallen from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (the year of the United Nations Joint Programme on HIV/AIDS - UNAIDS), it is also true that 60 per cent of patients have been born under AIDS since the discovery of AIDS.
In the state of Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011 and 187 people died as of May this year. However, universal access to antiretrovirals has been ensured since 2005.
- Why do people continue to die of the consequences of the disease?
"I don't think the problem is access to treatment.
This is how I see it, this is how it happens at the hospital.
At least in the last 12 years, we have not exhausted the supply of medicines. The problem is that patients come in a very advanced stage, because they do not know the state of the infection, that is, in the late stage of the disease."
He adds convincingly: "Nine out of ten patients come when some associated infection is already manifesting. The only thing that needs to be done to be able to more influence the overall mortality is to diagnose the disease first, and therefore it is not necessary to diagnose everything in the first place."
In his proposal he agrees with the specialists and officials of the State Council for the Prevention of AIDS in the state of Jalisco and directly with patients like Fabrizio, who came to do tests in a private laboratory only because of the sarpuk that his friend had done it with one disease.
“Everything will change when you know you have AIDS.
Some people think they're going to die, and they don't want to know anything else.
"If I'm going to die, I'd rather get three times a week," they say, but that's not my case.
The change was for the better, healthy eating, exercising, taking medication."
To this day, his parents only know that he suffered from cancer.
“I live a normal life like everyone else.
I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I lead an active sex life, but responsibly, I pay attention to myself and to the other person," says Fabrizio, who accepted the invitation to share his experiences with those who are motivated by the journal MILENIO JALISCO, to dream of the day.
"Let them take tests. If they're at risk, let them know as soon as possible if they're HIV positive, it's better. And if they've already been diagnosed, let them realize that they can live like everyone else when they're responsible."
This message summarises the theme of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
There is a big gap between health programs and ordinary citizens, said Ricardo Salazar, a Guadalajara journalist who searches for information about the HIV virus.
And the biggest gaps are in prevention.
“In places that are dedicated to this task, the distribution of condoms has really increased, we were given one or two, and today we are given packets and a hundred condoms, which is very good, but there are still people who don’t have access to condoms,” he said.
Adolescents are among the most prone to new infections.
“What do you want to do?” is a common question full of irony and judgement from social workers, school counselors, pharmacy staff, and health care staff who teenagers want to avoid, the reporter says.
He proposed to change this ineffective distribution. Let the condoms be not just behind the counters, but those hundreds located in the dispensers in the public toilets, in places where young people often go.
“This is not promiscuity.
It’s not even about them “paying for beer and motels,” as Governor Emilio Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez responded to the question of whether he would agree to the distribution of condoms in his district.
This kind of sexuality is not. It is best to make condoms available to those who already have sex," he noted.
Key numbers in the state of Jalisco
There were 13,435 cases (12,158 cases of AIDS and 1,317 cases of HIV).
This condition marks the fourth place in Mexico in new and detected cases of AIDS and the 13th place in relation to HIV.
92% of the infection occurs sexually, 6% by blood and 2% perinatally.
It is estimated that about 50,000 people can live with the HIV virus, as for one registered case there are four to five people who do not know about the disease.
The decision approved by the U.S. Court of Appeals, which does not recognise the restructuring of Grupo Vitro’s debt imposed by bankruptcy in Mexico, sets a bad precedent for any national company with branches in the neighbouring country and the solvency problem.
It seems, therefore, that the procedures for restructuring companies that allow Mexican laws do not apply in the country of stripes and stars despite international agreements.
The approval of a June 15 ruling by Judge Harlin Hale in the bankruptcy court for northern Texas leaves the Mexican firm defenseless in practice against the possibility of confiscating their assets on the other bank of the El Bravo River.
However, the ruling opens the door for the main Mexican glass manufacturer to the U.S. Supreme Court with an appeal against three inequalities.
The introduction is to say that while the judges of this case claim that creditors are to be subject to U.S. insolvency law, the Fifth District Court of Appeals, based in New Orleans, says that the main proceedings determine bankruptcy proceedings in Mexico.
Firstly, this would indicate the ignorance of international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of multinational companies.
In essence, for this purpose, a United Nations Model Law for the Unification of International Commercial Law was created, which is designated by the American Law Institute as an arbitrator.
Secondly, the judgment states that without voting on the subsidiaries of the internal corporate structure, when the debt of the Vitro parent company to the subsidiaries is recognised, the majority required for approval of the restructuring would not be achieved.
However, this option is allowed by Mexican laws.
The fact is that the Vitro case was not the first in which this scheme was adopted.
There are half a dozen examples such as Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, for which the intra-company debts were secured by the Federal Bankruptcy Institute.
In addition, it is true that even after deducting the votes from the branches, the creditors – who stood against Vitro in court in the United States, i.e. funds “supplies” such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited – would not have reached the majority.
In the vote they would reach about 45 percent to 37.
This information is not taken into account by the Court of Appeal.
From a different point of view, the court blames Vitro for the difficult situation it has faced since 2008 – against the backdrop of the serious economic crisis that hit the United States.
In the meantime, the family company Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez Sady is appealing to the appeal court for a re-assessment to be conducted with full participation, i.e. with the participation of five judges, since they originally voted only three.
If it fails here, it will require a review of the process by a higher court, in this case the Supreme Court of the United States.
It is important that the court neglected a document sent by the Mexican government as a unit of amicus curiae, which describes in detail the procedure of Vitro under the Bankruptcy Act and which points out that the company facilitated the acquisition of the Spokon by ordering the Conflict to be signed by the Conflict.
In addition, it points out that the country has complied with the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, that is, rules designed for international insolvency cases that guarantee equality for debtors and creditors.
Conflict on both sides: punishment for Vitro and the State.

Without noticing, the Mexican Air Force’s criminal complaint against former business owner Gast<0xC3><0xB3>n Azc<0xC3><0xA1>rraga Andrade, who was accused of fraud, was on the table for several months, and according to the union pilots’ organization, the container has already passed.
The body headed by Carlos D<0xC3><0xAD>az Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez Morineau has just filed a lawsuit against the National Banking Commission and the Securities Commission, which he accuses of obstructing justice.
According to her, the audit authority systematically refused to report to the Attorney General of the Republic on the transaction carried out by this entrepreneur, in which the IXE of the fideikomis F/589 selected 198 million pesos on behalf of the Mexican Aviation Company.
The funds were most likely directed to the purchase of the shares of the Professional Hotel Administration (Administradora Profesional de Hoteles).
As you know, Azcarraga Andrade is the majority shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
Siege of Dragon Mart
At the Universidad de Caribe, a group of domestic and foreign ecologists, academics, entrepreneurs and ordinary citizens, who have approved the creation of the association, met over the weekend to prevent the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
We are talking, as is known, about a huge commercial and distribution center with products from a "land with a big wall" focused on Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, which would include a residential zone for employees from 150 companies at the bottom.
Previously, the Canacintra (C<0xC3><0xA1>mara Nacional de la Industria de Transformaci<0xC3><0xB3>n) was able to unite the governors of the southeastern zone to oppose a monumental area that would partially devastate the protected areas and which represents the origin of all resistance to industry.
The end of the ACTA document
The request of the Senate, which the government did not take into account and which required an explanation of the conditions and circumstances under which the Mexican Ambassador to Japan signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known by the English abbreviation ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property.
As is known, this happened despite the fact that the Senate itself excluded the possibility of considering it as a threat to freedom of expression on social networks.

Héctor "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
Basketball world champion Héctor "Hetin" Reyes has been associated with this indoor sport for more than 60 years and has been processing the entire world thanks to him.
Few people in Puerto Rico have as many memories of the history of local basketball as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes has.
Reyes was before he was stabbed in a wheelchair by a cerebral palsy in 2008, burned to this sport for more than 60 years, whether as a junior category player, a player of the national basketball league BSN, a presidential basketball team owner and coach of the club Vaqueros de Bayam<0xC3><0xB3>n in the national league.
"I've played many roles in basketball throughout my life, including several at the same time, as when I was president of the BSN National League in the 1990s, general manager of the national team and president of the federation," Reyes recalled at the time of his visit to the 50-year-old reporter in the newspaper Isa Primera.
“Basketball was my life.”
Reyes does not go beyond his assertion.
The walls of his house, which are almost all decorated with photographs and commemorative items from his long career, testify to this.
Bayam<0xC3><0xB3>n in the heart
With the greatest movement of all guards are those who remind him of his performance at Los Vaqueros from the mid-1950s, where he was a player until 1982, when he also celebrated 15 years as a co-owner or owner of the team.
"It was my best years, the one I enjoyed the most, because I had the opportunity to compete with the Los Vaqueros team since 1967 in eight championships, whether as owner, co-owner or coach.
It was a series of successful years, including five championships held in the years from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one championship - in 1981, when Jerome Mincy made his BSN debut.
At the time, the team took over Cuco Ortiz, who was an excellent leader," Reyes said.
"I remember Gene Bartow, who used to be a coach here and was working at the University of Alabama in Birmingham at the time, telling me, 'I have a grown-up two-meter player for you.
You want him?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico has ever had.
Bartow then recommended to me the player Raymond Gauss, who became a member of the team and one of our best shooters.
I remember he said that if Mincy brings Bayamona a championship victory, then Gauss will contribute to the next one."
The championship, when Los Vaqueros played for the team Gauss, was enjoyed, but only at a distance, because in 1988 he already served as president of the basketball federation.
At the time, he wanted to devote himself fully to his duties and enjoy Mincy’s placement in the national team.
“I remember the first time we beat the United States in the qualifying Olympics in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the World Cup in 1990, where we ended the quarterfinals, but we should have had the bronze not to be that Canadian referee who let us repeat the final innings," Reyes said.
Is the 1990 World Cup team the best national team you've ever seen?
He is among the best, as well as the one who defeated Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was the national team at the 1991 Pan American Games in Cuba, when we won the gold and broke the United States team, which was quite similar to the one that blew us the bronze at the World Cup.
The team had not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramona Rivase, Fica L<0xC3><0xB3>pez and "Picul<0xC3><0xAD>na" (Ortiz), but also there were the youths (Javier) "To<0xC3><0xB1>ito" Col<0xC3><0xB3>n and James Carter, the brothers of Leon (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not have been in the 1990s.
The team, which may not have had the perfect composition, but managed to win the gold medal and bring great joy, was the team from the 1995 Olympic qualification at the Argentine Neuquén.
With co-writers such as "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and junior player Rolando Houruritiner replacing players excluded due to a dispute at the Pan American Games in Mar de Plata, we won gold despite all predictions.
What was the best player in Puerto Rico?
It was without a doubt Picul<0xC3><0xAD>n Ortiz.
His numbers from the international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has reached this level of results like Picul<0xC3><0xAD>n.
Not to mention his performance in the different leagues where he played.
Who was the best Puerto Rican coach?
That's very hard.
We had a very good generation, including Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau and Armando Torres.
I really like the work of Leo Arilla.
What do you consider to be the biggest success in the federation?
That I was part of the most famous era of the national team from 1988 to 1995 and that in the early 1990s the BSN National League had up to 17 teams in one season.
What couldn't you prove?
There were things I wanted to introduce, like the division of youth categories by region.
For example, the Ponce boys would only play in their area and compete with teams from other corners of the island only in the national play-offs.
Now children travel a lot and play too many matches, which is not necessary.
I also see the benefits in mandatory certificates and courses for coaches, assistant referees and referees.
I'm glad you did.
What are you doing now?
Most of the time I listen to music, watch YouTube videos with music from my time, enjoy grandchildren and sometimes go to basketball games.
And of course I enjoy the company of my wife Isabel, who has always been by my side.
Actor Larry Hagman has died.
Larry Hagman, who was born on September 21, 1931, in Forth Worth, Texas, played the world-famous lead role of John Rosse Ewing, better known as "J.R." in the television series Dallas, in which he portrayed a man who acted ruthlessly and was seductive and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role as oil magnate J.R. Ewing in the Dallas television series became a symbol of starvation in the 1980s, died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in the new series of Dallas, died on Friday afternoon from complications related to cancer, according to an official family announcement provided by the Associated Press to Dallas production company Warner Bros..
"Larry has returned to his beloved hometown of Dallas, where he once again played the iconic role he liked most," the family said in a statement.
Larry's family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for Thanksgiving.
"Linda Gray, who was his wife's representative in both the original and the new series, was with Hagman at the time of his death in a Dallas hospital," said her agent, Jeffrey Lane.
He brought joy to everyone he knew.
“He was creative, generous, fun, kind, kind and talented, and I will miss him so much.
He was unique and lived his life to the fullest," Linda Gray said in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver in 1992, and he himself admitted that he drank a lot for years.
In 1995, a malignant tumor was found on his liver, and Hagman underwent a transplant.
Years before the broadcast of the Dallas series, Hagman became famous on television as a decent guy in the light-hearted comedy I Dream of Jeannie broadcast by NBC from 1965 to 1970.
Here he played the character of Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life changes when he meets an attractive girl (the jester) played by Barbara Eden, and takes her home to live together.
He was also the protagonist in two short comedies, The Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and Here We Go Again (ABC, 1973).
His performances in the films included roles that were well received by critics: The Group, Harry and Tonto, and Primary Colors.
But it was only Hangman’s masterful performance in the form of an incredibly repulsive J.R., which led him to the starry peak.
The CBS drama series about the clan of the Ewings and other characters around them was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The propaganda slogan, "Who Shot Jayar?", which was supposed to spark expectations about a part full of emotions when Hangman's character is nearly murdered, caused not only a huge array of spectators around the world to speculate, but also to risk millions of dollars in rate offices.
It also helped this part to achieve a record in follow-up.
The November 1980 episode, in which the response was revealed, watched an average of 41 million television viewers, making Dallas the second most watched entertainment show in history after the 1983 broadcast of MASH, which watched 50 million viewers.
J.R. was shot by his brother-in-law Kristin (played by Mary Crosby).
Kristin and J.R. got pregnant, and then he threatened to label her a prostitute if she didn't leave town, but there were others here who had reason to attack him.
Hagman played Ewing, an insatiable greedier with a charismatic smile: a lazy businessman and an unfaithful husband who tried to get his wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), who was an alcoholic, locked up in the treatment room.
"I know what I want J.R. to have on the gravestone," Hagman said in 1988.
It should be: "Here lies the honourable citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only thing that didn't work out.
Victoria Principal, who played in the original series, recalled Hagman on Friday as someone who was "great on the canvas and beyond."
It is unforgettable and irreplaceable for millions of admirers in the world and in the hearts of all of us who have been lucky enough to know and love it.
Ten episodes of the new Dallas series were broadcast by TNT a few months ago with great success.
"The shooting of five parts of the second series has already been completed and the sixth one has just been filmed," the television station said.
Immediately after Hangman's death, there was no statement from Warner or TNT about how the series would continue.
A native of Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who starred in classics such as the musicals South Pacific and Peter Pan.
Mary Martin was a very young girl when in 1931 she gave birth to Larry, whose father was her husband, lawyer Ben Hagman.
In the early 1950s, Larry tried his luck on the New York theatre scenes and then served in the Air Force in England from 1952 to 1956.
There he met a young Swedish designer, Maj Axelsson, whom he married.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and for a long time lived in the California city of Malibu, where many celebrities live.
In 2001 he published his autobiographical book Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life.
“I didn’t put anything there that I knew could hurt or hurt someone in some way,” the Associated Press said.
After a liver transplant, he began to promote organ donation and worked as a volunteer in the hospital, where he assisted the fearsome patients.
"I advise them, I give courage, I meet with them when they go to surgery and then," he said in 1996.
I try to give them comfort in the sense of "don't worry, it'll be a little uncomfortable for a while, but you'll be healthy."
He was also an activist in the fight against smoking and participated in various campaigns.
Starting a course that explores the “end of the world”
Each week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
When religion professor Stuart Charmé decided that this semester would take a course on the end of the world, he knew it was an irresistible allure: The end of the "long number" of the Mayan calendar, which is set to come on December 21, many people thought of it as proof that the end of the world was coming.
Charmé, however, had no idea what awaits him in the next few months: the catastrophic Hurricane Sandy, the budget gap some call “debted Armageddon,” and the growing conflict into which Israel is ensnared, a place where the Apolypse theorizes Christians.
"I didn't realize this would be the most apocalyptic semester it's ever been," Charmé told students at Rutgers University in Camden, New Jersey, this week.
When one discusses what is happening in the world today, as if we have 30 days left, it’s a really good time.
And remember, bad means bad for apocalyptic thinkers.
And he’s not the only professor who offers courses on the “end of the world” in this semester, which is theoretically the last in history.
Barry Beautifulr, an assistant professor at Temple University, holds a course on “Media, Culture and the End of the World”.
Each week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
“We’re discussing why these ideas expand over time,” he says, and how they offer hypothetical scenarios that drive certain human behaviors.
For example, if nuclear material gets into the hands of terrorists, a war could break out.
This month, students are analyzing films with apocalyptic themes and exploring how they differ from real-life examples.
“I’ve tried to inform students about what’s possible, probable, credible, and impossible,” says Vacker.
On the main campus of Pennsylvania State University, professor of Latin American history Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an expert assistant to the history of art and anthropology, came together to organize a course called The End of the World.
“We don’t join 2012 because we always count on the possibility of rescheduling the course in case the world doesn’t end,” Restall said.
Despite the "threatening destruction" students must study, create projects and take final exams.
At Penn State, the final exam will take place on the eve of the Apocalypse, giving students no choice but to work "until the eve of the supposed end of the world," Restall said.
The courses have become quite popular.
"It split within two hours," Restall said of his course for high school students who enrolled in 35.
Weeks and weeks before the start of the semester we received an e-mail asking if there is still a place.
The students themselves make sure that the course is one of the most interesting.
“I find it fascinating to see what people are doing to comfort themselves,” said 23-year-old Bridgid Robinson, a student of religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey, at Rutgers University in Camden.
And so apocalyptic, secular or religious thinking is only a matter of comfort or its absence.
Will Wekes, a 25-year-old student of psychology and nursing, said he saw all the apocalyptic films.
"I've never heard of an hour in which it could be taught," he said.
"I'm enjoying it."
But no professed student, let alone a professor, said he did not believe in the date of the end of December 21.
“Our first project was about the Mayan prediction and in a way we’re going to throw it out,” said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old final year student at Temple University in West Chester.
"The Mayans never predicted the end of the world; it's just a key point in the calendar," Restall said.
But he added that in Western culture there is an apocalyptic anxiety that dates back several centuries, which people react to changes in their surroundings by predicting the end of the world.
The rise of these speculations has caused the internet.
"People don't think about it anywhere," he said.
This is the case in the vast majority of the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University, who lectures in the Philippines this year, responded quickly to the question of whether he knew of any course there about the “end of the world.”
"The Philippines will not participate in the end of the world," he wrote, pointing to an exception to the Supreme Authority.
We have grace from the Pope.
Restall noted that many days of the last trial had been talked about over the years, and said that if nothing happens on December 21, "people will immediately start thinking about the next date" or philosophy that December 21 is the beginning of a seven-year period, at which time the world will not die.
The date is taken lightly by students and professors.
Several of them said they intended to go to the celebration of the "end of the world".
“I’m probably going to call a few friends to laugh together,” said 20-year-old communications student Samira Ford.
