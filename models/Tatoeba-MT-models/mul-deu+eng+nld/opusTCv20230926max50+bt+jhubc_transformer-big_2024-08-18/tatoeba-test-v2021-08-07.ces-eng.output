Do you remember the day the two of us met for the first time?
Do you remember the day we met for the first time?
Do you remember us?
Do you remember that?
Do you remember Tom?
Do you remember that you've seen me before?
Do you remember the last time you saw Tom?
The toilet is free.
Yoshino is a place famous for its cherry blossoms.
Yuriko was very fond of occasional secret meetings with her lover.
You packed your suitcases.
It'll take a long time.
They'll kill him.
I'll kill you.
I killed two flies in one wound.
I killed them.
He's been killed by a reprocessing.
I'll turn left.
I started writing a new book.
They started arguing about the money.
I started reading a book that Tom had borrowed from me.
I began to read a new book.
You started to cry.
He began to explain what had happened.
I spent the beginning of my life in an incubator.
Be very careful with this.
He treats him like something.
She saved my life.
You saved my life.
They saved Tom for two hours.
I began to be in advance.
I'm starting to be like Tom.
I'm starting to understand.
I'm getting cold.
I'm starting to feel a little guilty.
I'm starting to lose my patience with you.
I'll start tomorrow at 6:00.
You're starting to bore me.
The curtain in the bedroom started to burn.
Let's go!
Let's start this meeting when Tom's here.
I'll start tonight.
I asked Tom not to do it, but he did it anyway.
Have you applied for a job with this company?
Did anyone ask for me?
I'm asking you to get my money back!
I'm asking for the money back!
No words will express how amazing you are.
No giraffe will cross this river.
None of the bones are broken.
No conversations during the test, people.
There's no solution.
They didn't see any trees.
None of these tricks are mine.
No honest man can go to politics.
No guy ever asked me to do that.
Behind the house is a large garden.
It's dark.
The mystery is still unresolved.
We dragged the horses into the fence.
He stabbed the intruders.
They've been raped.
How long will you be ready to leave?
For what purpose?
What team is Tom playing for?
I wonder what caused Tom to change his mind.
I wonder what the future will be for Tom.
I'd like to know how Tom got to my house.
I wonder what Tom's intention is.
I wonder if Tom's interested.
I wonder if we can save this situation.
I wonder if Tom slept with her.
I wonder where Tom is now.
I wonder where Tom ended up.
I wonder who is going to drive.
I wonder how many mistakes I've made.
I wonder how much Tom knows about the matter.
I wonder if Tom's still tired.
I wonder what Tom was really thinking.
She wondered where Sam was and what he was doing.
I wonder when you'll be back.
I'm more interested in speaking French.
Are you interested?
Are you interested in art?
Prohibited fruit tastes best.
I bought a new computer.
The student surpassed the teacher.
She yelled at him.
Cover your mouth when you cough, sneeze or scream.
Sadly, her hair was swollen.
"I care a lot about you," she admitted.
Please fill the flowers.
The deposit has been paid.
He was talking about her.
Put it under the mat.
She fell in love with a Russian immigrant.
Did you fall in love with her at first sight?
To fall in love is one thing, to marry someone is another.
I pointed the gun at the target.
She locked herself in his bedroom.
Did I lock the main entrance?
I was going to have that role done by this time.
Leave the lies.
I don't blame you for anything.
You paid more than you had.
You paid more than you had.
I paid with my credit card.
You paid more than you had to.
I'll pay for Tom's ticket.
Will Tom pay for it?
Please turn on the radio.
Please turn on the radio.
Turn on the TV, please.
Involving Tom in this would be dangerous.
I forgot to tell you about Tom.
Have you forgotten everything we've done for you?
Forget it, it's not worth it.
Forget about this sad event.
Forget I said that.
You forgot to invite Tom, didn't you?
He forgot her name.
I forgot to paste the badge on the envelope.
I forgot all about it.
I forgot to ask for a bill.
I forgot the pencil at home.
I forgot my wallet on the nightstand.
I've forgotten my password.
I forgot to pick up Tom from the airport.
I've forgotten that Tom can read French.
I forgot to turn it off.
He forgot his wallet at home.
Forgot to return the keys.
He would sell his soul to the devil.
First, I don't have a crown, second, I don't have time.
Did I write everything down correctly?
Principles neutralize acids.
I'm the last one to know the truth.
I lost again in chess.
You're lying again.
You're back to your old ways, Tom.
We'll see Tom again.
I heard someone talking to me.
I deserve good things.
I deserve to know the truth.
They deserve what they get.
You deserve good things.
We're asleep.
My heart stopped.
Will anyone stop the human trafficking?
He shot himself for unfortunate love.
I'll shoot him.
I'll shoot him.
I'll shoot you both.
They dragged her into the cellar and raped her.
As I read it, the phone rang.
While Tom was still asleep, Mary was already awake.
You can stay with me for now.
You're not moving anything yet.
The police arrested him?
Did you arrest Tom?
Shut your fist.
I don't pay for this.
I won't pay for this.
Tom will punish you for this.
I can't do that for Tom's business.
You're not responsible for Tom's death.
The entire group was punished for Tom's mistakes.
That's why I love you.
I'm not paid for this.
Three months later, Tom was dead.
They paid me five bucks for the bag.
She attacked him.
I'll call back when I get to the bus stop.
I'll call you later.
I'll call you back a little later.
I'll call you back a little later.
He'll call back.
Call me when you're ready to go.
Call me when you're ready to go.
Call her tomorrow.
Call me, okay?
Call me tomorrow.
Call your father and ask him.
Call him, please.
Call an ambulance!
They locked Tom in the cellar so he couldn't run away.
I closed the door so they wouldn't hear us.
I closed all six windows.
Shut up the book.
Please close the door when you leave.
Shut the fucking door!
You have to pay me for all my translations.
We'll sing another song.
I rang the bell and waited.
We got rid of some old stuff.
Get rid of the evidence.
She adored him.
I love the ocean.
I love you.
The arms industry brings profits, but also suffering.
We have the rest of the day for ourselves.
There's only one day left.
What is butter made from?
I don't quite agree with being treated that way.
With all my heart, I hope he's happy.
She seemed to be silent.
I felt like I was fighting in the war.
I felt like I was in love with a beautiful girl.
It seemed to me that I changed my job.
I thought about onions.
I felt like a friend of a colleague at work.
I thought about the Tatooine.
I thought about this day.
I thought of Tom as he rose from the dead.
It seemed that the officer was afraid of their revenge.
Tom didn't seem to notice that Mary was there.
Tom seemed to have everything he needed.
Tom didn't seem to understand anything you said to him.
Tom didn’t seem to be alone.
He seems very sleepy.
It seems to me that Tom is responsible for Mary's nervous breakdown.
It seems to be too dangerous.
Looks like I'm gonna be up all night tonight.
Spring seems to be coming very soon.
It seems that I am still asleep during the day, but it seems that I can not sleep at all at night.
Looks like I did it all for free.
Looks like you're happy with yourself.
Looks like you have the same problem as me.
No one seems to understand me.
No one seems to understand me.
You don't seem to take me seriously.
Looks like he saved a lot of money.
Looks like no one's noticed anything.
Looks like the war isn't over yet.
Looks like we're gonna have to do it.
Looks like Tom's drunk.
It seems that Tom trusts less and less people.
It seems Tom doesn't care if it happens or not.
Tom seems to be telling the truth.
Looks like Tom doesn't remember any of us.
Tom seems to have fallen asleep.
Tom seems to have lost the meaning of life.
He seems to know everything.
He seems to be neglecting his duties.
Looks like he's losing his motivation.
Here is a picture of my school.
Here you have to enjoy the ally.
We left the house early in the morning.
I'm going to hang out with her on this topic.
I'm reluctant to ask Tom for help.
Healthy relationships are developing slowly.
Health is more important than wealth.
Health is the best gift.
She's holding her back from work.
Of the 20 students, only one read the book.
Which airport am I flying from?
Which of these glasses did you drink?
You're gonna get green.
Iron is much more useful than gold.
Iron is more useful than beautiful.
Iron is a useful metal.
Turtles are beaches.
Turtles have no teeth.
Farmers are still complaining about the weather.
The earth is covered with snow.
Earthquakes have destroyed many homes.
He died so that we could live.
She died at the age of 54.
He's dead.
They died in battle.
He died ten years ago.
The woman you're married to is very beautiful.
My wife left me in October.
The woman denied everything.
Women need to feel that they have the ability to do whatever job they want.
Women are not interested in him.
Women love tea.
Women don't care about him.
I asked him if he would cut my back.
She asked me if all was well with me.
She asked me if I knew this woman personally.
They asked if they wanted to write new words.
They asked Tom if he felt safe with them.
I asked them where the train station was.
I asked Tom where he had gone.
I asked Tom where I should put him.
He asked if he would come.
He asked if he would come.
Let's ask Tom.
Ask Tom about it.
Ask your mother.
The sound was amplified, so everyone could hear it.
He's got a little radio.
He grew old, grew old and divorced, but he also became rich and famous.
He tried his best not to think about her anymore.
I didn't like him at first.
Turn it off, please.
Shut up!
Zhubla.
We live alone.
We have been living in this city since 1960.
You like living here?
She lives in comfort.
I live modestly.
I live in the city.
I live in a community where most people can go to work on foot.
The giraffe was injured.
I've made a lot of new friends.
I'll be working tomorrow.
I'll be working in the garden tomorrow.
I can't go to work tomorrow.
I'm going to Paris tomorrow.
Tomorrow's a holiday.
I won't see her tomorrow.
I'll buy everything I need tomorrow.
We're closed tomorrow.
Tomorrow's my birthday.
Tomorrow's my birthday.
I'm 28 tomorrow.
You can't help Tom tomorrow because you have to work all day.
I'm going to the funeral tomorrow.
You have to wake up early tomorrow morning.
Tom's coming to our school tomorrow.
The life of a banker is difficult.
Life is a riddle and love is the answer.
Life is like a soap bubble.
Life is beautiful!
Life's nice.
Life is a deadly sexually transmitted disease.
Life is hard and difficult.
Life's amazing.
Life is a great suffering.
Life is not easy.
Life is not just about work.
Life is going to go on normally.
Life doesn’t always go the way you want it to.
Cheerful for glory.
From what city are Marco and Maria? Maria and Marco are from Rome.
What chapter is this verse from?
Find out where Tom was going.
Find out where Tom was going.
We found out where he lives.
Did we find out who the woman is?
Did you find out where Tom went?
I found out the food was a little sharp.
I found out my bike was gone.
Did you find out how many Toms are?
The bus was so bad that she started to vomit.
You let me down.
You let Tom down.
Who are you afraid of?
Check if you haven't forgotten anything.
Check it out for me, please.
I've tried everything.
I've tried everything.
You son of a bitch!
Experience brings wisdom to you.
She tried it herself.
I've tried everything.
He tried to get her attention.
I'll try and do something about it.
Try to have some compassion.
Try not to be stupid.
Try talking to the police.
Try it yourself.
Try not to read it that much.
Try to control yourself.
Try this!
Try to explain it to Tom.
Try it again.
The evil witch cursed the man and turned him into a beetle.
Gold is a precious metal.
Gold is heavier than silver.
Gold is heavier than iron.
Evil people will be arrested and convicted for their crimes.
She pissed him off.
I'm mad at Tom.
The criminals managed to escape.
The criminal Tom stood up and killed.
You broke your leg.
He changed the address.
Did I miss something?
It's not exaggerated on my part.
She disappeared in the dark.
He disappeared without a trace.
He disappeared in the crowd.
He disappeared from the surface of the earth.
Get out!
They killed it.
He knows them.
He knows them.
Self-knowledge is the beginning of all wisdom.
We've known Tom for years.
I know him, but I don't know his name.
I know him, and that's why I don't believe him.
I know him very well, because I have often seen him in his father's office.
I know his name.
I only know a few words.
I know her by name.
I know both girls.
I know the truth.
I know the real reason you're here.
I know Tom's wife.
I know the area.
I know your younger brother very well.
Rape is a horrendous crime.
You know me enough to know that I wouldn't do it.
Do you know any of these men?
You know everyone here, don't you?
Do you know the longest word in your language?
Do you know the answer?
He knows it as his shoes.
Does anyone know this guy here?
He knows wine.
Pollution can be regulated.
For some reason, I feel more alive at night.
The captain suddenly left the ship.
She abused my ignorance.
They're abusing me.
You are abusing your authority.
Destroy your enemies: make them your friends.
You'll be happy again.
I told them again to shut down the radio.
I'll read it again.
It was snowing with rain from the sky.
Jogging is another thing I'm not very good at.
They packed it.
They sing in the choir.
She was singing a song, smiling at me.
She wasn't attracted to me at first.
A cat came under the desk.
Two boys came out of the room.
The news of Tom's death saddened me.
I've caused him a lot of trouble.
She betrayed me, I'm disappointed.
A ripe apple fell from a tree.
I'm hurt.
The mirror is armoured.
The mirror's blurred.
The mirror's broken.
They set up a new company in London.
I rarely see you and Tom.
I was just thinking about something.
I was just going to write a letter when he came home.
They ruined my life.
I'd cancel all the dead bodies if I could.
You canceled the meeting.
Destroy this board.
Cancel the meeting.
She shook her face.
We can get a lot of valuable information from that book.
You're overweight.
I wouldn't make fun of that.
Tom is now a man.
He's wasting his time.
The loss of a job she loved so much was a blow to her.
We've lost all our equipment.
He lost her.
I lost the umbrella that Tom gave me for my birthday.
I lost the umbrella that Tom gave me for my birthday.
I've lost my key.
I lost all my friends.
You lost your head, didn't you?
He lost two sons in the war.
You're wasting your time.
Losing the job she loved so much was a serious blow to her.
She shredded the knife.
They took part in it.
I took part in the debate.
I took part in the search.
I'd stay and talk, but I have to go.
They stayed in Tennessee.
We remained silent.
Stay at home.
Will you stay or will you leave?
Will you stay or will you leave?
Stay where you are, or I'll kill you.
Stay with us!
You stay here and lock the door.
Stay here! Stay here!
Stay at home and don't go anywhere.
Stay at home.
I'll stay with her.
I'll stay at the motel.
I'm staying with you.
Curiosity has triumphed over me.
Raise your hands before you answer.
Get out of your chair and help!
We'll call you.
We'll do better.
Can you do it yourself?
Can you do it yourself?
Can you do it on your own?
I chose the path of least resistance.
He's ringing my phone!
The bells ringing.
The bells started ringing.
They screwed it up.
I smashed my ankle.
We get used to everything.
I'm getting used to it.
Habit is second nature.
I'm used to living alone.
I'm used to winning.
He's used to not having hot food every day.
You'll get used to everything.
You'll get used to it.
