The Prague Stock Exchange finished with fewer points at the end of the day
After the rapid fall of the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange corrected their losses.
Transactions of <0xC4><0x8C>EZ stocks reached about half of their value on a normal day.
The Prague Stock Exchange, at the beginning of Tuesday’s trade, reacted immediately to Monday’s fall when it went down to about 6%.
The decline this time is due to the fall in stocks on Wall Street.
It is also here that the market reacts to the outcome of the vote of the American Assembly of Representatives that refused to support the stabilization plan of the secretary of the financial sector.
Fall of stocks in Asia
Shares of the Asian Stock Exchanges fell dramatically on Tuesday, although over the course of the day the index finally attenuated some of the losses.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng stock index over its financial day marked nearly four percent, although it later mitigated its losses by reducing the decline by virtually 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index following the movements of Chinese stocks on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange fell 3.8 percent, in Shanghai the markets were closed.
The shares of the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than five percent but, in the end, the losses fell to 4.3 percent.
The Taiwan Stock Exchange, according to the Index secretary, fell to 3.6 percent.
“The rescue actions planned in the U.S. are unsafe and this affects the financial market around the world,” said Joseph Yam, head of the Hong Kong Monetary Office.
Although Hong Kong is a part of China, it alone determines its monetary policy, that is, without dependence on the Central Bank of China.
Hong Kong’s interest rates are at the same level as those of the United States.
U.S. lawmakers should meet again as soon as possible, according to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, and approve a proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, it threatens that the falls will be felt in other countries.
The Bloody Bath of American Actions
On Monday, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the plan to help the financial system, which should be allocated $700 billion (about 12 trillion kroner).
Lawmakers, in that way, ignored President George Bush’s invitation to support his plan.
For Bush, the plan would solve the root causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
On Monday, U.S. stocks suffered a bloody bath and mainly the stock index picked up the biggest drop in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones index fell to almost seven percent, with a similar volume drop last recorded in 1987.
The index went down before it was announced, but as soon as it was shown that the assembly’s proposal did not go forward, the index began to fall freely.
Congress Withdraws: U.S. Government May Inject $700 Billion Into Bank
The top representatives of Congress and the government, President George W. Bush, agreed on a pact in broad terms of financial aid to the American financial system.
The vote will take place at the beginning of next week.
U.S. lawmakers caused a gap in talks on the approval of the bailout plan in its form of aid to the U.S. financial system in the amount of $700 billion (approximately 12 trillion kronor).
However, it is not yet won.
Congressmen must fine-tune some details of the contract before they can make public the final form of the law and that it be voted on.
The financial aid plan will be discussed in the House of Representatives on Monday.
Barney Frank, chairman of the Committee on Financial Services and the Bank of the Assembly, told Reuters on Sunday.
According to some sources, the vote on the plan could be held in the Senate not before Wednesday.
According to economists, the arrival of the ratification of the bailout plan should represent the announcement of a first psychologically significant factor for the revitalization of the financial market.
After that, however, "disenchantment" will be achieved thanks to the complex mechanisms whose help to the market will also reach in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
“We have made a great breakthrough.
We resolve our discrepancies regarding how the package of measures should have to stabilize the market," Democrat Nancy Pelosi<0xC3><0xA1> told Bloomberg.
According to her, the final vote could still be held on Sunday.
Representatives of lawmakers met with finance minister Henry Paulson on Sunday night to give a definitive shape to the government fund.
It should buy unsold mortgage assets from financial corporations that lead to financial firms to heavy losses and threaten the stability of the entire system.
“We are about to close the agreement on the plan, which will work and should also be effective in the market.
It is still necessary to continue with the sanitation plan, but I think we are already in it," Paulson said.
A Sign for Asian Businesses
The global financial crisis has an explicit impact on the stock market that is rapidly declining.
According to Nevada Democratic Senator Harry Reid, lawmakers are doing everything they can to get Congress to definitively pass a deal on Sunday.
They want to reassure investors in the Asian financial market as these are the ones in the first time zone and where Congress could influence Monday’s trade.
However, for now there is nothing clear for sure about when the two chambers of the American Congress will vote and, not even if they will not stall at the last minute with some problem.
Lawmakers believe it will be approved in the coming days.
The law, however, will undergo a number of changes.
The total amount destined to help the system should be divided into two parts.
The first 350 billion have to be available as soon as possible, as President George Bush requested.
However, Congress could block the release of the remaining amount if it had the impression that the program did not fulfill its function, which would be another $100 billion and, later, the last $350 billion.
Bush applauded the progress of the meetings
On the other hand, the president can veto this decision, but Congress can outperform his veto by a majority vote.
Despite these changes, the basic idea of the program that consisted of earning financial resources for the repurchase of bad mortgage bonds whose value fell because hundreds of thousands of Americans are not able to finish paying off their mortgages was retained.
“We have worked everything.
The House of Representatives would have to be ready to vote on the law on Sunday, and the Senate on Monday,” Republican Senator Judd Gregg said.
U.S. President Bush is also pleased with the progress of the meetings.
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, announced that Bush is satisfied with Saturday’s advance and appreciates “the efforts of both sides to stabilize our financial market and protect our economy.”
Limitation of the Armored Contract
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd, chief negotiator, said legislators decided on the program’s money responsibility for protecting taxpayers’ taxes from their losses, a relief clause of the planned financial plan.
The new law should also limit so-called armored contracts for directors of the participating companies of the program, and create a committee that will have control of the Fund.
This would have to be directed by the Ministry of Finance.
“We’ve worked very hard on it, and we’ve made a big breakthrough towards the agreement that will work and that will be effective for the market and for all Americans,” Paulson said.
The plan also includes helping homeowners who have problems with their payments.
The government would have to agree to the new mortgage payments it buys in order to lower the monthly payments charges to debtors’ deadlines and enable them to stay with their homes.
Marek: psychological help
The proposed plan is, according to the chief economist of Patria Finance, David Marek, a good idea that will be realized but quite difficult.
“And that’s why it’s not known with what mechanism and at what price the problematic assets will be purchased.
This will be decisive for the distribution of losses between the financial sector and the government,” Marek told iHNed.cz this week.
Whether the plan is approved now or early next week is not so relevant, according to Marek.
“Much more importantly, this week the congressmen agree on their support and give them their good looks as soon as possible.
“This important and psychological agreement that that approval is reached is, at the moment, the most important thing,” Marek said.
Armed Hand Struggle: The MP3 Player against the mobile.
We advise you how to choose
While almost every mobile plays MP3 files, no MP3 player can make calls.
What seems clear is that it is better to buy only the phone.
Still, there are enough reasons for man to acquire only the breeder.
The choice depends practically on the manner of its use and the requirement of the future owner.
It will probably be difficult for him to acquire the most modern record to listen to Maxim Turbolenc’s latest album.
On the other hand, this type of music products such as LPs no longer come out, and in terms of their quality there is not a single objective reason to continue buying them.
If you stick vinyl records with art rock, jazz or blues music on your shelves, you’re probably dreaming, at least, of this type of record.
This is the same with the music that is on the way, that is, the compressed, simplified music - the music in MP3.
And here there are price and quality categories.
For some it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns on a player, as well as for a Pink Floyd lover who will hardly try the twenty-crown market helmets.
Two extremes, between which there is enough space for each.
The choice is wide.
It also determines the battery life
Some of the best players get so much more than just playing music and even that which not even most mobiles.
No current device is as universal as the phone.
Faced with the most basic functions such as calling, sending messages, you can play music and video, record both, have a better or worse camera and even manage to navigate.
And when we consider the Smartphone and the PDAs will also have a small computer in their pocket.
This is a small miracle as no refrigerator knows how to grill and no TV can photograph.
The universality of mobile phones also brings us disadvantages.
The more features you use on the mobile before the display indicator will light up asking to be recharged.
And music playback is one of the biggest energy tragedies.
Few are mobile phones that can play music for more than ten or twelve hours, most much less.
In this sense, music players (especially the simplest ones) clearly have higher performance.
Therefore, keep in mind that inexpensive mobile phones will not play more than two hours.
If in addition to this, above, constantly call get even, for more safety, a charger for the job - this also applies to the most expensive appliances.
With the MP3 player this problem will not have, as even the worst ones last at least 9 hours of uninterrupted operation after a charge.
Another problem occurs when recording music on the mobile phone.
Unfortunately only a part of the devices has the universal USB connector and, moreover, not all of them can be connected directly to the computer without special software.
Of course, it is possible to record music directly on the memory card but only in some unreduced drives can connect the small memory cards that are used on mobile phones.
On the players, with some exception (iPod), no special software is required.
Simply fill the device with music through the computer's USB.
Most mobile phones and players create their own order in the music library according to the performer's name, album title, genre or user rating.
Some devices only show a directory with a tree structure similar to a Windows Search and some recognize both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smartphones with operating system).
The player tries to serve, the mobile knows more
For the choice of a particular equipment be interested in the strength of the accumulator, the memory capacity, the quality and type of sound output and, of course, the comfort of its handling.
If you listen, above all, to music as a background and you will listen to it every day only for a while, as in the tram, then you are enough with any mobile that you play.
This is what virtually any mobile device can do.
You should not even be interested in the format in which the mobile or the player plays the music.
The MP3 is played by everyone and virtually all the music that comes to it will be in this format.
It is among the most widespread and with the exception of it the absolute majority of devices play music in WMA format.
The smaller ones include the AAC format (the format used by Apple and its iPod).
The best mobile phones also make it possible, for example, to buy music online.
It is enough through the mobile internet to visit the competent pages of the operator (or any other service provider) and buy a song or album.
This service could by itself be a weighty argument to purchase a mobile for music.
Unfortunately, the offer of the operators is miserable and the majority is limited only to the issues of fleeting success of the radios.
Prices are not the lowest either.
However, in general, it is assumed that precisely this way of selling music (either by GSM, internet or wireless internet) in the future will dominate the music industry.
Most people always wear a mobile phone.
Whenever you want to listen to something, you’ll find the phone in your pocket, while the MP3 player will be forgotten at home.
However, it still depends on whether you always carry headphones or at least hands-free ones.
If not, you can use a built-in player that has virtually every mobile even if it is at least an MP3 player.
Probably the biggest advantage for many of the mobiles with music will be its price.
The cheapest ones usually cost less than three thousand.
Between three and four thousand crowns can already acquire a good walkman.
To most of you will limit the absence of an entry for classic headphones.
The best, even in terms of the technical part, such as phones equipped with a 3.5 mm input for classic headphones, cost up to fifteen thousand.
Again, the advantage of the players is nothing more than their easy service.
The simplest players - by no means necessarily the cheapest (see our selection) - really handles them anyone.
The minimal functions, their handling similar to the previous current cassettes or also to the playable discs is obvious.
It does not pose a threat in the sense that by mistake we connect to the internet with the mobile and, consequently, gigantic account by downloading data.
Which device to choose
Even the cheapest phones (e.g., the Vodafone 527) usually have a memory card change slot (type M2, micro SD, etc.).
Even with the purchase of a suitable card will reach the two thousand crowns.
However, be careful.
Basic models are usually only equipped with a 2 GB card of maximum capacity.
Only the most expensive ones have 8 GB of memory.
If you already have a mobile phone and still want to buy a cheap MP3 player, take a look at Cowon, Creativ, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or Iriver.
Depending on the capacity (up to 2 GB) no more than 1,100 kroner need to be spent.
If you are considered one of the most demanding music lovers, you can use the most specialized mobile-walkers (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have independent keys for the MP3 which makes a service as comfortable as that of a single player.
The most specialized of all is Sony Ericsson, whose mobiles of the walkman line have almost identical use as that of an independent MP3 player.
The same service and the same category in terms of price, over 4,000 crowns, but with a higher memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and accumulator (usually 15 hours, with a maximum performance of up to 35 hours), the most cited brand brings MP3 players.
The first virtual operator will arrive in the Czech Republic this year.
- Probably.
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite developed and our operators offer virtually all services as their Western European partners.
However, here we still lack something - the virtual operator, which would force those to be cheaper.
It probably won't be long before we get there.
That the Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe, we have already written it on mobil.cz.
The Czech Telecommunications Office (<0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>) also confirmed that the price of SMS messages in our country is among the most expensive in the whole Union.
After the European Commission’s latest steps in the field of regulation of roaming fees it is likely to come to a paradoxical situation – for some customers of Czech mobile operators SMS sending from abroad will be cheaper than if they are sent from home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic remain so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, lack of competition that really wants to fight.
This probably seems paradoxical to us, as we have three mobile networks and their high coverage is more than 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to complain that there is extreme competition in the Czech market.
The Chairman of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Office (<0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>), Pavel Dvo<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xA1>k, said that there is no longer room in the Czech Republic for any other operator.
It is perhaps true that for a classic operator with his own network he no longer has too many possibilities (for the rest, it would be quite difficult to find any frequency).
However, there is still a possibility - the virtual operator.
Precisely the entry of the virtual operator into the mobile telephony market brought a significant drop in prices to which classical operators also had to react.
At the same time, even before sharks like Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile entered the UK market, similar voices were heard both here and there.
It has been shown that there is room for these types of operators and that they can be successful.
For the rest, it is not necessary to look for examples too far.
In February of this year we inform you about the premiere of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland.
Only after half a year, this operator managed to acquire more than 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest operator in the neighboring country.
On the other hand, after Mobilking there is the Penta group which, apart from that, in the Czech Republic is the owner of U:fon.
The advantage of virtual operators is the ability to focus on many more specific target groups.
In addition, in order for them to function effectively, they have far fewer customers than a classic operator.
They do not carry relatively large costs in the construction, operation and maintenance of the network.
In the world this type of virtual operators are usually profiled with low costs - they offer cheap calls and SMS messages that however, are often contrasted with the offer of more tailored services.
For example, Tesco mobile in the UK offers SMS at least half of them cheap compared to the competition.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can also be a good blow to bet on a rather trivial target group.
This operator is specifically aimed at the man.
“The right man chooses Mobilking – it’s the operator he likes and who he can be trusted with,” says David Seibert, CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, which works for this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say if a similar concept like that of Poland could stick in our country.
Vodafone spokesman Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> said: “The Czech market is relatively small to be accessed by segments on which most virtual operators are based.
In addition, from the point of view of the offer of services is relatively saturated"
In the Czech Republic there are no possibilities, mobile operators say
However, it seems almost certain that if there will be any virtual operator in the Czech Republic that will not be Mobilking.
“We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, however, in the Czech Republic it doesn’t seem too hopeful.
Rather, it is the launch of Mobilking in other countries in our region,” Jana Studni<0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1>, spokesman for the financial group Penta, told mobile.cz.
He indirectly assured that the current mobile operators in the Czech Republic definitely do not bow to this idea.
Rather, they try to do their best to avoid any potential competition.
Interest in the launch of a virtual mobile operator is already shown by the GTS Novera group that would like to take a step further to become a real competition of Telef<0xC3><0xB3>nica O2 in the field of corporate customers.
“We have a great interest in this, in order to be able to offer our customers not only landline but also mobile phone services.
And the sooner, the better.
With this possibility we have repeatedly met with all Czech mobile operators.
With some of them we have been able to move forward in the meetings,” said group spokesman Pavel Kaidl.
Then maybe better times will shine.
It seems that, according to unofficial information, the first official operator would probably have to arrive by the end of the year.
But for now his appearance is accompanied by an impenetrable wall of silence.
“At the moment we believe that the situation is ideal for the emergence of a virtual operator in the Czech market.
The Czech market compared to others is a very specific market.
So far no one has addressed us with any complex and serious project in this area," Vlastimil Sr<0xC5><0xA1>e<0xC5><0x88>, spokesperson for Telef<0xC3><0xB3>nica O2, told mobil.cz.
Other operators refer to the specificity of the Czech market.
T-mobile spokeswoman Martina Kemrov<0xC3><0xA1>, in exceptional accordance with the opinion of O2, adds: "To date we have not registered any viable commercial projects that, bilaterally beneficial, can continue to develop."
“On the T-Mobile network, it will be difficult to find a virtual operator until the end of the year.
At this point we should already have on the table some concrete contract that could be studied in such a short period of time."
Vodafone focuses its attention on meeting the requirements of a 3G license.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> adds: “We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, and this in terms of spending and infrastructure.
We consider this to be the greatest contribution from the point of view of customers.
Vodafone’s main strategy in this field lies in the partner with whom to establish a shared network for a fast internet on mobile.”
Responsible offices - with nail and meat operators
The progress of mobile operators can be easily understood, but the entry of another operator would mean increased competition, which would lead to a drop in prices and thus a drop in profits.
So why facilitate entry to the competition?
When the operators want to get something, they are able to pull from the same rope, proof of this is the grip when U:phone emerged.
Perhaps the greatest pressure on the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> was at the time of the entry of U:fon by the T-Mobile society.
This is confirmed by the public information available on the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> websites.
But right now U:fon serves as an argument why not accept a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrov<0xC3><0xA1> adds: “Furthermore, not too long ago the competitive environment in the mobile market was open to a fourth operator.
With regard to the nature of the mobile telephony market in the Czech Republic, it is natural that the entry of another player into the market would entail great requirements for him and, above all, for his services.
That is why this access to mobile operators is tremendously discouraging due to the absolute disinterest of the Czech regulatory body.
It is not just the position of the <0xC4><0x8C>TU, which unfortunately has no competence to intervene in commercial tenders, unlike Britain and other developed countries.
This is purely owned by the Office for the Protection of Commercial Tenders (UOHS).
However, it expressed its typical stance on this issue.
“The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile telephony market would be possible after an agreement on the rental of the necessary infrastructure between a mobile telephony operator and a virtual operator was concluded.
To date, no agreement has been concluded as the offer of the potential stakeholders was not interesting enough for the classical operators," added Kristi<0xC3><0xA1>n Chalupa, from the Department of Foreign Relations of the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS.
These statements do not surprise the representatives of the operators.
For the offices that must represent the interests of consumers, this is more than a consideration, and they must observe that no one takes advantage of their position in the market.
Especially when Kristi<0xC3><0xA1>n Chalupa adds: "Overseas where virtual operators operate normally, we can observe that their entry into the market contributed to the fall in prices of mobile telephony services"
Of course, the pressure on the proper functioning of the market means and the fall in prices do not fall within the interest of OHSU.
The really dramatic shock in all of this is in the dissonant reactions that result from the three mobile operators.
The question of whether it is really a coincidence is offered on its own.
It is the same as with the price of gasoline at gas stations because it is clear that it is the work of chance and a hard fight for competition.
“The Office has not found any signs of unfair competition in this regard and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the operators has a dominant position, therefore they do not have a corresponding rise in accountability in their market performance.
The tools needed to open the mobile telephony market to virtual operators, rather, are missing, as well as telecom regulators," Chalupa added to his response.
The interpretation of the dominant position in the market is one of the many conflicting points.
There is, of course, an analysis of relevant markets drawn up by the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>, according to which telecommunications are from the point of view of commercial tendering a single market.
In this type of market, of course, none of the Czech traders has a dominant position.
However, some of the legal experts offer a different view - for a virtual operator to emerge it is always necessary to agree with the network administrator.
And the mobile operator - with all its logic - has the monopoly of its network.
Therefore, in a particular segment it must necessarily be dominant.
And if this argument is not accepted, at least for <0xC3><0x9A>OHS it should be a warning that three mobile operators are strikingly ascending similarly.
Current complaints from stakeholders (including GTS Novera) show that many similar obstacles are encountered in all negotiations with operators.
Carrying responsibility in the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> is a fairly common trick in the field of telecommunications of which the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS washes its hands in all this matter.
We have met with him already in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, a new amendment to the telecommunications law was recently tabled to extend the competence of the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> in the field of commercial tenders that was not implemented, even though a number of specialists promised that the situation would improve.
The representatives of <0xC3><0x9A>OHS must know this perfectly, but it is clear that their interests are elsewhere.
Everything's fine, when no one's looking
At the same time, something like a pseudo-virtual operator that already exists in Czech mobile networks remains unnoticed.
They are companies that put their own prices on mobile telephony services that, however, only a part are public.
These are usually companies that are engaged in multi-level marketing.
Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others offer their own mobile phone services.
Usually only a select few get the price list of these companies.
The magic is that the company, with respect to the operator, acts as a classic business customer of the same ordering a large amount of SIM cards.
As a special customer you will then receive special prices and other offers.
The problem is that commercial conditions in all Czech mobile operators prohibit such resales.
“If cases such as those mentioned could be discovered we could talk about a breach of the contract conditions that could translate into the end of the collaboration with the given society,” Martina Kemrov<0xC3><0xA1> replied to the question about this problem.
But it is quite unlikely that such activity carried out by mobile operators would reach responsible people.
Precisely in the case of the three companies mentioned, it can be thousands of customers.
None of the operators are against this procedure.
With the activities of these companies they make nothing less than negligible profits and, at the same time - unlike the real virtual operators - in no way threaten their own official marketing.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> warns us of the possible problems: "The law allows such speculation, however, the services of this company are used only by a negligible as a percentage of customers.
They must also accept that their phone’s SIM card is not in their name, so they can’t absolutely dispose of it as a normal operator’s customer.”
This is exactly what it should look like to the <0xC4><0x8C>TU at least strange.
There is also a new question for <0xC3><0x9A>OHS.
If it is the mobile operators that surround the eyes in this type of procedure, why do they block the entry of the virtual operator?
It is necessary to add that the UOHS has sufficient competence to discover this type of activity and if it is not going to want to be satisfied with the explanations of the operators that they have no idea of this story and that their trading conditions do not allow it.
When will we cease to be the most expensive
As was already clear in the text, the entry of the virtual operator into the mobile phone market brought a significant drop in prices of services.
At the same time, in virtually every country where the virtual operator emerged, the classic operators tried more or less to protect themselves from this eruption.
The arguments used by these were virtually all identical – too small, a market, eventually, too saturated, problems with quality of service, etc.
In the more advanced countries, however, regulators have intervened at this time and in none of the cases defended the operators but their customers.
Whether with formal measures or informal pressure they managed to make the first virtual operator appear and with it began to appear more.
Unfortunately, the Czech Regulatory Authority all this case passes as if it were a burning nail.
From our experience we cannot help but be impressed that the confusion of the attributes in these cases suits them.
But we will not despair.
If this information is right behind the scenes and the virtual operator actually gets to these lands, then the Czech mobile market is likely to start moving again.
If any of the carriers let in any virtual mobile operator it will be difficult for <0xC3><0x9A>OHS to remain indifferent to the rejection (discrimination) of other interested parties.
And maybe we will stop calling more expensive than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four presentations of the new version of the official Czech anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek on the occasion of the day of the Czech official celebrations presented the new official recording of the anthem D<0xC3><0xB3>de, my home.
The new anthem was recorded by the National Theatre Orchestra under the direction of Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> B<0xC4><0x9B>lohl<0xC3><0xA1>vek.
There are four versions available - two versions that are Solos, one male voice and one female voice, one with choir and another instrumental.
The canto was commissioned by Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina P<0xC4><0x9B><0xC4><0x99><0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD>nkov<0xC3><0xA1> and Adam Plachetka.
The authors of the arrangements of the hymn are Otakar Jeremiah and Jaroslav Kr<0xC4><0x8D>ek.
On the iHNed.cz server you can listen to all four versions.
B<0xC4><0x9B>lohl<0xC3><0xA1>vek considers this Czech national anthem as one of the most beautiful anthems.
Czech Radio said earlier that it deliberately chose for solo singers with representatively young voices that are more expressive and popular.
“From the beginning I have tried with the two and then, too, with the chorus to fix themselves on the dictation so that the text was well understood, so that it would be consonant,” he said.
The official Czech anthem celebrates its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Where, My Home first sounded in the year 1834 on the tables of the Theatre of the States in the original Czech play Fidlova<0xC4><0x8D>ka by Josef Kajet<0xC3><0xA1>n Tyl and arranged with the music of Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek <0xC5><0xA0>kroup.
It gained popularity and people made it theirs.
The first stanza of the song after the emergence of Czechoslovakia in 1918 became, naturally, a part of the official anthem.
One of the seven official symbols remained even after the emergence of the independent Czech Republic.
How does the “new” hymn sound?
The Prague MHD takes us on Wednesday for the first time with the chip
On Wednesday, October 1, 2008, the date on which the first passengers enter the metro, tram and bus with an electronic voucher in their pockets instead of a paper ticket is written in the history of the Prague Transport Company.
This can now be purchased by almost one hundred thousand people who own the Opencard chip card.
Passengers can purchase the 30-day, 90-day and annual voucher (this will be valid as of January 1, 2009) and simultaneously load it onto their chip card at the transport company’s information centres and stations at the Metro, Muzeum, M<0xC5><0xAF>stek, N<0xC3><0xA1>dra<0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD> Hole<0xC5><0xA1>ovice, And<0xC4><0x9B>l, Lezty, and Lu<0xC5><0xBE>ty.
The bonuses can be purchased from yesterday on the Internet on the pages of the transport company, www.dpp.cz.
The service, until late in the afternoon, was used by more than four hundred people.
Those who start using the internet as a form of commerce, can definitely start to forget about ticketing stations at metro stations, where until now they had to regularly queue up to get a normal ticket.
The voucher is purchased online, and the Opencard card will be charged to you at one of the thirteen branches of the Municipal Library.
“In these places there is a window with prepared staff that helps those interested with online purchases and also with reloading the voucher purchased on their card,” said project spokesman Martin Opatrn<0xC3><0xBD>.
In addition to the library, it will also be possible to recharge the electronic voucher on the Opencard on the vending machines located in some of the subway’s lobby.
What are these vending machines?
They are red, they remind us of a ticket picker and travelers will probably have already fixed on them at the subway stations of Roztyly, Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovick<0xC3><0xA1>, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavsk<0xC3><0xA1>.
"There are now five in the city but by the end of the year there would have to be eighty," Opatrn<0xC3><0xBD> added.
The bonus is controlled by the machine instead of the driver
The use of the machine, which will start to work tomorrow, is simple.
Simply enter the Opencard chip card on it and the previously paid bonus will only be charged on it.
Electronic bonds from tomorrow are valid not only in the capital but also in its surroundings.
That is, on the circumference trains and bus lines from the numbers 300 to 499 mainly used by the inhabitants of the towns of central Bohemia.
“On the trains attached to the integrated transport of Prague there are reviewers equipped with a reader card that will help confirm the validity of the time and the zone of the bond,” explained the ticket control, Filip Dr<0xC3><0xA1>pal of the organization Ropid that sets the schedules of the collective transport of Prague.
Circulation buses have their reader cards mounted in the driver's locker.
When entering it is necessary not only to show the card to the driver but also to accompany it with the Opencard at the place intended for it on the side of the Box.
With this, the driver controls the validity of the voucher.
"If the passenger needs to verify the validity of the bonds, there is nothing easier than asking the driver for this information," Dr<0xC3><0xA1>pal said.
Passengers who do not travel on the circumference buses and do not remember when the voucher expires can go to the vending machines where the cards are recharged.
Here, on the machine screen, you will be shown information about the validity of your document.
The South East wants to be part of the U.S. in a referendum
The German Sudeten asked in 1945 for Fumaba to be part of the United States.
This is what is extracted from the letter that is stored in the collection of the Scientific Library of South Bohemia.
If we can’t be part of Germany or Austria, we want to at least live under the patronage of the United States of America.
With this wish, presumably, some groups of Germans from the Sudetenland addressed the US president in 1945.
It is the result of the letters that are stored in a particular archive and that are today stored in the collection of the Scientific Library of South Bohemia.
<0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xBD> Krumlov’s Germans are asking in a letter to the US president not to allow the return of the “Land of <0xC5><0xA0>umava” – occupied by Hitler under the Munich Pact – to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation correctly and we really want your word that American units are coming to German lands not as oppressors or enemies but as liberators," the letter reads, signed with "the people who carry the fate of <0xC5><0xA0>umava in their hearts."
Given that the union of Czechoslovakia with the south-east Germans presumably presupposes - according to these Czech national character - a hope only in brutality, disregard, misunderstanding, pressure and slavery, the authors call in the letter to the American president who assumes for today and forever <0xC5><0xA0>umava under a protectorate.
“We cannot believe that without considering the opinion of four million inhabitants, it gives us a foreign state that oppresses and rejects minorities and that cooperates at all with the victory of the Allies,” the letter reads.
The reason why the authors cannot sign is presumably the fear of retaliation from the “Czech oppressors.”
If the U.S. president presumably doubts this idea of the Germans, it would suffice to organize a referendum on whether their inhabitants want to be part of the U.S. or live under their patronage.
Although the text of the letter, with the current knowledge we have of post-war history, may sound a bit childish, according to some specialists, it closely paints the expectations of the Germans of the south-east then.
Although the Czech Germans had to at least intuit that it was going to be discussed about their expulsion from the republic only a few admitted this possibility.
Some hoped that the United States and Britain would negotiate some clear form of autonomy for the Sudetenland.
Others believed that they would stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is confirmed by Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice.
He was in the war, as a German of Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice, entrenched in the Baltic navy.
When at the end of the war he was captured by the British and placed in the Holstein prison camp dozens of Germans went to him to teach them Czech.
"They believed that when they came home, the Czech would welcome them," Chalupa said.
None of the German prisoners who lived before the war in Czechoslovakia, according to him, expected to be removed from the Republic on the basis of the Decrees of Benefits.
Don't think - you pay!
Emotional Campaign Attacks Drivers
The most expensive action in Czech history aimed at road safety.
This could characterize the emotional campaign that the Ministry of Transport decided to launch on Wednesday in the media.
The minister’s office, Ale<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0x98>eb<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek, promises to deter drivers from dangerous conduct at the wheel.
The 150 million campaign will be felt on television, radio, cinema, the Internet and in brochures.
It would have to deter the driver from high-speed and alcohol driving.
And also to remind them that before they start, they tie the belts.
He wants to reach the awareness of young drivers, drivers, pedestrians and, last but not least, professional drivers.
And what can we see in the ads?
Basically human stories that imbue emotions.
And for this we witness the "blood-blooded" ads throughout the campaign:
Don't think - you pay!
The word "don't think" is written in capital letters on the registration plate.
And in a blood vessel is the word "pays".
This should symbolize that the man in a moment of desperation can come to pay with his own life.
The ads are going to "fear" viewers until 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by the campaign in Anglo-Saxon lands where strong images of accident victims can be seen.
It promises that this will reduce accidents and the number of deaths on Czech roads.
The announcements have been made by the Euro RSCG agency.
Sugar and lettuce for drivers
"For drivers it is worth the sugar and lattice system.
Sugar is for him when, for example, a traffic light is passed in red and thus saves time.
The whip is a threat of a fine or an accident.
Drivers should be reminded of the risks,” says Na Homolce hospital transport psychologist Martin Ko<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xA1>n.
And that is why an information campaign in the press and mainly negative advertising is needed, the psychologist says.
Less effective, for him, are the panels that warn the driver of dangers.
“If there is any panel installed warning of any danger it will likely soon merge with the environment and the driver will not pay more attention to it,” Ko<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xA1>n warned.
Olmert would return almost all occupied areas in exchange for peace
The president of Israel’s provisional government, Ehud Olmert, spoke out on the restitution of virtually all occupied lands in 1967, namely the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with Palestine and Syria.
He suggested in the interview that Monday appeared in the newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth.
“We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means we will necessarily have to return almost all of the (occupated) land if not all of it,” Olmert told the newspaper.
“Of course we will keep a few percent of these lands, but we will have to give the Palestinians a similar percent [of the land of Israel] because without this there will be no peace,” he added.
He admitted that in the event of restitution, East Jerusalem would also be included.
“Whoever wants security in Jerusalem and therefore does not want tractors or excavators to pass over his legs as one of my best friends did, then he will have to hand over a part of Jerusalem,” Olmert said in reference to the two July attacks in the city where several deaths and dozens of people were injured.
According to the president, it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Temple Hill, a sacred and historic place" that is located inside the old city.
“Whoever wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty throughout the city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This will not work,” he later insisted.
Retreat of the Golan Heights
Olmert also spoke out for Israel’s withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which in his view is an inherent condition for concluding a peace agreement with Syria.
But this would also involve concrete efforts on the part of Damascus.
“I do not propose to close peace with Syria solely on the basis of the withdrawal of the Golan Heights,” he warned.
“The Syrians know very well what they will have to disengage from to win the Golan.
They will have to abandon their current relations with Iran, they will have to abandon their relations with Hezbollah, they will have to break away from the permanent support that provokes terrorism from Hamas, Al Qaeda (the terrorist network) and Jihad (the Holy War) in Iraq.”
Questions after the accident: Are the maids on the buses illegal?
The law is unknown, you can't walk on a long-distance bus
In connection with the tragic bus accident of the Student Agency company near the Italian city of Padua, the question arises whether the hostesses and passengers can move by the bus during the trip.
“If we want to strictly and formally comply with the law, the stewardess’ activity is opposed to the road traffic law,” said Transport Ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka.
The accident in which the twenty-two-year-old hostess died last week was obviously caused by the truck driver only that the bus crossed the road.
The girl, unfortunately, was sitting next to the driver in the less secure place of the vehicle despite having two other sites reserved.
However, the bus may have an accident or brake suddenly, and at the exact moment the host distributes the coffee or the newspapers.
Here what plays the role is if the bus is equipped, according to the technical permit, with walking places.
If the bus is not approved, the passenger must sit.
The long-distance buses of Student Agency have no places to go on foot, which the company's director, Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, confirmed to Aktu<0xC3><0xA1>ln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz.
"We have solved this with the ministry and, in principle, the movement of passengers is not allowed.
“Finally this was removed and we reached an agreement that passengers can go to the toilet while the bus is running if they have a seat,” he said.
The owner does not know the law.
“There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of the mistress – no legal provision clarifies this function.
Not even any legal provision prohibits transport agents from performing any service.
The road transport law only knows the term Vehicle Reviewer, whose rights and obligations are not defined,” Hanzelka said.
Josef Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD>, director of the Department of Road Traffic of the Ministry of Transport, believes that the law adequately addresses this problem.
“It depends on whether the bus has the approval allowed to have walking sites.
That's all," he says.
Buses are divided between urban, where there are places to stand and limited maximum speed, inter-urbans with places to stand with a higher speed permit and long distances without places to stand, with the highest speed permit and seats equipped with seat belts.
Just like on the plane, the expert says.
BESIP’s Transport Safety expert, Jaroslav Hor<0xC3><0xAD>n, sees no major problems with the driver’s movement on the bus.
“During the development of the journey there is not much threat of danger, the situation can be compared to the service on airplanes.
Not even here is there the certainty that turbulence will come and the hostess can be hit in the head."
“However, if the bus suddenly stops, it is obvious that the physical laws are valid.
The same as in an urban bus or on the tram.
The safety of the hostess must solve it by the internal regulations of the carrier," he says, and also thinks that from the point of view of the law this problem is unresolved.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura is ready to cancel this service
Student Agency is the only carrier that offers the service of hostesses.
It employs two hundred in it.
The director, even after the accident, considers that work risky.
“However, the moment I have the impression that the post of steward is risky, then I will remove it.
Coffee and newspapers can receive it, passengers, upon entering.
It would save even costs,” he says.
In the interest of safety is the reason why Asiana lacks stewards in its vehicles, according to Alexej Litvin, who runs a small line compared to SA.
“We don’t have bosses, we’ve been against them from the beginning.
Sooner or later this will end in a fatal accident," he told T<0xC3><0xBD>den.cz less than a year ago.
There was a huge tragedy
In the accident of the line connecting Naples died a young stewardess from Pilsen who had worked for the company for two years.
A Slovenian truck that probably turned from the parking lane blocking the passage to the bus without using the intermittent lights.
His driver tried to avoid it in a quick maneuver, however, he collided with the right front.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura denies that the two sites that are reserved for the hostess' rest were sold.
“These sites cannot be reserved for long-distance connections, they are blocked.”
The company intends to sue the truck driver.
The agency will not wait for the verdict on the girl's family's compensation but expects financial expenses also on the part of the culprit.
Reform of the law?
No, for now.
The reform of the law could bring more precision about the move of the hostess on the bus in which for a year 30 expert members of a group of the Ministry of Transport have been working.
"However, they have not come to any concrete conclusion.
They are not too dedicated to buses, but rather to the point system, maximum speed on the highway and the use of the mobile during the ride,” says expert Hor<0xC3><0xAD>n.
“The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of the hostesses to be something that seriously threatens the safety of passengers,” said spokesman Hanzelka, who concluded that the control of safety on buses is the responsibility of the police and the Office of Safety at Work.
Dusseldorf's hope is backed up in Frankfurt
In the letter of the board of directors of West LB to its collaborators there is no shortage of great words.
The merger of the Dusseldorf bank’s units with the DEKA bank can form “a central capital market of the Sparkasse financial group,” as the letter says, published on Monday.
The West LB bank, breaking the 'competition block' with sustainable profitability would enter such a business.
In addition, such a merger can be a start for subsequent mergers in the field of regional banks.
This is how you come to understand the text, when a board of directors wants to show ability to act in hard times.
Because like before, the West LB is under enormous pressure.
Not only on the part of the European Union, but also on the Federal Institute for the Surveillance of Financial Services which has recently made it clear to the government of North Rhine-Westphalia that there is little time left to find a solution.
For a long time, also on the part of Frankfurt, much has been said about the union of this type between DEKA bank, which Sparkasse customers know for its investment funds, and West LB.
Frankly speaking, Franz Waas, the head of the bank DEKA, presenting the data after half a year at the end of August, said he sees no sense in the merger of the bank, located on Mainzer Straße, with a regional bank such as Helaba or West LB.
But the DEKA board of directors, which is now composed of regional banks and Sparkassen associations, commissioned the board of directors to start negotiations with West LB on common business activities.
This could be a business in the capital market or parts of it.
Of course, negotiations have just begun, as they say on the financial site.
It is not the first time when it comes to consolidation in the area of Sparkasse the name of the bank DEKA that with its 3,000 employees is among the most important entrepreneurs in the financial site Frankfurt.
In 2003 at one point the situation seemed so that the DEKA bank could merge with the regional bank of Rhineland-Palatinate and with the Helaba.
This initiative to create a union of three parties was unsuccessful.
As soon as the plans were made public, the Hesse government voiced opposition to Helaba's participation in this project.
The other two banks also did not find the same language.
Instead, the regional bank of Rhineland-Palatinate started the dialogue with the regional bank of Baden-Württemberg.
But it was always played out again with the idea of DEKA bank merger with other regional banks.
But finally Günther Merl, the chairman of Helaba’s board of directors, said he was against plans for coexistence with his bank.
Independent of that, it seems clearer that the union of the different banks in the field of public law is necessary.
When the Bavarian parliamentary elections take place, the union of the BayernLB with the regional bank of Baden-Württemberg could make progress.
For the Helaba that is not necessarily good news.
If the pressure continues to merge, Helaba will lack partners to do so.
In the south the bank could only be a young partner, although so far it stood out much better from the financial crisis than the real estate in Stuttgart and Munich did.
On the other hand, the Hesse-Turingian Sparkassen - und Giroverband, which owns 85 percent of the Helaba, at the beginning of the year avoided plans for coexistence with West LB.
In any case, only the Nord LB remains.
But such geostrategic reflections form are only one part.
On the other hand, it is about the compatibility of the different banking models.
In June, Merl asked a fundamental question about a business model that could guarantee the future for regional banks, to which the German Sparkassen- und Giro-Verband has so far given no answer.
In the end you can break down the West LB, but that, of course, is not the bank’s own wish.
Thus, also in the letter of the bank’s board of directors it is said that it would try to find a complete solution for the entire bank.
As you can combine the coexistence between singular parts of the bank with the DEKA, that’s going to show the time.
The second weekend of the Oktoberfest is known as “the weekend of the Italians”
For Elena it is the first time, for Luca it is the third or fourth time.
But this time, he attends Elena as his girlfriend, and that's why everything seems different, he says.
Behind them, next to a 5-liter barrel of Kaiser-branded beer is built a huge bear tiger showing nearly 200 Oktoberfest participants who know how to produce bass sounds in their throats.
First Elena gives Luca a handcuff, then a kiss.
From Bologna they arrived in Verona.
From there, from the car park next to the Porta Nuova train station, tonight at 23:45 three buses depart, <0x60> direction Munich, the party of the beer', expected to arrive at 6:30 in the morning.
Three buses are planned mainly for Italians, one bus is only for Brazilians.
In one of the corners of the parking lot next to their flag are singing the South Americans, they had already started celebrating at night.
With a lot of noise, says Marco Guarda, which is nothing for Italians.
Marco, who wears a long coat with an artificial leather lining and glasses with silver-coloured pads, owns these buses.
For five years they have come to the Oktoberfest, considering that only this year there are three excursions.
At night on the road there, during the day in the meadow, at 10.30 the turn.
Spending the night there means only unnecessary expenses, Marco says.
The trip costs 75 euros, including the welcome reception with a Kaiser beer that was made according to the Bavarian law of purity, health insurance and guide in German- Marco attended a language course in Frankfurt.
At night buses are already on the road on the highway with the direction "Brennero"
No beer, not yet.
Quickly the tranquility reigns on the bus, travelers are sleeping.
All right, they'll still need the forces.
It goes to Brixen and Holzkirchen, where other buses with the Italian registration make another stop on Highway 8 just before Munich.
Finally, when Marco’s group has scheduled arrival at 6.30 a.m. in the parking lot next to the Prado de Teresa, there are already about 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others meet, Marco has his last speech on how to proceed.
First, put on a yellow cap.
There, on the left side is written "Oktoberfest", next to the Gothic letter is the page of Marco's travel office on the internet: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Second: “When the doors of the tent of the campaign are opened, that means marching!”, Marco shouts in the morning.
"March!" March and occupy the back sites in the campaign tent.
“Don’t take the seats in front, because we’re going to block, and everyone with yellow hats doesn’t sit on the same bench, spread over the whole space!”
A litre of beer, Marco rye, costs 8.25 euros.
Don't forget the tip
Show the security people that we have a good tone!
As soon as he gets out of his place, he'll be busy!"
Third: "Tonight at exactly 10:30 you have to get here!" Do you understand?
And now everyone's going to the Oktoberfest.
One, to mark the way, binds the yellow hats on the trees, traffic signs and even on a poster of the elections of a great Bavarian People's Party.
I wish I could recognize the way back.
It is the second weekend of the Oktoberfest which is known as "the weekend of the Italians"
There is no exact data on the number of people; it is 50,000 people who make the trip over the Alps and stormily enter the tents, 10 percent of all came especially this weekend from Italy.
The Munich police receive help from seven police officers from the Autonomous Province of Bolzano, Italian volunteers help the Red Cross of Bavaria that makes a statistic of the present nations, where the Italians, with more than 200 medical assistance, in front of the English (about 60 assists) and the Austrians occupy the first place.
The favorite tent of the Italians is so called Hofbräuzelt.
Sleepless nights for Hypo Real Estate creditors
Germany’s banking system is relatively stable, Federal Finance Minister Peter Steinbrück said last week.
It is good that the politician used the word “relatively” and added that the German banking sector will also be affected by critical trends.
And that happened after the weekend.
Hypo Real Estate (HRE), the Munich real estate financier, which is listed on the DAX index, receives a billion-dollar loan from a consortium of German banks to be able to withstand market turbulence.
On Monday, a person who knows the situation well told Reuters that credit aid amounted to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>35 billion.
The share of the capital that the Hypo Real Estate is going to use has to throw interest.
The money comes from both private and public-law banks.
The cause of this is the losses of the Deffa subsidiary.
According to a report, state financiers with the money that was borrowed for long-term projects financed them only for a short period—which now, due to market mistrust, is no longer possible.
In the first half of the year the bank’s capital reserve in cash has fallen by 95 percent, <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.37 million, also the share of equity delayed slightly from 1.6 percent to 1.45 percent.
Compared to the same period last year, continuous financial investment revenues and net profits from financial operations fell to zero, debt incursions and some securities also tended to fall by more than 70 percent, by 5 million euros.
Only thanks to the high and high revenues of the reimbursement of the compensation expenses of the restructuring of the former Deffa group as well as the reimbursement of interest under the federal tax code and the organized business for the consortium companies, the negative balance could blame a deficit of approximately 16 percent more.
After its privatization in 1990, the former state financer was initially lost in speculation with industrial loans for real estate, which served as the reason for the founding of the Aareal bank.
As much money could not be made through the financing of state projects, the Defa began to devote intensively to projects in the field of infrastructure and financing of community projects by private and state investors (Private-Public-Partnership PPP) and diversified.
Now the Hypo Real Estate has to make amortizations on the value of the subsidiary that will have an "essential material effect" on the consolidated loss and profit account of the group, it is said very inaccurately.
It is a fact that dividends have been cancelled.
By 2007, they were canceled to two-thirds.
Following the acquisition of Deffa, Hypo Real Estate became an important state and financial financial institution in the field of infrastructure.
Since the bank does not have client deposits, it, compared to other banks, is more dependent on refinancing in the interbank market.
With the bankruptcy of the U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers, which happened two weeks ago, the granting of interbank loans declined essentially because the banks were saving their liquidity.
Each year the Hypo Real Estate needs nearly 50 billion euros to finance a portion of the Defa’s credit portfolios of its short-term refinancing measures.
According to the Hypo Real Estate report, the bank covers with a credit the need for group financing for a short time and the company is assured of “the influence of international monetary markets that are now essentially not fit to function.”
Other sources say that thanks to this money, refinancing is guaranteed until the end of 2009.
Georg Funke, chairman of the board of directors of Hypo Real Estate, explained that the Hypo Real Estate Group would not need the money markets for the foreseeable time.
The German central bank and the federal financial services supervisory institute (BaFin) are based on the assumption that the competitiveness of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now assured.
That’s what the bank’s shareholders and creditors have to expect.
But because of the dynamics and the impossibility of the crisis, there is no consistency.
It is even conceivable that you do not need funding in its entirety.
But the opposite case cannot be ruled out.
It was rumored that at the last hour of Sunday the bank was still almost insolvency, so temporary salvation cannot at least reassure concerned people.
The share price fell to 75 percent, 3.30 euros.
Loan courses, on the contrary, are really good.
While priority debts almost do not change, borrowing rates according to the position in the property register clearly tend to go down.
The loans of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo are mainly affected and the loans whose maturity exceeds 2009 are rightly affected.
After the remarkable growth of the banking crisis and the acquisition of the Deffa that affected the Hypo Real Estate, the current value of its loans that were previously an investment for speculation has to be considered as dependent on the stability of the international financial system.
While issuing banks, governments, and banks that are little affected are still ready to support the system, in the meantime you can start from amortizing pensions within the future.
Or something is going to happen, which no one can imagine – the financial crisis is going to be over in the next 15 months.
But seeing the cross-news about partial stating, now the security that is already at its limit has become a justified hope.
That’s going to be a reason, because creditors will spend the nights without sleep, breaking their heads over the decision about their isolation from enthusiasm.
Still, short-term investors can put the end to and use the new account transportation of losses for upcoming gain compensation tax payments on the change in the future.
Sylvana and the Secrets of Bent?-Box
When the first day Sylvana Hiltrop, a 16-year-old girl, had to show up at Tachibana Highschool the girls began to laugh: German is totally "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana knows the word of Mangas - in a report on the exchanges she tells Japan.
"The first day at a school in Japan.
I felt nervous.
Before I went to school, I was scared.
I live on the edge of Tokyo in the direction of Kawasaki and I go by train 40 minutes to Highschool Tachibana.
I just had to find my way, fortunately I didn’t get lost.
It seems that the beginning of classes is not set as strictly as in my home, in Lower Saxony.
At eight o’clock in the morning the students come, at nine o’clock at least twenty starts a small meeting with the teachers, the ‘home room’.
Before the class started, it was time for me to introduce myself.
I am also not a person who speaks with great pleasure in the public, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
As they still have the school uniform I put on an old skirt from the mother of my host family and also a blouse, blue socks and black leather shoes.
Well, dressed like that, I put myself on the pulpit and tried to pronounce everything correctly: "Sayonara Wo she Sylvana..." - my name is Sylvana, I am from Germany and in a week it will be my birthday.
At this point I was very happy because I had already started studying this language for two years.
All 31 girls in the class have spooned, laughed and made signs and all the time I have heard the word "kawaii"
I already knew her from my mangas.
That belongs to Japanese girls' survival vocabulary and means "sweet, cute"
Then I quickly slipped onto my site.
The girl next door had a big smile, for her it was an honor that the exchange girl had to sit next to her.
The rest of the class was pretty quiet, but when the gong sounded, I felt really under attack.
Everyone spoke at the same time, laughed and asked a lot of questions – at the same time it is very difficult to understand English from Japanese.
Then everyone in the playground took out their blessings.
The mother of my host family also made a Lanchbox for me - it's something other than boring pieces of German bread.
It had rice with herbs, small sausages, cucumber and algae salad, fruit and something like mass meat of tofu.
In most cases I have no idea what it is like here in Japan.
Things are rare and have a new taste.
What is certain is that everything is very rich.
Well, maybe with the exception of marinated plums in salt, buff!
In Japanese schools, bentos are not just a lunch.
Sometimes it happens that a girl prepares a blessing made in a very artistic way for a boy and gives him in the hope of being able to get to know him better during a recreation.
I read about it in my manga-comics.
I’m curious to see if I can see it here too.
“Why Japan?” my friends asked me when I told them I wanted to go to Tokyo to attend school for a year.
Then he always answered:
"Well, because it fascinates me."
For years now, I have been reading Mangas.
In order to better understand comics and culture, one day I began to study a little Japanese.
For me it was absolutely certain that one day I would travel there.
Also because I have a slim by tradition and customs.
Here they have great value.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends, on the other it is a strict, disciplined and traditional country.
As everything is well organized, I still didn’t feel lost here although Tokyo is the largest city I’ve ever seen in my life.”
Rats also have feelings.
It is said that a rat or cockroach feeling danger flees, why is it also afraid?
Joseph Le Doux, a scientist in the field of neurology, is convinced that many animals also have feelings.
How can it be controlled if they, acting in the same way as us, feel the same?
In an online magazine called "Edge" the contributions of famous scientists have been published for many years.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series the chosen answers to the question What do you think is true without being able to prove it?
I think animals have sensations and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else being able to prove it so far, although we can’t even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case we can at least expect it because all human brains have the same fundamental configuration.
But as soon as we dedicate ourselves to other species and include the questions about feeling and in general about consciousness, we enter the unknown realm because the hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, it does the same as the other animals: it becomes dead, flees or attacks.
People behave in a similar manner, from which some scientists draw conclusions about comparable subjective experience.
Of course I don't.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to infect our subjective experience with that of animals.
First, they almost always include the circuits associated with human consciousness of the lateral prefrontal lobe of the cerebral cortex (due to their participation in short memory and executive functions that direct behavior).
This broad part is much more developed in the case of humans than that of other primates and seems to be absolutely lacking in other creatures.
Considering at least the aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal lobe of the cerebral cortex, including knowledge about who we are and the ability to plan and decide, there is a reason to assume that even man is different from the other primates.
Another peculiarity is found in the linguistic nature of man: Since most of his experience is linked to language, often that means that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals can be excluded.
But even if consciousness did not depend on language, it would influence it in such a way that the consciousness of animals, created like any other, would in many cases differ from most of our states of consciousness.
That is why it is difficult to explain how the consciousness of other animals works.
If that, as something interesting and subjective, is not measured because it has the special hardware, nor is it analyzed through our experiences, then your research presents us with great problems.
Most of my interventions refer to the content of consensual experience, but at the same time there is also another aspect of consciousness that should be easier for scientific research.
Animal consciousness processes could be investigated without taking into account their contents, and that’s what happens during short memory studies of primates, especially in the example of visualization.
But with this approach followed by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, the essential thing goes more to the neutral correlations of consciousness than to the causal mechanisms: the two can be similar or not.
Interestingly, this approach highlights the importance of the prefrontal lobe of the cerebral cortex for visualization formation.
And what comes out of that for the sensations?
I owe it to the fact that in the emotional system a part of the brain that is responsible for that is activated, as is the case with fear.
What we describe as fear is therefore a state of mind in which we are when brain activity occupies a space in the defense system (or its consequences such as body reactions).
From this point of view, the sensations are very fixed apart from the cerebral cortex, which distinguishes primates and especially humans.
From the point of view of linguistic nature, classifications of fine sensations follow because we can differentiate and classify states with the help of words and grammar in order to be able to describe the states of others alongside ourselves.
For example, Antonio Damascus, on the contrary, thinks that the sensations derive from the simple activities of the parts of the cerebral cortex responsible for body feelings and the brain stem, the same Jaak Pankseep thinks, but focuses more on the brain stem.
Since this network has not changed much during human evolution, it can absolutely refer to different types and their sensations.
For theoretical reasons I can’t go against that, but I consider it unlikely.
Pakseep argues that what rats and men feel like fear, possibly that feels in two cases as well: But how can you control whether rats and men behave in the same way?
Seeing the danger a cockroach flees, why is it afraid?
I am of the opinion that the similarity of behavior does not yet prove the similarity of experience.
That’s true that the neural comparison helps: rats and men have similar brain stems, cockroaches on the contrary don’t have at least one brain.
Is it the brain stem that is responsible for sensations?
Even if it is possible to prove it for men: How can you prove it in the case of rats?
I think rats and other mammals, possibly also cockroaches (who knows?), have sensations.
But I don't know how you can prove it.
I prefer to investigate emotional behavior of rats than emotional sensations because their sensations are supposedly fundamentally different from us (because human consciousness refers to special circuits and language).
In any case, progress in the field of neurology is expected here as the same is measured in rats and men.
As I don’t investigate the language and consciousness of rats, as well as sensations, I don’t know if they exist.
It can be said that I don’t see beyond my nose, but I’d rather move forward than work permanently without results.
Well, I'm a practical emotionalist.
UEFA president Platini: grace period for Poland and Ukraine
Iwan Wasjunik, the deputy prime minister said the preparations would soon take place under the direct responsibility of the president and the prime minister.
"The government sees the decision of UEFA in Bordeaux as a proof of confidence in Ukraine's ability to organize the European Championship together with Poland," Wasjunik said.
“But that is not an amnesty for our country.
Now the work is about to begin and there is a lot to be done in both countries.”
The timetable for the construction and reconstruction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports in the host countries is tight.
Possibly the number of stadiums will be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste more time.
Now we have to do work with great speed," said the president of an association of Ukraine Grigory Surkis.
"Uefa is not going to take our eyes off us."
A more radical step was agreed in Poland.
After numerous scandals, the Polish Olympic Committee suspended the management of the Polish association PZPN and replaced it with the independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The committee met at the request of Sports Minister Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There is “a serious danger that the PZPN is not able to follow the rules,” Drzewiecki told Polish news agency PAP.
"In a letter we have assured UEFA President Platini that preparation for the 2012 European Championship will not suffer from that."
Only in the last season many clubs in the first division were condemned for manipulation down to the lower category, finally also the division board had to be postponed.
Counter-attack of Dennis Quaid outraged
She wanted to promote a new film, spoke in an interview about private life — and has problems with her ex-husband: Hollywood star Meg Ryan designated her ex-husband as an adulterer.
He gets angry and counterattacks.
The late war of the two roses on Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid's ex-partner: eight years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors publicly show an unpleasant fight between them.
Last week in an interview with InStyle magazine, Meg Ryan spoke for the first time about the reasons for the marriage failure: "Dennis was a long time unfaithful to me, and that was very painful."
She knew the size of her infidelity only after divorce.
The reason for revealing private things was Ryan's work with the press for his new film "The Women" - a story about the failure of a marriage is told.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his appointment as an unfaithful husband was clear: This is "unheard of how many times Meg tells the story of our relationship in another version," the 54-year-old told the New York Daily News.
Among other things, it is very "unfortunate" that Jack, his 16-year-old son, will again "remember in public the pain and the changes, all that means a divorce for a child."
While Ryan lives alone after divorce, Quaid is remarried and recently is twin pope.
And so he ends with his statements highlighting: “As long as my life goes on.
I feel happy because I have a wonderful family that’s okay.”
Airline and hotel ticket prices are falling
In the first half of 2008, air tickets and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper compared to last year.
According to a current study, air tickets in Germany became cheap even up to 50 percent.
Air tickets and hotel stays were again made cheap - this is the result of a study by American Express' travel and financial services provider.
The company has analyzed its booking data for the first half of 2008 and after the price increase in the first quarter it found a major change in the second half.
After prices in the hotel market continued to rise for many years, overnight stays at many sites became cheap.
Compared to last year, prices in 41 of the 48 different cities in Europe rose by an average of 6.9 percent between January and March.
From April to June, prices have already fallen to 3.6 percent compared to last year.
Trends were more noticeable in Paris and Rome, where travelers had to pay less than the previous year.
According to American Express, the reason for that was the weakened dollar exchange rate, which was the reason that “American tourists’ interests in travel decreased.”
The decline in hotel prices is also noticeable much more in financial centres such as Frankfurt or London than in industrial concentration points such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, hotel prices rose to 26.3 percent and so break a record in Europe.
In the first quarter, airfare prices also showed upward trends:
Due to rising prices for kerosene, Economy class travelers had to pay an average of 7.1 percent more than in 2007, long-haul flights even became more expensive up to 29.2 percent.
From April to June, prices for Economy-class airline tickets, compared to the previous quarter, fell by an average of 12.5 percent, but the price changes for the Businessclass and Firstclass were small.
In Germany the price change was more noticeable than in other European countries:
From January to February prices rose to 11.9, in the second half they fell to 23.6 percent.
According to a study, prices for domestic flights in Germany even fell by half.
The reason for the price change is on the one hand the rise of the loose economy, the company explains.
In many parts of the air travel market, demand is falling.
On the other hand, there is great competition for the Open-Skies treaty that liberalizes air traffic between the US and Europe.
The signal of the tense situation is the cancellation of non-profit long-haul flights on airlines, as well as a large number of airlines that in the first half of 2008 declared bankruptcy - only in Europe there were 24 airlines.
HSV wins against Gladbach 1:0
With a goal and simple methods, the Hamburg SV becomes the leader.
Luhukay from Borussia to him still does not go out to make the tenth goal.
Kristoffer Klein presented very well the forced landing of national team player Marko Martin.
The Gladbach player started playing late and failed by scoring a goal.
Everything he meant by reacting exactly to what had happened, he could clearly read it from his lips.
I just knew he was right.
"We need a second goal," whispered Hermann Rieger at the entrance to the Hamburg stadium.
Nothing special happened in the catacombs, the rest time was over and most of the present were back in their places.
Rieger was almost for three decades a physiotherapist of the HSV, enjoys a very great reputation as one of those who formed a part of the group.
That is why his request was noticed by a responsible person.
Cornelius Jol the assistant coach nodded his head and lifted his fingers as a sign of assent.
Cornelius is the brother of Martin Jol, the head coach of Hamburg.
His order was the same: Wow, the second goal!
But that was not realized.
"Today not everything was nice to see," Marcell Jansen later added.
Also Bastian Reinhard had wished he had "more relaxed".
The result 1:0 (1:0) Hamburg has to thank Mladen Petric (11) for his head impact; and also to the situation that the very weak Gladbach team could not show all their strength to the weak Hamburg team.
“That was a dirty victory,” Martin Jol said, summarizing.
This Monday the SV Hamburg will turn 121 years old.
On Saturday, the spectators had already celebrated themselves, the blue sky over the stadium and the change of table on the video screen.
It's going to be a birthday without a real party.
“We know how to interpret it,” said Marcell Jansen.
He predicts that the partial ratings in the table correspond more to the league's sleekness than to the dominance of his HSV.
The quipo with its players forced late as the Brazilians Neves and Silva, the goalkeeper Petric as well as Jansen who was removed from FC Bayern need time to join, but still the quipo cannot shine with his successes.
“We need more of feeling and dribbling,” Jol demands.
After the defeat of the vote
In Wall Street, fear spreads.
The first news of the failure of the bank bailout dropped the Down Jones to 700 points for a certain period.
That was the biggest loss of points for a day in his history.
Then the Dow Jones recovered a bit.
At 20:30 one of the world’s largest stock market barometers quoted a 5 percent deficit at 10,579 units.
The Nasdaq, the electronic stock market, lost more than seven percent and stood at 1548 points.
At this time the biggest loser on the Dow Jones were American Express who lost almost 14 percent and the Bank of America with a loss of almost 12 percent.
No title could win in value.
The shares of Goldmann Sachs bank lost almost 10 percent.
Just a few days ago, a great investor Warren Buffet had participated financially in the company.
The bailout plan envisages making available resources to buy so-called “potty” mortgage shares.
But the sum will be paid by strike or step by step.
As compensation for that, the state has to receive stock option receipts for financial partnerships that during course development can be charged to reduce the financial burden of the state’s cash.
Stock prices in Europe and the U.S. continue to decline
The billion-dollar aid to banks in Europe and the U.S. does not reassure investors.
The stock price of the large German Hypo Real Estate bank is low and negatively affects the Dax.
Despite the saving of the financial market projected by the state, the U.S. Dow Jones index continues to fall.
The losses of the speculated shares of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank caused the fall of the German index (Dax) in a large deficit.
Despite bailout actions by the federal government and private banks, the Munich real estate financier’s stock lost two-thirds of its value over a period of time, the Comerzbank lost more than 20 percent.
The Dax fell clearly below the psychological limit of 6,000 points and cited a 3.7 percent deficit at 5,839 units.
All over the world, financial markets have fallen.
The opening of Wall Street Day in New York began with notable losses.
Investors fear that the US government’s $700 billion bailout package won’t be enough to boost financial markets.
In the first hour after the opening, the Dow lost 334 points or 3.3 percent to 10,809.25 points.
The U.S. House of Representatives wanted to vote on the draft salvation, the Senate vote may be on October 1.
Also the other European balls knew only one trend: at first the FTSE index in London lost 3.2 percent, the CAC 40 in Paris lost 2.9 percent.
In Asia, the main Japanese Nikkei index after profits fell to 1.26 percent in 11,743.61 units.
In Hong Kong, the Hang-Seng index fell to 2.1 percent to 18,286.90 points.
In India, the main Sensex index lost 506.43 points or 3.9 percent and closed at 12,595.75 units.
After the announcement of the capital increase, Arcandor’s shares lost on the MDax.
Private bank Sal. Oppenheim subscribed 23 million new shares.
In addition, the commercial and tourism consortium announced that the shares in the company Thoms Cook will not be sold.
Dark matter influences the trajectory of space probes
For many years a mysterious phenomenon has caused confusion for researchers: Dark Matter influences the speed of space probes during so-called gravitational assistance to maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein’s Theory of Relativity may not be so correct.
The spacecraft "Ulysses" spent almost 18 years flying in the universe.
Because the fuel pipes are helminating now threatens to die in the cold.
For years a mysterious phenomenon, the anomaly during gravitational assistance to maneuver, has caused confusion among researchers.
Gravitational assistance is a maneuver of the trajectory of space probes during which they obtain acceleration using the energy of the gravitational field of a planet, for example from Earth.
This allows space probes to save fuel.
Cassini-Huygens, the European-American spacecraft used this physical trick as did the Sun Ulysses probe.
But what surprises researchers for many years: Missiles don’t behave 100 percent as expected under the venerable law of gravity.
There are frequent irregularities in speed.
All of a sudden the probes have higher or lower speeds.
Physicists have not been able to explain this effect so far.
They called it the anomaly during gravitational assistance to the maneuver.
Some experts fear that even Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity describing the attraction force of matter by the curvature of space may not be so correct.
Stephen Adler, an American physicist at Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study, solemnly believes now as before Einstein did not confuse and tries to explain the anomaly during gravitational assistance with the help of so-called Dark Matter, in what remained astronomers in the universe.
“The reason for the anomaly may be Dark Matter that may also be very close to Earth,” he writes.
Researchers in the universe have only known about the existence of Dark Matter for ten years.
It supposedly possesses attraction and its influence can be observed on other planets.
Dark Matter, on the contrary, is completely invisible which means it does not emit and does not reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially any visible light.
According to scientists, dark matter makes at least one-fifth of the total mass of the universe.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
As confirmed by Italy’s foreign minister, after spending ten days in the hands of kidnappers, tourists kidnapped in Egypt must be released.
Sudan’s kidnappers had demanded millions of bailouts.
Six kidnappers must be killed in a shooting during the release.
Five Germans have been kidnapped in southern Egypt.
The rescue negotiations have already begun.
The Germans always fall back into the spotlight of the kidnappers.
The newspaper WELT ONLINE tells about the most important cases.
Apparently, European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are released.
The same information is provided by state-owned Egyptian television, Al-Arabiya Arabic television station and the Italian media.
After news of the release on the Italian broadcaster Sky TG 24 Franco Frattini, Italian Foreign Minister, confirmed the release: "Our fellow citizens and other hostages are released.
“We now control their state of health,” Frattini said.
Five Germans, five Italians and a Romanian as well as their eight Egyptian escorts are well and are in security, state-run Egyptian television reported.
The 19 participants of the desert expedition are on their way to Cairo.
What remains incomprehensible are the reasons for a shooting before the release of the hostages: According to the descriptions of an Egyptian security guard the kidnappers were ready to end the kidnapping, but the Sudanese army had suddenly killed six kidnappers.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed with the rescue,” the guard said.
It was only about "receiving hostages" when suddenly "this surprise" came.
On Sunday, Sudanese soldiers killed six kidnappers and detained two of them in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt.
The kidnappers have demanded a ransom of six million euros from Germany; the money had to be handed over to the German wife of one of the hostages.
The newspaper El Masri El Jom, referring to a German mediator, reported that the release was delayed because the kidnappers were afraid of their safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers intend to release the female hostages after receiving the ransom.
The men had to be stopped until the kidnappers had a safe route to escape.
The German embassy in Cairo declined to take a position on this report.
Parent abuse "leads to suicide"
According to the court, years of abuse by his stepfather led a woman to kill herself.
Michael Trerise, 57, of Stithians in Cornwall, has been sentenced to five years in prison after admitting eight counts of indecent assault.
The Royal Court of Truro, through an investigative study, found that he had regularly tied his daughter Stephanie Randle, when the girl was between five and seven years old.
Trerise wrote in a confession paper: "I feel responsible for his death."
The court heard that Ms. Randle committed suicide at her Mutley home in Plymouth on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
In the season the girl lived in Coventry, Trerise used to tie her and sell her eyes before performing her sexual acts, while her mother was working in a pub.
After the divorce in 1980, Trerise returned to live in Cornwall.
His daughter moved to Plymouth.
However, the court learned that Ms. Randle, who spent much of her time volunteering for the National Trust, was tormented by the abuse that had been inflicted on her twice a week.
In 2006, prosecutor Ramsey Quaife referred to the court what some friends of Mrs Rande had said about her, who, having been a great surfer and cyclist, now seemed "emotionally dead", as if she had "resigned to life."
In April 2007, his true father, Terraza Randle, found the dead woman in his apartment in Plymouth.
Mrs. Rande is supposed to have killed herself by suffocating herself with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronted his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a letter of confession concluding with, "I used to tie her up and open her eyes.
It was never a sexual assault.
I feel responsible for his death.”
Judge Christopher Elwen responded to Trerise: “You are a very strange fetishist, and for your victim it must have been a terrible experience, especially when he was only seven years old.
This nasty saga ends with the victim taking away his own life.
Even clearer, it is that if she hadn’t done it, the issue probably wouldn’t have ended in the courts.”
“I’ve noticed the effect that according to the description made by Stephanie’s father and mother the abuse had on her daughter over the years.
Clearly she could have had a promising, successful and happy future.”
An officer charged with data loss
The BBC was informed that a Cabinet official who forgot some secret documents on the train in June will be charged under the Official Secrets Act.
The man, on a work trip through the Ministry of Defense, left two highly classified documents on the train to Waterloo.
The documents were passed to the BBC before being handed over to the police.
This is probably the least serious charge under the law and does not imply any indication of intent to commit a crime.
BBC Defense Correspondent Frank Gardner said the sentence had come as a surprise to many in the British administration.
“They thought it was an internal matter between the Ministry of Defense and the Cabinet,” he said.
The employee, who cannot be appointed, is charged under section 8.1 of the Act, the clause that relates to the safeguarding of information.
The Royal Legal Service noted that the official must be indicted by the Metropolitan Police, because of the highly sensitive entity of his work in the Secret Service Committee.
The forgotten documents contained secret information about al-Qaeda and the capability of the security forces in Iraq.
The officer was informed of the decision on Monday morning and immediately moved from his home to a secret location.
Construction companies face the price of B&B
In Britain, construction companies could face a price tag of more than <0xC2><0xA3>80,000 after the rescue of the Bradford and Bingley bank.
The government, in fact, provided <0xC2><0xA3>14 trillion to protect the deposits of the bank’s 2.6 million savers.
The interest on the loan will be paid by all companies using savers’ money, including the 59 construction companies.
Adrian Coles, Director General of the Association of Construction Societies (BSA), considers it “humiliating” that societies and their members have to pay
Eventually, the 14-billion-dollar loan should be repaid after Bradford and Bingley’s mortgages are redeemed.
However, interest due in the meantime is supposed to be charged each year to the 700 financial companies that have deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Plan confirmed to the BBC that the 59 construction companies are included in that number.
It is humiliating that institutions that behaved prudently ... are called to pay the price of institutions that have been much less prudent today.
Adrian Coles, BSA
That is, each of the companies had to pay in proportion to the bank deposits, and the mediation companies had to pay about 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that interest on the loan will amount to <0xC2><0xA3>450,000 in 2009.
This means that companies will have to recover <0xC2><0xA3>81,000 to face the first year of interest.
Adrian Coles, general manager of the Commercial Association of Construction Societies, told the BBC that this situation is unfair.
“It is humiliating that institutions that behaved prudently in the growth of the real estate market are called to pay the price produced by those who were far less prudent.”
According to the BSA, there are no data indicating the failure of any society since 1945.
“We will need to look into all aspects of this issue in the coming weeks to find out what options exist to protect construction companies and their members against what could be a relevant price,” Cole said.
The interest paid in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September this year to the end of March.
In 2010, it will be a full year of eligible interest, which can be almost twice as much.
As construction companies are mutual organizations and have no shareholders, their members will inevitably end up paying the price, either through higher rates or lower interest on their savings.
The price of milk goes up by five pence per liter
The residents of the Jersey Strait will have to pay more for their milk.
The Jersey Dairy newspaper has announced that the higher price of dairy products will increase by an extra five pence per litre from next Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after a two-pence increase in February and immediately after the research carried out by a consulting firm.
Traders can decide for themselves if they want to apply price increases to their customers.
The last time the highest price of milk had risen before February was in 2002.
Ex-Bangladesh Prime Minister on bail denied
A Bangladeshi court has rejected the bail application for former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, in the sense that she can be taken to jail when she returns to her country.
His advocates said the court did not grant him bail by accusing him of extorting 50 million taka ($729,700) to an entrepreneur when he was Prime Minister.
This is one of several corruption accusations against you.
His longtime political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina’s return to Bangladesh is expected in the coming weeks, but his party, the Awami League, has demanded that the country’s military-backed government first grant him full freedom.
Correspondents say that while she was given parole to go abroad and receive medical treatment, it is now unclear what the terms of her release are or whether she will be able to remain free when she returns to Bangladesh.
Their lawyers say they will appeal to the Supreme Court against the Supreme Court’s order.
"The Supreme Court rejected the bail request for Sheikh Hasina's bail, arguing that he could not obtain bail because he was already being treated abroad under parole," his lawyer Rafique-ul Huq said.
"We are going to bring an appeal against the order of the Supreme Court."
Her advocates argued that she needed bail-freedom to return to her country from abroad and prepare for the December elections.
Sheikh Hasina should return to his homeland after Oct. 17, according to a Awami League leader last Sunday.
She was arrested last year after the army-backed interim government took power, but was released in June to go abroad and receive medical treatments.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia reject all charges they are charged with.
Fears for anti-poliomyelitis campaign in Afghanistan
Nearly 200,000 children in Afghanistan have not been able to take advantage of a recent anti-poliomyelitis vaccination campaign due to the violence of the Taliban.
Last week, the United Nations conducted a vaccination program in six provinces of the country.
The organization reports that it was unable to reach the children in some parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the South for security reasons.
A U.N. spokesman said it happened despite promises made by the Taliban that they would not have attacked or hampered thousands of officials while conducting vaccinations.
BSkyB loses legal challenge at ITV
BSkyB has lost its legal challenge in the Competition Commission following the decision that forced the company to reduce its participation in rival ITV broadcasting.
BSkyB has been informed by the Competition Appeals Court that it will have to reduce its share of ITV by 17.9% to below 7.5%.
Earlier, the Commission said that BSkyB’s interests impeded competition and allowed its unfair influence on ITV.
BSkyB bought its stock in 2006 in a deal that effectively blocked NTL, now Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Anti-Monopoly Office reported that BSkyB’s acquisition of ITV’s share in ITV raised doubts about ITV’s independence and encouraged the Competition Commission to open an investigation.
Everyone, including Virgin’s head, Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and regulator Ofcom, opposed the purchase.
BSkyB, commented that the obligation to reduce its ITV package was not reasonable and constituted a disproportionate remedy, particularly because, BSkyB said, it would have surrendered its voting rights.
New Investigation into the Assumption of U.S. Lawyers
The U.S. Attorney General has appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the dismissal of nine U.S. lawyers in 2006.
The reason was a report in which the Inspector General of the Department of Justice criticized the performance by administration officials.
The report criticised White House officials, lawmakers and former Producer General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was motivated by the fear that the lawyers had been removed for political reasons.
Special Prosecutor Nora Danney is investigating whether officials interrogated during the investigation lied to investigators in an attempt to obstruct justice.
“Grave allegations of possible criminal conduct have not been fully investigated or resolved,” Attorney General Glenn Bellas said in the report.
One of the main recommendations of the report was the appointment of a special prosecutor with the power to force witnesses to leave their statements.
The discussion began when nine U.S. lawyers were removed from their posts by the Department of Justice in December 2006.
At the time, the department motivated the decision by suggesting that the lawyers had been fired for low performance.
But it was later learned that the lawyers had not assessed themselves worse than other colleagues, and many observers concluded that the dismissals would be motivated by political reasons.
Some of the lawyers in question had worked on the persecution of Republicans, high-profile members of Congress, while others had refused to investigate allegations of electoral fraud against the Democrats.
These lawyers investigate and prosecute legal cases for the government.
and may be fired at any time, but not removed for political reasons.
The next head of the Department of Justice, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, under pressure for dismissals, resigned from his position.
A number of other Justice Department officials did the same.
The Attorney General’s report is very critical of Mr. Gonzales’ role in the matter, and underlines how he had a “primary responsibility” for the dismissals, who “abdicated” his leadership position and was “remarkably non-collaborative” in the process.
Other officials, including former Bush collaborator Karl Rove, were criticized for not cooperating with the investigation.
The epic of Meat Loaf with great honor
Rock star Meat Loaf will be honored at the Q Awards for his epic anthem Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will pick up the special award next week at the ceremony that will take place in London, said getting this recognition will be "an honor."
The song, which lasted nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title of the album with which Meat Loaf triumphed in 1977.
The Coldplay group are leading the nominations for this year’s awards and making the classification of the four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said: “There are some songs that transcend time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is certainly one of them.”
The song, written by Jim Steinman, requires an excellent vocal ability like the one used by Meat Loaf.
An almost two-minute instrumental section opens the anthem.
The song was first known as a single in the UK in 1979 and reached number 15 on the chart.
However, Meat Loaf’s Bat Out Of Hell remained in the charts for about nine years and went on to sell over 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - real name Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered health problems in recent years, including surgery for his heart arrhythmia in 2003, after a collapse during a concert.
In 2007, acute laryngitis forced him to cancel some concerts.
Later it turned out that he had a cyst in his vocal cord.
Dark city street, often forgotten and maybe ready for sale
New York City has thousands of avenues, boulevards, streets and other roads, some famous, others simply service.
However, many people, including veteran taxi drivers and long-time local residents, find it difficult to indicate the location of the Extra Place, especially because many of them have never heard of this street.
The small street is located in the East Village and extends north of First Street – before I found Second Street – between Bowery and Second Avenue.
This street, more or less than 30 feet wide and 120 in length, resembles a dusty street more than an active path.
There are no signs.
It is almost impossible to find in an atlas.
The street, however, has admirers.
For example, there’s Avalon Bay, the company that recently built luxury buildings on First Street.
who wants to repaint Extra Place and create a clean aisle to the shops and boutiques that are expected to open in the new buildings.
Other admirers include the old-fashioned neighbors who commented on being enchanted by the truncated lane simply because it is one of the last remnants of the block’s past before the building’s appropriation.
However, the Department of Housing, Preservation and Development of the city, which has control of the street, has no interest in owning it.
At the meeting of the Venture Community Committee for Land Use this month, Avalon agency representatives outlined a proposal to buy the street.
However, the committee, preferring the street to remain in the city, called for a new plan that will be presented next month, as said Susan Stetzer, the community’s district manager n.3.
"The city now owns very few spaces and we would like it to continue to own Extra Place," said Ms.
“We can consider the proposals made by Avalon to solve the problem and manage the space, but we also want to ensure public access to the street.”
Avalon Bay had announced several months ago that it wanted to repair the small street and install some seats, including some to be used as coffee, while waiting to rent the spaces.
The idea that Avalon could buy the street came up for the first time during this month’s meeting
but Michele de Milly, an Avalon Bay spokeswoman, said that although the company wanted to use the street, it did not necessarily want to own it.
“The primary concern of Avalon Bay is the renovation of this abandoned alley and the possibility of turning it into a public area,” he said, adding that the sale proposal came from the city itself.
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the Preservation Committee, confirmed that it was the city’s desire to sell the street and noted that the agency’s mission is to develop the property rather than manage it.
Compared to its more colorful surroundings, those of the Bowery, Extra Place has left a mark on history.
Some believe it got its name in 1802, when Philip Minthorne’s large estate was divided among his children and this narrow strip of land was not claimed by anyone.
The back door of the CBGB, the punk rock monument that closed in 2006, opened in Extra Place, but the street is perhaps best known for the photo of the establishment that comes out on the cover of Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia".
“The environment was magnificent,” commented Danny Fields, the Ramones manager, who took the photo in November 1976.
"It was full of rubbish, pieces of clothing and pieces of barrels, posters, sheets, strings."
Some residents, including bloggers who write about the East Village’s burglary, have opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that public goods, however modest, should remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rare piece, virtually unchanged, a city raja that should be protected.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitled, "The Book of Lamentations: A Bitterly Nostalgic Look at a City in the Process of Going Extinct"), has made available part of a talk on the city's history on Extra Place, published by The New Yorker newspaper in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a somewhat narrow and runaway alley, dark also by day and marked by oxidized iron warehouse doors and counter-windows, with week-old newspapers blown along the canals."
With few exceptions, the street looked more or less the same on a recent afternoon.
A rat was cured through the back of the street and stood near the door that was used to enter the CBGB and now houses a luxury clothing store.
Graffiti on the walls and a bottle of nearly 22-oz empty beer were close to a new batch of discarded newspapers.
Some interns said they rarely paid attention to Extra Place, but suggested it could be given a cleanup.
Mr. Fields, for his part, noted that some people underestimate the attractive power of the street in its current state.
"I spent the best years of my life," he said, "in dark, humid, filthy places."
The debate on bilingualism: immersion in the English language
In this chapter of Education Watch, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss candidates’ positions on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, an old California study associate and study director at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is co-author of the book Not as Good as You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs School Choice.
Calling Hispanic voters effectively is a difficult business.
The education proposals made by Barack Obama are an example of that.
Obama’s campaign notes that “African-Americans and Latino students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students,” and this is a very true consideration.
To combat such differences in learning events, Obama’s education plan specifically advocates, among other things, “transitional bilingual education” for English students.
However, the open question for Mr. Obama is whether the commitment of bilingual education, which prefers classroom instruction in languages other than English, is effective in eliminating the gap in the final results.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an officially recognized primary school in the eastern region of Los Angeles County.
In this school the vast majority of students are Hispanic and low-income families:
More than a third of the students, many of whom are newcomers, are learning the English language.
However, an incredible 100 percent of fourth-year students have been positively assessed in the 2008 math exam.
and almost an equally astonishing 93 percent have mastered the English language and arts test.
This incredible success has been achieved using a different ingredient that Mr. Obama favored.
The Sixth Street School emphasizes review and practice, constant assessment of competencies, and does not tolerate any attitude of excuses.
In addition, and here’s where Mr. Obama should take note, according to Linda Mikels, the principal of Sixth Street, the school’s approach to English instruction to students is in “total immersion.”
Immersion in English means the almost exclusive use of the language in the treatment of the contents of the instruction.
Ms. Mikels, who opposes bilingual education, told me, "we have had extraordinary successes with students like this one who has come from Mexico and that, if you enter the classroom 12 months later you wouldn't be able to pick up what it was."
"It works," he said, "we believe it works."
Will Mr. Obama take a school like Sixth Street Prep as a model of replicating for other schools with large populations of Hispanic-English students?
The results achieved by this school should remove any doubt about the answer, but the idea of his party’s politicians on the issue of education (the National Education Associations have long been advocates of bilingual education) and his same constant support for bilingual education obscure Obama’s response prediction.
While immigrants need to learn English, recently Mr. Obama has trivialized the issue leaving people to stop worrying about legislation that is only written in English.
and instead, he said, "you have to make sure your child can speak Spanish."
If Mr. Obama really wants to improve the system and close gaps, he should carefully consider models of education that work well, rather than despise or trivialize them.
Oil price drops sharply after renewed economic fears <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Oil prices fell drastically on Monday due to concerns that the U.S. bailout plan for financial markets may not be able to reactivate the economy.
Shares of crude oil fell 7 percent to $99.80 a barrel in the morning trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The price has fallen by more than $20 per barrel since last Monday.
Over the past two weeks, commodity markets have been shaken by the financial crisis on Wall Street and a pair of powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After reaching a peak of $145.29 per barrel in July, prices had fallen to nearly $90 per barrel earlier this month, before falling back once again due to huge uncertainty in financial markets.
Anxiety seized investors, once again, on Monday, despite Congressional leaders saying they had reached an agreement over the weekend on the bailout plan, the largest in history.
The news was overshadowed by new concerns that the financial crisis would be far from over.
The evolution that occurred in the last episode of the merger process, confirms that Citigroup will buy the banking operations of Wachovia Corporation, according to the government said Monday.
Meanwhile, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalized the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Analysts at Barclays Capital said that on the frenzied weekend, the negotiations that led to the bailout deal "seem to have failed to reactivate market sentiment."
As the economic situation deteriorates, demand for commodities, including oil, is expected to decline.
“The outlook for global equity, interest rate and exchange rate will become increasingly uncertain,” Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a note to investors.
“We believe that commodities will not be able to escape this contagion.
From a product perspective, our most pressing concern is assessing whether the American virus will spread globally and specifically to China.”
Bank analysts have lowered their expectations for next year, as oil consumption is down due to the economic growth crisis and the forecast for oil and gas price reductions is 20 percent for 2009.
Second quarter of madness: team sets record
After having spent the last eight seasons, longer than anyone else in the Jets uniform, playing in defense, Shaun Ellis thought he had seen everything.
Then he saw how things unfold in the second quarter this Sunday, when the Jets turned an unannotated game into a deflating game.
"I've never seen anything like that," Ellis said.
The second quarter started after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals had played lazy under the shadows of the clouds.
At this point it happened that quarterback Brett Favre found Laveranues Coles scoring a 12-yard goal and suggesting the perfect foreplay for an afternoon, in which the evolution of the relationship between the players had a big leap forward.
Favre found Coles for two more goals in the quarter, one of these when one cornerback fell and another came with 10 seconds in the half.
"I didn't get out of my way," Favre said of all the steps that went to Coles.
"He's a player's devil.
Our communication has been great, regardless of what people may think.”
While Favre and Coles were performing in the dam, the Cardinals' defense abused quarterback Kurt Warner.
Cornerback Darrelle Revis intercepted a running shot and returned it 32 yards for a touchdown.
Safety Eric Smith scored another pass and intercepted it.
Linebacker David Bowens was forced to miss by Warner.
In the last turnover, Bowens' failures could have been the best.
The Cardinals had taken possession with 10 seconds available, and after the Jets regained the ball, Jay Feely gave him a 20-yard kick to win a final 34-0.
They are the biggest points the Jets never made in a quarter.
The team's coach, Eric Mangini, asked to describe the madness of this moment, he said, "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
When both were answered - the Jets allowed 21 unanswered points in the third quarter - Mangini said: "I can say I liked the second quarter much more than the third.
They've earned a lot of points in a very short period of time."
Gebrselassie rested tops his world record
Once again, Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia has demonstrated because many consider him the greatest runner in history, breaking his own world record at the Berlin marathon on Sunday and becoming the first person able to race 26.2 miles in 2 hours 4 minutes.
Following the win in the accommodating flat race in 2:03:59, Gebrselassie has broken for 27 seconds his previous record of 2:04:26, obtained last year in Berlin.
At the age of 35, Gebrselassie has set the world record number 26 in a race of an impressive length so he has set a world championship or world record for any distance, from the counterclockwise race to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie has not taken part in the Olympic marathon in Beijing, fearing — perhaps too alarmingly, in retrospect — that air pollution will aggravate his asthma problems.
Instead, he set out to run in Berlin.
In virtually perfect conditions - sunny and with 48 degrees at the start of the race, 55 degrees at the end - Gebrselassie won this Sunday, using an average of 4 minutes 43 seconds per mile.
Since racers like Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat of Kenya have become long-distance, the marathon record has fallen by more than two minutes in the last decade, as Ronaldo da Costa of Brazil won in Berlin in 2:06:05 in 1998.
After last Sunday’s victory, Gebrselassie told reporters that he had suffered cramps on his hip two weeks earlier and that he had lost a week of training.
It is obvious that the suspension left you fresh, not oxidized.
"I'm very happy," Gebrselassie told reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I started again a week ago, and today I had some doubts, but in the end everything went well.”
The athlete has been the subject of some criticism - especially in Kenya, the Afro-Eastern rival of Ethiopia - for the style of orchestrating too much of his careers, in general, avoiding the encounter with many stars of the world marathon, relying on the pacemakers as if it were a race track, and putting them on the récord.
But this criticism does not diminish the greatness of Gebrselassie’s skills as a runner.
This Sunday, at the march of four Kenyans, Gebrselassie reached half the race in 1:02:04.
Two Kenyan elite runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, began challenging Gebrselassie after their paces declined.
But shortly before the three-mile goal, Gebrselassie took a final push to break away from Kwambai, who finished second in 2:05:36, improving his best personal record by almost five minutes.
Kamathi came in third place at 2:07:48.
In the women's race, Irina Mikitenko, a native of Kazakhstan but now a German citizen, completed a remarkable year winning in 2:19:19, the seventh fastest time in history.
Paula Radcliffe from Great Britain holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, Mikitenko, 36, was a surprise and won the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She also did not take part in the Beijing Games so it was described as a back injury, but recovered to win in Berlin and set her staff best record in almost five minutes in the third marathon she ran.
He did a smart computing race, leaving a quartet of Kenyan and Ethiopian runners to do head-to-head and then recovering them after 18 1<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 miles.
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia won second place in 2:21.31, while Elena Kiprop of Kenya finished third in 2:25:01.
In a separate city, the pride and proofs of color life
Hidden by the expansion of the theme park of the great Orlando, a few kilometers from the bright, noisy and colossal city, lies a quiet village, where the pride and complications of the African-American experience remain very evident.
Eatonville, the first fully black-inhabited city incorporated into the country and place of Zora Neale Hurston's childhood, is no longer as simple as she described it in 1935: "the city of five lakes, three croquet fields, 300 men of color, 300 good swimmers, many guaabas, two schools and no prison."
It is now a place of pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! Fair in Eatonville to pay tribute to Mrs. Hurston, the most famous writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
And yet, in many ways, the city she described – also making it a tourist stage by including it in the Florida travel guide produced by the Federal Writers of the Depression Season Project – remains a separate place.
The city remains independent, dignified and private as it was in the 1930s, when Mrs. Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resist sharing their true ideas with the white man, who “knows so little about us and doesn’t know what’s missing.”
Even now, in the year that a black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, has called attention to start a dialogue on the issue of race, many are still cautious in front of the foreigner.
“We are very cautious about the way our story is told,” said Jones Hortense, 59, a lifetime resident and member of the city’s oldest church.
“It has to be right.”
Eatonville has always been defined as a paradox of victory and struggle.
It is at the same time a historical model of the assertion of blacks and a community of nearly 2,400 people living below a poverty level twice the national average.
It is a literary center, but also a fixed example of the rural culture of the south black - sometimes neglected, others praised - that was born of slavery in America.
It’s no wonder that those who live here are both proud and reserved.
And the concern for the image of Eatonville really started with Zora, as no one here calls her Mrs. Hurston.
She introduced her hometown to the world through her deep-seated books in dialect such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs on Florida's guide transformed the city, just outside Route 17, a road running through central Florida often forgotten into black history and human drama.
Faced with cement in both life and literature, Ms. Hurston took her readers to Eatonville's first mayor's tent, Joe Clarke, and then into more private areas.
"Out of the road to the left," he wrote, "there is the modern maroon public school with its white finishes, its well-maintained gardens and playgrounds, cared for by Howard Miller, as he can barely read and write."
She also mentions Dash's new husband and writes that Glenn Lee "sells drinks of all kinds and anything goes with transitional rooms."
Thus, in just a few hundred words, Mrs. Hurston puts Eatonville in relationship with autonomous government, but also with illiteracy, second marriage and sex.
Obviously, this Fodor didn't do it.
In fact, not everyone appreciated the portrait.
“Zora described it as it was,” said Ella Dinkins, 90, one of the Johnson girls Mrs. Hurston immortalized by quoting men who were singing colorless songs about her beauty.
He added, “Some people didn’t like that.”
Ms. Hurston is still remembered here as an eccentric living woman who often returned after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Franklin Augusto, 77, remembers that when Mrs. Hurston arrived in town, she did so without warning in a large Chevrolet, smoking and wearing pants in a city that is still proud to wear with dignity.
Most residents were fascinated, Mr. Franklin said, while many laughed sarcasticly.
“People were always very happy to see Zora,” Mr. Franklin continues.
But, she adds, swinging in her chair in a backyard overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Mrs. Hurston was probably baptized, "she never stayed too long."
When Mrs. Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were no longer in print.
Like most of the world, Eatonville also seemed to have forgotten about her.
Although she was a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only woman of color at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an anonymous grave in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she had been living.
In Eatonville, there were no major commemorative ceremonies, no major public readings.
"I don't think her contribution to the world or her legacy was understood," said Valerie Boyd, author of Wrapped in Rainbows, a biography of Mrs. Hurston published in 2003.
A certain turn came in the '80s.
Orange County officials wanted to put a five-lane road across the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the work community’s main two-lane street.
The expansion of the Orlando area had already pushed Interstate 4 across the western edge of the city.
The proposal came at a time when Eatonville was recovering from a difficult period in its history.
Forced integration, among other things, had put an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the struggle for racial mix brought hatred closer to the community.
“During that season, a group of white boys were going around the city throwing oranges and everything against the people who were sitting next to them,” Franklin said.
“They also killed a girl once.
They threw him at a watermelon in the car."
In a 1955 letter to Mrs. Hurston he wrote to The Orlando Sentinel, criticizing the forced integration by the Supreme Court that in Brown v. Board of Education "insulted rather than honoring my race."
R Residents say today that the positive detachment of schools in some respects had weakened Eatonville’s cohesion and undermined the confidence of its youth.
“Black children were used to being embraced — I remember this — used to hug the teacher in the morning and at night,” said N.Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and executive director of Preserve the Eatonville Community, a non-profit organization.
This lasted, he added, until teachers and students came from the same place.
“I wasn’t embracing your professor because he was white — there’s a cultural gap there,” said Ms. Nathiri.
Civil rights, however, helped create the space for many more Zora Neale Hurstons – black writers, actors and artists who passed over prejudices, just as she did, with guts, confidence and lines like: “How can one deny himself the pleasure of my company!
I don't understand."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker went to Mrs. Hurston's anonymous grave and began to fight to revive her reputation.
Five years later, an acclaimed biography of Mrs. Hurston made by Robert E. Hemenway appeared in bookstores, reintroducing it to the American canons.
The road project came just as Eatonville’s most famous daughter was once again under the spotlight.
And this time, Mrs. Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a savior.
In 1988, the community began planning a fair for Mrs. Hurston to show what the county could ruin with that road.
Thousands of fans arrived at the inaugural event two years later, and every January, many return for the celebration.
After several years, the county has abandoned its road proposal.
“The resurrected idea of the five-way road would have been to put in what you would call curvature speed, a real civic pride,” said Ms. Nathiri.
Mrs. Boyd said it more simply: "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory over the road project has helped to change the image of the city itself.
Outsiders like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who began coming to church here in 1993, began to appear in large numbers, and residents began to review the past.
Eatonville entered the National Historical Registry in 1998.
A new library (named Hurston, of course) opened its doors in 2006, on a paved and beautified Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly in Florida: just six miles from downtown Orlando, it can sometimes feel like on a street from the past under a summer rain, in a small town as it was founded by only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(90 percent of people are black today.)
Foreigners who come in search of Eatonville’s history, of its meaning, are often still treated with caution.
A Preliminary Permission is required to do most of the interviews, and some things—such as the murals in Eatonville’s oldest church, painted by a white man and showing black men working in the field—can’t be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, such as Mrs. Jones, a brave and convinced teacher who has a weakness for bright red, still fear that her island community gives may be misinterpreted.
And yet, as the Hurston festival has expanded, a higher level of native pride has also emerged.
Young people, in particular, tend to see Eatonville as Mrs. Hurston saw her whole race: beauty, and all the problems, no better, no worse, and equally to the other racial and ethnic groups in America, proud, creative, hardworking, stupid and mixed.
It’s a sincere civic sense what can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin’s 18-year-old nephew, Edwin Harvey, who is planning to return to Eatonville after college to work in the local government or by the Police Department, who he said might need some help.
And even those who are younger, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, two 11-year-old twins from Winter Park, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people, in case they dare to go up here, will have to think, 'Oh, this city is nothing compared to any other,'" says Alondra Kenon after going to church on a recent Sunday.
“But if you really stop and take a moment to look at its history, it’s a very nice city.”
Here in New York, everyone is talking about finance.
On the surface, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from the kiosks and the giant TV screens in Times Square, they wouldn’t realize they were in the eye of the hurricane.
They could never imagine that behind the glass fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade of the bee-nest offices above their heads, bankers and fund managers who monopolize New York City face the worst “bad day of the office” since the 1929 downturn.
Boys for home delivery continue to resonate their metal tea carts through the sidewalks and carrying muffin trays for breakfast meetings.
Latino men continue to smuggle between buildings of loaded apartments, like human mules, with 50 shirts of eccentric stamping hanging to a yoke through their shoulders. Office workers still wait in queue for their food to carry from the morning, and it is still impossible to pick up a cab in the morning.
Employees still wait queuing for their bagel to the carts of the sellers, and still it is impossible to find a taxi between four and five in the afternoon on the days of the week.
It seemed to me that there was no crisis at all, until, this Thursday afternoon, with all the pessimistic forecasts out there, I decided to open a new savings account.
Although I had calculated the time needed for the operation to coincide with the late afternoon calm at my local JP Morgan Chase branch, a queue of about 20 people was already waiting.
And not in front of the employee’s window, to withdraw their cash or make a deposit, but in front of the customer service bank, where lifelong customers order their checkbooks, tourists look for instructions to go to Macy’s department stores and new customers want to open their accounts.
Most of these people preceded me, I was later informed by Starr, my “personal trusted banker,” and were in line for the same reason I did.
Unlike me, they had already withdrawn their savings from the smaller banks in places from which they had switched, places like New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They had taken their money out of so-called savings associations (a bit like a construction company), credit unions and savings boxes in their hometown whose whites only work within the state of belonging, and which they say treat customers as their family.
Over the past year, 15 of these banks have silently failed.
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion of assets, went bankrupt, and as New Yorkers headed home Friday night for the weekend, another bank, Wachovia, with savings of $440 billion, was looking for a rescue buyer.
The workers of the offices and shops that stood in front of me, fearing another collapse, were transferring their money to a bank to what is considered a safe haven, which is doing most of the rescues on Wall Street.
Ordinary people in New York have become financial experts in recent weeks.
A woman in my local Chinese supermarket, speaking on the phone, was referring to Lehman Brothers, the bank failed, and her grieving-looking chief executive, Dick Full, commented on the matter with familiarity as if they were complaining about the inactivity of a colleague.
And Lyn, the 50th and somewhat uniformed concierge of my apartment block, has changed the normal course of our conversations about Brad and Angelina or my shopping at the store.
He told me, after my visit to the bank, that "I now have all my savings in money market funds.
The switch is done, I'm not taking any risk."
Muslim graves profaned as Austria approaches to the right
Heinz-Christian Strache, from the left wing of the far-right party for freedom of Austria and Filip Dewinter Belgian, affiliated with the far-right party Vlaams Belang, take part in a demonstration to present to the organization "Cities against Islamization" in Antwerp, on Thursday 17 January 2008.
They carry traffic signs that represent the mosques with a red line passing through.
Police are blaming far-right extremists for desecrating a Muslim cemetery in Austria, the same weekend that far-right political parties made huge gains in the country’s general election.
More than 90 graves were severely damaged at Traun Cemetery near Linz at some point between Friday night and this morning, in what police believe was an organized action.
Criminals sprayed Jewish symbols, such as the Star of David, on some of the tombs, but investigators think this may have happened by trying to hide the real motives of extremists driven by hatred against Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident was in any way related to the election.
A spokesman for the local Islamic Community said they were "deeply shocked" by the news of the profanation, which reached Muslim religious as the month of Ramadan was ending.
In the meantime, Austria is preparing for an introspection round after the turn to the right in yesterday’s parliamentary elections.
The two far-right parties that caught nearly 30 percent of the vote, the Freedom Party and the Austrian Future Alliance, had run a campaign focused on anti-immigration vehemence and some of their slogans were considered xenophobic by critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party who won more than 18 percent of the vote, campaigned against the headscarves and burkas, and also expressed his opposition to food considered Islam-related.
At his last meeting in Vienna, he spoke of a “European brotherhood” to prevent the emergence of Islam.
Both parties are trying to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, arguing that they were symbols of Islamization policy in Austria and Europe.
Surveys and analyses carried out immediately after the elections, which have confirmed the far right as the country’s strongest political bloc, indicate that the change occurred mainly by young voters who are worried about their future in the European Union.
Travel Abroad Ban for Gary Glitter
Courts have banned Gary Glitter, the fascinating rock star guilty of child sexual abuse, from travelling to France and Spain.
The judges imposed a six-month ban on Glitter after he informed surveillance authorities that he wanted to travel to Spain through France.
Kent police issued a travel ban last Thursday after magistrates had produced evidence of Glitter’s previous convictions for sexual abuse of children.
Glitter, real name, Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at the Ashford Magistrates' Court in Kent, but was represented by attorney Corker Binning.
A Justice Service spokesman said: “On Thursday, September 25, at the Ashford Magistrates’ Court in Kent, police requested a provision to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd’s travel abroad as he did to France and Spain until March 25.
"Paul Gadd did not attend in person."
Glitter, 64, had informed the authorities that she wanted to travel abroad, by virtue of being under the register of sex offenders.
He must inform the authorities if he wishes to travel abroad for more than three days.
and it is also necessary that you inform the police of the planned date seven days before your departure.
Kent police said they would not discuss the individual case or the possible location of Glitter in the county.
A Kent Police spokesman said: “Kent Police will do everything possible to protect children in this country, or abroad.
A Kent Police spokesman said: “Kent Police will do everything possible to protect children in this country, or abroad.
“From our point of view, it is easier to monitor someone who stays in the UK because here we have the systems to manage all possible risks more effectively.
“Protecting Kent residents is the main concern of Kent Police and we work closely to monitor the behavior of registered sex offenders in the county and minimize any risk that may exist to the public.”
Glitter returned to the UK last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for the abuse of two girls, aged between 10 and 11.
When he was released, Glitter flew to Bangkok, where he took a flight to London.
However, he said he felt bad and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not allow him to pass through passport control and eventually flew to Hong Kong.
Chinese authorities also denied him entry and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and immigration officials insisted he would return to Britain.
He probably arrived at Terminal 3 in Heathrow on 22 August and stayed there while his lawyer David Corker went to the Uxbridge Magistrate's Court, west of London, after Scotland Yard had successfully applied for the order to register as a sex offender.
Glitter had been imprisoned in the UK for four months in 1999 for possession of child abuse images.
A source from the Interior Ministry reported that Jacqui Smith, the Interior Minister, was reassured and delighted to learn that they had banned Glitter from travelling to France and Spain.
"I catch the master off-stage to extract his character" Günther Bauer_Photographer
No boots, no steering wheels, no jumpsuits.
The essence of the great masters of flamenco, stripped of the concentration in interpretation to obtain the relaxed appearance of the man or woman.
On the other hand, the artist.
The other, the person.
Inseparable except in privacy, in those moments foreign to the public, when you find the privacy of a gesture, the depth of a stolen look or the expressiveness of a hand, unconcerned because they will not go out on the scene.
The German Günther Bauer alternates in "Flamenco-people" the theatricality of some staged with singers, dancers and guitarists with that less known side of these masters.
With this proposal, the photographer collects the particular iconography of flamenco from different areas.
Included in the Flamenco Photography Month program, the exhibition "reflects the international importance of flamenco, bigger every day", explains the creator, who clarifies that "Flamenco-people" "can be anyone but, seeing the photos, the observer realizes that they are not the typical images of artists on the stage.
These people portrayed "in the street" are artists capable of transmitting passion, sadness, joy... captivating the audience.
To capture the personality of these artists you do not have to take pictures of the stage.
They carry their personality and character inside.
What interested me was to create an intimate atmosphere that would allow me to capture with the camera the personality of the great flamenco.”
With the taste of the "Cante de las Minas" festival, Bauer began in 1997 a long journey to portray singers, guitarists or dancers with a plate camera.
They are portraits that, due to the selection of the camera and the material, remember the classic photography.
The application of different stylistic means breaks with the classical basis of the image, giving it modernity, an idea that reflects how Bauer himself understands flamenco: "A music with very traditional roots, which evolves and surprises every day".
It is not the action of the dance, the song or the touch itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, that captivates the public with his art.
The search for an encounter with the essentials, with the duende that becomes visible in a way of feeling, of being and of being are and have been the constant of this work that is presented these days in the gallery El Fotomata.
Famous flamenco figures such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, set up this selection of nearly seventy artists photographed.
The project has become an anthology of flamenco, which will soon be published in a book that will collect the portraits exhibited in the sample.
Bauer’s passion for portraits led him to repeat the idea two years ago with “Portraits of veteran athletes” (“SportARTproject”).
Although the concepts are different in "Flamenco-people", the photographer admits that "I love to portray people, meet them and be able to enter a moment in their life, whether it's a long or a short moment.
I think within photography portraiture is the most difficult genre.
You meet or face people, characters, who sometimes you don’t even know, or who leave you only a few minutes to be able to take the photo.
Despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to make my ideas come true.”
This collection of portraits of the current flamenco entitled "Flamenco-people" is on display in the El Fotomata Gallery, located at number 20 of the street of La Mata, parallel to the Alameda de Hercules, where it can be visited until next October 16.
Vargas Llosa confesses that the novel he writes is "a cowardice"
It’s set in places he doesn’t know yet and revolves around unknown issues, but still, Mario Vargas Llosa is committed to bringing forward the new project he works on, a novel starring Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived in the Congo for twenty years and passed through the Amazon.
The ever-favorite of the Nobel Prize in Literature confessed yesterday in his passage for the Hay Festival Segovia that the project that today occupies it "is a cowardice" and that "everything indicates that you should not write" the novel.
"If it were wise, I wouldn't do it, but I'm going to do it and I hope to finish it sometime," he concluded in his speech at the festival of exchange of ideas, thoughts and words that for four days he has seen pass through the city of the Aqueduct to a hundred writers, historians and journalists and thousands of people.
The author of "The City and the Dogs" was one of the prominent figures of the third edition of the word party and fulfilled the forecasts.
Vargas Llosa, who has won the Hay Festival award for being the most voted writer by the participants - an old edition of Dickens' "Our mutual friend", filled the forecourt of theater Juan Bravo.
Introduced by Félix Romeo, he found before him a documented audience who was made very short the time when the Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and with great doses of humor, revisited how in him was born his literary vocation, derived from the "extraordinary adventure" and the "extraordinary adventure" of the "pleasure to read" and "live more."
The Spanish-American novelist acknowledged that "there is no way" to measure and know if books change life, "but I refuse to believe that literature is a pure entertainment, an ephemeral experience," emphasized Vargas Llosa, who said that this "has effects" and "abstains responsibility" and "makes people "more frivolous" to their "inconsistent" so he asked them to write.
Climatology undermines Pozoblanco fair, which also runs out of districts
The party of districts that closed the Pozoblanco fair was suspended yesterday morning, after checking the district planners announced that the floor of the square was not in the best condition.
In this way, the company, according to Ferm<0xC3><0xAD>n Boh<0xC3><0xB3>rquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez, decided to suspend the celebration of the race.
Weather inclement weather has begun with this fair, as at last two of its three festivals have not been able to be celebrated.
On Saturday it was rain that prevented the second scheduled bullfight.
The poster was composed by José Luis Moreno, Curro D<0xC3><0xAD>az and Juan Bautista, who were going to face a lockdown of Castilblanco
There was only a party on Friday.
In it, the winner was Daniel Luque who cut three ears and went out on his shoulders, after leaving passages with taste and aesthetics.
That same afternoon Alejandro Talavante salvaged his two fists with greetings and an ear, which granted more to the tendeds than to his chest.
That was, even worse was El Juli, which passed through the coso of Los Llanos without punishment or glory.
In his second bull, after a relief act, he won the bronze of a large part of the audience.
A control in <0xC3><0x81>lava jumps in a van with two thousand kilos of hashish
Five minus ten in the morning.
Traffic control of the Ertzaintza in the municipality of Armi<0xC3><0xB1><0xC3><0xB3>n (<0xC3><0x81>lava).
The agents shut down the two occupants of a van and they take the flight.
Their cargo, more than two tons of hashish, was not like stopping.
The officers pursued and arrested one of the two occupants, a 28-year-old man, identified as A.A.J., the Basque government’s Interior Department said in a statement.
The arrested person has been accused of drug trafficking and forgery of public document.
The incident was recorded when several officials of the <0xC3><0x81>lava Traffic Unit carried out a transport control on the N-1, at its passage through the municipal terminus of Armi<0xC3><0xB1><0xC3><0xB3>n.
They were ready to stop a van for inspection when the driver disobeyed orders, rushed abruptly, and the control jumped.
The agents began their pursuit until the vehicle stopped a couple of kilometers later in the arcene, as its two occupants stopped to flee the race through a wooded area.
The Ertzainas finally reached one of them and seized the 2,178 kilograms of hashish they were carrying and found after inspecting the van, an Iveco Daily.
The back of the vehicle was loaded with hashish loads, so they proceeded to move it to police stations for a thorough inspection and weighing of the drug.
In addition, officials verified that the registration had been "folded" as it did not coincide with the collection in the van's documentation, so the arrested person has also been charged with a crime of forgery of public document.
Ertzaintza continues the investigation to proceed with the arrest of the other suspect, who managed to escape to the race as it has been said, and determine the origin of the drug seized.
The 28-year-old detainee, A.A.J., was transferred to police units to carry out the corresponding investigations and will be made available to the judiciary in the coming hours.
Actress Heather Locklear Arrested for Driving Under the Effects of a Drug
Actress Heather Locklear, the popular Amanda of the Melrose Place series, has been detained this weekend in Santa Barbara, California, for driving under the effects of some medication.
A witness saw her perform strange maneuvers while trying to get out of her car park in Montecito, a spokesman for California’s road patrol told People magazine.
The witness has detailed that at about 4.30 p.m., Locklear "was stepping deep into the accelerator, making a lot of noise, trying to get the car out of the parking lot forward and backward, and as he walked back he passed several times over his sunglasses."
Shortly thereafter, the witness, who apparently did not recognize the actress at first, saw Locklear stopping on a nearby highway and exiting the vehicle.
This person was the one who alerted the emergency services because "she was worried about Locklear's life."
When the police patrol arrived, she found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, which was partially blocking the road.
"She seemed disoriented," so the agents took her to the specialty drug and alcohol center for a test.
According to a police spokesman, the actress was shown to be cooperative and excess alcohol was discarded from the first moment, although "according to officials observed at first glance, we believe that Locklear was under the influence of some medication."
Locklear was arrested on suspicion of driving under the effects of some unspecified substance and entered the local prison at about 7 p.m. although she was released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear left an Arizona treatment clinic where she was recovering from an episode of anxiety and depression.
Callazares urges the Andalusian federation of IU to assume its powers in the Silva case
The general coordinator of the IU and deputy of the United Left, Gaspar Llamazares, said today that it will be the regional federation of the formation that will have to make a decision on the case of the former youth and sports councillor of the City of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after he was charged with carrying out family members.
"I am very federalist for these things, and it will be the Andalusian organization that has to assume its competences," said Llamazares about the performance that the party will have to adopt with which so far councillor in the Seville Consistory.
However, the UI leader argued that the need for “transparency” to be present in the possible investigations into the irregularities that Silva might have committed: “U has always defended that these kinds of issues have the highest degree of transparency.”
In the same line he stressed that the training has “strict ethical codes for all public offices.”
'Blood of May', Garci's epic bet
Inspired by the National Episodes of Benito Pérez Gald<0xC3><0xB3>s, José Luis Garci recreates the famous Spanish uprising against the French in Sangre de Mayo, which is the most ambitious film in his filmography with a budget of about 15 million euros.
In this way, the filmmaker has tried to “illustrate the torrent of characters and social analysis” that he has always admired in the work of the well-known novelist, he explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarr<0xC3><0xAD>a at the head of a wide cast of performers.
Blood of May, with a footage of more than two and a half hours, premieres this Friday in the cinemas, to become in the future a miniseries for Telemadrid of more than four hours duration.
A great admirer of Gald<0xC3><0xB3>s' literature, José Luis Garci claims to have fulfilled this film "a childhood dream", which should thank Esperanza Aguirre, who from the Community of Madrid three years ago commissioned him to film a commemorative tape when he based on the second centenary of the 2nd of May Epi<0xC3><0xB3>lez in Madrid.
The 15 million budget that the Community of Madrid has contributed in its entirety constitutes for Garci a "unique opportunity" to ambient with the decorations and the appropriate wardrobe the portrait of "an atolled Spain that was mistaken as a boss to fight for, since, the struggle for independence has ended, has led the people to a huge delay with the resignation.
But the filmmaker regrets not having had a funding like that of Alatriste or Los Phant<0xC3><0xA1>smas de Goya - more than double that of Sangre de Mayo - so he has not been able to shoot some scenes in a script signed with Horacio Valc<0xC3><0xA1>rcel, with whom he has collaborated in almost his entire career.
Therefore, the director of Restarting, has emphasized what is his usual form of work, the staging with the actors, with whom he usually rehearses before starting the filming and those who do not cast, seems "humiliating" and considers that "part of the office of the director lies in going to the theater or cinema".
Many of the interpreters he meets in Sangre de mayo repeat in front of his camera, as is the case of Miguel Rell<0xC3><0xA1>n, Carlos Larra<0xC3><0xB1>aga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Candidate for the Oscars on four occasions - of which he won one -, Garci considers that any of the three candidates to represent Spain this year before the Academy of Hollywood, the Blood of May itself, Seven French billiard tables and the finally selected, The Blind Sunflowers, does not represent a young generation of Spanish cinema, "to give," to give.
With this film Garci does not expect prizes.
“At first you think you work for posterity, then you realize that you only work for prosperity, and now you’re making one more movie,” Garci explains after more than 30 years of professional career.
Isabel Bay<0xC3><0xB3>n recovers the essence of the Sevillan dancer T<0xC3><0xB3>rtola Valencia
A Sevillan dancer will also pay homage to a Sevillan dancer.
Carmen T<0xC3><0xB3>rtola Valencia, Catalan father (Floren<0xC3><0xA7> T<0xC3><0xB3>rtola Ferrer) and Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana neighborhood and when he was three he moved to London with his family.
She was a free dance dancer and an oriental dancer.
She had an exciting life, pioneering the liberation of women, such as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf, and Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and vegetarian and advocated for the abolition of the corset that prevented the free movement of women.
The life of this woman who marked a dance and aesthetic revolution in Europe between wars, fascinated Isabel Bay<0xC3><0xB3>n.
“I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she introduced me to this character and I thought it was amazing.”
According to the dancer, "we do not intend to tell your life but to collect your spirit.
The titles of his dances have suggested flamenco sticks to me.
Thus, "the butterfly dance" suggested me a guajira, or "the snake dance" a few tangos.
His dance was sensual and I’ve been told that my dance is also within this aesthetic,” he says.
The assembly has two exceptional collaborations: that of Miguel Poveda who will sing again to Isabel in one of his shows, as he did in that of "La dooropente"; and with the teacher Matilde Coral, who has exceptionally wanted to collaborate with who was her student.
"Matilde makes Tortola the eldest, the character of maturity.
I am happy because he has accepted to act in my work and I am very honored for it.”
The assembly also features the musical composition and guitars of Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s Torres and Paco Arriaga, the song of Miguel Ortega, the Pulga and Moi de Mor<0xC3><0xB3>n; the percussion of El P<0xC3><0xA1>jaro, as well as the viola of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfra Ju<0xC3><0xA1>rez, "who makes the role of the eternal and his accompaniente of this type."
The work also tells in some way the life of this woman who developed in places so far away, especially for the time, such as India, the United States, or Russia, as well as throughout Europe, since she habitually resided in London.
“I wanted to remind her because I think she’s one of those women who have a huge influence at a certain time and now no one knows and much less puts their work in value,” Bay<0xC3><0xB3>n says.
The show will begin today at 8:30 p.m. at the Lope de Vega Theatre.
The publication of the "Diary of a newly married poet" also closes the Triennium
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Diario de un Poeta Reciencasado" in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), where Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Jiménez entered into marriage with Zenobia in March 1916, is framed within the activities planned by the Ministry of Culture of the Juan and the "Cinnamon of the Council of Andaluc<0xC3><0xAD>a."
In this way, the "Trienio Zenobia y Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n" comes to an end with the re-edition of this work, with the International Congress that has been held in New York, with the restoration of the Casa Museo del Nobel and with the itinerary exhibition "Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Jiménez: The provincias con viao se trastri<0xC3><0xA1> during the journey of light", which was inaugurated last May.
Also, the Ministry of Culture of the Junta de Andaluc<0xC3><0xAD>a has acquired a total of eight hundred copies of the "Diario de un Poeta Reciencasado", edited by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to continue the dissemination of the figure and work of one of the most universal Andalusian poets.
America Likes Less Without Paul Newman
“Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them.”
The phrase is from actress Sally Field, who worked with him on “Absence of Evil,” and gives the idea of the helplessness of American cinema, and of all of America, in the face of the shocking idea that Newman has left.
It was hard to get an Oscar.
He has been retired since 2007.
And he knew he was very sick.
Still, it has been an apple for everyone.
“Sometimes what one feels is beyond expression, and I have now lost a great friend,” cried Robert Redford, “my life and my country were better because of their existence.”
No one was afraid of being ridiculous or exaggerating.
A father of cinema and homeland had died at a particularly dark time, in fear of terrorists and markets, with American self-esteem for the soil, desperately looking for reasons for dignity.
When time is so hard and without virtue the men and very few beings who admire you remain, it is not necessary to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
It embodied for everyone an almost platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was a formal enemy of Richard Nixon and defender of lost and earned causes, from the drug-fighting foundation created in honor of his first child who died of overdose to his home-made and organic food brand.
A whole gift to a country that has cost a lot to surpass a suicidal food culture.
The expansive wave of admiration barges Hollywood without attending to nationalities or passports.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, found that not one man has died, but one era.
Another Englishman, Oscar-winning director Sam Mendes, said that working with Newman was neither more nor less than the culmination of his career.
The bad boy from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to call Newman his greatest inspiration.
“It has left us all very high,” said George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who today dares to try to live the way Paul Newman lived: maintaining high the requirement of probity and having a serious, away from the cameras private life.
This is not always easy or even possible in today’s media jungle.
But there are those who try, and Paul Newman is his example.
He divorced once but then was married for fifty years to Joanne Woodward, to whom he was faithful when the chances of not being.
"But why am I going to eat burgers out of the house, if I have steak inside?" he used to joke himself.
In the sky, he sees the pride that his daughters on earth coincide with his fans, something not so common in America.
“Of all the great roles he played, no one was as proud as that of a devoted husband, loving father, solitary grandfather and dedicated philanthropist,” they say.
The imperfect race of an Olympic Madrid
Yes, the dream of many of us is that there will be some Olympics in Madrid and, after the 2012 failure, it may be 2016.
But I wonder, are we ready?
If we follow the example of yesterday’s race, I say no!
They called it the perfect race, and I think it’s been the worst race I’ve ever been in.
A plethora of misconceptions that would certainly be a very clear suspension if it were taken into account as an evaluation and I would consider it.
But let’s move on to parts and from the beginning.
The misunderstandings begin with the collection of the dorsal, which makes you have to go before.
Which does not seem bad to me, but if you are already made to go give everything (including the chip to avoid queues in the race).
Well, no.
Here they just made you go to pick up the dorsal (first unintentional, go only for that) and (after the relevant queue), surprise!, there was only size 'S' for the shirt (second unintentional, because I need a size XL)
What world do we live in?
Or is it because of the crisis they have decided to buy only small t-shirts with less fabrics and cheaper?
Well, things like this are a minuscule compared to race day.
In addition to having to go very early to pick up the chip, the queue on arrival is 15 minutes and, in addition, you have to leave the backpack.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, something incomprehensible for a race where more than 11,000 people are expected.
Then, as expected, the race started and we still hadn’t left the backpack, although once we did, the pickup was worse.
In addition, the rain reduced the wait of more than 40 minutes, which combined with connats of popular rebellion and assault on the cassette.
I think about 500 people will probably have pneumonia tomorrow, and some like me won’t even show up at the right time in the rankings, because of the chip they gave me that, I guess, didn’t mark my exit correctly.
Of course, if they asked me about the perfect race, this would not fit into my thoughts.
So I think we will continue to dream of a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft Searches Receptionist (Virtual)
At the MIT Emerging Technologies conference Microsoft has shown a breakthrough of a new system of image recognition and human interaction, a kind of Artificial Intelligence without much intelligence but able to perform some basic tasks, such as asking for a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a shuttle to move around the company at the campus).
Thanks to a camera and a system of recognition of shapes and faces, this "receptionist" can know how many people there are in the room, who they are - even remember what they wear - and listen and understand the keywords of their conversations.
Also group those present according to the conversation groups.
In the video, the receptionist detects a third person but understands that she does not belong to the group she is talking to and that she is not an employee of the company.
He asks if you are there to visit someone and tells you that you will be there soon.
All without blue screen.
Impressive.
But that, of course, is the future.
Now the company has better things to focus on, for example in the next version of its operating system, Windows.
This week has been much talked about over a strategy change at Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and will not have as many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer has discovered that if computers came with the essentials instead of commercial garbage loads, they would go five times faster — man, Steve, it will be for less.
All one finding considering that Microsoft, version after version, has added features and "extras" to Windows.
The change of direction is appreciated.
Microsfot is right, the operating system is losing importance, and also the software.
When Google Chrome came out on the network, I was one of those who joined the theory that it was Google’s first step to competing with Windows.
Many have rightly pointed out that a browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is the essential layer for the hardware and software to be understood.
It performs the same function as your wife or husband when you have to tell your mother-in-law something.
It's true.
It will never disappear, but you have to think of the "death" of the operating system not as an absolute truth, but relative.
What Ballmer has said this week is confirmation of this idea.
People are paying less and less attention to the operating system, and more and more to the web browser.
The computer boots up just to run Firefox or Explorer – or Chrome – and every day we spend more time browsing than in the window environment.
What is half of the applications that come into the system for?
Less is more.
And Windows 7 has to be less, much less, than Vista.
Less heavy, less recharged, less complex.
Microsoft is more interested in integrating its online services and ultimately being an alternative to Google.
They desperately need it, in fact, and I bring a small example.
I took the photo of this post in one of the Microsoft employee rest rooms in Redmond earlier this month.
In the refreshment machine a sign asks them to use their search tool - "Your search. Our future".
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search the web.
Last week, by the way, a delay in the new version of Windows Mobile 7 was also confirmed.
It will not come at the beginning of 2009, but at the end of 2010.
At Microsoft they will surely look for the joint release of Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
After all, the phone is becoming more and more computerized every day.
But the delay, with Android and iPhone already on the street, will pass the bill.
The Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso was wearing it on the C<0xC3><0xB4>te d'Azur, Leonardo di Caprio was wearing one in Edward Zwick's 'Diamond of Blood', the same as Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola's 'El Padrino' and is part of the uniform of the musculata gay parish.
And if we start to list star-appearances, we can go back to the image of that sharp-pointed mustache that was lifting weights in a walking circus.
In essence, it is nothing more than the typical men’s cotton, belted and sleeveless t-shirt.
The 'tank', called by the English speakers, but the Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles stands out over all the others.
First, because of his resounding name - although it is known as 'Marcel' - that has to do with sport because it gets its name, according to legend, from boxer Marcel Cerdan, lover of singer Edith Piaf.
'La Marcel' stands out over the others for its excellent cotton, for its unisex cut, for its distinctive shield and for the small Belgian flag (almost recognizable) that the most iconic t-shirt models wear as a detail on the neck.
And pay attention, because the production of the Belgian firm is not only focused on its tank tops.
Also includes college sweaters, retro boxers, cashmere cardigans, cotton pants, navy shirts, babies, mini shorts...
Clothing designed for the comfort of underwear.
It is a shame to leave them as underwear.
They have too much charm.
"I want to be a young mom; the candidate doesn't care"
His enormous resemblance to his sister has not prevented him from developing his own personality.
Monica Cruz is short but full of vitality.
Currently, the Cruz sisters take their new activity in fashion very seriously.
For Monica, they are much more than some pretty and famous girls who lend their name.
It has been in Paris in the promotion that Mango makes in its new headquarters, in addition to the presentation of the most important fashion awards that the Spanish house sponsors.
Warm and timid, wins at short distances.
Tell us what you do in Paris.
I have come to present the new collection that my sister Penélope and I have devised for Mango in this new fall-winter season, in addition to attending the presentation of the second edition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and the opera dinner in honour of Valentino.
Come on, a very intense but at the same time exciting day.
What is your new collection for Mango based on in this fourth season working for the Spanish house?
Both my sister and I love the cinema of the 50s and 60s; from that we get a lot of references.
Then, I really like to miss out on a city and watch women go dressed, how they combine and mix their clothes, I do a lot.
Dancer, actress and designer, you're a very multifaceted woman, aren't you?
I think so, but in the end, everything comes together and has many ties in common.
I liked clothes when I was little; I wanted to go to my grandmother’s house to rush into my aunt’s closets and see her clothes.
It was the bomb, almost better than going to the amusement park.
Then, as a dancer, I always tried to take care of how I dressed.
You know that dancers like to make our styles for classes and rehearsals, to look in the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of actress when they give you the costume is when you really find the character.
So, everything goes together, that is, with a lot of respect for designers and professionalism.
You turned 30 not long ago, you got into a crisis?
What's going on.
I feel better than ever, I like my 30s.
I find that the woman is made, has experience and tastes life with fewer mistakes.
For me, the biological clock does not scare me.
I’ve done the things I wanted since I was a kid and this has given me a lot of inner happiness.
So are you thinking about being a mother or not?
Of course, I know I’m going to be a mother because my body asks for it and I also want to be a young mother; I don’t want to miss it.
As for the candidate, I'm not worried.
What I will do is give my son a lot of happiness and educate him with a lot of love.
As for the cinema, you’re waiting for several premieres that you shot last year.
That’s the way it is and I’m looking forward to seeing the light.
I, who am a woman who comes from the theater, I am very impatient and restless, I want everything for now and of course, it cannot be.
I look forward to the release of ‘Last Hour’ and ‘In Search of the Tomb of Christ’.
See what they look like...
You made your debut on a walkway with Naomi Campbell a few days ago, didn't you?
Well, well, don't say that.
It's not like I'm going up a runway to model.
Simply called me Naomi Campbell, whom I’ve known for a long time, to invite me to go to London to participate in a charity parade for her organization Women for a Better World, and the clothes we showed — I took two pieces from our collection for Mango — were auctioned off to raise money for this NaNG.
People don't know Naomi's tender heart.
There are so many things said about her that, I know her, I would tell you that many are not true.
Besides, I'm stuck with that good part that she gets involved in.
He asked me to parade for such a noble cause, but if he came to ask me to make the pine, so too.
For the benefit of third world women, whatever is needed.
Drivers recurring from alcoholism will have to install the ‘alcolock’
Interior wants the driver with three administrative penalties for alcoholism, to have to install in his vehicle a system that prevents the vehicle from starting drunk, or if it is not blown.
The initiative was announced last June and is now included in the annual memo of the State Attorney General, according to which it is a pilot project that will last one year.
Its purpose is the reinsertion of the driver, so the driver will also receive a road re-education course.
In addition to the General Road Safety Prosecutor’s Office, the Directorate General of Traffic (DGT) and the Fundaci<0xC3><0xB3>n Instituto Tecnol<0xC3><0xB3>gico para la Seguridad del Automobile (FITSA) will participate in the experience.
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of motorists reported more than once for driving drunks pick up the car again.
The alcohol lock would avoid this as it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the rate of alcohol in the exhausted air and prevents the car from starting if the driver does not blow abs; or when an alcohol concentration is detected is higher than the allowed concentration.
Its cost is more than 1,000 euros and would run for the sanctioned.
In this sense, a study conducted in the US in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with these devices reduce violations by up to 65% during the first year of deployment.
And in Spain it is estimated that it could save lives of 115 people each year.
The measure is subject to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to address such behaviours before they result in criminal offences.
And to facilitate its implementation, since legal reform can be done by ordinary means, and yet the reform necessary by criminal means requires reform in an organic law.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial mode, although it has already been experimentally deployed in some industrial and utility vehicles.
Precisely tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote tomorrow on a PSOE initiative in which it is proposed to install this system on school buses, just as it has been carried out in France.
In Mexico and without 'peep-toes'
At 5.40 p.m., the scheduled time in the program, the aircraft of the Spanish air force on which the Princes of Asturias traveled landed at the presidential Hangar of Benito Ju<0xC3><0xA1>rez Airport in Mexico DF.
The sun was retreating but its rays still forced the hand to use as a visor to see the real couple get off the plane.
Walking stairs, the Spanish ambassador and other authorities.
Hours earlier, he had asked the taxi driver if he knew that the Spanish Princes were visiting the city to formalize an official trip.
- Ah, very good, then you can't go to the airport to charge at that time... she's from here or something...
- No, no, sir, she's Spanish, but she lived here for a couple of years.
- Ah, very good...
But the Mexican press does know very well who the Princes of Asturias are and the importance of the trip.
Many are waiting in the airport hangar glued to the red carpet and a military fence made up of 27 naval soldiers who interpret the salvage of honor.
The Prince appears smiling, dressed in navy blue, and she, the Princess, melancholy to the wind, very sober, does not use her usual 'peep-toes', perhaps they had informed him that in the DF he was threatening storm.
They give a smile and a pause to the photographers before moving to the room where the official committee is waiting.
At the door of the hotel in which they are staying, one of the city’s four greats, a reporter from Mexican television is waiting for them.
The best gifted award in fashion
There is probably no place in the world more appropriate to present a fashion award than Paris and there is probably no living designer more exquisite and bont vivant than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of the El But<0xC3><0xB3>n-Mango Fashion Awards, to enhance the international projection of new fashion talents.
It is endowed with a prize of 300,000 euros.
Yesterday, Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at her designs at the Mango stand at number 54 on Paris’s Haussmann Boulevard and almost wept with excitement.
By the way, it is the second largest store of the firm in Europe and has just opened with 1,335 square meters of surface area.
The first is in London.
So many events, coupled with the desire to thank the designer Valentino who presided over the jury of the contest, led us to a luxurious dinner at the Opera Garnier in Paris.
With the proximity of the most exquisite Chagals, the presidential gala table prepared by Mango, looked even more spectacular.
Nati, with a broken heart of grief and heartbreaking, by the recent death of his brother, put on a suit of the House and a suit of ELAH, which cut off his breath, and the arm of his son Luis - a cannon almost two meters long - accompanied Valentino in his presidency.
Andik, the owner and lord of Mango, did the honours, and he was so gentleman that he ended up, next to the baron of Rotchil, without a jacket, because both had been lent to two ladies.
M<0xC3><0xB3>nica Cruz, who came to the store with pants and shirt - of her own design - and for dinner she was transformed in a sexy black long dress, was excited when on the night walk through the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, we were taught the bargo ballet rehearsal room and she'd bend 'a' she's, remembering to other times.
Inés Sastre did not stay for the walk through the palace’s dependencies, but he previously showed us on the mobile phone photos of his son.
The next morning we were able to enjoy the view with the presence of Olivier Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez - another cannon that moves by motorcycle - and by John Travolta, who arrived at the intercontinental hotel in Paris, with his sheets, his towels and having previously ordered, that there be no smells in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh, that's life.
1001, the anti-stress number
There are not 1000 but 1000 more ways to forget the chaotic and frenetic everyday life.
And by the way, they are all gathered in a book that will bring relaxation to bookstores on September 30th.
The alarm clock almost punishes when it sounds every morning at 7 a.m., but it’s even worse to imagine yourself wrapped up in the hectic rhythm that life imposes today.
The office is called tension and the computer back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there are not one or two methods to combat daily exhaustion and problems of disconnection from the working world.
No, the number amounts to, nothing more and nothing less, than 1001.
Apart from yoga positions, classic massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott brings together in the pages of a book a whole menu of possibilities adapted to the taste and minutes of each one.
The anti-stress work is called '1001 Ways to Relax' and its calm will reach the bookstores at the hands of the Pearson Alhambra and DK publishing houses.
If one considers that it is not possible to achieve peace of mind in areas such as work or through personal relationships, this 'manual' denies such belief.
In addition, it offers other procedures such as being in contact with nature or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If adrenaline no longer runs through your veins to restore your body’s balance and stress has become a problem, it’s time to sit on the couch, disconnect your mind and focus on reading.
Talking Sleeping
Some kids talk at night.
I don’t mean those who wake up very sluggish telling us something that happened the day before, but children who talk while they’re asleep.
The first time it happens, you probably get scared, but it doesn’t really matter.
It is a benign sleep disorder called somniloquios.
It is quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
I'm sure more than one person has been told that he spoke at night.
This phenomenon can occur very sporadically (once in life, for example, associated with an episode of high fever), or more periodically (every day, once a week, once a month...), the next day the child remembers nothing.
There is no single cause that determines their appearance.
They are often related to other sleep disorders such as nightmares, night terrors, nighttime enuresis (sleeping) or sleepwalking, but they don’t have to be.
As we have already mentioned above, they can also be associated with very high fevers, stressful situations or over-excitement.
It is an unstudied phenomenon.
The intensity with which it appears is also very variable.
It may be that he speaks in a calm tone of voice, loose words, a whisper or the opposite (crying, crying, long speeches...).
In cases where the manifestation is very intense it would be advisable to observe the child and consult with a specialist, to check if there is any issue that is generating a lot of anxiety and gives him a way out.
We have said that it is a benign disorder, so it has no treatment, unless it is associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, if it is associated with sleep apnea or a stress disorder).
What you can do is take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excite the child much before going to bed.
Therefore, look for quiet games and avoid programs or TV series that are scary or a little violent.
With children who are very nervous and find it very difficult to relax, relaxation techniques can be used to help them gain some inner calm.
This will help the child to have a quieter sleep.
Once the somnolence appears try to keep calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the next day he will remember nothing of what has happened.
Useful Advice
Don't wake him up.
It is useless, because he is not conscious, and you will break his sleep.
Even though he's talking, he's sleeping and so he's resting.
Remember that if you are very anxious during several episodes you should consult or find out what is causing so much anxiety in the child.
If he understands what he says (which is not the usual thing), do not fall into the temptation to interrogate him for information.
You will not achieve anything, because when you are asleep you are not aware of how to organize your thinking.
Moreover, you will hear what it says, but you do not know what it is dreaming to say that, with great care in how you interpret the information and with the conclusions you draw.
Never tell the child that you can interrogate him at night to find out his secrets.
Not even a joke.
That generates a lot of anxiety.
In short, don’t worry, it’s not bad, it’s an episode that only lasts a few minutes.
Illhaeusern at last!
The football club, Illhaeusern, finally found the way to victory in his field after a long period of scarcity.
Without having made a good game, the team created many goals and was able to score a goal to win the game.
The pace was not very constant during this meeting in which the aggressors had difficulty expressing themselves.
After a first attempt by Captain Kauffmann to smash the squadron with a shot from a distance, Illhaeusern almost went to take the "power" and in turn Fonderflick away, then with Hirn up, Romain with the tip of the foot or also Diebold came to prevent Dannemarie's defense.
In front, we did not let the midfielder pass and left only Riahi in attacking position.
The start of the second half was crucial, first with two goals from Riahi and Temporale for Dannemarie, and immediately after the opening of the scoring for the Illhousiens with the goal from Marais, well positioned to pick up the ball rejected in a first attempt from Diebold (53').
But the goalkeeper Illhousiens will not be able to taste his happiness for a long time and will be forced to return to the wardrobe a dozen minutes later and thus leave his teammates in numerical inferiority.
But Dannemarie will not take the opportunity and will not be a problem for the eleven illhousiens who stepped back a bit to "compress" their defense, except in the last seconds of the game during which, after a major flyer, the ball passed very close to the cross-field.
Sarkozy Meets Angry Fishermen
Before taking off to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will give a rodeo for Britain.
Faced with a demonstration of resistance by fishermen who severely disturbed the entrances of several Breton and Norman ports last Monday, the President of the Republic decided to go to the port of Guilvinec, in the Finist<0xC3><0xA8>re, last Tuesday morning to meet his representatives.
They promised to welcome him " with a constructive spirit " and hoped that he would " come up with concrete proposals " .
This presidential visit coincides with the general meeting of the " crisis committee " set up by the Breton fishermen to obtain measures against the rise in the price of diesel, which sets a record at 1.14 euros per litre.
According to Elysee spokesman David Martinon, the president “will discuss with them solutions that can be imagined to help their businesses become competitive again and to save the conditions of employment and salaries of sailors”.
The fishermen are waiting for Nicolas Sarkozy on foot.
On Tuesday morning, they carried out operations to reduce traffic in the Morbihan and Calvados, which have caused traffic jams of almost 10 km.
The port of Quiberon has also been blocked, but connections to Belle-<0xC3><0x8E>le have not been halted.
" A filtering barrier " has been placed on the Quiberon peninsula.
Sailors have already shown their determination on Monday by burning the dawn, tires and wooden pallets in front of fuel tanks at the ports of Brest and Lorient, while demonstrations took place in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports on the Atlantic coast and the Channel, such as Les Sables d'Olonne, Vandea, where the bous remained at the port, or Le Havre, where about twenty ships blocked the movements of the merchant ships.
The fishermen of La Turballe and Croisic, in the Loire-Atlantic region, in the afternoon stopped the blockade of the important refinery Total de Donges.
The fishermen of Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait until this Wednesday's meeting that will take place at the ministry to think about possible actions.
In Guilvinec, the " crisis committee " will have to think Tuesday about the development of the movement and its participation in the planned meeting at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen don’t want to be represented by the leaders of the National Fisheries Committee, which did not support their movement.
" The strike will continue " because " the fishermen did not leave " and " do not want to move to Paris " , for example, announced Liliane Cariou, chairman of the Lorient Fisheries Committee.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay taxes on diesel, currently pay about 50 cents per litre but consider that the financial balance point of a ship can be reached with only one diesel at a price of less than 0.30 euros per litre.
The Magnificent Paul Newman
The unforgettable performer of " Two Men and a Destiny " died of cancer at the age of 83 at his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and also Sam Mendes greeted the film legend and the engaged actor, Paul Newman, who has died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its delivery forecast for 2008
The Brazilian aeronautics company has 215 aircraft delivered this year despite the recession threats that weigh on the world economy.
Embraer, the world’s fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer, maintains its 2008 delivery forecast with 215 delivered aircraft, Embraer’s president, Fredrico Fleury Curado, said in a statement.
During the first half, the company delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer relies heavily on the Chinese market particularly to sell planes ranging from 30 to 120 seats.
Today, Embraer delivered 41 devices to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG intends to sell more than 15% of its assets
The American International Group, which has been pulled out of trouble thanks to the U.S. monetary authorities, intends to sell more than 15 percent of its assets with the goal of repaying its $85 billion loan, according to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times.
AIG is willing to study the sale of most of its services beyond its international life insurance and retirement insurance in the United States.
AIG’s board of directors met last Sunday afternoon to examine possible sales, according to the Financial Times.
No confirmation could be obtained from AIG.
The assets AIG intends to separate from include its air leasing subsidiary, International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in the insurer Transatlantic Holdings as well as its real estate portfolio and private equity investments, the Financial Times adds.
No definitive decision has been made on these sales, the Financial Times said.
AIG must quickly liquidate to repay its $85 billion loan granted by the Federal Reserve at risk of US authorities taking 80% of its capital, diluting it with the right proportion among current shareholders.
Analysis of the historic session of the Paris Stock Exchange
The New York Stock Exchange blamed a historic fall on Monday after the House rejected Paulson’s plan to save the banks: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, or a loss never seen on the stock market by nearly 800 points, and the Nasdaq by 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Index fell from 777.68 to 10.365.45 points.
In terms of points, the most significant drop in its history (684.81 points) had been recorded in the past on September 17, 2001, the day on which exchanges resumed after the September 11 terrorist attacks.
The Nasdaq technology-dominant index dropped 199.61 points to 1,983.73 units and the Standard & Poor's 500 expanded by 8.81% (i.e. 106.85 points), to 1,106.55 units, according to the definitive closing figures.
Already depressed by the crisis at the beginning of the session, Wall Street sank after the unexpected rejection by the House of Representatives of the plan to save banks that would have allowed to regain some stability in the markets.
With 228 votes against and 205 in favour, representatives denied U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson the media he requested.
About two out of every three Republicans rejected their plan.
“That’s not a good signal sent to the market, which Congress sees as unable to adopt a plan,” said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
“This shows how much the market was counting on this plan,” added Lindsey Piegza, fearing that a project adopted within several days would come “too late.”
“If the project is really dying ... the Fed and other central banks will quickly take over (the U.S. central bank, the N. of the Network) to manage the crisis, which would further tighten credit conditions,” said Brian Bethune, head of Economics and Finance at Global Insight.
And further accentuating the sense of urgency, " every day that passes, the fall of a financial institution is announced " in the United States, Ms. Piegza stressed.
Following the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual last Friday, authorities organized the purchase of Wachovia’s banking activities by its rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis accelerated dramatically, prompting emergency interventions for the benefit of banks in the UK, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, which shows that markets are facing “not only a crisis in the U.S. but a global crisis,” FTN Financial analyst added.
The bond market has risen drastically.
The yield of the 10-year bond went down by 3.632 percent, from 3.827 percent on Friday afternoon, and the 30-year bond by 4.161 percent, from 3.357 percent on the day before.
Obama wins first televised duel
In Friday’s first debate between the two candidates in the White House, another one happened to find out who has triumphed between John McCain and Barack Obama.
Unsurprisingly, Republican and Democratic campaign headquarters declared their own victory in this televised duel that has been followed by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes John McCain’s performance, although honorable, was not “brilliant enough” to allow him to slow his down in polls five weeks after the presidential election.
The Gallup Institute, whose public opinion poll published last Saturday gives Obama five points of advantage (49 percent versus 44 percent for McCain), judges that it is the Democrat who did well.
Among the undecided voters, who are the ones who count, Obama came out victorious with 39% of the respondents, while 25% of them concede victory to McCain, according to a CBS poll.
Obama could confirm his advantage on Thursday with the expected good performance of his own running mate, José Biden, during the first and only public debate with his rival, Sara Palin.
It would be a mistake to underestimate it.
He has good instincts,” I warned Bill Clinton this weekend.
The septuagenary McCain highlighted his undisputed foreign policy experience, emphasizing his opponent’s “naivety” on these issues that were at the heart of this first quarry.
"Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that... " he accused several times.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge to be president," he said.
These words have been repeated since yesterday in Republican television commercials.
Obama said he represented the future.
Without being confused, it proved concise and precise.
He emphasized his ability to make good decisions, and to restore the image of the United States in the world.
“McCain has not yet understood, while Obama has already understood,” he replied, this weekend, a Democratic television ad that criticized the Republican for not considering the importance of the impact of the crisis on Americans.
“During the ninety minutes of debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you,” Obama reported, in front of 20,000 people who had gathered for an election meeting in North Carolina in a rainy season.
He did not pronounce the words "middle class" or "workers." "The financial defeat clearly favors Obama, who is considered by the Americans as the most capable character to save the economy that is on the edge of the precipice.
"Next week could be a decisive episode," said influential and Democratic Senator Charles Schumer.
Democratic Representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama’s “good economic instincts” to those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
According to the Democratic candidate, the current financial disaster "is the final eight-year consequence of a poor economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain".
Reaffirming that it would nevertheless come to cut taxes on 95 percent of Americans despite the Wall Street booms, the Illinois senator also noted that achieving an eventual energy independence of the country thanks to the promotion of renewable energies was his first priority, with the creation of a security and health system.
McCain wants to build a fleet of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
Prudently, both candidates shunned issues related to the $700 billion (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>470 billion) financial bailout plan adopted yesterday afternoon by Congress and extremely unpopular.
" In Minsk, " Have you noticed the elections in Minsk? "
Young people and opponents demonstrated last Sunday afternoon in the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject in advance the results of the legislature.
Hundreds of Belarusians gathered on Sunday afternoon from the closure of electoral centers in Minsk’s central square to protest the fraudulent nature of the legislature.
While no results had yet been announced, numerous young people had come to protest against the power of President Alexander Loukachenko: "the dictator, he has to resign".
Some admit that they didn’t vote: “Why, because they will do what they want with my vote,” says one young man.
They do not believe that the regime that put foreign observers in good shape in order to renew contact with the European Union is willing to make a democratic change.
Sanctions, including the visa ban for 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections are considered clean for observers.
They were not according to the opposition.
"We have been placed beside the electoral commissions and our observers were unable to participate in the counting of the votes," said Yuri Potemkine, spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous regrouping of twelve parties.
“It’s a cosmetic change,” emphasizes Alexandre Milinkievitch, a former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-European movement, because the important thing is who counts the votes, and in our house, it’s the executive power.
If some opposition MPs enter parliament, it is because they have been appointed but not elected.
" But his entry into parliament may mean television appearances, regional meetings and bills. "
The opposition must therefore enter the political game because " the dialogue with the European Union must begin.
Because if our economy, which has a lot of debt to Russia, goes into crisis, and if we don’t reform, we run the risk of becoming a protectorate of Russia.
But we want to be independent.”
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe that followed the electoral process will not recognize the validity of the vote.
He underlined that participation figures appeared too high, and that the early generalization of the vote (26 per cent of voters in Minsk) favored manipulation.
"Have you noticed the elections? Ask Social Democratic leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
There was no one in the polling stations.
And there will be a maximum of five deputies from the opposition to parliament, those who are best suited to power. "
The silence of the night returns again to the square in October.
On television, President Loukachenko and members of the Central Electoral Commission congratulated him on his success.
The interview - Blood is safe again
Héma-Québec celebrated its 10th anniversary of its founding yesterday, and its president, Francine Décary, was right to rejoice, because Héma-Québec has once again become one of the safest and most effective blood suppliers in the world.
And above all, it regained public confidence that had been seriously hampered by the contaminated blood scandal in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is known, the national blood reserves administered by the Canadian Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service have been contaminated by the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
Faced with this drama and public discontent, in February 1994 the Government of Canada conducted a public survey, chaired by Judge Horacio Krever, which sought to clarify the circumstances that had led to such a tragedy and to make recommendations so that such a disaster would not happen again.
While Judge Krever was late to present his relationship, certain provinces then created a committee aimed at planning a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee fulfilled this mission.
As a result of the Gélineau and Krever reports, two suppliers have been created in Canada: Héma-Québec to supply Quebec and the Canadian Blood Society to supply all other provinces and both territories.
" In 1998, when Héma-Québec began its activities, nearly 38 per cent of people still had confidence in the blood system in Quebec, recalls Décary.
The situation was disheartening.
Having made many efforts to improve the safety of blood products and a lot of work over the years that followed, we have regained public confidence,” he says before proudly asserting that at the beginning of 2008, about 94% of the Quebec population had confidence in what followed in Héma-Québec.
Dr. Décary recalls, however, that " trust is something extremely fragile " .
Since its inception on 28 September 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
At that time, we witnessed in Europe the birth of numerous cases of the human variant of mad cow disease, a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, says Décary.
And we didn't know if this disease could be transmitted by blood.
Then we relied on one of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau reports, according to which when we do not know and when a serious disease can emanate from that, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease characterized by brain degeneration that inevitably leads to death, we instituted exclusion measures.
In April 1999, we denied the blood of people who had stayed in the UK for more than a month since 1980.
But, a few years ago, it has been proven beyond any doubt that this disease is transmitted by blood.
This episode showed us so that the precautionary principle that was applied made sense.”
In 1999, a much more sensitive HIV detection technique appeared on the market: nucleic acid tests that allow donors to detect the presence of the virus directly in the blood rather than antibody against the virus, on which the tests used so far were based.
Nucleic acid tests allowed to shorten the period between the time the person has been infected and the time when the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, explains the specialist.
We were able to reduce this period by less than a week.
We thus substantially reduce the risk that certain donors become infected without knowing it and that we cannot detect them.
These improvements significantly reduced the risk of contracting AIDS through a blood transfusion.
Today, one person in every 12 million is at risk of receiving HIV-contaminated blood.
“That means we’ll have to distribute 12 million blood products before someone gets infected with HIV.
As Héma-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood products each year, it will take more than 24 years for a case of transmission of HIV by a blood product to occur.
I think that today you can receive or prescribe a blood transfusion to regain health without worry,” says the head of the management of Héma-Québec.
“Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
You never know which pathogen could emerge in the system.
Last year, the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Reunion, which, for example, is transmitted by an insect in the blood.
You have to be constantly vigilant,” Dr. Décary said before stressing that in addition to a safe supply, Héma-Québec should also provide for a sufficient supply.
" Needs are increasing because the population is aging.
Because anti-cancer treatments are more aggressive, patients often need an injection of red blood cells or platelets.
Aging of the population also has consequences for the blood donor network, which on average brings together only 3% of Quebecers eligible for blood donation. "
All people with good health, 18 years of age and who meet the eligibility criteria, can still donate blood every 56 days, or six times a year.
On average, 14% of people who propose their blood are not accepted because they suffer from AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have traveled to a country where malaria occurs, they will be excluded for a period of one year.
" With this 3%, we managed to maintain an inventory that covered the needs of hospitals.
Deficiencies are very rare.
But members of this network of donors must be renewed as they age and can no longer donate their blood.
But it’s hard to convince people to donate their blood, but above all to hold them back and encourage them to be regular donors.
Since today’s life is very unbridled, we rarely find the time to spend an hour donating their blood,” Francine Décary laments.
With a budget of $297 million annually, Héma-Québec supplies not only blood products, but also human tissues, including bone grafts, heart valves, eyeballs and skin that is almost exclusively used for large burns.
These tissues are analyzed, transformed and frozen before being stored in Hema-Québec, which also manages the only public umbilical cord blood bank in Quebec.
The umbilical cord that was once considered biomedical waste is filled with blood rich in stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases such as leukemia.
"We celebrated a few weeks ago, putting on the bench our thousandth sample of blood from the umbilical cord and it is expected to take out more than a thousand of these per year.
We would have to start proposing it for grafts early next year,” says Dr. Décary who describes this cord blood-taking program as very popular.
" Many mothers are disappointed not to be able to enjoy this " , since Héma-Québec does not have the resources to propose this complex and expensive program in all hospitals in Quebec.
Softball - The Impact on the Semifinals
The Montreal Impact qualified for the semi-finals of the USL First Division qualifiers, thanks to a 3-1 (4-3 in short) win at the Seattle Sounders yesterday, during the second and decisive match of the quarter-final series, at Saputo Stadium.
Midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal in the 90th minute of the game.
After the first goalless time on either side, midfielder David Testo and Rocco Plancentino created many goals.
Roger Levesque was the only one to beat Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
Let’s remember that during the first game of the round-trip series, on Friday, the Impact had suffered a 2-1 defeat at Starfire Complex, in Tukwila, in the suburb of Seattle.
The impact will be measured at the Vancouver Whitecaps in the semi-finals.
On Saturday afternoon in Minnesota, the Thunder lost 3-1 in the game back to take him 4-3, but the Whitecaps still reached the semi-finals by 5-4.
The Impact is expected to face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the series will be confirmed today.
In short – Kovalev’s victorious goal
The number one Canadian trio is ready to start the season.
The unit composed of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn encouraged the attack in a 3-2 win of the Canadian to the free throws barrier against the Florida Panthers last night at the Bell Center.
Kostitsyn, the first star of the match, scored a goal, Plekanec amassed two assists, and Kovalev picked up a pass in this win, the fourth of the Tricolor in six preparatory games.
Kovalev gave the victory by scoring the only goal.
"I'm not ready yet, the Russian warned.
"I need another game to feel comfortable."
He tried to play the most in the first half, Guido Carbonneau noted.
But I think he appreciated the end of the game.
He had a beautiful ovation."
Charest takes care of the North
The Prime Minister does not rule out launching elections before the end of the year
As soon as the general council of the Liberal Party is over, Jean Charest went yesterday to Juan-Talon, Quebec, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc (left), tries to get elected during today’s partial election.
Rejecting the boundaries of our last great northern border " : that is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented with visual force, remaining on the front lines, at the end of the General Council of the Liberal Party of Quebec, in Lévis, yesterday.
Behind him, during his speech, images were projected.
They paraded, on three huge screens, spectacular images of hydroelectric reservoirs, mining, from Quebec seen by "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Great media as during the election period.
The prime minister thinks the elections will take place this fall, although he showed that his schedule was very busy.
The “Northern Plan” is the fourth side of a “vision” that the Prime Minister intends to have for Quebec, that of a “new economic space”, which includes a labour agreement with France, an alliance between Canada and Europe, and harmonies with Ontario.
Often mentioned in the Prime Minister's recent speeches, the opening of the North - the northern territory to the 49th parallel - had never been the subject of a presentation.
The Prime Minister, however, limited himself to explaining why the North was " a jewel of immense potential " , but did not give a term, investment amounts, or precise priority in future projects.
What could be especially more developed are: particularly hydroelectricity, forestry, but above all the mining sector, doped by the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
The North contains " nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and also diamond ", according to the enumeration of Mr. Charest.
This "territory twice as big as France," is our home, it's in Quebec.
It’s not just our home, it’s in us,” he insisted, as if to show that he was asking for a national founder myth.
Quebec was built a lot thanks to its relationship with the North, he emphasized: the laughter towards gold in Abitibi, Quebec engineering, James Bay.
“It belongs to us, it’s our future,” he added, after taking a theatrical break to contemplate the immense map behind him.
The North, 70% of Quebec territory, comprises a part of the Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, the Prime Minister said during the press conference.
" It is a traditional position that all governments have reiterated.
There is a border line on which they have not agreed for a long time and, when the opportunity arises, I repeat that position on the part of the government,” he said.
In addition, “with climate change, we need to rethink our vision of the North,” he said speaking of the Northwest Passage, which will open every year due to melting ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister believes that occupying the territory is a duty.
What about the inhabitants of the territory, the First Nations and the Inuit?
The prime minister said the Quebec government would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, particularly young people.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former deputy of the Quebec Ungava party), have already begun consultations with about thirty communities.
An interministerial committee chaired by Beno<0xC3><0xAE>t Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) has an important role began some work.
The Prime Minister does not exclude an important meeting, " not necessarily a summit " , but a meeting at which " a common vision will be given " .
The development of the North would be done in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan “will be concerted, orderly and environmentally friendly,” he promised.
Jean Charest described this “vision” as one that is in continuity with that of the liberal prime ministers who preceded it.
" Like the liberals who preceded us, we have thought differently to transform challenges into new opportunities for growth and development."
This was one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which began on Friday with a great cocktail to highlight the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage’s arrival to party power.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to rename the Beauharnois Central in the Adélard-Godbout Basin.
“De Godbout, who created HydroQuebec, in Lesage who made the Quiet Revolution and the nationalization of hydroelectricity, in Bourassa who made James Bay our party knew how to forge the future,” said Juan Charest.
At the press conference, he invoked another reference, that conservative, the program "Roads to the North" by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
Addressing the theme of the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric reservoir project, Mr. Charest stressed that its commissioning is scheduled for 2012.
"This stays among us, but I expect to be there," he confided to his militants, arousing applause.
Indeed, the prime minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008 and certainly not in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of running a vote this fall, which the law allows.
He stresses that his schedule is nevertheless full, particularly due to a federation council mission in China and a Quebec-New York summit.
The weekend general council provided the head of the Liberals with a platform containing nationalist resolutions, particularly " constitutional aspirations " that had no problems to be accepted: the Liberal Party of Quebec in particular called for the recognition of the " specificity of Quebec " in the Constitution.
It also wishes Quebec to appoint members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council and to veto decisions taken in Quebec.
On the opposition side, we welcome the broad lines of the North Plan with scepticism.
The head of the Quebec party, Pauline Marois, highlighted the Northern Quebec Development Policy that the Landry government had launched in 2001.
According to her, the liberal government, coming to power in 2003, relinquished its application.
If I had done so, "we would have made progress today," Marois said alongside her candidate in Jean-Talon (vote held today), Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise Mercure.
Quebec’s Democratic Action seemed to support the government’s adoption of a Northern Plan.
"But what is desired is that this is not just a show," said leader Sebastien Proulx, replacing Mario Dumont, who returns on holiday today.
Letras - A Dishonored Country
It is Mr. Vic Toews, former Minister of Justice (oh irony!) at Harper’s cabinet, who was allowed to say last summer that Luisa Arbour was a “shame” for Canada.
Dishonoring this woman who waged a relentless fight for justice and who deserves all our admiration for what he says about the relations between the Prime Minister and Stephen Harper.
We are facing a government that is the only one, among all the Western countries involved, that has not repatriated its national who is locked in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
It is a government that does not take into account in any way the fact that Omar Khadr was a very young teenager when the facts that are recriminated to him occurred.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada signed the Geneva Convention, rejects its promise and leaves an inhuman child soldier to live in.
The only one who faces a false justice to assess the guilt of the accused.
Recall that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association, in particular, support the repatriation of Omar Khadr in order for him to enjoy the benefits of a fair process in Canada.
It is this government that closes its eyes to torture: it does not care that a young adult is psychologically destroyed, no doubt forever after so many years of exasperation.
We do not yet realize that, but at this moment we are witnessing an insidious erosion of our rights, of our freedom and of our “democracy,” that is the word that Harper continues to repeat and that makes no sense.
The time has come when there is no more morality: we can mistreat, torture, arbitrarily imprison a Canadian citizen as the head of government so far a minority wants (what will happen after October 14?).
Many voters believe that they will find salvation in a party that praises Virtue, Law and Order: they do not see that this government gave up our country’s reputation and dignity.
Mr. Toews, shame is caused by this resignation and nothing more.
Free Opinion - Barrick Gold's Orwellian Speech
In its September 17 edition, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, Vice President and Director of Canadian Mining Barrick Gold.
Following an Orwellian logic, Barrick Gold claims that the world’s largest gold company attempted a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6 million defamation lawsuit against three authors and a small publishing house in order to provoke a “transparent public debate”.
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth that they judge, especially in the case of defamation persecution, but the law.
Not surprisingly, this fundamental difference is completely concealed by Mr. Garver.
Why, according to Barrick Gold, would the best way to conduct a public debate be to harm anyone who dares to hold a position contrary to his?
The outcome of the lawsuit is of little importance, and the authors and publisher of the book Noir Canada will have to spend considerable sums in order to prepare their defense and to fight, with very unequal weapons, against an army of lawyers supported by the almost bottomless pockets of the mine.
The tactic, in these unequal struggles, is often to ruin the defendants in order to impose a friendly arrangement that will dampen the opposition as well as scare anyone who will dare to re-examine the issue.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it is in front of the public that he would have had to present his view of the facts.
Contrary to what is done in several of the countries where Barrick Gold works, debates in Canada are usually done by changing ideas and not by bluffing.
It was therefore enough for the miner to open her books, her files and establish a real debate, through the newspapers, the media, the publications and the financing of independent search teams that could have clarified the issue.
But Barrick Gold does not seem to trust public opinion and rejects petitions and letters of support for Noir Canada’s authors.
Could Mr. Garver possibly explain how he can ask for a “public” debate by disregarding the views of this one?
According to the Vice President, this word seems to refer only to high-paying lawyers and not to all Canadians; that represents a very limited view of the concept.
In a democracy, detractors also have the right to speak.
What Barrick Gold doesn’t understand — or doesn’t want to understand — is that the public that supports Noir Canada’s authors and publishers does so mainly because it rejects the brutal manner of mining.
This public is willing to listen to Barrick and judge him, but based on civilized changes of arguments, and not in the context of what many people perceive as a persecution-bittery (following the "public debate", Barrick Gold has just filed a demand with respect to the authors of Noir Canada rather than intimidating them).
In addition to Mr. Garver’s surreal speech, the Barrick Gold trial is a direct attack on the freedom of university search and truth, essential to all democratic societies.
It denies the right to cite credible sources and debate facts and interpretations, which represent the basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible to study and discuss topics that dislike the rich companies of this world in a country like Canada, under the penalty of many persecutions, who will be able to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, he could do so by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada.
You have a right of reply.
The university world, to which we belong, has long been able to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold’s disproportionate persecution clearly shows that, contrary to what he claims, he does not want to make a transparent debate.
It is a loss for the academic world, but also for public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to put in place devices that limit this kind of abusive persecution.
Wall Street Rescue Operation - Democrats and Republicans agree
The Bush administration and Congressional leaders, both Republicans and Democrats, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the most important economic bailout plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the $700 billion plan that aims to curb the financial crisis that has rocked Wall Street for months has yet to be confirmed by both Houses of Congress.
It provides, in particular, for better control by the elect of its implementation, of new mechanisms aimed at ensuring the reimbursement of public money invested, of new provisions to contain the number of houses embargoed the non-payment, as well as a right to control the salaries paid to the managers of the aided companies.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and Republican Representative at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news minutes after midnight yesterday, after a two-day marathon of negotiations.
“We are making great progress towards an agreement that will be effective in markets,” said Bush administration representative Henry Paulson.
“Everything has been done to cover up the economy and ordinary Americans in the face of the current crisis on Wall Street,” she said.
“It’s the fundamental point: if we don’t do this, the trauma, the chaos and the disturbances on Americans’ daily lives will be immense,” Republican Judd Gregg said.
Negotiations had ended very quickly in the last few hours because they feared the effect that would cause a further failure in the mood of investors.
The last hour that had been set was the opening of the markets this morning.
The two candidates in the U.S. presidential election, who have joined late in the negotiations, were more in favour of the deal, not forgetting, however, expressing their discontent with being forced to reach this end.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama was given certain arrangements to reach an agreement, particularly one that would allow owners to keep their homes and the one on the salaries of the leaders of the surviving companies by the state.
" When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary action because of the irresponsibility of some, no congratulations are to be made.
But these measures are necessary,” he said on American television.
His Republican opponent, John McCain, interrogated in another chain to know if he would vote for the proposed plan, replied that: "I would like to see the details, but I hope to vote for it."
"The important points I read [show] that it is something that we will have to digest and with which we will be able to move forward.
He said the option of not doing anything is not acceptable.”
The $700 billion plan aims to buy from taxpayers’ money the dubious debts, assets to risks, and unsellables of U.S. financial institutions.
It comes after 14 months of a crisis triggered by the burst of a real estate bubble that first led to the sinking of risky mortgage loans before extending to other more common forms of credit securities (PCAA) and causing a freeze of liquidity and a ban on banks and financial institutions.
It is a group of elected Republicans who had changed the first draft agreement last week.
We believe that we have come out of stagnation since the Democrats accepted that certain “toxic” assets of companies in difficulty are only insured by the government, rather than purchased.
With the aim of clearing the atrocities for everyone in Congress, we also added a provision that if the government had to assume losses for five years with this program, it could impose new rates that would intend to help it recover money.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first part of $250 billion, to which another 100 billion can be added if the president finds it necessary.
The payment of another 350 billion would have to be confirmed by another vote from Congress.
Instead of his help, Washington will get stakes in the aided companies that will be worth dividends in case of profits and that it can resell when the storm passes.
The federal government will have the option of delaying the embargo procedures concerning housing obtained with real estate loans under this plan, as well as setting limits on remuneration and on cash compensation paid to business leaders affected by the crisis.
The architects of the plan would like to see it submitted to the vote of the House of Representatives from today and that of the Senate next Wednesday.
Despite all their efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will be approved.
Some people continued to protest yesterday against this project, both on the part of Republicans and Democrats.
Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House Finance Committee, told his constituents that “with all evidence, Washington does not want to understand.”
"We have a very serious financial problem.
There are solutions.
But it’s not about taking advantage of taxpayers.”
Democratic Representative Brad Sherman, who is an animator of a small group in Congress, presents the problems differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred economics professors, including three Nobel laureates, wrote to us to tell us: We ask Congress not to rush and carefully examine the path to take," he said.
At this very moment, in Europe, we once again had proof of the global nature of the crisis.
After an urgent meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for 11.2 billion euros ($16.3 billion).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg had been necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it was renouncing to buy its bankruptcy competitor since it lost <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2 billion (2.9 billion) during the U.S. mortgage crisis.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is part of the 20 largest European banks and the 10 largest insurers.
"This is not lost money," Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said yesterday.
Instead, we regain a right to vote in the bank and influence.
It’s just something that savers and families will appreciate now that times are uncertain.”
During this time, on the other side of the Channel, the British government seemed to want to nationalize another bank that is suffering from the financial crisis.
According to the British press, the government would take over all outstanding loans at the Bradford and Bringley bank and more than 41 billion euros ($75.5 billion) in real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it would buy the branches and bank accounts of the British bank.
Bradford and Bringley Bank would be the second bank, after Northern Rock, that the British government would have to nationalize from the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a Committed Icon
His blue eyes represented his triumph for a long time.
Did the American actor with a charming smile get rid of his narcissistic side?
Yes and no.
His taste, sensitivity, and a talent that was evident will also have taken him away from the record of power held by the true sacred monsters.
But what a great background runner!
Paul Newman, who died on Friday at the age of 83, from lung cancer at his Connecticut ranch, remains one of the last icons of American cinema of the fast-paced years.
He is less phenomenal than Brando, to whom he seemed very much and who was long regarded as a rival in the cinema, more prudent in his play, certainly more fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and the bursting of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often makes children great.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, to a German Jewish father and a Hungarian-born mother.
From these European roots will be born one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
Without excessive ego, last quality mark.
Because it projected an entire country in love with the self-made man, the fighter of the Pacific War, wounded in combat, who in the early 1950s studied dramatic art in Yale, then attended the New York Actor's Studio, before triumphing in theater, television and soon in cinema.
This man who fought for civil rights was also the car driver who was ranked second in the Le Mans 24 Hours in 1979, folded by a sex symbol, although member of a model couple formed since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
With him also disappear the secret sides of this secret star, discreet and committed, allergic to the scandals of the show world that we do not know very well.
He is an honest man, in the noblest sense of the word.
Paul Newman’s death caused vertigo to the filmmakers this weekend, as his big roles on the black screen of memories crumble.
More than half a century of American art in perpetual change parade through it.
Many memories come back to mind as the charming cowboy of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man who rejects his sensual wife (with Elizabeth Taylor) in The Cat on the adapted zinc roof of Tennessee Williams in 1958.
Closer to us (1990), we recall his sensitive Mr. Bridge, disturbed by a marriage that did not fulfill all his promises.
Others like Paul Newman have gone into the history of cinema.
This boxer Rocky Graziano, criminal, tormented, violent, unforgettable in Robert Wise's Somebody Up There Likes Me, a role destined for James Dean, repeated after his death, who truly launched Newman in 1956.
This charming manganese in the sumptuous film The Sting, Oscar for Best Picture in 1973.
A bitter billiard player and avenger in Robert Rossen's magnificent film The Hustler (1961), he will repeat the character in Martin Scorsese's The Color of Money, who won him his only Oscar in 1987 among nine nominations.
This face that changes with the years, it was him.
He's still alive.
Times change during his career.
Young people know him mainly thanks to George Roy Hill's Slap Shot (1977), in Reggie Dunlop, coach of an unorthodox ice hockey team.
His fans saw him again in 1994 in the Coen Brothers' The Hudsucker Proxy.
With one last role as patron of the Irish mafia in Sam Mendes' Road to Perdition in 2003, the curl was curled.
Contrary to several film legends who left the race quite soon, Newman stayed long in the world of cinema, denouncing Hollywood, its gold, its fasts and its concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier humorously considered it "a challenge living in " underplaying " and judging his performances too supported.
The profession was not always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman to whom the papers came for a long time without doing anything.
However, he less often interpreted the role of young gallan than marginal: neurotic, alcoholic, cockroach or desperate, whose traits reflected the rebellions.
As a director, Newman revealed sides of his true pudic sensitivity not very well known.
Her film Raquel, Raquel, in 1968 (according to the novel by the Canadian Margaret Laurence), with his wife Joanne Woodward in the lead role, depicted a female portrait of melancholy.
He who lost his son Scott to overdose dedicated his 1984 film Harry and Son to him, a work of debauchery and sadness.
" Among the numerous tributes that were triggered yesterday for Newman, his great friend and former gunman Robert Redford (who had worked together on The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) stated, very sadly: "My life and my country were better because of their existence "
Generousness, love of existence are important traits of the deceased actor.
On the other side of his legendary career, he also hides a great activist for civil rights, ecology, independent cinema, a protester against Hollywood’s excesses.
We will have seen a lot of his face reign over the pots of vinegar sauce, sauces, cookies and other foods, judging this method as a method of bad taste, although it began as a gag.
The profits from these sales were given to his Foundation for Children in Difficulty.
Newman, rather than content with his myth, will have committed himself to the end.
He left to his five daughters a letter containing these phrases: "Always and to the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was a privilege to be there.”
And a privilege for us to have followed the career of such a lucid and generous American artist.
In short, a model citizen.
What did they produce in the Zuschlag invoice factory & amp; Co.?
Very soon, on October 8, the criminal trial against J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Zuschlag and his accomplices will begin.
The politician and his accomplices are accused of committing frauds of significant harm, in a business way, continuously and in an organized manner in addition to other crimes, including the falsification of documents.
According to the Prosecutor’s Office, they used the funds obtained in public tenders for their own purposes, often justifying the performance of tasks with false invoices.
Public and municipal funds - in total about HUF 65 million - stopped partly in the treasury of the organization Fiatal Baloldal and partly in the pocket of private individuals.
The method, which was made known by the researchers as well, was to justify the collection of funds obtained in public tenders with false invoices behind which there was no real execution, the various associations never fulfilled their assumed obligations.
According to the indictment, most of the invoices were false.
For this they obtained the pilgrims in the market of the District of J<0xC3><0xB3>zsefv<0xC3><0xA1>ros and the circular seals were manufactured in the city of Kiskunhalas.
And the question that on behalf of which company the counterfeit invoice should be made was decided among others on that tour through the Upper Balaton Region where J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Zuschlag sent to Istv<0xC3><0xA1>n Lados.
The latter confessed that for this purpose he had to choose hostels and restaurants.
He asked for a bill for his consumption and these served as a model to draw up the invoices that he presented, among others, in the competitions of the Ministry of Youth and Sports Affairs, in the Ministry of Social and Labour Affairs, as well as in the City Hall of the Capital.
These invoices were mostly signed by Istv<0xC3><0xA1>n Lados and his accomplice Andr<0xC3><0xA1>s <0xC5><0x90>ri, who according to our information rather wrote the necessary reports to obtain the public grants.
During one of his "study trips" Lados chose a brewery.
According to two invoices issued in 2003 by Zuschlag and his accomplices, this gastronomic center provided food for a group of ninety people from the Asociaci<0xC3><0xB3>n Biztos Pont Egyesület.
However - according to the manager of the center - so many people do not fit at the same time in that place.
Similarly, the invoice issued in the summer of 2002 for the Jobb Jövër<0xC3><0xA6>r Foundation – later called Together for the Third Year – was filled with formal and contextual errors.
For a hostel in the town of Badacsonytomaj had only three rooms and more than ten people could not stay there in one night, however, the bill consisted of one hundred and thirty people.
But the fancy invoice manufacturers also exaggerated when they pointed out to the gastronomic center Pigal Kft. because in the bookkeeping of the same - according to information given to the Prosecutor's Office - there were no documents on the name of Jobb Jövöért and Hopp<0xC3><0xA1>.
Gy<0xC5><0x91>z<0xC5><0x91> Farkas, the company’s manager, told hvg.hu that when he was quoted by the prosecutor’s office and shown the invoices, he already knew it was fake documents.
"On the seal the name of our company and the NIF appeared in the wrong place."
In addition to the formal problems, he also disagreed that according to the bill, 100 people were accommodated, since they only have eleven rooms in which not so many people can fit.
In addition, meals were also included in the invoice, while the restaurant has not been working for a long time.
The enthusiastic invoice manufacturers also did not report that the chosen travel agency in Budapest exclusively organizes trips abroad, so that on the cash payment invoice they foolishly indicated as a service a trip within Hungary, which also did not coincide with the agency’s practice of issuing invoices.
In addition, as was known during the investigation, VAT was included in the document as well, even though travel outside the European Union was tax-free.
Among other things, the VAT measure was also incorrect in the four documents issued by the Hotel Révfülöp Kft. for the Jobb Jövöért foundation, since the services of this company are not charged with a 25 but only with 15 percent VAT, in addition, the employees of the hotel only extended invoices made by machine but the invoice was manual.
In addition, the "shippers" made other mistakes as well, as in the case of a company in which they put on the invoice as an activity carried out the transport by road to which - it was known during the investigations of the prosecutor's office - does not carry out the company founded as an investment consultant.
Equally for formal differences - formato inadecudo de la billura, sello falso - it was assumed that the invoices issued for the Third Millennium Foundation, for the XXI. Sz<0xC3><0xA1>zadi Kultur<0xC3><0xA1>l Egyesület and for Biztos Pont are false.
As in the case of Ravenna Bt. or the Sport Camp of Kunfehert<0xC3><0xB3>, whose representatives refused to issue those invoices.
The falsifiers also did not pay attention to the fact that when the group of Fiatal V<0xC3><0xA1>rosért Egyesület ate there (2001) the HIB Kft. of Ny<0xC3><0xAD>regyh<0xC3><0xA1>za was in the process of liquidation, therefore the in charge of the liquidation process - according to our information - refused to issue such a document.
Deliberately issue invoices
Another group of fake invoice makers are those who were aware that they were supposed to issue fictitious invoices.
The Esély Budapest Foundation, at the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifj<0xC3><0xBA> Szocialist<0xC3><0xA1>k, issued an invoice worth about HUF four million in the name of the Yüjütt a Third <0xC3><0x89>vezred<0xC3><0xA1>r Foundation.
The manager of Collab Kft. - according to the indictment - was persuaded by one of the accused, Ludovic Györfi, to issue fictitious invoices.
Biogate Kft., currently under liquidation process, also collaborated with Zuschlag and its accomplices, which in 2003 supplied invoices worth approximately HUF five million to the Jobb Jövöv<0xC3><0xB5>ért Foundation, the association Atlasz Egyesület and the association Vörösfeny<0xC5><0x91> Egyesület real.
There was no movement of capital either, because then they cancelled the prepared invoices but forgot to include in their documents to this entity.
The following group of fake invoice manufacturers includes those that have any connection to the accused.
For example, Ivan Kubatov was the plaintiff of the Ukrainian manager of the fictitious Delta Trio SL based in Budapest, who was dealing with the trade in fuels and vehicles.
The company issued numerous invoices worth approximately HUF 18 million in the months of October, November and December 2005 on the sale of computer media.
According to the data of the investigation, these invoices were purchased by Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas, which since September 14, 2005 is under liquidation process.
The manager of this company was a Romanian to whom Ivan Kubatov should have also sent documents related to the company between 2002 and 2005.
We have information that Kubatov recognized during the investigation that he issued invoices on behalf of the company for Atlasz, for Hopp<0xC3><0xA1> and for Együtt to Third <0xC3><0x89>vezredérd<0xC3><0xA1>ny by charging the amount himself.
Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt. were founded by Romanian miners at the express request of Ivan Kubatov.
However, none of the companies worked effectively due - according to the defendant - to the fact that they did not receive work.
But he took advantage of these companies, because at the request of his accomplice the lawyer Zsolt Szente, who prepared the company’s registration documents, issued invoices on behalf of the companies for the organizations associated with Zuschlag: for the Atlasz and for the Y-Generation.
Kubatov, on behalf of Cash Investment, Delta Tri<0xC3><0xB3>, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, gave a total of 15 invoices to different entities worth HUF 14.2 million.
The Prosecutor’s Office considered that Kubatov received VAT and 10% of the amount of the invoices.
That man even took advantage of the Szi-Beri-commanded society to issue fictitious invoices used in the Biztos Pont contest.
The Y-Generation and Alliance for Modern Hungary presented a contest in January 2006 by the T<0xC3><0xA1>ncsics Mih<0xC3><0xA1>ly Foundation (TMA), a public utility entity of the Socialist Party.
They obtained 500,000 HUF respectively from the contest, but did not use the money for the purposes of the contest.
To prevent this from being discovered, five fictitious invoices received from Works Team Kft were presented to the TMA.
These were the invoices found during the registration of the office that Arp<0xC3><0xA1>d Kemecsei had at the headquarters of the Ministry of Education.
Some of the defendants will likely report in the trial - as they did in the Prosecutor's Office - the course of falsification of invoices.
The most interesting thing could be the confession of the main defendant J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Zuschlag himself, if he decides to dismantle everything.
For his confessions so far have not been very detailed and although he repeatedly promised to talk about everything, this has not so far done.
The question is: what interest does he have in doing it?, for perhaps in return for the return of most of the money - fifty million HUF - the Socialists came to an agreement with him so that Zusi could assume all responsibilities.
Who, on the other hand, for these days could even be offended, since in order to relieve his prison conditions he requested house arrest, but was repeatedly denied.
While the numerous perpetrators of economic crimes of far superior value, who never returned the money, walk freely or at least can wait in their own home for the sentence, he has no chance of that.
Psychology of Overlapping: Why Do We Spend More Money?
Auction participants are likely to spend more money and overvalue the product.
Neurologists and economists at the University of New York have discovered the neurological - economic - basis of this known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to the study in the journal Science, people don’t want to lose in competitions like eBay auctions, so they prefer to pay even an excessive price.
Scientists tried to establish the neurological scheme of this "game" through experimental auctions.
One of the groups of volunteers was playing the lottery, the other was participating in an auction and while the active areas of the brain of the people participating in the experiment were examined using the functional magnetic resonance imaging system (fMRI).
In both games participants could earn money, but during auctions, where it is essential to bet more than the other, losing the game intensified the operation of the complex called strata located below the cerebral cortex.
This area of the brain, in addition to many other functions, plays a role in the nervous system’s “self-premium” mechanism.
Thus, according to the scientists, the increase in bets is explained as a prevention not to provoke an intense reaction of the stratum.
To support their theory, the economists of the scientific group also conducted a financial follow-up study.
In this experiment three groups bet against a person in different circumstances.
The control group was simply informed of the actual value of the product in question, and its members bet.
Another group was also promised that if they won, they would receive an additional $15 prize.
On the other hand, the third group received exactly $15 before the auction, but in case of losing the auction, the group members even lost that money.
So the only difference between the two groups was that for one the victory was highlighted and for the other the failure.
However, by checking the hypothesis of neurologists, members of the group who played "against failure" were willing to bet even more than members of the control group and the "winner" group.
“These results cannot be deduced from any previously existing economic theory.
For those so far explained the phenomena of auctions only with the joy of winning and with the prevention of risks.
Only visual neurological methods helped resolve this contradiction between the two theories, so we now come to a third explanation," said Andrew Schotter, a professor at the University of New York's Faculty of Economics.
Hepatitis: When should you go to the doctor?
Around the world some five hundred million people suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary chronic liver disease is considered one of the leading causes of death.
The number of infected people in this country is estimated at one hundred thousand, but only seven thousand receive treatment because many of the sick do not know that they are infected.
The name hepatitis is the common name for different liver diseases caused by viruses.
The symptoms are very similar; they are characteristic of liver infection and jaundice, but their pathogens and the diseases caused are very different.
Hepatitis viruses depending on the pathogen are spread by two main forms: hepatitis A and E by food (e.g. with water or contaminated food), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses with blood and with body humor (sperm, vaginal humor, saliva).
It is recommended for travelers to protect themselves by vaccine against viruses A and B, there are no vaccines against C.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after consuming the infected food, manifested by a general malaise, weakness, abdominal pain, and nausea.
After this, jaundice appears on the skin and on the whites of the eyes, the excrement becomes clear, dark urine and healing can last as long as two - three weeks.
Every year, one million people die in the world from cancer and cirrhosis of the liver caused by hepatitis B, the most serious forms of this disease.
The main reason for this is that according to estimates, only one in ten infected people receives pharmacological treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: without treatment it can produce liver cirrhosis and even cancer.
Most infected people do not know that they are sick because this pathological agent gradually destroys liver cells and often the first symptoms appear only 20-30 years later.
Premature recognition, systematic medical check-up, is therefore very important.
This disease is much more common in three groups: people who had blood transfusions before 1991, drug users and those who wear tattoos.
Currently, there are about 200 million people in the world who suffer from chronic hepatitis C.
As this disease can be discovered with a routine laboratory checkup as well, it is worth consulting with your family doctor when experiencing some unknown symptoms.
The disease has healing if it is discovered in time, it is possible to exterminate the virus from the body, so it can suppress the infection and prevent cancer.
September 30 is World Hepatitis Day, which was first organized in 2004 by organizations representing the sick.
Its aim is to draw attention to the causes of chronic liver infections caused by viruses and the importance of their early recognition.
Does it hurt less to those who believe in God?
According to the results of a recent investigation, religious faith has a calming effect that also eased the death of the martyrs of Catholicism.
Scientists at the University of Oxford conducted an interesting experiment: they analyzed how religious belief influences human pain, the British newspaper Telegraph reported.
As part of this unique experiment they applied electric shock to 12 Catholic believers and to the same number of atheists, while everyone was looking at a painting of the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to rule out most of their pain.
Thanks to the scanning technique of the human brain, it was possible to verify that Catholic believers were able to activate that part of their brain that is responsible for regulating pain.
This experiment is the first in a series of researches in which scientists, philosophers and theologians from the different departments of the University are also involved.
The analysis was carried out as follows; they attached a sparkling instrument to the left hand of the patient, which applied the electric shock.
The researchers asked the participants of the experiment to look at two paintings; the Virgin Mary, a 17th-century work by Sassoferrato and the Lady of the Arminian by Leonardo da Vinci of the 15th century.
The researchers hoped that the Virgin Mary show would provoke a certain religious spirit among the faithful, while they chose Leonardo's oil because it was not too different from the other, and thought it had a soothing effect.
The patients spent half an hour on an MRI scan, receiving in that period 20 electric shocks in four successive parts while observing the religious-themed painting or the other.
The Catholics asserted that by looking at the Virgin Mary they felt “safe” as “protected” people, “reassured themselves and peace reigned in their hearts.”
When they looked at the religious theme picture, they felt 12 percent less pain than when they looked at Leonardo’s work.
The psychologist Miguel Farias who also participated in the experiment, thinks that with any image so shocking you can achieve a similar effect with atheists as well, you just have to find the right image.
"We should find the portrait of a person they feel very positively about, like a mother or a father," the psychologist said.
Anglican Bishop Tom Wright celebrated the outcome of the investigation.
“The exercise of faith should and in many cases really change our personality,” Wright added.
After these formidable results, one question remains: what effect would it have on the regulation of pain if the faithful were shown the Madonna of Leonardo or another painter of her size?
Would the vision of a high-quality Virgin Mary have even better results?
You are what you say about yourself
On its 10th birthday, Google can say: it can be found both in people’s pockets and in the sky above their heads; it knows where they spent their vacations, what doctors they visit, and what interests them.
But according to Eric Schmidt, one of the company’s executives, this is still not enough.
On the other hand, skeptics who make a parallel with Orwellian vision do not see the essence of Web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google’s primary goal is to gather as much personal data about its users as possible, and this is necessary to be able to meet the original goals of Google founders: “Let’s gather all the information in one system of the world!”.
According to the Google leader, the company even after ten years of work that turned the world around is still in the early stages of the effort to be able to handle all the information.
Asked what would happen in five years, Schmidt replied: I would like Google to be able to answer questions like “What to do tomorrow?” or “What would work be best for me?” – however, software will not be able to answer seemingly simple questions as long as there is not enough user information.
Not all Internet users are aware that while browsing the Web, search keywords, IP addresses and pages where they went when they finished the search are accurately stored.
For example, thanks to Personalized Search that debuted two years ago, users can store their own browsing history, they can revisit what they were looking for before, what they opened up and thanks to this history will generate much more personalized searches - in this same logic will be based on the Recommendations store, on which the system will provide us previously defined products and services based on preferences.
What happens if they take advantage of my data against me, if they collect information about my activities? - ask those users who are concerned by seeing Google's information monopoly.
In most cases rather the potential represented by the company is what can be fearful and not remorse, fear of punishment, yearning for freedom, or rebellion against power.
However, it is a fact already confirmed that they not only preserve, but in justifiable cases also give to third parties all the sought expressions, in these cases there is nothing that protects the personal rights of Internet users.
The most debated example of recent times was perhaps the coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, when Google handed over to the Brazilian government the information on its website, called Orkut, to identify pedophiles.
On the other hand, internet users concerned about people’s rights were relieved in May when the company along with the EFF, an electronic rights advocacy organization, successfully proved to the court that he was right in his litigation with the FBI: according to the ruling, he will not be able to oblige Google to secrecy by any of his points.
(At the same time, the federal government managed to get its pretext of reinforcing the child protection law passed years ago, about fifty thousand web addresses and a thousand searched phrases, but without getting the individual user search lists, nor the complete lists of web pages and keywords of the last two months.)
This is quite contradictory to the opinion about Google: it is criticized by those who fear to provide your personal data because they think it is harming your privacy, your privacy when you start using Google services, and rebels against it as against the conservative multinational image companies.
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and its enthusiastic followers, internet users and users from other countries, see in them the future generation, the “avant-garde corporation,” not so its rival, Microsoft, categorized by its Windows as conqueror of the World, no matter how much they both fight for the same goal.
This can happen because Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask users for any identification code, nor money for its applications, the code is open and the free program package, constantly updated and looks more youthful, more collaborative than the practice of the official software giant.
But it can also be because geeks accurately see the very problematic relationship between human rights and the Internet that came about precisely by one of the most mentioned keywords in recent years: Web 2.0.
Web 2.0 is about collaboration, leaving intentional footprints behind us and taking advantage of the available communication channels, and while the measurement of these varies individually, the essence remains the same: to show ourselves.
A normal young person can have a profile on numerous collective pages, from Facebook to Shanghai, and can even combine them with other services, such as Twitter or the last.fm that offers a list of his music habits, then you can include them in a tracking system such as the FriendFeed or the Blip.fm photo store, you can also have a blog that is currently in the gallery or in the pics, in which the most autom<0xC3><0xA1> appear.
We can know numerous cases of which it is clear that, for example, the bride, seeing the flow of photos of the next morning of common friends, finds out who spent the night before her fraudulent boyfriend or they can fire the employee of a company because he completely wrote his sincere opinion on his blog about the direction of the company.
A person’s “on-line” life is what she shows herself – this is the definition that hides behind the behavior of today’s youth.
And anyone who wants to hide something, or at least wants to circumvent Google’s monopoly, can do so (starting for example with Scroogle that uses Google’s search engine but leaves no footprints).
There are many people who don’t want to sign up on collective pages to prevent them from being found, but they can replace Google’s “online” apps, from text-writing software to news-reading and image-based apps with alternative versions that don’t connect to giant servers or prepare the most perfect profile possible about us.
The public expects it almost openly on the day that Google shows its true face.
The company with its current value of $156 billion is worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion), AdWords/AdSense advertising surfaces also threaten the revenues of other advertising agencies, while software companies alone, while Microsoft's services that are being introduced do not cause more and more serious.
Critical observers, however, will find the alarming contradictions as well: for example, the top management roundly rejected the protest of employees after doubling the price of the company's childcare, considered too expensive the full number of employees' feeding information, but all this is not in comparison to the fact that in the 2006 Google predated the company's interest.
One of the company’s own internal regulations says that they will not announce any new service in advance, but only when it was already ready to work, which if it is certain that our foreseeable problems of the coming months and years will be able to turn to the World: while some we can believe that the project of scanning and filing of books and magazines will be systematized, Health by Google will acquire the dimension.
And the fact that Google is going to create a genetic database, it will be able to provide a good raw material for science fiction writers, Scroogled, Cory Doctorow’s popular novel, describes in an orwellian way that future, in which a man only of Google’s data can be described alarmingly well.
Two minors helped clear the footprints of the author of the double murder of the city of <0xC3><0x93>zd.
Police questioned two minors about the double murder of <0xC3><0x96>zd who, on reasonable suspicion, helped erase the footprints of the crime, a spokesman for the Borsod province’s General Commissariat of Public Order said on Tuesday.
The young women recognized the crime they were charged with, and are currently accused of committing the crime.
The two minors - according to information from the Hungarian News Agency it is two girls - will be able to defend themselves freely.
For complicity they can receive up to 5 years in prison.
The accused of the double murder of <0xC3><0x93>zd - a 23-year-old man - has been in pre-trial detention since Sunday.
He is accused of murdering several people with premeditation and greed.
During the investigation, it was revealed that the 23-year-old owed a large sum to a 53-year-old man.
The defendant did not want to pay his debt, so on Wednesday last week he quoted his creditor at the headquarters of a company in <0xC3><0x93>zd, where he killed him and then also killed the victim’s 9-year-old daughter.
According to information from the MTI, the young man prepared much earlier to commit the crime, as he committed the murder with a weapon previously hidden at the crime scene.
The police analyze with an expert on the weapon and the circumstances of its use.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange presented an offer to buy the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange offered two hundred million euros – about five billion Czech crowns – for one hundred percent of the shares of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Poles, even though the Czechs have previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the possible new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in the hands of the state.
99 percent of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state that wants to sell 60 percent of them within a few months.
The Czech economic newspaper E15 reported that the offer of the Poles has been the highest among those offered by those interested in the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press, so far they have offered the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Transatlantic Stock Exchange Nasdaq, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Börse.
Petr Koblic, the head of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that among the concerned the worst new owner would be the Warsaw Stock Exchange and did not rule out the possibility that the Prague Stock Exchange would disappear in the future.
Experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange at about 5 to 10 billion kroner.
According to the shareholders’ agreement, approximately 90 percent of the shares could be sold.
The majority owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the investment bank Patria Finance with a stake of approximately 25 percent, followed by Banco Cesk<0xC3><0xA1> Sporitelna with 14.7 and Tiger Holding Four S.a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
On the financial crisis from the point of view of the European press
Major European newspapers in Tuesday’s comments on the deepening international financial crisis speak of a “Second September 11th.”
The global financial catastrophe is due to the President of the United States - the Republic of Rome - the president has not been able even to get the support of his own party for the bill made hastily, whose aim is to give a solution to this desperate situation...
Instead of a new “Pearl Habor,” which billionaire investor Warren Buffett was talking about, it’s better to talk about a “Second September 11th.”
According to part of the Madrid press, Washington is the scapegoat.
In El Mundo’s view, the mistake of the political direction of the United States was the one that led the world economy to the brink of the abyss.
The danger of the collapse of the American monetary system is increasing, and this will then have an impact on the entire world.
Although Bush’s plan was not perfect, after the congressional vote the danger arises that Washington does not offer a political instrument to deal with the crisis.
The world economy is suspended in the air – precisely when one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism is carried out.
This threat cannot be ignored - points out the Geneva Tages-Anzeiger.
Some states today can still throw life-saving belts at crippling financial institutions, thereby saving them from bankruptcy with taxpayers’ money.
But if, like the dominoes, more bank collapses, then neither the new funds nor the new improvisations will be enough.
In the long run, it is necessary for EU member states to put aside their nationalist selfishness and centralise control over fragmented financial markets.
The financial institutions in crisis received just over 100 billion euros on Monday - recalls Vienna's Der Standard, adding that concerns are increasingly real that, as did the Americans, also European taxpayers will have to pay a lot of money to solve the crisis.
The EU has so far not seriously dealt with the crisis that is passing as a cuneo across the Old Continent.
The “saviors” will not have to immediately present hundreds of millions of euros, but it would be good if they defined: in what cases is it justified to use taxpayer funds to avoid a greater evil?
Intelligent car mimics the flight of the bee
What would be the best method to develop technologies in order to avoid collisions, if not the imitation of the existing obstacles sensors in nature?
For example, the bees.
In a surprising project presented at Japan’s CEATEC, the bees provided the starting point for Nissan engineers to design the next generation of collision prevention systems.
Nissan, in cooperation with the University of Tokyo, designed the nature-imitating BR23C robotic vehicle steering system, which was given the characteristics of the bees, with the ultimate goal of creating a system that can avoid all collisions.
During the flight each bee creates its own oval private space that actually looks a lot like our protective security capsule - explained in the exhibition Kazuhhiro Doi, chief technology officer of RP and development and research.
Composite eyes of bees that are able to see in all directions at an angle greater than 300 degrees play an important role.
To copy the function of the composite eyes, the engineers used the laser beam length measurement system.
It identifies the obstacles in front of the BR23C within a distance of 2 meters, at an angle of 180 degrees, calculates its distance and sends a signal to the vehicle’s microprocessor that is immediately transformed into a maneuver to avoid collision.
In a fraction of seconds the obstacle is identified, then the vehicle robot mimicking the movements of the bees, modifying the direction by rotating the wheels to the extent necessary.
Unlike any current system, this maneuver is totally instinctive.
"If not, the vehicle robot could not react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," said Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the Mobility Laboratory and the vehicle robot project.
It must react immediately and instinctively, as this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable inner layer of the safety capsule, in a layer within which all types of collisions are currently considered inevitable.
The whole process should reflect what a bee does to avoid other bees.
This process should be carried out in one open and close the eyes.
However, unlike bees, the movement cannot be directed upwards, downwards or diagonally, but can only be two-dimensional and exclusively in the direction of rotation of the wheels.
Thus, instead of the endless possibilities that exist for bees to avoid other bees, here only rotary movement and acceleration in addition to braking were used as a possibility for the robot of the car.
The BR23C uses lithium-polymer batteries that are lighter and have a higher energy density, which means they have a longer lifespan than lithium-ion.
According to Andoh, the important thing is the instinctive and intelligent reaction and not the ability to process data, let alone the storage.
This apparatus in every second should only process some input signals and react as the case may be.
It is not necessary to store this data or react with an instinctive logic based on the data of the previous maneuvers, so it uses only a few dozen kilobytes of memory.
No gigabytes or megabytes are required.
This is the first step in developing the technology to immediately avoid obstacles, which according to Nissan’s calculations can be incorporated into series-produced models within ten years.
Another possibility for its application is to incorporate the unit into the GPS satellite navigation system to take the driver to their destination, avoiding existing obstacles in their way.
He already has a name for this precious child.
A written version of the $700 billion bailout bill has been prepared to be implemented in several phases in order to buy bad loans from banks.
In the first phase, half of the money will be spent.
According to the East Coast timetable during the new consultations that lasted until after midnight on Saturday, congressional leaders reached an agreement on the $700 billion financial bailout package in total, after several days of discussion, Reuters reported.
“We have made significant progress,” said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic president of the U.S. Congress, stating that it is only necessary to formalize the agreement in a document.
The commitment on the package was supported by both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain.
Henry Paulson, the Minister of Finance, speaking about the outcome of the compromise, said: This program will work and be efficient, but more action is needed. According to Pelosi, it is not about saving Wall Street, but about turning the economy around.
The written version of the package was published before the opening of Asian markets, i.e. Sunday before 8 p.m., according to Washington time (i.e. before 2 a.m. on Monday morning, according to Central Europe time), without causing a spectacular jump in the stock market.
On the bill called the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, first Monday will vote in the U.S. Congress and then the Senate.
President George W. Bush on Saturday night consulted with Pelosi and then the White House also celebrated the news of the deal.
"We are pleased with the progress made overnight and we highly appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy," White House spokesman Tony Fratto said in a statement.
The program is different from the Bush administration’s original proposal to spend all $700 billion to buy low-quality credit fund securities.
Now only half of the $700 billion will be spent, using $250 billion immediately after Congress votes, probably on Monday, of this sum, the Ministry of Finance will buy stocks of credit, bad grade and the fate of another $100 billion depends on the president’s decision.
This program will be controlled by a special body, in which the President of the Federal Reserve will also participate.
The other half of the $700 billion will be spent after a new Congressional decision.
According to the law, the Ministry of Finance can apply a combined tactic: it can simultaneously buy bad credits, mortgages and credit-fund securities, plus other “poisonous” credits as well.
The purchase can be made at auction or in direct form - competent people of the ministry reported.
The law allows the affected companies to participate in an insurance program where the financial portfolio guarantees the worrying elements, for which the companies will pay the amount corresponding to the foreseeable damages.
Henry Paulson asserted that the law thus secures the necessary financial means, which can reach as much as $700 billion to meet the urgent needs of the American financial system, whether it be the purchase of bad financial means, its insurance or the prevention of risks that could lead to the collapse of some major financial institutions.
“We will do everything we need to be ready to introduce the law as soon as they sign it,” he added.
On the other hand, the heads of banks that are in trouble and waiting for state aid will be able to count on the official limitation of their compensations, which the U.S. argot simply calls gold parachutes.
Only in certain cases will payments be limited, furthermore, the limitations depend on the form of assistance of the Ministry of Finance.
The limitation means that if the ministry buys in the framework of an auction, an extra tax will be imposed on the gold parachute, unless the bank's failed boss is retired.
By buying bad credits directly, the government will intervene aggressively to ensure that bosses’ compensation is not exaggerated.
In addition to the above, existing gold parachute contracts will not be changed, the limitations apply only to new contracts to thus also stimulate participation in the programme.
This is the first case in U.S. history that a legal limitation will be in place for directors-general revenues, said Democrat Barney Frank, chairman of the congressional committee responsible for financial services.
The State will also have the right to acquire shares of the participating banks in the program, thus reducing the risk of taxpayers, as they can ultimately even make profits from the transaction as soon as the economy and the bank recovers.
Under the bill, in the next five years, the president will have to submit to Congress a proposal on how to repay taxpayers the losses of the financial sector.
Of course, there were those on both sides who expressed their reservations about the project.
“This is not what the American citizens ordered us, that is, taxpayer dollars are not being protected,” said California Republican Congressman Darrell Issa.
Her fellow Ohio Democrat, Mary Kaptur, said the moves were pushed by those responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.
Industrial prices continue to rise
In August 2008, domestic industrial sales prices rose by 0.1 percent compared to last month's prices and by 12.9 percent compared to August 2007's prices, the Central Bureau of Statistics (KSH) reported.
Industrial export prices rose by 1.1 percent compared to those in July 2008 and decreased by 3.9 percent compared to the previous year.

Industrial sales prices rose only to a minimal extent, by 0.1 percent.
Domestic sales prices in the processing industries rose minimally, by 0.1 percent compared to the month of July.
The largest increase in the magnitude of prices occurred in August 2008, in the leather and footwear production sector (2.8 percent), primarily due to a 4.6 percent monthly increase in bags and belts and a 2.5 percent increase in footwear.
The highest price level of plastic and chemical base materials resulted in a significant monthly increase in the prices of the chemicals production branch (1.6 percent).
There was a price drop in the petrochemical sector, (1.4 per cent), in the production of electric machines and instruments (0.9 per cent), as well as - to a minimum - in the wood processing sectors (0.1 per cent).
The prices of papermaking, publishing houses and printing houses did not change.
In the rest of the sectors of the processing industry there was an increase in prices between 0.2 and 0.9 percent.
In the supply of electricity, gas, heat and water, which represent an important weight within domestic trade, an increase of 0.3 percent was recorded in August, primarily as a result of the effect of the increase in official prices from July 1.
In a comparison of a twelve-month period - in domestic sales of the processing industry sectors - the largest price increase was recorded in the petrochemical sector (32.4 percent).
In the metal processing sector, there was an increase of 13.2 per cent, while in the food, beverage and tobacco industry, of decisive weight, there was an increase of 11 per cent.
There was a drop in prices in the textile industry (2.5 percent), as well as in the manufacture of electrical machines and instruments (0.3 percent).
In the rest of the processing sectors, the pace of price growth was between 0.6 and 9.1 percent.

Electricity, gas, heat and water prices outpaced the previous year’s prices by 18.7 percent.
In August, among the different sectors of domestic trade, the largest monthly price increase (0.7 percent) was recorded in the investment goods sectors.
In the consumer goods sectors, prices rose by 0.3 per cent, with prices in the energy sector and intermediate sectors unchanged from the previous month.
In August 2008, compared to the same month of the previous year, the largest price increase occurred in the energy sectors and in the intermediate industry (16.8 percent).
In the production of consumer goods, there was a decline of 6.8 percent and in investment goods by 1.4 percent.
Industry export prices calculated in HUF increased by 1.1 percent compared to the previous month, and compared to 12 months, there was a decrease of 3.9 percent.
The price of our national currency in one month fell by 1.7 per cent against the euro and by 7.1 per cent against the dollar, compared to August 2007 it strengthened by 7.5 per cent against the euro and 15.9 per cent against the dollar.
Will you no longer need a visa to travel to the United States next year?
Kinga Göncz believes that there are many possibilities for the entry into force of the U.S.-Hungarian visa waiver agreement around January 12 - the foreign minister spoke about it in Chicago, in front of Hungarians there.
Practically everything depends on the timely construction of the electronic access and control system on the other side of the Atlantic.
At the same time, he warned that in the new system will disappear the premise of entry, but tourists before their departure from the country of origin will have to register.
As of today, the head of Hungarian diplomacy is holding talks in Washington.
He will be interviewed with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice handing her the Medal Cross with the Star of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary and will hold negotiations with the international policy advisers of the presidential candidates, Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Both Barack Obama and McCain are in favor of the banks’ financial bailout package.
Barack Obama and John McCain, both candidates for the presidency of the two major U.S. parties, on Sunday secured their support for the administration’s $700 million banking aid program, instead there are politicians who demand the resignation of the finance minister.
Representatives of Congress and the administration, after several days of marathon-type negotiations, announced on Sunday morning that a principle agreement was reached on the banks’ financial bailout package.
The financial package aimed at resolving the Wall Street crisis and freezing the frozen credit market became the central theme of the presidential election campaign.
Both Obama and McCain want to prove that they are more capable than their rival to get the country out of the economic crisis.
According to recent polls, by putting economic issues at the forefront, Obama regained some advantage and vanished the McCain advantage he had gained after the Republican convention with Sarah Palin’s candidacy for vice president.
At a Detroit campaign rally last Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that Congress would quickly pass the $700 billion package law.
He stressed that the proposal includes those consumer protection points, which he himself supported.
“We have to act now and responsibly ... there is a threat to employment, to your savings, to whole industries and to the stability of the entire economy,” he said in front of a crowd of 35,000 people.
He did not take the opportunity to call McCain’s economic concepts obsolete.
In an interview with ABC McCain he explained that “we will all swallow this hardly (...) but not doing anything is simply not a viable path.”
The Republican senator said the proposal included setting up a control commission to the Minister of Fines and limiting executive compensation, he was the one who insisted on that.
Obama told CBS McCain played no important role in the consultations, but he consulted the minister daily.
Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi said on Sunday that Congressmen are likely to vote on the bill by Monday.
Press magazine of the German-speaking area
The right-wing group is intact, only within the group itself became the most conscious voters - says the Der Spiegel about the weak election result of the CSU in Bavaria.
Haider and his followers are ready to rule in Austria to prevent a red-black coalition.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
In the electronic edition of the German left-wing magazine Franz Walter, in his article entitled "The Bavarian Revolution devours his parents" he analyzes the reasons for the dramatic defeat of the CSU.
According to the well-known political scientist, the erosion of the CSU had begun long before the sad duo Beckstein-Huber had assumed office.
Social-Christians for several decades were developing Bavaria – and now it is these modern citizens who turn their backs on it.
The change of an era is at the same time a problem of all Christian democracy, as well as of Angela Merkel.
The failure was not entirely surprising for the CSU, but Sunday ended a process that was already foreseen for almost ten years: the undisputed hegemony of a state party disappeared.
Ten years ago, in 1998 the CSU obtained 47.7 percent, for the first time below 50 percent since the 1950s.
This was repeated three years ago, in the 2005 Bundestag elections, that is, even during the so-called Stoiber era.
The reason for this is the consequent modernization of the CSU in the eating province of its parents.
Sociologists have been predicting this for 40 years, but at the same time they were wrong, but secularization, the results of the education and settlement of the North Germans in the developed regions of Bavaria had their negative consequences on the fidelity of the CSU voters.
With modernization, the possibilities also increase and this also has political consequences.
The right-wing group is intact, only within the group itself the most conscious, critical, and stubborn voters became.
It is surprising that in recent weeks it was precisely the conventional groups of citizens who moved away the most from the CSU; the self-employed, the small industrialists, those who have a bachelor’s degree and the graduates.
This led to less than 40 percent of the CSU’s support.
The Press (diepresse.com)
The conservative newspaper in Vienna: "Who with whom? In its article entitled "Party presidents are very reserved on coalition issues" - deals with the confusing situation of domestic politics after the Austrian elections.
The SP<0xC3><0x96> wants to negotiate with the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
The <0xC3><0x96>VP prohibits the SP<0xC3><0x96> from interfering in its internal affairs.
The BZ<0xC3><0x96> is open in all directions to negotiate, but the Greens do not yet want to make consultations on the coalition.
Elections have already been held, now everything revolves around the coalition; in the debate held on public television, party leaders barely allowed to see anything of their decks.
Werner Faymann, the SP<0xC3><0x96> president, confirmed that he wants to negotiate with the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
The SP<0xC3><0x96> wants to show that collaboration between the two parties is possible - this already exists in some provinces and social associations.
Fayman left unanswered the question of whether he can imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current president of the <0xC3><0x96>VP, in the position of vice-chancellor.
He claimed that in any case they disapproved of the Schüssel-Molterer era.
It is not possible to follow this political trend.
Molterer reacted cautiously to the red offers.
He said that cooperation will certainly not be successful if Faymann tries to interfere in the internal affairs of the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
It is still open in the party if they elect the opposition or enter the coalition, these issues must certainly be discussed, within the <0xC3><0x96>VP itself.
The president of the BZ<0xC3><0x96>, Jörg Haider, was open in all directions.
“To prevent the red-black coalition, we are willing to take responsibility for the government,” Haider said.
J<0xC3><0xA1>roka: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today the European Summit for Equal Opportunities has started in Paris, its host is France, which this year is also the president of the European Union.
Livia J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka, a member of the European People’s Party for the Fidesz, in her message addressed to the plenary, as one of the main speakers of this professional meeting, drew attention to segregation in education, because it is one of the most serious violations that hit Roma children and is also the biggest obstacle to their interest in the prevalence.
This high-level conference was inaugurated on behalf of the French Presidency by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs, and by Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Representatives of governments, European social partners and representatives of the most important European organisations for the protection of social rights attended the meeting.
J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka - according to the press office of the Fidesz group in the European Parliament - warned that in addition to discrimination in employment, Roma remain out of the labour market primarily because of their low level of schooling.
“Most young Roma have not finished secondary education and due to the poor quality of basic education, only a small part can obtain a university degree.”
J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka also stressed that education, as a fundamental human right, plays a decisive role in the predominant foundation of other human rights as well.
Investing in the education of Roma children at an early age can strengthen the economy of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the MEP, it is necessary to raise broad awareness of these issues both among Gypsies and among non-Gypsies.
For the sooner a Gypsy student starts school, the more chances he will have to become an active member of the labor market; through income and consumption taxes they will also contribute to the national budget.
“Gypsies, as citizens of the European Union, must be assured of the right to quality education and ensure the abolition of segregated and low-level education,” said L<0xC3><0xAD>via J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka.
According to the MEP, the objective and active unity of the European Union is necessary in order to speed up the processes of school detachment immediately, for which it is essential that the existing and planned anti-discrimination directives are properly complied with.
"We must break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment, we must offer Roma children the possibility that guarantees democratic space so that they can contribute to the future of Europe as citizens of full rights," he said.
The aim of the European Summit for Equal Opportunities, organized annually since the Berlin meeting last year, which was held in the sign of the "European Year of Equal Opportunities", is to ensure a unique forum to promote the abolition of discrimination and equal opportunities at the European and national level.
CSU: grace for a transitional period
A decision will be made at the end of October on the fate of the failed Huber-Beckstein duo.
Despite the serious electoral defeat, heads have not yet been cut off at the summits of the Bavarian CSU, so far the debate on personal issues has been postponed.
Erwin Huber, party president, and Günther Beckstein, provincial prime minister, are still in office, but it is not known how long the grace will last.
The fate of the duo, which suffered a catastrophic election defeat of 17 percent, will be decided at the party’s extraordinary congress to be held on the last weekend of October.
The members of the so-criticized duo let go: they don’t cling so much to their posts.
With this they sought to reassure the furious members of their parliamentary group and their base organization, who one day after the "Bavarian tsunami" demanded personal consequences due to the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago — though under the direction of Edmund Stoiber who was at the top of his career — the social Christian union reached 60.7 percent, but now, a year after the coup against Stoiber, they achieved only 43.4 percent.
The CSU for 46 years had a “monopoly” in Bavaria that gives 18 percent of German GDP.
Although in the southern province, of key importance to the Hungarian economy, conservatives continue to dominate, in the future they will undoubtedly have to make a coalition with someone.
As the first sign of the party’s restructuring, Vice President Horst Seehofer, one of Huber’s possible successors, also holds a position in the small intelligence group that is negotiating with the liberal FDP and the Right-wing Free voters about a possible governmental coalition in Munich.
The strange thing about the fate is that Gabriele Pauli, whose performance against Stoiber was exploited for the Huber-Beckstein coup and then cruelly wiped out of the stage of ambitious local politics, enters parliament.
The CSU’s top leaders are now investing all their energy to stabilize Beckstein.
In the transition it will also receive an active role Stoiber who so far was moving the ropes in the background, the former provincial head of government and former president of the CSU called September 28 as the most bitter day of his political career.
On Monday Huber made some critical remarks to the CDU, in his opinion they would have deserved much more support from the brother party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a warning to the CDU and to Angela Merkel herself as well.
After the September 2009 Bundestag elections, Merkel will not be able to be chancellor if they are not able to highlight together the CSU that played a transcendental role in the successes of the 2005 national elections.
According to Merkel that she could hardly hide her disappointment over the failure, the CSU’s losses will not negatively affect the great Berlin coalition.
Which is of course relative: it will not be easier to treat the injured CSU and the crisis of the Social Democrats continues.
The SPD with its 18.6 percent achieved its worst result since 1946 in Bavaria.
The opposition of Lukashenko: 110-0
After Sunday’s elections, there will be no opposition MP in the Belarusian parliament.
According to Russian observers, this is explained by the well-being and stability it guarantees in the country Alexander Lukashenko, but according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), this is more explained by the violations of the law committed during the counting of votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the election result.
While the legislature of the country of 10 million inhabitants, consisting of one percent and ten deputies, more than a decade ago has no opposition, before yesterday's elections the united opposition under the name of United Democratic Forces (ODSZ) entrenchment expected that the parliament of this time with the modification of Lukashenko, which for the fourth time renewed its mandate after the 2006 elections.
Thus the ODSZ abolished the boycott that it originally wanted to do.
At the bottom of the anticipation of the opposition was that Belarus, which is increasingly economically dependent on Russia - which took a credit to moderate the import of natural gas increasingly expensive from Russia and which contributed to the sale to Russia of Beltransgaz regime, political owner of the political pipeline that passes through the country - considered high to have a political dependence on the country - wanted to improve to give him a non-European relationship with the Union.
It was a sign of dissatisfaction when the OSCE, in evaluating the election campaign, placed emphasis on positive phenomena rather than on mistakes – such as the ban on participation imposed on a third of opposition candidates.
However, the OSCE's primary report on Monday even criticized the campaign itself - in which opposition candidates could not appear in the press - and especially that the opposition could not be present in the vote count.
With all this in the opinion of the opposition there is an improvement in the political climate: political prisoners have been released and Minsk is willing to a small confrontation with Moscow, denying recognition of the separation of South Ossetia and Abkhazia from Georgia, although Russia considers indefinite - with which Belarus already makes a federal state.
"We have taken two steps forward and one backward, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the European Union has begun," Milinkevich told the newspaper.
According to the opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential election, it is desirable to maintain this situation, even though "the regime fears allowing the entry of so many even an opponent in that weightless parliament."
The opposition does not plan to organise protest demonstrations on seeing the results, rather it is trying to send voters its message about the need for economic reforms.
- This clearly causes us many problems because we must print the press of the opposition in Russia, the local authorities put difficulties before their distribution, but even so I see that there are more and more those who support the change among the elderly also - said Milinkevich regime, citing more security that they are not official to the regime of Lukashenko, who believes that the main result is the social.
Due to the country’s indebtedness and the increase in the trade deficit, it is only a matter of time before the breakdown of social security “looks like the silence of the cemeteries,” Milinkevich said.
Russian observers, unlike the opposition politician, called the elections democratic.
Sergei Lebedev, Head of Mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States, told the Russian news agency Ria Novosti: “People do not believe in words but in facts,” so the lack of opposition is nothing more than a testimony of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on, you'll have more breakfast before you start working"
It has never happened in the history of Chigi Palace that they would put automatic doors to control the entry and exit of staff.
but from today he starts with this measure against whom to file and then goes to the bar to have a coffee in working hours.
This novelty has been presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta and by the Secretary General of the Presidency of the Council, Mauro Masi.
“Automatic doors,” says Brunetta, “are an instrument to work better, with greater productivity, more presence and more services.”
“A new season of responsibility and transparency is now opening.
This is Reformism,” Brunetta once again emphasizes.
With Chigi Palace the installation is completed in all the buildings of the Council Presidency.
For Masi, “the choice of automatic doors is also important from a symbolic point of view.”
No resistance has been found on the part of the employees, the secretary-general says: "It has been a change shared by the workers and there has been collaboration on the part of them."
In short, no more breakfast in working hours; no more coffee and midnight.
Brunetta's word, which suggests, smiling, "a good cappuccino at 7 a.m. is a holy hand."
During a convention at the Higher School of Public Administration
In Rome, the minister states that "in three months the absences due to diseases of public employees have been reduced by 50%, that is, 60,000 more people to work in a year".
And he adds that it is necessary to render more effective the Public Administration
Italy, “which wage dynamics in the last 8-10 years have been double in relation to the private sector and well above the inflation rate.”
For now, millions of public employees have joined forces to oppose the rules of the Brunetta decree adhering to the petition backed by the Codacons.
“While the Minister of Public Service shows the numbers, the lower absenteeism of work due to illness – writes the consumer association – the people of the ‘vacant workers’ is constantly increasing.
There are millions of correct and productive public administration employees in Italy who have come together to declare war on the illegitimate norms of the decree.”
In particular, the Tar challenged the exclusion of economic treatments combined due to illness due to service; the extension of the time zones in which the medical check-up visits of the sick employee are carried out, and other aspects contained in the new provisions desired by the Minister.
Work Accidents, Napolitano: "Critical Prevention"
Every day, 2,500 accidents occur at work in Italy, 3 people die and 27 are permanently invalid.
For 2007, Inail data effectively confirm that white deaths have been approximately 1,200.
Figures that testify to the severity of a phenomenon that is one of the leading causes of death and causes nearly twice as many deaths as homicides.
To draw the attention of institutions, social forces and media on this dramatic issue, today Anmil celebrates in all the provinces of Italy the 58th national day for victims of work accidents, institutionalized on the second Sunday of October.
“The disturbing data disseminated by the Anmil and the tragic news these days confirm how crucial the issue of prevention at work is,” said the President of the Republic Giorgio Napolitano, in a message sent to the president of the Anmil, National Association mutilated and invalid by work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses his “great appreciation for the constant associative effort in favour of workplace prevention, the protection of injured workers, the assistance to the families of the victims and the raising of public awareness”.
"It has manifested itself, a 'sufficient', sincerely shared, in the face of tragedies that, by their dimensions, arouse the cry of the media and the participation of public opinion, instead the daily reality proposes dramatic cases, even repeated in their dynamics."
Napolitano does not hide that "there is undoubtedly a resource problem: it is crucial to invest in training and information.
The numerous initiatives promoted in the field of schooling are of particular importance for a more direct awareness of young people entering the world of work.
It is a duty to keep the attention to the phenomenon alive, not to curb the alarm about social gravity, to apply and improve legislative rules.
For his part, the President of the House Gianfranco Fini has stressed "how the phenomenon of white deaths constitutes an absolute social emergency, which offends the conscience of each of us and imposes a determined effort on all institutions to put an urgent end to it."
“The data on accidents at work seems to indicate a slight positive trend, but this does not remove the equally impressive number of white deaths,” said Anmil president Pietro Mercandelli.
“We do not want this ‘decrease trend’ to translate into less attention, because it is precisely when attention diminishes that tragedy exploits.
“We believe that in general, too little is still done to counter the phenomenon of accidents and the remedy can be exercised through multiple actions.
They are necessary, at our discretion - has emphasized Mercandelli - greater controls and inspections, but also a stronger intervention on the training of workers, and this from the world of the school ".
“There is a further effort,” he added, “as far as communication and public awareness are concerned.
But it serves, above all, a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers regarding a phenomenon that represents a social emergency.”
Mercandelli has denounced “the progressive deterioration in the level of subsidiary protection envisaged for victims of work” and the “assistant derivation to which the system is heading in recent years.”
“The goal is to return the insurance guarantee to the worker because the luck of the one who crashes doesn’t have to depend on the gift provided by the legislator every time.”
Mp3 Players Under Accusation, Risk Hearing
Listening to high-volume music for a long time using portable music devices such as Mp3 players can cause permanent hearing damage.
As far as the European Commission is concerned, in a communiqué circulated in Brussels, it cites the opinion of the EU’s newly identified and emerging (Csrseri) Scientific Commission on health risks, published today.
"From this scientific opinion, 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music with portable musical devices for more than an hour a day having the high-volume device risk a permanent loss of hearing ability."
“I am concerned that such a high number of young people who frequently use portable music devices and high-acoustic cell phones can unconsciously ruin their ears in an irreparable way,” says Meglena Kuneva.
“From the scientific evidence – the EU responsibility follows – emerges a clear risk and we must react quickly.
What matters is raising awareness among consumers and providing this public domain information.
We must also re-examine the existing control systems in the light of this scientific opinion, so that they are widely effective and keep up with the new technology."
Brussels had asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, seeing the large use of portable musical instruments and the increase in the number of young people exposed to the noise that it causes.
"Scientists confirm that this is cause for concern and the European Commission will now examine, together with Member States and stakeholders, what measures could possibly be taken to better protect children and adolescents from noise exposure from portable musical instruments and soap operas."
At present, there is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable musical instruments to 100 dB, but concern increases as hearing damage can result from excessive exposure to such sources of noise.
It is possible to greatly limit these damages by resorting to solutions such as reducing levels and exposure time to noise.
In its opinion, the Scientific Committee of the European Union points out that if users of portable musical instruments listen to music at high volume (more than 89 decibels) for only 5 hours per week they exceed the currently in force limit for the maximum noise allowed in the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for longer periods, risk permanent hearing loss after a period of 5 years.
It means it affects 5-10% of users of such devices and the number can be quantified between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Alemanno gives way to the Commission for the future of the capital
Today it starts, in March it closes, in June the accounts will be made.
This is the calendar set by the Municipality and for the workers of the "Commission for the future of the capital of Rome", which has been established this morning in its new headquarters behind the Thermal Baths of Caracalla.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will deliberate on the main points for Rome.
Once the doors are closed in March, the board and the municipal council will evaluate analyses and projects, in order to present in June the Strategic Plan for Rome with the "official bullet" of the Municipality and its intendant Gianni Alemanno.
“The Commission is absolutely independent and is represented by all political, social and cultural ideas – Alemanno tends to stress – It will have to provide proposals for the development of Rome in which those who decide politically, the board and the municipal council, can then be applauded.
There is no position left of roles, only the will to have a place to develop a great project for Rome.
In March the work will disappear, because this experience must have a precise timeline.
In June we will present the strategic plan using the work done by the Commission for the future of the capital of Rome.”
To whom the Commission accuses of being useless, given that its opinions are not binding, Alemanno replies: "It all depends on the work the Commission will be able to do and the quality of its proposals.
If quality is present, as in France with the Attali Commission and as I am sure in Rome, its contribution will be fundamental.
Almost always the policy is crushed in the ordinary management and in emergencies that turn around manifest.
We, on the contrary, want to look beyond and in the long term, in a deeper perspective, working seriously on the development of Rome and its future.”
The intention of Rome also tends to point out that "this Commission is neither a useless entity nor a banality: it is absolutely free, does not cost a euro to Roman citizens and will serve to make the best minds expressed by the capital participate and reason".
For Alemanno, indeed, "we need to have a strategic design as a reference, not closed or immobile, to allow our city to make an authentic level jump, of which we have an absolute need, thinking with a united spirit about its future".
A future that, according to Rome’s intention, “will not only be limited to the current communal borders but will look beyond” not only in the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal status of Capital but “also considering the role that Rome can and should develop as the Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean”.
Obama, the first anti-American president.
He wrote a well-known American politician who is interested in running for independence: “Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who with his decisions reduced the U.S. economy and tube relations (as he also does today private citizen) with the enemy Islam.
Attacks on Obama are increasing as the election date approaches.
A Miami lady wrote on a Web site: “This person is full of ambition.
Obama has a big stone face: he thinks he’s won the nation’s highest office that has had two governors and five black senators!”
They are actually attacks that don’t say much; they are clearly racist attacks and don’t answer the voters’ question: will he be a good president? And there are polls; everyone says Obama wins and with a good edge.
There are those who speak to the heart, but not to the brain.
A Mississippi newspaper, in the southern bowels of the United States, wrote an editorial: Once in the cab to vote, we will know who will vote for the American patriot.
There is a side of the American mentality that has been covered up to the last.
“Whatever you want, we’ll think about where to put the cross, whether about Obama or McCain.”
There are people who swear that if Obama wins, we will leave America.
things never said before now, which seems almost certain the success of the black candidate.
Yet despite all these reasonings, the winning weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
They have asked 1,500 people: What have been the mistakes Bush made during his term? 89 percent have answered: Iraq.
Change America.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50,000 soldiers and was sent home to kick in the ass.
In Iraq there are 4,500 soldiers who have lost their lives and the Americans have not been forced to pack their bags.
Iraq for the majority has also been Bush’s weak point.
Whoever takes the post of George W will have a huge duty to develop.
In the United States, the economic collapse is also felt for journalists: in the newspapers it is time to cut. Many blame the Internet, "killer" of the printed paper.
Five hundred American journalists have been questioned by the PEW Research Center about the state of their profession and mind control for the future.
Today, however, journalists are almost all pessimistic about their future.
However, journalists have not openly stated that they are less concerned about credibility.
They don’t feel isolated like they once did.
The problem for American journalists is money, the money.
The crisis of 2008 for these journalists is a crisis of economic model destroyed.
In addition, the cuts made in the room where the editors work to make the newspaper, is a big problem.
It is a problem that must be solved, according to the journalists interviewed, if you do not want traditional journalism as understood by the majority of the public to be substantially reduced.
A clear but complex pessimism prevails today over the American journalist.
Six out of ten journalists and executives are convinced that national journalism is on the wrong track.
In the local field, the executive group is 65%.
Printed against emissions.
It is not difficult for journalists to see where the web goes.
The largest publishing houses open a gap on the Internet, for many seen as the "killer" of the printed letter.
The “economic pressure” that journalists warn has increased to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed have admitted that they are embracing technology in the hope of “doing something good” for journalism.
The biggest break in American journalism today is between who runs the newspapers – namely the directors – and the journalists who work for them.
Fifty-six percent of executives at the national level are confident that their journalists share the same values, while at the local level the percentage drops to 23 percent.
For some, this has to do with “safety at work.”
Executives who plan to lose their jobs in 3 years are 47% nationally.
For journalistic staff it is 30%.
The issue of "safe work" at the staff level (our editors, etc.) in America is always on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work with a contract.
In a huge nation like the U.S., with 300 million inhabitants and millions of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV, and the Internet, employers often offer what they want and thus become a matter of "take it or leave it".
Directors almost always get good salaries, while editors can earn up to $10,000 a month, plus retirement and social security.
For holidays, reasoning becomes complicated: a total of days in the first year, another after the third to reach 15 full days after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, by his admission, are "sick" followed by the year.
It's all a matter of climate.
UNIPOL: TRIBUNAL OF ROME, DANILO COPPOLA SEES IN GROTTAFERRATA
The president of the second criminal section of the Rome court, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the instance of real estate agent Danilo Coppola who had requested to be able to move from his city, Grottaferrata, to a room in the city of Rome.
Coppola is being investigated for bankruptcy in the field of research on the counter-pact on Unipol-Bnl escalation.
In the course of the arrest process under his charge, last week, he obtained home release, turning it into a mandatory residence to Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked for the real estate agent to be able to travel the route from the city of the province to a room in the capital.
According to the court, these trips (which the prime minister has voted against) would allow him to influence his society and access the evidence that accuses him.
The Elites in Danger
The phenomenon had already manifested a few days ago with the House vote against the $700 million bailout plan put in place by the White House: a significant part of Americans was, and is, more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
The New York Times yesterday informed us that the ongoing crisis is disarming the Republican Party, increasingly divided between its old East Coast soul, moderate, favorable to federal institutions and the business community, and its new soul, instead, conservative, hostile to "those of Washington" and to the strong South-Centre, to the world of finance.
The soul, in fact, has become premeditated with the vote of whom he spoke at the beginning.
This is just one example of the mutations, of the great mutations, that the ongoing economic earthquake announces: not only in the United States but throughout the West and not just here alone.
Whether in the United States or Europe for a long time, the crisis seems to act as an accelerator for incubation phenomena that with the new climate solidify and come to light.
The first of these phenomena is the re-upgradation, the extraordinary reactivation, of the double category state-sovereignty in relation to a type of renationalization of the economy.
The crisis, indeed, is a crisis of banking institutions – which would finance, if any, have strong financial relations with the outside world, but above all, the balance sheets of families living in a single country and in a single state are much more compromised.
The one that immediately creates a political problem for those who govern it: that is, how to respond to the difficulties and protests of those people and those families who, on the other hand, are voters.
The crisis appears economically global but is politically and exclusively national.
Political internationalism seems substantially out of the question or has little to say: the crucial test is the European Union, which as always is divided between different interests and different state strategies, is not enough to decide on any common policy.
It is from the government of each state that everyone expects intervention, rescue and reactivation plans, new rules and above all the subsidy of funds: from the moment you arrive at the court it is only the state that has the economic resources and the mass of financial resources to remedy things.
And they also have the necessary means and the legitimacy to use them: two resources of incalculable value, values in certain circumstances in which no market and no organization can ever have to the same extent.
This new emphasis that the crisis places on the nation-state is in perfect tune, with the greatest importance whenever the new development of the economy tends to attribute to a factor very attached to that element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, while we were convinced that we had entered the network of increasingly sophisticated technology, the intangible, while we were convinced that global finance was already destined to dominate the world, we realized that our future will instead have to do more and more with the little intangible things like water, crops and oil.
All things that, look, can certainly be transported from one place to another on earth but are equally united in absolute fashion in a circumscribed space, a territory.
So whoever finds himself as sovereign, certainly has many more letters about who he is not, and who has the misfortune of living in a place without crops, without oil and without water.
I come to the second novelty, but it presages a fracture.
Whoever says Territory, State, Government, inevitably says Politics and Leadership.
In this sense, the economic crisis seems to produce two convergent phenomena.
On the one hand, the objective awareness of the need for leadership, the request of someone who knows how to handle the situation.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit for existing leaderships, of an inadequate economic nature with many dark zones.
And together something deeper and in a certain disturbing sense: a discredit, an intolerance, an inadequate image, a sense of distance, which tends to involve the entire ruling class of Western countries in an increasing number.
It seems to advance ever more, in various places of the population, the conviction that before their actions are the same as those of the social elites up until now, the same way of feeling and being, their culture in the understandable exception of the term, to have made their own time and to be more foreign to the opinions of the majority.
The demand for leadership in Italy, in short, feeds underground a branched but powerful movement of delegitimization of the ruling classes and the traditional political structures, which also manifest themselves in an electoral "revolution" or in the sudden changes in the collective humors of recent times, which will be seen by the socialist movement in Austria.
It has the impression that the traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their format would say some, will always make it more difficult to understand and then to represent, what is potentially taking shape from today are the deep strata of Western society and that it is in a state of economic crisis.
In the face of all this speaking of a “mass rebellion” today is frankly exaggerated.
But having your eyes open is certainly not.
The super glue to walk on the walls
Overcome the laws of gravity thanks to a super glue and in the future walk on the walls like the spider man.
It is the target of several American research centers and now a team of four institutes has come quite close.
With an adhesive of only 2.5 square centimeters, scientists have been able to paste a 100 kilo body on a vertical wall.
The American journal Science has published the findings of some researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the team of researchers is an evolution of existing ones using a particular carbon structure, called carbon nanotubes.
“The glue principle can be imagined as a series of tubes arranged like a pile of spaghetti,” explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists have been inspired by the legs of geckos, covered with microscopic hairs that can assure the animal a perfect adherence.
Tests done on different materials, such as glass, teflon and sandpaper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the legs of this reptile and at the same time “easily takes off the walls,” explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the University of Dayton’s Engineering faculty.
"This material could be useful as a transient adhesive," adds Liming Dai.
Yes, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use such as the connection between electronic devices, because carbon nanotubes are conductors of heat and electrical current.
Other applications may have to do with aerospace engineering.
No superheroes at the moment.
OTHER INVESTIGATION - Also the University of Berkeley, California, is dedicated to the search for a new adhesive.
In an article in the American Chemical Society, Californian researchers have presented an adhesive made of microfibers as hair that self-cleans itself of dust during movement on a surface to always maintain a perfect adhesion.
Drugs: never with fruit juice
Attention to grapefruit juice, orange juice and apple juice.
These drinks, consumed especially in summer because they are refreshing and rich in vitamins, if taken simultaneously with some drugs their absorption is altered by amplifying or decreasing as the case may be, efficiency with serious consequences for health.
To repeat the risk of fruit juices to be packaged freshly associated with the intake of some medicines David Bailey, a professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, who since the 236th national meeting of the American Chemical Society in progress in Philadelphia, sends a new health and health concern to Philadelphia by reducing the effect of the fruit juices.
Grapefruit juice had already been charged because it was held responsible for increasing to toxic levels some anti-arrhythmic, antibiotic, anxiolytic, antihistamine and neurological drugs.
PHARMACEUTICALS – The same Italian drug agency had given the news in an information bulletin two years ago warning doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger arising from this mixture and to pay attention to what is being drunk in case a drug such as Diasepam or Me is being taken.
NOT ONLY POPULAR – According to experts, orange juice and apple juice also contain substances that inhibit the drugs.
A long list of active ingredients inhibited by grapefruit and other juices.
Michele Carruba, director of the Department of Pharmacology at the State University of Milan, said: “These discoveries are generally pointed out to the various international and national drug agencies that eventually provide for changing the informational notes of the same.
Therefore, you should always read the illustrative leaflets of the medicines that are taken and if there is something that is not clear to us, do not let us be impressed, ask clearly the doctor or pharmacist,” said the expert of the agency Ansa.
The Novel of Economics by Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize in Economics has been awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his studies, his models of commerce and on the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a neo-Keynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is a noted New York Times editor.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush administration’s decisions regarding the economy and foreign policy.
A few months after the September 11, 2001 attack, in those days that Enron broke, Krugman had predicted in an editorial published by the New York Times that the second event would be more decisive than the first, in terms of consequence for the United States.
A prediction that triggers a lot of controversy and that for several years has been blamed on the economy, but that has now proven accurate.
“I’m surprised and a little upset at how the memory of the Enron and Worldcom collapse scandal has quickly disappeared from the public’s attention,” Krugman said in a statement.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a “great-value economist,” but also a “very aggressive, particularly critical proponent of the Bush administration’s excesses of liberalism.”
Open Office, echo the third edition of the "anti-Microsoft" package
It’s the day of the launch of OpenOffice.org 3.0, the open source suite of personal productivity that aims to attract more and more users, from home to office to public administration professionals, as a free alternative to the well-known Microsoft Office.
After almost a year of work by volunteer developers, whose backs are monitored by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office is shown to the public with several novelties: to the welcome screen and to the less coarse magazine interface, ISO are added more consistent, such as the compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X format.
Attention also put to multi-function with the Office 2007 suite, Open Office is able to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting some specific features of some modules such as the one that allows you to reduce the size of the PowerPoint presentation, useful for example, for sending it via email, or the possibility of importing the PDF file into the graphical processing module, while preserving the original appearance of the page.
On this front you can always create "Hybrid PDF" documents, which accumulate the typical graphics of the Adobe format with the elements of a spreadsheet or a word processor.
Collaboration is an element that has received different improvements within the applications: in the spreadsheet can intervene on different users, avoiding conflicts of modifications, in the elaboration of texts, each collaborator is given a color in the comment for better recognition in the review phase.
Some companies are also working to bring some OpenOffice features to the Web (on the cloud, on the clouds), and in the coming weeks they should give the final result.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://en.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and is added to the English version that was in the mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, as usual the suite is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request, the installation CD can also be sent home or to work.
And if the theme of the free can be a hook for broadcasting in the homes, it is in the business area that Open Office the suite tests, tries the big bet, can already count on several projects carried out in the public administration and in the schools.
And not even the realities that offer an ideal training, consultation and assistance service for small and medium-sized enterprises, where business prospects could be opened up, are missing.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for video writing the corresponding Word; Calc, is the spreadsheet that replaces Excel; Impress, for PowerPoint presentation; Dbase, in the case of the known Access, is the program that allows to work on the database; and finally Draw the graphical module.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that until today we have reached almost 3 million 600 thousand, with the release of the new version it is likely that the expected figure can be exceeded.
Kohl is also the fourth case of doping
A new positive case on the Tour de France: the Austrian Bernhard Kohl, the Gerolsteiner team, third-ranked and winner of the climber’s best belt.
To give the news is the website of the newspaper L'Equipe.
Kohl, 26, is the fourth Epo positive runner of the third generation, after Italians Riccardo Ricc<0xC3><0xB2> and Leonardo Piepoli and German Stefan Schumacher, also from the Gerolsteiner.
The analyses of Kohl's blood champions are among those carried out in recent weeks in the labs of Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the counter-tests confirm that it is positive, the Austrian will lose third place in the Tour and anger against the two years of canonical disqualification.
To confirm the news of Kohl’s positive doping to the third generation Epo is the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who has told the Associated Press that he has notified the news to the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian has positioned himself on the podium behind Spanish Carlos Sastre and American Cadel Evans, awarding himself the helm of the best climber.
INMIGRANTES:NEW YORK TIMES ASKED, IS ITALY RACISTA?
Italy as an immigrant country has only recently become a privileged destination for immigrants "hostilely welcomed.
Is this turning the beautiful country into a nation of racists? This is what the New York Times asks in a long article that has devoted to the debate on racism in Italy starting from the case of the young Abdul William Guibre from Burkina Faso who was murdered last month in Milan for stealing a box of cookies.
This case demonstrates what the New York Times defines the “Northern Paradox”: the northern regions are at the same time those where “more integration and more work” is recorded but also the country’s highest anti-immigrant sentiment and the highest support of the Northern League.
As confirmation of the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the New York Times has also cited the episodes of intolerance in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not only.
Also, the new legislation that the League loves tightens the brakes on immigration and facilitates the expulsion of illegal immigrants is cited as a paradigm of climate change in Italy.
A trend marked both by the Pope and by the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano meeting Benedict XVI in Congress has called for the state and the church to work together to fight racism."
Student victims of expensive rent, up to 900 euros for a room
The rent market for college students is not aware of the crisis.
According to the latest Sunia survey, the tenant union, renting a single room could cost a student 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 to Naples, 600 to Rome.
"the phenomenon has already assumed very serious characteristics to the point of excluding the right to study a large part of young people for the very high costs that the family would have to bear - explains the head of the Sunia studies office, Laura Mariani - in these cities the strong demand has resided completely deformed the market to the point of triggering them to a general process increase."
Apart from the fact that in most cases rental offers contain a number of violations: free-type contracts, unregistered, no fee limit, linked sub-rents.
For Sunia, extraordinary interventions are needed that, through the revision of the taxation, can be regulated prices.
Looking at the survey in detail, we see that in Milan, for a bed in Brianza zone, they serve approximately 450 euros; for a single room from a minimum of 650 (Bande Nere zone) to an average value of 800 (zone Lambiate, Udine and Fiera) to a maximum of 900 (in Victoria zone).
In Florence, a bed costs an average of 350/400 euros, a room about 700.
In Bologna, where students are concentrated in the areas near the University, 250/280 euros for a bed in a double room and 370 to 500 euros for an individual.
In Rome in the central areas near the University (San Lorenzo, Plaza Bologna) you are asked about 600 euros for a single room and 450 for a bed in a double room.
Only slightly lower values (550 euros for a single room) in areas near other Universities (Ostiense and Cinecitt<0xC3><0xA0>).
Economy is made only if the peripheral area is changed: 300 euros for a bed and 450 for a single room in Prenestina area, Centocelle and surroundings.
In Naples for a bed you serve 300/450 euros, for a room is spent from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei zones.
In Bari for a bed you serve 250/350 euros, at least 350 for an individual.
in the cities more girls prices are lower in absolute terms, but has a greater weight in the city's economy.
In cities such as Perugia, where the phenomenon of student and non-community rentals is more common, there is another anomaly: a 25-30% increase in the canon to foreign students compared to Italians.
Farewell to the old Paradiso cinema, the cities cancel the historic halls
The historic cinemas close favoring the multiplexes.
“A city without cinemas in a blind city is like a face without eyes.”
The image offered by director Giuseppe Tornatore effectively photographs what is happening in the major Italian urban centers and also in the provincial cities.
The process of the marginalization of cinemas, which with the birth of the great meticons in the periphery and the consequent disappearance of the monkey rooms in the central areas of the city, is an inevitable and indisputable event with all the characteristics of a true cultural crime.
To disappear almost always are historical places, full of memory, "it is as if a friend died, a friend with whom a piece of place and so much emotion was shared", observes the director of the new cinema Paradiso, the film that twenty years ago I always won the Oscar and the grand prize of the jury to Cannes.
The figures given by the Anec, the main association of merchants, speak clearly: in the last five years have closed 316 traditional cinemas, and to pay the most are mainly the halls of the main cities: 10 less in Florence, 9 less in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by the closures are first, Emilia-Romagna with 82 cinemas less, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
It is a demonstration that the person responsible for its disappearance is the event of the multiplex, are own of these three Italian regions that have recorded the largest number of new meticone cinemas: 195 screens more in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 in Tuscany than in Emilia-Romagna.
“The Italian exercise has developed irrationally,” observes Paolo Protti, president of the Anec, “it would be useful if new structures were built, but it would be necessary to ensure the permanence of existing ones, because when a city hall closes, not all its attendees are willing to move to the meticones.
Not to mention the lack of funds in favour of traders: the previous debt of the state is about 10 million euros.
It is shameful from the ethical and moral point of view that the government does not respect the laws that exist.
To support the sector would serve between 16 and 18 million euros per year.”
Interestingly, the case of Bologna, the first Italian city to worry about the closures, decided to repair the signing of a protocol between the municipality and Anec, the first of its kind in Italy to promote and protect the cinema mono sala be in the historical center and on the outskirts.
Among the rules envisaged are mediation of tax facilitation in favour of managers and advantages for the public in terms of mobility: viewers will be able to enter the restricted traffic area and will have special parking fees.
“It’s an initiative that I like,” notes Giuseppe Tornatore, “and I hope other cities will follow the example of Bologna setting up other measures.
It is true, that to contrast the extra power of meticons, traditional rooms have to improve the quality of sound and image because the audience today is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a theme that has always been important to me: the closure of the cinema of Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to make the "New Cinema Paradise", which I had already thought for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass in front of the Rialto or the Quirinale of Via Nazionale already closed, where I have lived so many shared emotions, not to see the posters blackened by the dust, I turn to the other side.
Liaison between politics and 'drangheta, the mayor of Gioia Tauro has been arrested
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was available to unify the municipal elections for those interested in the Piromalli hull."
The accusations made by the judges of the Anti-Mafia Directorate of Calabria are heavy to the Goia Tauro Intendant and Deputy Intendant Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and the Rosarno Intendant Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for mafia association.
Also arrested Gioacchino Piromalli, the senior mediator between the clan and the public administration, and his grandson lawyer, homonymous to the boss, already convicted of criminal mafia association and to compensate 10 million euros.
"Disregarding any legal and moral norms, and common sense," the prosecutors write, the two local administrations had expressed their willingness to pay consultations to Piramalli's lawyer.
“The Mafia family would have been allowed – write the judges – to officially enter the municipality facilitating the great possibility of control and command of the public administration.”
The president of the Calabrian regional council Agazio Loiero does not hide that "agreements between organized bad life there are a lot" in his region: "There are areas where mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where the agreement is almost inevitable.
But there are so many local politicians who resist the pressure of the 'drangheta, heroes who keep themselves clean.'
The detainees of this morning are added to those of last July after the police had announced the cut of the head of the Piramalli mafia family.
Since the end of last April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had dissolved, already in 1991 and always due to alleged conditions between organized crime and local administration, local politicians had been relieved of the responsibility of administering the municipality.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, a Udc leader at the time of the dissolution, after the election in May 2006, had been elected as head of a centre-right coalition.
I explode a scandal when the Prefecture orders the dissolution of the municipal council.
I call in question the deputy interior minister who at the time was Marco Minniti, accusing him of having organized everything for a political issue, but the judges in the warrant signed this morning explain that Piromalli had even come to request the variation of the A3 road project.
From the environmental interceptions made to Dal Torrione, the judges write, emerges "the willingness to favor the demands of an entrepreneur, representative of a group very close to the Piromalli clan, uniformizing the elections of the public administration over the interests of the mafia families."
When the energy comes from the waves, the big waves come down to the stage.
It is an exterminated site that occupies more than 70% of the planet’s surface and they are discovering it now, the world’s major energy companies.
Waves, currents, tides are the new renewable sources on which the big ones look like Chevron.
The possibility of collecting energy from sea movements has been studied for a hundred years and in the 1970s along with the first oil crisis, research intensified.
When the price of oil was low in 1980, the idea of exploiting marine energy was discarded, but now environmental cases and the new rise in oil are driving the sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London has estimated by 2007 that 15 percent of the world’s electricity needs could be covered by implants that exploit the movement of sea waves.
That would be twice the amount currently produced by nuclear power plants.
And there would also be currents and tides.
Giants to attack.
The first company to bet on marine energy has been Enersis, which in 2005 has sealed an agreement to build an implant in the North of Portugal.
When the intention was announced, it seemed like a revolutionary step.
Two years away to bet on marine energy are always more and among these companies who have always voted for traditional energy.
“Chevron is studying technology on ocean energy,” said a spokesperson for a company associated with the U.S. oil colossus to the Wall Street Journal, “and is evaluating the possibility of cooperating with us.”
The cooperation in question is about obtaining permission from the U.S. Energy Commission to carry out a project to exploit marine energy in Alaska.
It is a pretty important sign, if you consider that in Alaska the U.S. continues to extract oil and recently President Bush has activated a plan for further drilling.
In addition to Chevron is New York’s Verdant Power Inc. and New Jersey’s Ocean Power to follow the path of energy coming from the sea, the total invested so far, although not detailed, indicate an increasing interest.
Technology to develop.
Experts are talking about a technology still in the beginning, because marine energy is undoubtedly having a big environmental impact.
For now, impacts such as those of the Portuguese or the Scots are small and do not seem to create major problems for the ecosystem.
To produce energy on a large scale, technology with greater environmental impact must be used.
And the options are several: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of good connected between them.
The force of the waves, which moves the wells up and down, becomes hydraulic pressure with pistons and cylinders inside them.
The pressure causes a turbine to rotate, which in turn feeds a generator.
Electricity is sent to the coast via submarine cables.
For now, four implants of this type are under development, waiting only for federal approval, apart from energy, could serve for a military installation.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, already produces energy for a shopping mall and for a parking lot, using underwater turbines on the East River in New York.
The movement of water when there are tides, turns the pallets of the turbines, creating a rotating motion that feeds the generator.
Verdant has said it has a long list of customers waiting for the necessary authorizations to use energy.
After the waves, the tides.
A particular interest, they say at the Institute for the Development of Electricity, deserves at this time the potential of the tides.
While this is an intermittent phenomenon, tides are more preventable than wind, sun or waves and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
It is mainly about the energy of the tides that states such as New York, Maine and Alaska, along with others that are approaching the coast, have invested $7.5 million in 2008 and an investment of $35 million is planned for 2009.
