The President of Russia Vladimir Putin signed the law on the introduction of administrative responsibility for the violation of the time and order of payment of goods (works, services) when making purchases for state and municipal needs.
This law is intended to solve a very acute problem of non-fulfillment of its obligations by customers in the execution of state and municipal procurement.
Two years ago, the situation, when entrepreneurs could not receive payment for already executed state and municipal contracts, was ubiquitous.
At the same time, the President of Russia gave orders to the Prosecutor General’s Office of the Russian Federation to take the problem under special control.
Because the businessmen themselves could not cope with unfair customers, who concluded contracts that were not supported by financing, tried to avoid the commitments made on payment and included in the contracts illegal conditions.
The problem was systemic in the country as a whole.
Since 2015, in the interest of protecting the rights of entrepreneurs to receive payment for public orders by the prosecutor’s office, 9.7 thousand submissions have been made, as a result of their consideration of disciplinary responsibility, 4,5 thousand employees have been brought to the office of public officials, to the administrative office, to the office of representatives - 533, in the investigative bodies for the organization.
As a result, debts to entrepreneurs amounting to more than 66 billion rubles were paid off.
And these huge sums were accumulated far from the non-payment of multi-billion-dollar contracts.
Fascinating debts have led to numerous, systematic delays in the payment of services to entrepreneurs for much more modest amounts.
Here's a typical case.
The manager of a small company won the competition for the provision of services on social transport for several million rubles.
The person invested all his working capital, fully fulfilled his obligations, but did not receive the deposited money in time.
The result is a growing financial coma of debts on salaries, taxes, loans that would lead to bankruptcy if the entrepreneur did not seek help from the prosecutor.
At present, the problem has been minimized as much as possible in a number of regions.
However, as of the first half of 2017, the total amount of debt under state and municipal contracts, identified by prosecutors of entities of the Russian Federation, amounted to about 27.4 billion rubles.
In regions where indebtedness rates continue to reach critical levels, the prosecutor’s office operates in a manual anti-crisis management mode.
The Prosecutor-General personally conducts outbound meetings with representatives of the local authority, which deal with all the violations identified by the prosecutors and measures for their immediate elimination.
Such operational meetings have already been held this year in Yaroslavl and Yekaterinburg.
Qualitatively to improve the payment discipline of the subordinates of public customers will be able to implement the Federal Law No. 189-FZ "On Amendments to the Code of the Russian Federation on Administrative Offences in Part of the Establishment of Administrative Liability of the Officials of the Client".
The draft law was developed by the Ministry of Economic Development of Russia at the initiative of the Prosecutor General’s Office.
The new law will supplement the Code of the Russian Federation on administrative offences with an article, which provides for a fine of 30 thousand to 50,000 rubles for violation by the official of the customer of the time and order of payment of goods, works and services in state and municipal procurement.
And if the official has already been subject to an administrative penalty for a similar offence, then he will be disqualified for a period of one year to two years.
All prosecutors of the subjects of the Russian Federation have already received an order to ensure the application of these legislative novelles in practice.
Civil Rights Protection Group Announces Warning on Movements in Missouri
The National Association for Promoting the Progress of the Colored Population has issued a warning to the colored people traveling to Missouri because of the state’s discriminatory policies and attacks on racist soil.
The group's statement reads as follows: "A warning to the traveling national association to promote the progress of the colored population, valid until August 28, 2017, urges African-American travelers, guests and citizens of the state of Missouri to take special care and show a high degree of respect.
According to the National Association for Promoting the Progress of the Colored Population, the announcement of a warning on the movement prompted the group to a law recently passed in Missouri, which made it harder for people to win claims related to discrimination by their men and women, as well as the fact that the law enforcement agencies are not a thing.
“You people are being violated by human rights.
They are stopped on the roads because of the color of the skin, they are beaten and killed,” Rod Chapel, president of the National Association for Promoting the Progress of the Colored People of Missouri, told Kansas City Star.
“We hear complaints as often as we’ve never heard before.”
This is the first warning of its kind issued by the organization against the U.S. state.
The group referred to incidents such as the humiliation of black students by race at the University of Missouri and the death of twenty-eight-year-old Tory Sanders, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in suspicious circumstances earlier this year after he ran out of gasoline during a state trip, and the Missouri State Police arrested him without filing charges for the crime.
The warning also mentions a recent report by the Missouri State Attorney General’s Office, which said that black drivers are 75 percent more likely to be stopped on the road than whites.
“The goal of the warning is for people to be aware of the situation and to warn their relatives and friends and colleagues about what might happen in Missouri,” Chapel said.
“People need to be prepared in one way or another, whether they will take money for bail or tell relatives that they are traveling through the state.”
According to the latest data from the FBI’s hate crime reporting program, there were 100 hate crimes registered in Missouri in 2015, making the state the sixteenth state in the number of such crimes.
The move warning is also a response to the new law of the state of Missouri, after which it will be more difficult to bring a lawsuit against a legal entity in connection with housing or work discrimination.
Earlier, the American Civil Liberties Protection Union (ACLU) issued warnings for travelers to Texas and Arizona after those states adopted new immigration control laws, according to which the law enforcement agencies were required to comply with AC law enforcement, arrest people for violation of immigration laws.
Traffic warnings are usually issued by the State Department with respect to other countries, but in recent times, public organizations have resorted to this in response to certain laws and trends within the United States.
Two People Killed in Shooting at Police Patrol in Egypt
The unidentified gunned down a police patrol in the Egyptian city of Isna, Reuters reports, citing the Egyptian Interior Ministry.
Two people, including one police officer, were killed in the shooting and three people were injured.
All the wounded were taken to the hospital.
According to the agency, the police stopped the car, after which two armed men in the car opened fire on law enforcement officers.
One of the attackers was arrested, the other managed to escape.
Rosturism supports the law on the cancellation of free baggage for non-return airline tickets
Head of Tourism Oleg Safonov said in an interview with the RBC television channel that "positive" refers to the adoption of the law on the cancellation of free baggage transport on non-return tickets.
“It is necessary to create conditions under which a person who does not have luggage can buy a ticket cheaper than one who has luggage,” he stressed (quoted by TASS).
At the same time, Mr. Safonov noted that, despite the concerns of citizens, you will not have to pay for the transport of top clothing and mobile phone in the manual storage.
"It would be right to reassure all of our citizens and tourists and declare it, to say that it will not have a relationship with top clothing, umbrellas, mobile phones, iPads or even some computer," - said the head of Rosturism.
Earlier, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law that provides for the right of airlines to exclude the rule on the free carriage of luggage in case of non-refundable airfare.
This means that airlines can determine the number of seats and the weight of luggage included in the non-refundable fare.
Vladimir Putin ordered to eliminate the pollution of Baikal <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Russian President Vladimir Putin at a meeting on the protection of Baikal said that in recent years, large areas of the lake have been subjected to extreme pollution.
He has mandated to identify sources of funding, plans and contractors for the elimination of pollution.
Mr. Putin also instructed to carry out a full reclamation of contaminated territories.
“It is also necessary to deal with the facilities that continue to work here, the clean-up structures of most of them are worn out,” RIA Novosti quoted the president as saying.
He also added that the Prosecutor General’s Office of Russia should carry out a check on the detection of environmentally harmful activities.
According to him, in the area of the lake there are problems related to the appearance of natural debris and a number of violations in the field of ecology by the organizers of recreation.
"I want to emphasize this: not all in a row to check, here too, the measure needs to be known, but precisely - illegal and environmentally harmful activities and take appropriate measures," he stressed.
Earlier, the Prosecutor General’s Office reported a reduction in fish stocks in Lake Baikal and proposed an increase in the number of sites under environmental supervision.
Recall, on June 15, Vladimir Putin in the course of a straight line declared the need to change the legislation to ensure the rights of citizens living in the natural territories of a special regime of protection.
The inhabitants of Olhon Island, which is part of the Baikal Natural Territory, informed him about problems with the conduct of economic activities.
The head of the Ministry of Nature Sergei Donskaya immediately proposed to solve the problem by clarifying the boundaries of the Baikal water protection zone, but in the Government of Buryatia recalled that such a change is not enough, since the restrictions are related to a number of regulatory acts.
Previously, the Ministry of Economy proposed to solve the problem by amending the Land Code and the Environmental Protection Act.
A new temple will be built in Yugoslav
In the village of Sosiva, members of the community of the representatives of the indigenous few peoples of the North "Rakhtinya", together with the inhabitants of the Berezovsky district participate in the construction of the Orthodox temple in honor of Saint Nicholas the Wonderworker.
Its location is the river bank, the temple will be well seen from afar, so it will serve as a beacon for fishermen.
According to the representatives of the community, construction work will be completed this year, domes are now installed, church bells are available.
The Igrym REB fleet provided transport accompaniment.
The temple is named in honor of St. Nicholas the Wonderworker, as it is revered by the Orthodox Church as a patron of travelers, including fishermen.
In the Soyuz world, fishing gives the settlers work, feeds them.
Locals are waiting for the temple to open its doors, and children even write about it in school texts as a local attraction.
Disneyland with the death penalty.
Why are the laws being enforced in Singapore?
I'm talking to a local businessman, Chang, sitting in an open-air snack bar.
Commenting on the situation in Singapore, Chang smokes one cigarette after another, and carefully stores the octopus in an iron box he has seized from his office.
After the end of the conversation, the businessman goes to the nearest urn - up to it a hundred meters - and throws the bulls there.
The fine for garbage in a public place is $500 local, - reports Chang.
You know, I just had a reflex from childhood: you can't throw a fancier from candy to the bridge, immediately fined.
And now, video cameras are everywhere.
And indeed, Singapore’s sidewalks in the city center are clean, like a museum.
Three months ago, his neighbor’s 18-year-old son painted graffiti on the wall of an old colonial building.
The court found the guy guilty of vandalism and sentenced him to jail.
What?!
Imagine it.
He got ten punches with a wooden stick on his buttocks and spent a week in prison.
Physical punishment is not uncommon at all.
As Singapore combines the highest standard of living and incredibly harsh laws, was understood on the spot the observer "AiF".
“No one here is thinking of abolishing the death penalty,” lawyer Victor Lee Hong said.
And the government has long cared about the opinion of both the European Union and the United States on this issue.
If a person carries a large batch of drugs or trades in them, he is hanged.
In 2002, a 22-year-old Australian citizen was arrested at Changi Airport, carrying 400 g of cocaine.
He was defended by the Australian prime minister, threatening sanctions, international human rights defenders and even the pope of Rome.
In the end, the man was hanged.
After that, the drug couriers are trying to circumvent our country.
In Singapore, it is stated that the laws must be followed by ALL in succession, not just the humble and the poor.
It doesn’t matter who you are – a millionaire, a vice-premier, a famous artist or a resident of the European Union.
The only option in this case is if you find a shelf of cocaine, you'll be hanged.
When you walk around Singapore and everywhere you encounter placards with a bunch of warnings, you simply wonder - how many bans in this city-state!
For example, chewing gum is sold only in pharmacies, and you can buy it strictly on the prescription (!) of a doctor.
Tourists on arrival will not take the chewing gum, but it is worth sticking the "rubber" in the metro, will impose a fine of 1,000 local dollars.
Within four days, I met two people with white plaques on their neck: "I was garbage."
In addition to the fine, cigarettes are often referred to as a “link to the courtyards”: a week to clean parks and beaches.
6 thousand rubles. pays "criminal" who forgot to wash water for himself in the public toilet, and in an attempt to cope with a small need in the elevator of a residential house works a special detector - the doors are locked and a signal is sent to the police.
Among the most exotic laws - the prohibition of feeding pigeons on the street, the public performance of songs and even the excessive watering of the room plant (!): it is believed that the abundance of water attracts mosquitoes.
In order to avoid fires, smokers can not carry lighters in the metro, otherwise they are fined 5 thousand Singapore bucks.
In general, the idea arises: no matter how hard you try, you will necessarily break something.
This is not the case at all, - is trying to convince me Muhammad Kabir-Kadzhariya, the owner of the local travel agency.
Particularly fantastic laws exist only on paper, and in the last twenty years I have not seen anyone attract for their violation.
Why are they preserved?
So that the citizens do not relax.
Compliance with the basic rules is closely monitored.
Let’s say, if a minor is sold cigarettes in the kiosk, everything on the chain will be punished: the owner of the store will pay a huge amount, the offender himself will be beaten with sticks on the “back”, and the seller will also be kicked out and put in jail.
It is because of such strict laws that crime in Singapore is very rare.
Is that justified?
Back in the 1970s, there was chaos on the roads - drivers ignored the lights, drove as they wanted, sat drunk behind the wheel.
After the imposition of the fines for a year, everything calmed down.
Now, after drinking a portion of whiskey, the driver knows: if stopped, the policeman will not let go for a bribe, they will impose a fine in the amount of the cost of the apartment and for years send for a grid.
For many foreigners, the city-state in Southeast Asia seems to be a type of concentration camp.
In 1993, U.S. writer William Gibson called Singapore a "disneyland with the death penalty" - a guest from the U.S. has horrified the general wealth of residents, "terrifyingly clean airport" and "cultural nature".
To say that such things are unnatural, look artificial, and so should not be in principle.
The first few days in Singapore and you're afraid to throw a piece of paper on the sidewalk, you're thrilled if you get in the subway with ice cream.
But then you come to the "Little India" area, and suddenly - "breaking the pattern": at the bus stop are rolling plastic cups.
"How's that?" you're surprised.
That's right, the Singaporeans are smiling.
It's all happening.
Not every such "crime" will be caught on the spot, but you should know: if you are counted, you will not be repulsed - because you have broken the law.
Most often, this is enough for a person to behave normally.
Of course, the power in Singapore is quite authoritarian.
But you know what?
In Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, I was moving very carefully – motorcyclists often take smartphones and cameras out of the hands of tourists.
In the heart of Paris, there are lots of dirty booze and begging.
In our streets, not everyone is trying to throw garbage into the dumps.
Singapore, thanks to a set of draconian fines and ruthless (until the death penalty) laws, became the most peaceful, clean and safe city on Earth.
You'll think.
Such is the human nature: remember, and in Russia no one got stuck behind the wheel until they started to penalize.
Although the main thing in Singapore is not fines, but voluntary compliance with the laws.
And we should think that in Russia, people would also be happy with clean streets, the absence of garbage in the metro and would welcome the arrest of those who confuse elevators with public toilets.
Here's the corporal punishment - thank you, don't do it.
In the rest of Singapore’s laws, at least, it’s worth taking care of them.
Nothing holy?
The Trump White House is now targeting the Statue of Liberty.
The most reliable sign of a regime change is when it begins to fight the statues.
Americans understand this no worse than everyone else - hence the intentional theatrical download of the statue of Saddam Hussein on Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Steven Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump administration, no doubt knew what he was doing when he brought a symbolic hammer over the Statue of Liberty during a fierce dispute with CNN journalist Jim Acosta over the president’s proposals for a sharp reduction in legal migration.
Let's be honest, Miller didn't try the statue himself.
The shelves of owners of cruise ships and artists depicting the Statue of Liberty would lynch him if he tried to do so.
But he tried to make sense of it, and especially the meaning that was attributed to it in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, when the poems of Emma Lazarus were added to the pedestal.
As Miller whistled at Acosta: “I don’t want to go deep into history here, but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that brightens the world.
The poem you’re talking about was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty.”
Miller put the facts right, but as he himself said, it’s not really about history.
This is about the current sound of the striking words of Lazarus, the only ones in which the state invites not any immigrants, but the poorest: "Your tired, your poor, your crowds dreaming of breathing freely, the unfortunate discards of your lavish berets."
Never before have “unfortunate throws” been so visible on our screens.
Miller wasn’t into literature – he made it clear that Trump wasn’t waiting for these people in America.
This dispute over the meaning of the statue is part of a broader political and cultural war: it is indeed a dispute over the meaning of America.
Lazarus and her friends, who struggled to put her words on the base of the statue after her death, understood very well that they were committing a perfectly political act.
The sculpture was intended to mark the link between the French and American republics with the help of a banal classical figure – the female image of Freedom.
Lazarus changed her meaning: in her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract, she has a voice.
And she had a different name: The Mother of the Exiles.
The combination of poetry and image was a brilliant feminist move and a crushing attack on American nativism.
And how Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the right though to change it back.
Rhash Limbo, a kind of John the Baptist who announced the arrival of Trump in 2010, argued that Freedom does not invite anyone, rather it is an early neoconservative who carries the flame of America lying in the dark world: “Freedom is coming.
It carries the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch is not needed to illuminate the way to the United States.”
Against the usual, Limbo really got to the point here.
The meaning of the statue depends solely on the angle of view.
The great creative achievement of Lazarus was to see it as if it were seen by the exhausted, unfortunate, but full of hope people on decks of ships after a long and often heavy sailing.
It literally means looking at the world through the eyes of people who are looking for shelter and a chance for a better life.
Her statue responds to them with words of hope and hospitality that they dream of hearing.
And, of course, that’s not the perspective that Miller and Trump will ever want to acknowledge.
Their torch is needed not to illuminate the path, but to ignite hatred, which is the only source of their power.
The 2017 World Cup: Neil Blake is highly appreciative of the Scottish members of the UK team.
Eilid Doyle remembers a time when there were only two Scots in the UK
Neil Blake, the game director of the United Kingdom Athletics Federation, said a 16-man Scottish World Cup team would make a "significant contribution to the team's game".
A record number of Scottish lightweights were selected for the 2017 London Championships starting on Friday.
Blake believes that in Scotland "something special is born" and the Federation of Athletics of the United Kingdom should take this into account.
“We know this and we’re trying to understand it and we’re going to support it as long as they have the potential,” Blake said.
“I talked to people at the Scottish Sports Institute and they think it has something to do with what they did.
The Scottish Federation of Athletics believes that what they have done must be done.
The British Federation of Athletics: with what they have done, you have to work.
People on the street think the same.
I don’t know why the situation is like that, but it’s brilliant.”
Some of the Scottish lightweights claim medals, including Laura Moore and Andrew Bachert - who will compete with Sir Mo Farah at a distance of 5,000 m; and Eilid Doyle's team has chosen their captain.
"Eyed is humiliating.
Her captain's speech was great," Blake said.
“Many light athletes, whether they’re Scots or not, and where they live or train, have left this room, feeling the pride and the victories.
The passion and the sincere feelings that Eilid put into it were wonderful.”
The silver medalist of the Commonwealth Championship, which at its fifth World Championship will run a distance of 400 m with obstacles, says that 16 Scots in the British team - it is "impossible".
The previous record for the number of Scots at the World Cup was seven, in 1983 and 2005.
Laura Moore, who specializes in middle-distance running, is ahead and broke five British and two European records last year.
She'll run at 1500 and 5000 meters.
Chris O’Hare, who will take part in the 1500 m race, is another Scot who is worth noting: behind his back he has a successful season, in which there were victories in the qualifying competitions of the British national team and in the Annual competitions.
Doyle remembers his first World Cup when, apart from her, the only Scot on the team was Lee McConnell.
The team captain says she is "impossibly proud" that so many of her compatriots have not only joined the team, but in some cases will claim medals and fight for the final.
“The captain of the team is chosen by other members of the team, so it was a huge honor anyway, but to know that your teammates voted for you and chose you is a very special thing for me,” she added.
"Of course, I'm very proud of all the Scots who joined the team.
It shows how much we have achieved.
And they're all runners-up who'll try to get on the pedestal of honor.
What about my captain's speech?
Yeah, I think she was pretty good.
I just noticed that we were very lucky to have the World Cup at home.
So it’s just about how important it is to get support from the fans and take advantage of the fact that we will be back at the Olympic Stadium.
I got another chance to go out to his arena and take part in the competitions, and the atmosphere there will be just great.”
Blocking critics on Facebook: Don’t step up for public office unless you’re ready to listen to criticism from voters
The founder of our country understood what a critical press is.
The Americans loved George Washington, but that didn’t stop them from criticizing him for everything from domestic politics to his political principles.
His criticism, of course, irritated him.
But he did not shut his mouth to his critics.
In 1783, Washington said, “We may be deprived of freedom of speech, and we deaf and dumb will be led like sheep to slaughter.”
Now I will move on to Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, who should try to be more like Washington.
Hogan’s subordinates blocked and deleted posts of at least 450 people who expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.
And this week the American Civil Liberties Union sued him for it.
The subordinate governors called the lawsuit futile, and the comment on the Internet was written in the spirit of "well and what".
“It’s just Facebook,” many will say.
But it's important, too.
And this is especially important when it comes to a guy like Hogan.
He is an astonishingly popular Republican governor in a democratic-preferred state.
He is second in the approval rating among 50 governors of the country.
Hogan is not a stubborn reactionary.
He has demonstrated a firm hand in the administration of the state and a commitment to its principles.
He also cleverly uses Facebook as his primary way of communicating with his constituents and with jokes on his page demonstrates his rash after chemotherapy.
That’s why blocking people who come to the governor’s page – which has been declared an official public forum and is run by administration officials for taxpayers’ money – is unnecessary and ultimately harmful.
In an interview with the Washington Post, press secretary Amelia Chess defended the governor’s actions, claiming that blocking comments was simply their moderation.
But it’s too easy to use the image of trolls, spammers, and hackers bullying the internet.
“The Post” spoke to some of the real people that Hogan blocked.
And it is the real people, not the trolls, - the teacher, the businessman, the pastor, who turn to their chosen leaders.
All of them say that their comments were respectful, contentious, and not rude.
The pastor quoted the Bible, appealing that Hogan was a Catholic.
Lakshmi's lawyer, Sarma Raman of Bowie, Maryland, did not express hatred, but asked about hate crimes.
“I wrote a polite comment that I’m disappointed that he didn’t react to hate crimes and other recent news,” she wrote in a comment section on the post in the Post Office.
“I also don’t like the idea that when a lot of people leave comments on the same topic, some people immediately say it’s a so-called scam, rather than admitting that they’re dealing with a large group of disgruntled citizens.”
What the subordinate governors call a “concentrated spam attack,” others would probably call an “active life position.”
In the age of Facebook, it’s easy to edit your image by simply blocking critics or deleting negative comments.
This is much less dusty work than before, when it required sending people, gathering and burning newspapers with critical advances, or arresting and shutting the mouths of protesters.
But that's exactly what's happening right now, just in numbers.
Hogen is not the first official to be criticized for not wanting to listen to Facebook and other social networks.
President Trump has been sued by Twitter users who have been banned from his Twitter account.
One of the first reversal decisions on this topic was made this week in Virginia.
According to U.S. District Judge James K. Casheris, the chairman of the County Supervisory Board of Laudon violated the First Amendment by banning the voter in his Facebook account.
And in Kentucky, Republican Governor Matt Bevin filed claims by the American Union for the Protection of Civil Liberties for his behavior on Facebook and Twitter.
It must not be that hard.
In the days of Washington, the era of available postal costs was about the same turnaround as today’s Internet.
From 1776 to 1800, the number of newspapers increased fourfold, and the authors of anonymous letters greatly undermined his authority.
And even then, Washington was dealing with anonymous trolls.
People under the pseudonyms "Yuricola", "Valerius", "Belizerius" and "Porcius" wrote letters to newspapers mocking Washington's decision.
According to historical documents collected by the online project “George Washington Documents”, his office has been flooded with petitions criticizing his position on the Treaty on Friendship, Trade and Shipping.
But he didn’t try to silence them.
Freedom of speech, dissent and speech lies at the very foundation of our state.
And true leadership means agreeing with that.
Ronan Rafferty Hopes for Household Comfort at Renaissance Club
Former European champion Ronan Rafferty hopes for household amenities for the next three days, when the Renaissance club in East Lotto will host the twenty-fifth open Scottish golf tournament for senior athletes.
A native of Northern Ireland, who led the neighborhood at Archerfield Links, and moved towards the final round last year until he lost Paul Ilsa, attached to the new place and plays the role of a tournament representative on behalf of the founder and director of J.Ballu.
“I saw how the Renaissance club was built, and we’re watching him come to success with this event,” Rafferty said.
“The players will see this field at its best, it is in great condition.
Jerry did a great job of accommodating this place.
He is an ardent supporter of this game and is proud of his achievements here.
It’s a great demonstration for this field.”
Englishman Ilse looks forward to the opportunity to defend the championship title for the first time, despite having won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
“It’s really a special feeling,” said the Southport player.
“I couldn’t try to win the Extremadura Open again because it was removed from the schedule a year after I won it.
Going back to this corner of the world is magical.
This is a great place to play golf.
The memories of last year are coming back, and for me and my wife Sharon it was a very special impression to win last year.
It was a very special time and we will always remember it.”
He returns to fight in his native land, Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior Athletes' Tournament after turning 50 earlier this year.
The event will be his first public appearance in Scotland since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
“When you play at home, it’s always a little more important,” said resident Helensboro Orr.
“You want to perform well, but you feel that extra burden.”
I played with great pleasure again, and I showed a good golf.
I’m happy with how things are going so far.”
The trio will be joined by former Masters Tournament winner Ian Wussem and champions of majors for senior athletes Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
The Eagle and former Rider Cup captain Sam Torrance are two of the six Scots on the field; the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen Macalister, Bill Longmeier and Ross Drummond.
Participation in the tournament is free, and parking costs <0xC2><0xA3>5 per hour if one person is in the car, and <0xC2><0xA3>10 if a person is two or more.
All proceeds go to the British Prostate Cancer Foundation.
British Roads Will Learn to Absorb Harmful Emissions
Unique tunnels over highways, capable of absorbing the carbon dioxide emitted by cars, are already being tested on the roads of the UK.
The transport agency of the country, as reported by the publication Autocar, reported positive results of tests of the 100-meter tunnel, installed on one of the highways in the north of the country.
The 6-metre-high tunnel is built from some of the latest polymer materials that are capable of absorbing harmful substances contained in automobile exhausts.
However, the creation of a whole network of such tunnels is only part of the large-scale measures that the UK authorities are going to take to improve the atmosphere.
In addition to a network of tunnels, the British are going to expand the network of charging stations for electric vehicles, implement a number of actions to reduce the traffic flow on the roads, expand the use of commercial transport on electric traction and modernize the fleet of heavy trucks.
According to official statistics, a quarter of all air pollution is transported, and poor air quality is the cause of up to 40,000 premature deaths per year.
Mosgorsud changed the punishment of the disabled Mamayev to a fine
Mosgorsud changed the sentence of disabled Anton Mamayev, sentenced to four and a half years of colony, to a fine of 200,000 rubles.
This is reported by TASS.
Earlier, the prosecutor’s office asked the court to replace the term with a probationary one, explaining its request that Mamayev’s disease “prevents his being in prison conditions.”
The 28-year-old Anton Mamaev was sentenced to four and a half years in prison with a sentence in the colony of the general regime for the robbery, the victim of which was a former special forces fighter.
On July 19, a court at the exit hearing in the SISO released the man from custody.
Poverty and death in Indonesia’s ‘golden land’
While preparing lunch, Bardina Degey does not use the stove.
She even uses the pot very rarely.
In her wooden house in Enarotal, the capital of Paniai County in the rebellious Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually simply places a sweet potato, which here is called a “note,” right in the focal point.
After half an hour, the charred cabbage arrives and eats with impatient, unwashen hands.
Degey sits on the ground floor – she has no furniture – and it is here that she does her homework, such as washing clothes with dirty water from a nearby swamp.
The laundry room serves a bucket in a room without a roof.
She is the youngest of her husband's four wives, so she was not assigned to work in the field.
Polygons are common here.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: many men from this village are unemployed, many drink, and there are still soldiers.
“No one decides to walk around the village after five o’clock,” she says.
This is a rare opportunity to look at everyday life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was annexed to Indonesia in 1969 after a dubious referendum, when only 1,026 elders were forced to vote, publicly raising their hands in front of the occupiers.
The existing movement, which advocates independence from the Netherlands, quickly turned its anger against the Jakarta government, which maintains strict control of the region, not allowing foreign journalists and human rights defenders.
In 2003, the province was formally divided into Papua and West Papua, and the independent state of Papua New Guinea occupies the eastern part of the island.
The city is as remote as it is abandoned; the road here includes a half-hour flight from Jayapur, the administrative center of the province, to Nabir, and then a five-hour quake on a rental car.
There is no public transport here.
The city with a population of about 19,000 people consists of wooden houses lined with bamboo fences; corrugated steel roofs are painted with rust in a variety of reddish shades.
Few of the Indonesians arrived here, not to mention the journalists, and almost none of the foreigners.
Before the arrival of the Christian missionaries, the Mee Pago Papuans worshipped a god named Uga Tamee.
There were other changes as well.
“It was unusual for us to wear this garment,” Degey says, pointing to his bright, woven hand turban, a dark skirt and a bright shirt.
“We used to wear only leaves on our bodies.”
Papua is Indonesia’s poorest province, with 28% of its population living on the poverty line, and child mortality and literacy levels among the worst in Asia.
But it is also Indonesian gold land.
The world’s largest and most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, owned by Phoenix-based Freeport McMoran, is only sixty miles from Paniai, a high-altitude province about the size of New Jersey, where 153 people live.
In 2015 alone, Freeport obtained gold and copper for about $3.1 billion here.
In addition, Papua can boast forest reserves, the value of which is estimated at $78 billion.
These riches, however, will entail one misfortune for the Papuans, ensuring that Indonesia’s powerful armed forces maintain their suffocating presence here.
According to an investigation by the New York Times in 2005, between 1998 and 2004, Freeport paid local military personnel and units nearly $20 million, including up to $150,000 to a single officer.
Demands for greater autonomy from the Papuans threaten the existence of this golden abode and are relentlessly suppressed.
According to human rights defenders, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed by Indonesian military forces since 1969, and thousands more have been raped, tortured and deprived of their liberty.
According to the Asian Commission on Human Rights, the mass killings of indigenous people in the Papuan highlands in the 1970s could be considered genocide.
Last year alone, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters in the region.
“We will lose everything,” the report, published in 2016 by the Diocese of Brisbane, contains evidence of atrocities committed in the previous year, such as executions without trial, torture – especially frequent and pernicious – as stated in another report.
“It’s hard to calculate the number of victims because the incidents happen every week,” said Andreas Harsono, a researcher in Indonesia, for Human Rights Watch.
Nuts were delayed as Papua resources attracted an influx of immigrants from other parts of Indonesia.
The province’s 3.5 million population is 83% Christian, but demographics are changing as Muslim economic migrants arrive from the densely populated Indonesian islands of Java, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese prawns, "warongs", sell fried chicken and a mixture of "gado-gado" vegetables, served with peanut sauce.
The locals are trying to withstand the competition.
“Migrants have started selling chicken and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the indigenous people of Papua,” explains Abeth You, a twenty-four-year-old native of Paniai who moved to Jayapur, the administrative center of the province, because of work.
“Because of this, the indigenous people of Papua – the mother-mama (women) of Papua – have lost their sales market.”
Indonesian President Joko Vidodo, popularly known as the Jokovi, vowed to deal with inequality and violations of rights in Papua during his 2014 presidential campaign.
On his way to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta, the former butcher has garnered support from 27 of the 29 districts of Papua, including Paniai.
But almost nothing has changed in Papua, and the locals feel loyal.
“Our hearts are broken because in 2014 we voted for the Jocks, expecting him to fulfill our hopes of restoring justice,” Yoo said.
In fact, just two months after the October inauguration, Jokovi Paniai survived the tragedy.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children were out in the street singing Christmas hymns at a caravan in Enarotal when two Indonesian soldiers broke out of the darkness on a motorcycle.
The frightened children told them that they should turn on the headlights.
According to the local priest Javedt Tebai, one of the soldiers fought their tone and after a while returned with four soldiers.
According to the victims and witnesses, the soldiers who were drunk were chasing the children and beating them with rifles.
Then one of the soldiers shot a group of children.
One child, sixteen-year-old Julianus Eimo, was so badly beaten that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, someone set fire to a government building near the election commission, and the situation worsened the next day.
About a thousand Papuan men, women and children gathered on the football field in front of the local police station and military command center to demand justice.
They brought with them the ritual hunting bows and performed the vita, the dance of the Papuan tribe mee pago: they ran around and depicted bird singing.
Some protesters began throwing stones at the police station and the military base.
When the situation escalated, internal radio soldiers were ordered: “If the crowd resists more than three times, shoot them,” – that was what he sounded as claimed in the official document, which was seen by the correspondents of the magazine “TIME”.
The fifty-six-year-old Jeremiah Kayame, the head of the Kego Koto district in Enarotali, felt the danger approaching and called for calm, addressing the crowd with a request to walk around the houses.
No one wanted to listen to him.
“When I turned around, I suddenly got a bullet in my left wrist,” he told TIME magazine, standing on the wing of his brightly colored wooden house.
Kayame still doesn’t know who fired, but says the bullet came from the sheriffs of the assembled soldiers.
“There was a crowd, there were a lot of shots,” he added.
A local resident, Alfius Yuva, was found three times, according to his cousin, who witnessed the shooting.
“I ran to him and examined his body to make sure it was him,” Johannes told TIME magazine, which, like many Indonesians, uses only one name.
“I saw that he was dead...I kissed him.”
General Yotja Mende, the senior inspector of the Papua police, told reporters that his officers were only "protecting" their base because it was under attack.
“We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us,” said Papua Police Commissioner Pujo Sulistio in 2015.
“It’s a matter of life and death.”
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed, and many more were injured.
The news of the murders reached Jakarta only the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokovi delivered a heartfelt speech in Jayapur, expressing his condolences to the families of the victims and vowing to deal with the historical abuses of power in Papua.
“I want this situation to be resolved immediately, so that it will never happen again in the future,” he said.
In October 2016, Security Minister Viranto said he would set up a non-judgmental organization to end historic human rights violations.
But almost immediately there were excuses.
“Most of the violations happened a long time ago.
Some of them took place in the nineties or early zeros.
The fact is that we certainly want to deal with these violations, but there are procedures that need to be done,” he said.
Viranto then declined to speak, speaking to TIME magazine on June 5 in Jakarta, and said he did not plan to set up an organization to deal with complaints in Papua.
Instead, he said, “Everything will be decided through court.”
Viranto, who was accused by the United Nations of “crimes against humanity” in connection with the deaths of more than 1,000 people during a bloody vote for East Timor’s independence in 1999, said 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua had already been resolved, including Pali.
The families of the victims from Paniai encountered such statements with dark distrust.
“In the last three years I have been questioned four times, but there has been absolutely no change,” says Johannes.
"I'm tired."
He says that years later, he's still living in fear.
“I’m scared,” he says.
“I’m afraid the military will arrest me, I’m afraid I’ll be shot.”
His brother Jacobus also expressed the opinion that the people of Paniai were afraid to discuss the incident.
He said he was beaten by the military after he helped bury four victims.
“After we buried the bodies, the military came after me,” he said.
The shooting didn't stop.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police fired at villagers in the neighbouring Paniai district of Deiai.
In a clash between villagers and the manager of the construction company, who refused to help bring the unconscious man to the hospital, one person died and 17 others were injured, including children.
A man, twenty-four-year-old Ravianus Dawes, who drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on the way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested in front of the office of the construction site owned by the company.
According to police, the villagers threw stones at the officers, who in response produced warning shots.
But locals claim that the mobile brigade (Indonesian special forces) started shooting at the crowd and killed one person.
“We were in such a panic, we are afraid of retaliation,” Domingo Badia, a twenty-nine-year-old man living near the hospital, told TIME magazine.
“I’ve been hiding at home for two days.”
The Deiyai Parliament demanded that the officers involved in the incident be called to account, and the mobile police brigade was withdrawn from the region.
Paniai has always been a sick place for the Indonesian government.
The lack of significant development is caused by the dissatisfaction of the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes scattered throughout the green-covered central highlands of Papua.
Many have joined the Free Papua Movement (OPM), a rebel army that claims to protect the rights of the Papuans by arranging sporadic attacks and raids with the kidnapping of Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top leaders of OPM come from Paniai, including Tadius Yoga and Daniel Judas Kogoya.
In response, in recent years, thousands of people have been arrested and unjustifiably detained by the military under the pretext of “protecting national independence”.
Some of them never came back.
Among the population of Papua Paniai is considered “a sad, forgotten place”.
Poverty increases dissatisfaction.
A small portion of rice sold in Enarotal is too expensive for the locals.
Bread is not available to the same extent.
People here grow everything they eat: mostly a note, as well as some fruits and leafy vegetables.
Agriculture is the work of women, each of whom can take care of four or five fields of sweet potatoes.
Usually they keep most of the harvest for the family, and the rest is sold in the local market.
The ten club notes cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities between indigenous Papuas and new migrants have increased, who have arrived in large numbers since the introduction of new flights to the airport.
Few existing vacancies are usually given to more educated and wealthy migrants.
Papuas rarely have enough money or skills to run their own competitive business.
“Young people don’t want to stay in the village ... because there’s no work or money here,” said John Gobai, chairman of the Paniai tribal council.
Isolation keeps Papua away from the views of the rest of the world.
In addition, restrictions on the work of international media remain severe.
Earlier this year, French journalists Frank Escudi and Basil Lonshan were deported from Papua for “inadequate coherence with the relevant organizations” despite the fact that they were given rare permits to conduct video footage.
According to Felim China, deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch, promises made during the Jokovi campaign to lift restrictions on media work in order to promote transparency and development have not been fulfilled.
“Now, foreign journalists trying to report from the rebel eastern Indonesian provinces of Papua and West Papua are facing new dangers: refusals of visas and blacklisting,” he said in a statement.
The lack of attention from the press means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely limited by the immediate neighbours of Papua.
In March, six Pacific states — Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands — appealed to the UN Human Rights Council to investigate “diversity and widespread violations” in Papua, including:
The same countries in the past supported OPM.
The representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Indonesia, Arramanat Nasir, rejected the group’s statement, telling reporters in Jakarta that “In Indonesia, there is still a democratic system and there is a free press, so there is a human need to hide the evidence of the incidents.
Locals want more foreign governments to pay attention to the situation.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by Dutch Ambassador for Human Rights Kiis Van Baar, visited Jayapur on May 4, locals broke the silence, pleading: “We want freedom”, as a source who was also present at the meeting stated.
Indonesia will hold new presidential elections in 2019, but the Papuans say they are unlikely to vote for the Jokovi again.
“Jokovi is a man with good intentions, but he is surrounded by people involved in the shooting in Paniai,” said Gobai, chairman of the tribal council.
He wants the Jokovi to know that the Paniai residents, besides living in the shadow of the threat from the greedy army, are in poverty, and their education and health care are in a miserable state.
Gobai says that the people of Paniai, like other papuas, consider their vote paid for the Jokovi, a debt that he has to pay.
“They don’t need money, they just want justice,” he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, the families of the victims of the Paniai shooting carried out the last symbolic act of disobedience: they buried the body of one of the victims on a plot of land directly opposite the police and military premises.
Knowing that justice is likely never to prevail, they will at least not allow the guilty to forget about their crimes. . . .
“They killed a member of our family,” Jacobus says, without raising his head.
“What else did we have to do?”
The fire for the second time covers Dubai skyscraper "Fakel"
The fire covered one of the world's tallest residential skyscrapers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of residents to urgently leave the seventy-nine-story structure at 337 meters high.
This is the second fire that has taken place on the high-rise building – which is coincidentally called “Fake” – in two years.
There was an evacuation in the building, no reports of human casualties were reported, and there was no operational news of the cause of the fire.
“We slept and woke up from the fire alarm and people’s screams.
We ran down the stairs, and it took us about ten minutes to get down from the 50th floor," a resident of the skyscraper named George told Reuters.
According to the Dubai Civil Defense Department, fire crews extinguished the fire at about 4:00 local time (00:00 Greenwich) and cooled the building.
The Government reported that it was working to provide asylum to the victims.
The incident could bring back the security issues of materials used in the exteriors of high-rise buildings around the world.
In the course of an investigation by the Fakel administration after the fire there in 2015, it was found that the most affected was the plating – external panels used for the decoration and insulation.
In the United Kingdom, police said they believe the insulation system and plating panels of the Grenfell Tower building in London could accelerate the spread of the fire there in June, which killed about 80 people.
The growth of the tourist flow in Ida-Virumaa in June was minimal
According to the data obtained by the correspondent of the portal rus.err.ee in the Department of Statistics, in June 2017 the services of hotel enterprises of the North-East used a total of 20,519 local and foreign tourists, which is 125 people or 0.6% more in the period.
At the same time, the number of local tourists has decreased, and the number of foreign tourists has increased.
Thus, foreign tourist traffic increased in June by 7.3% (544 people) to 7994 tourists.
And the number of local tourists decreased by 3.2% from 12,944 to 12,525 people.
The most noticeable increase in the number of Russian tourists in the region - by 8.9% or by 318 people compared to June 2016.
In June 2017, 3,885 guests from the Russian Federation stayed in Ida-Virumaa hotels.
Andrei Malakhov gave the fans an understanding of who was to blame for his departure
Andrey Malakhov hinted to his fans on Instagram who was responsible for his departure from the First Channel.
To date, he has not commented on the rumors, but today he posted a fragment of the article of the newspaper "Vedomosti" for August 1.
Photo Malakhov signed with the tag "boss milk sauce".
Article on how to prevent the "burning" of an employee and pay attention to his condition.
If you recall the numerous reports that the leader was unable to find a common language with the newly arrived producer, who began to reformat “Let them speak”, it becomes clear what he so transparently hinted at, writes “KP”.
It was reported that TV host Andrei Malakhov is currently on vacation and did not sign an application for dismissal from the First Channel.
The situation with the dismissal may become clear in the coming days.
In Afghanistan, five soldiers were killed in a car explosion.
At least five soldiers were killed in an explosion in the Afghan province of Gilmend, reports RIA Novosti.
According to police, a mined car exploded near the military blockade in the exit of Girishk the night before.
There are 20 known dead.
On Friday morning, a new CP occurred in Girishka.
The armed criminals attacked the currency exchange point.
Shooting between the attackers and the security forces continues.
Dave filmed a video of his camera biting a shark
Diver and researcher Greg Skomal captured a shark in a video that bit his GoPro action camera.
The video was posted on Facebook by a division of the U.S. Marine Fisheries Agency in the state of Massachusetts, whose employee is Skomal.
The incident took place on August 2 off the coast of the Cape Cod peninsula in the northeastern United States, the Necn portal specifies.
A man while swimming underwater tried to remove a shark on a camera, which he held on a special stick.
Seeing a man, an animal of more than three meters in length floated toward him.
The shark began to bite the camera, while not trying to attack the scientist.
Skomal explained that the predator acted in a similar manner to determine whether the gadget was edible.
The researcher added that the shark could easily destroy the device.
He also noted that such behavior of a marine animal was novel for scientists.
The cause of the mass battle in the Ural military center became known
A working group of senior officers of the Central Military District arrived at the Elan Training Center, where a mass battle took place, to investigate the circumstances of the incident.
Some of the details of this fight have already been known.
According to the Mash audience, which appeared on the page "VKontakte", the contractors of the Ural military unit number 31612 fought fiercely because of an unoccupied bed.
It all started with the fact that a commoner named Saiyan demonstrably ignored the officer’s order to fill up the ragged sheet.
On the side of the officer were soldiers from the sixth squadron.
Sayana supported the first round.
Within half an hour, 140 young boys were beaten up in the barracks beds and sinks, knocked out the glass.
More than 10 people were injured in the mass battle.
The CSO denied the information about the sniper.
The study found that at least one in five passengers in the U.S. carry prohibited items on the plane.
The study found that more than 20 percent of the air passengers deliberately or accidentally carried in their luggage on board the aircraft through the U.S. Transportation Safety Administration checkpoints prohibited items, including at least 6 percent of the other passengers seated on the plane, under the supervision or with a reservation.
Nearly 1 per cent reported that they later discovered that they accidentally carried firearms, ammunition or explosives.
A study by Stratos Jet Charters, Inc., which involved more than 1,000 people, also found that young passengers were more likely to violate the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted that they deliberately tried to fly with something that was banned from ATB, 19.7 percent were millennials compared to less than 15 percent of Generation X members.
By consciously passing employees of ATB most often carry food and water.
More than 3 per cent admitted that they had specifically carried through the inspection of acute objects, and 2.2 per cent of female respondents and 3.7 per cent of male respondents admitted that they had deliberately carried banned drugs into the plane.
The company said it had studied passengers across the country to find out how many of them accidentally carried out smuggling through inspections at airports, and how many did it consciously.
It is expected that most often – consciously or unconsciously – smuggles smuggling through the scrutiny of those who fly the most.
According to the company, the rules of ATB are quite complex and confusing.
People often don’t know exactly what fluids they can carry and how much.
So it’s not surprising that most of what ATB picks up is prohibited fluids.
Some time ago people thought that ATB could be considered forbidden to carry a book.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
EPA Chief Pruitt Refuses to Defer Implement Obama’s Emissions Reduction Rules
The day after the 15-state lawsuit, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency canceled his decision to postpone the implementation of the rules adopted by Obama aimed at reducing emissions of air pollutants and smog-producing substances.
Pruitt explained his decision by the fact that his agency is now more than in previous administrations, listening to the needs of environmental regulators of individual states.
He did not mention the lawsuit against his previous position filed in the Federal Court of Appeals.
The dispute raged around the deadline of October 1, by which the states should ensure compliance with the 2015 ozone-level standards.
In June, Pruitt announced that he would postpone their compliance for one year to give his department more time to study the plan and to avoid “inconsistency with local decisions or obstacles to economic growth.”
Pruitt, who before being appointed by President Trump to his current position as Attorney General of the State of Oklahoma, has long been known as a consistent opponent of tightening environmental norms.
After moving to Washington, Pruitt repeatedly blocked or postponed the introduction of norms opposed by the chemical or gas-oil industry.
The unexpected change of course on Wednesday is yet another legal defeat of the Peuitt course taken in return for the previous norms.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the head of the EPA had exceeded his powers in an attempt to delay the implementation of the Obama administration’s rule requiring oil and gas companies to track and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement released Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that, by sharply changing the course on ozone standards, he simply fulfilled the EPA’s obligation to cooperate with states in a comprehensive process of timely implementation of the new standards.
“With previous administrations, the EPA often couldn’t settle the deadlines, after which it waited for lawsuits from activist groups and others and discussed the deadlines during the settlement of the case,” said Pruitt, who filed more than a dozen lawsuits against the EPA in his previous post.
“We don’t believe in legal regulation, and we take the deadlines seriously.
We are also serious about our charter and the power it gives us.”
However, the EPA said in a statement that Pruitt may at some point re-use its “deferral powers and other data under the authority law” to make sure that the “jcyjdfys” standards are on a clear course and on all available information.
Republicans in Congress are insisting on a broader revision of the ozone-related rules.
The bill, approved by the House of Representatives last month, aims to postpone implementation of the 2015 rules for at least eight years.
The Senate has not yet voted on this issue.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that filed lawsuits against the EPA this week, said the group intends to continue legal pressure.
“The EPA’s course changes – after our lawsuits – are an important victory in the struggle for health and safety of the 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans directly affected by the smog that covers their cities,” Schneiderman said.
California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Man, Massachusetts, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington, as well as the District of Columbia, joined the lawsuit.
Earth-level ozone occurs when ordinary pollutants from machines, power plants, oil processing and chemical plants, and other sources enter the atmosphere in a reaction with sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious breathing problems in people who are sensitive to it, resulting in thousands of premature deaths per year.
Health advocates and environmental advocates welcomed the unexpected change in Pruitt’s course.
“It’s hard to think about how much pressure it took to achieve this perfectly logical step from a person who is tasked with protecting the air we breathe,” said Laurie Ann Bird of the Center for Biological Diversity.
“We must continue to resist the ideological campaign of the Trump administration and protect those who pollute the air and their special interests.”
The IAAF Congress extended the removal of the All-Russian Federation of Athletics
The Congress of the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) voted to extend the removal of the All-Russian Federation of Athletics (UFLA).
Thus, the Congress supported the IAAF Board for the Recovery of the WFLA, which issued a report on Monday in which it recommended that the deletion be left in place.
166 people voted for the extension of the removal, against - 21, reports TASS.
The report of the IAAF Board stated that the WFLA had made significant progress in achieving the conditions set by the Council for the Restoration of Membership, but these conditions have not yet been fully met.
Due to the disqualification of the WFLA at the World Championships in London, Russian light athletes were forced to perform under a neutral flag.
The team included 19 people admitted to the IAAF championship.
The WFLA was indefinitely disqualified by the IAAF in 2015.
The report was published by the independent expert of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) Dick Pound, which spoke about numerous violations of the WADA regulations permissible by Russian officials and athletes.
For more information on the latest report of the IAAF Council, read in the material “I” “The IAAF has extended the sanctions against the WFLA”.
Injurious defeat
As part of 3 rounds of the Fonbet Championship of Russia among the teams of PFL Novomoskovsky "Khimik" held an outing match against FC "Kaluga".
Just over 10 days ago, the rivals played each other in the Russian Cup, but this time the picture of the game was completely different.
"The chemist" did not give up on the opponent in anything, but the second relaxation at the end of the match led to an offensive goal and fiasco.
After the recent defeat of the Kaluga with a 0:3 count, many predicted the easy victory of the hosts in advance.
However, since the beginning of the meeting, the Novomoskovs were forced to be considered and acted from the defense, but from a position of force.
In the 1st time, the Caluzhans built more and had an advantage in possession of the ball.
Another very high-quality match was held by Alexei Sirotin, who several times reflected dangerous blows and gave confidence to the partners with his actions.
Unfortunately, in the attack "Khimeku" did not have enough effort and luck to put the defense "Kaluga" in a deadlock and to score the first goal on the way out.
After the break, the game began to run on the course.
The Novomoskovs were more active in the attack.
Alarming bells for our team have become errors in defense, which allowed the Kaluga to create a number of sharp moments.
10 minutes before the end of the meeting, the "Khimik" seized the territorial advantage and carried out several dangerous attacks.
But the experience of the Kaluga played its part - they more competently and cold-bloodedly conducted the end, waiting for their moment to take the gate.
After a dangerous attack "Khimik" transferred the ball to the corner, the feed of which the owner of the field without resistance was transferred to the gate.
The author of the goal was Yuri Dubrovnik.
In the report meeting "Chemist" demonstrated a good game, but suffered an offensive defeat.
In front of our team is another departure - on August 11 at 19 hours in Moscow at the stadium "Torpedo" named Eduard Streltsov novomoskovski will fight with the favorite group "Center" of FC "Ararat", in which Aleksko is represented by Roman Pavlyuchenko, Marat Izmay.
Come and support the chemist!
The meeting place and time of the Novomoskovtsev - 6:30 p.m. near the Magnolia store (Vostochnaya, 2nd Street, Corp.
Composition of "Chemistry": Sirotin, Manokhin (k), Romashchenko, Shayunov, Homutov, Gogya (Oreshkin), Dudaity, Ryzhov, Saints, Belyanin (Adoevtsev), Andreichenko (Lygin)

According to published decryptions of telephone conversations, Trump pressed Mexico on the payment of the wall at the border
The Washington Post published the decryption of telephone conversations between U.S. President Donald Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Australia.
On January 27, during a telephone conversation with Mexican President Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto, Trump insisted that he stop publicly declaring that he would not pay for the planned wall at the border.
The U.S. president denied him publicly speaking against the wall, and, according to leaked information, told him: “You can’t tell the press that.”
Trump began his campaign with a promise to build a wall along the southern border of the United States and vowed to make Mexico pay for the project.
In the decryption of his first telephone conversation with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, a hot switch was also found.
Trump told Turnbull that the deal that the U.S. should accept refugees going to Australia was “funny,” “obscene” and “stupid,” and insisted that because of the U.S.-led deal, it would look like a new Obama administration.
Trump concluded the conversation, telling Turnbull that “it was the most unpleasant conversation of the entire day.”
The bodies of the dead in Abkhazia tourists sent by plane from Sochi to St. Petersburg
The plane belonging to the airline "Russia", on board which are the bodies of the dead Russians in Abkhazia, departed at 20:15 Moscow time from Sochi to St. Petersburg, TASS reports.
At the final point of follow-up, the board will meet the staff of the ritual agency, as well as representatives of the city’s mayor, Deputy Minister of Resorts and Tourism of Abkhazia Astamyr Ahba told reporters.
Earlier, representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic stated that all the costs associated with the delivery of bodies back to Russia were borne by the government of Abkhazia.
In addition, the official Sukhum intends to pay the families of the deceased compensation in the amount of 500,000 rubles.
According to Ahba, the leadership of Abkhazia expressed its willingness to pay the relatives of tourists who died as a result of the explosions to fly and stay in the republic, but the relatives sent to the republic only confidence in the right of local authorities to act in accordance with the established order.
On August 2, at about 16:20 Moscow time, two explosions broke out in the village of Primorskyi Gudautskyi district at the missile and artillery weapons warehouse of the Ministry of Defense of the Republic, after which the other large-caliber artillery weapons kept there began to detonate.
As a result, there was a fire in the warehouse, which provoked uncontrollable explosions of shells of various modifications.
As a result, two citizens of Russia - Elena Polyakova born in 1970 and Elena Tymofeeva born in 1962, who were on holiday near the hydrogen sulfide source.
64 people, including 35 citizens of the Russian Federation and 29 citizens of Abkhazia, with injuries of varying degrees of severity were taken to medical institutions of the Republic.
At present, seven people remain in the hospital, the rest are discharged.
The study of the Russian influence on the US elections will be carried out by a large jury
Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller has convened a grand jury in Washington to study Russia’s influence on the 2016 U.S. presidential election, according to The Wall Street Journal and Reuters.
The Grand Jury is a group of ordinary citizens who gather evidence of potential criminal offences and have the right to question witnesses under oath.
The collected materials will be examined by the Special Prosecutor and will decide whether they are sufficient for prosecution.
The convening of a grand jury gives Mueller additional powers to collect testimony.
One of the topics of the investigation of the jury, which began work a few weeks ago, will be details of the meeting of the son of then-presidential candidate Donald Trump with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya.
To check the details of this meeting, which took place in June 2016, Mueller himself promised earlier.
They've already been studied by the FBI.
At the end of July, it was reported that Donald Trump Jr. expanded the staff of his lawyers.
Trump Jr. had previously said that from his meeting with Veselnicka he was waiting for a compromise for the Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton’s headquarters, but no revealing documents were presented, and in the end it was about adoption.
In early August, a number of media outlets reported that Trump’s statement about the meeting with Veselnicka was literally dictated by Trump’s elder.
The White House clarified that the president had not dictated anything, but simply used his authority, as any father would have done.

Deputy head of the Penza administration, Irina Shirshin, has been detained for 48 hours on behalf of the Investigative Committee at his workplace, reports RIA Novosti.
Official communications from law enforcement authorities on the matter have not yet been received, but the press service of the SU SC has assured that they will soon follow.
In the city of Penza, there is no comment on what has happened.
Irina Shirshina is one of the five deputy heads of the administration of Pence.
She has been curating urban issues and land relations, occupying this position since April 2015.
Prior to that, she worked for a long time as the head of the Department of the State Administrative Inspectorate of the Penzance Region.
Irina Shirshina raises three minor children, noteworthy that once again became a mother a year ago, she gave up the decrete leave and returned to work.
Of course, there is no cosmodrome or rocket launcher in Mexico.
But there is a space agency established in 2010 and a desire to develop its own space program.
And the installation of the bust of Yuri Gagarin is a tribute to the first person who visited in space.
Unlike the Soviet-era monuments that are carried in some countries, Gagarin’s monuments, on the contrary, “walk around the planet.”
In 2012, the monument was erected in Houston, USA, near NASA's former headquarters.
In London, a monument to the Royal Observatory was installed in honor of the 50th anniversary of its first space flight.
There is a Gagarin monument in Germany in the city of Erfurt, where our cosmonaut visited in 1963.
The monument in Karlovy Vary (Czech Republic) avoided demolition in 1992 thanks to public protests and was moved from the city center to the square in front of the local airport.
In the year of Gagarin’s 70th anniversary, a monument to Yurius Gagarins appeared in Riga.
This is how the name and surname of the first cosmonaut sounds in Latvian, and it looks like he is 70 years old.
Murder of Morse Ford: Activists Lose Lynch Trials on Stage to Call for Justice
"Ford Mercury" in 1948 passed the spectators in the village of Monroe in the state of Georgia and slammed into the small Morse Ford Bridge.
When a car carrying four black passengers and a white driver approached the bridge, a group of white men with guns blocked the way for her.
The main one - a middle-aged man in a thin stripe suit - stretched a cigar and looked through the windshield.
The insides trembled with fear.
"We need this nigger, Roger!" said the man.
"Get him out of the car!"
The penetrating cries broke the silence when a young black man was pulled out of the front seat.
Luckily, this horrible scene, which took place on July 22nd, is just a staging.
But when Roger was thrown a loop on his neck, almost all the spectators actually took their breath away.
Since 2005, activists have been returning to the Morse Ford Bridge to lose again the night the puppet clans lynched two black couples in 1946 – Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and May Murray Dorsey.
No one was convicted of these murders.
“It’s amazing that no one has been arrested in all these years – although we see them next to us; although we know who they are,” says Tyrone Brooks, who helped organize the show.
“It’s a stain on our history and it’s a stone on our souls.”
71-year-old Brooks is a former congressman from Georgia who has been fighting for human rights all his life.
For him, the performance is a dramatic call to action and an annual reminder to the residents of Monroe that the injustice has never been corrected.
“We want investigations, we want completions, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we have to get justice,” he said.
“We can’t move on to healing and reconciliation until justice is achieved.”
The coroner covers the body of one of the victims of the lynching at Morse Ford on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI records obtained by NBC News, more than 50 people in Monroe and neighboring counties were suspected of involvement in lynching.
But no one has ever been charged.
Although the suspects have been at liberty for decades, human rights defenders say the city has always been well-known for two related lynching motives: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a ruling of the Supreme Court for the first time allowed black citizens to vote for the premiership, which was to take place that summer.
Around the same time, according to FBI reports, black user Roger Malcolm struck Barnett Haster, a white landowner, in the fight with a knife — apparently because of a woman.
Brooks says that, according to rumors spread in the city, Hester slept with the wife of Malcolm Dorothy, and that the child she was supposed to give birth to was not from her husband.
According to FBI reports, on July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a large white landowner, paid $600 bail to release Malcolm from prison.
He went to prison with Dorothea and their cousins May Murray and George Dorsey.
But when they drove out of prison and drove up to the Morse Ford Bridge, a crowd of lynchmen surrounded the car.
"It seems that Harrison organized and commanded the killings," said one of the FBI's reports.
“It is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between the state and city law enforcement agencies that not only took part in the killings, but also destroyed evidence and concealed the identity of witnesses.”
Brooks calls it shorter.
“It was an attempt on electoral rights,” he said.
"They've all been killed to send a signal to black people in the city: if you sign up and vote, it'll be the same with you."
For almost a decade, Cassandra Green has been directing an annual show that reproduces the lining at the Morse Ford Bridge.
Her performance is watched, it captures the viewer and tells about the deep racism that, as many would like to believe, is no more in America.
It’s hard to look at and even harder to turn around, but Green believes that’s what matters.
“We don’t want to talk about the Lynch courts because they show us our own disgust,” she says.
“But I can’t build a relationship with you if you don’t hear me or hear what I’ve been through.”
The rehearsals of this year's performance began in June, and on the first day almost 30 actors - dozens of whites, the rest blacks - gathered in the room and listened to the over the years polished review of the play.
Wade Marbo was the director with Green.
He played the main member of the clan for several years, but says the role never got easier.
“I feel like I’m screwed because he’s not the person that I am,” Marbo says.
“But I think it’s very important to remember this story because we don’t want to go back to that time.”
In the room, Darius Bradshaw and Nick Rascon, who play Roger Malcolm and Barnett Haster, reprise their roles.
The spectacle begins with Malcolm, angry that Hester is sleeping with his wife Dorothy, yelling and pushing him.
"I said, Nigga, get out of my house!"
Screams Rascon in response.
A blow is given.
And at the same time, everyone (at least all black actors) is being harassed.
Green laughs louder than anyone else.
"What is it?" asked Ascona.
He's worried and embarrassed.
Am I playing again?
"No," Green said with a laugh.
"I just don't think white people said 'nigga' then."
“Yes,” laughs one of the black performers.
"You must have a solid 'R'."
And so does the energy in the room: the discomfort is replaced by the feeling of companionship.
Everyone must do everything right, not only for the sake of the play, but also for the sake of the memory of the four people killed.
The scene starts at first.
This time, when Rascon says the word on the letter "n," it becomes clear and sharp.
No one laughs.
The show ends brutally and quickly.
Screams, shots, and then silence.
A woman in mourning black clothes stands over the bodies of the actors and performs Billy Holliday's sad song "Strange Fruit".
Her voice is interrupted by the word.
In a hundred yards from it, half a hundred spectators wipe tears and sweat from their eyes.
The number of spectators is almost equal to the number of blacks and whites.
One couple came from Ithaca, New York, to see the show; many live very close by.
They all endured Georgia’s heavy thirst for nearly eight hours while Brooks led them on a pilgrimage to the graves of Malcolm and Dorsey.
Until then, the murders remained only a story, but now that they are standing in the same place where people were lynching, it seems that their ghosts are blowing right in the air.
When the last note of the song is silenced, Green invites people to come closer and examine the bodies.
The children bend to their heads, touch the blood-representing paint, and the immobile bodies and whisper something to each other.
"They're not really dead," one little boy murmurs, as if to remind himself of it.
After a few minutes, Green thanked the audience, and all of a sudden it was over.
The actors throw ropes off the neck and wipe the tears.
Bradshaw embraces Marbo, a man in a suit who played the main puppet clown.
Nick Rascona embraces two other actors and suddenly, crying, falls into their arms: the emotional strain of the show has finally fallen on him.
"It's all right," whispered one of the women.
“We know that your heart is good.
You had reasons for that.”
Later, the spectators sit down to dinner with the actors.
At one table, a white couple from Atlanta lively discusses a show with a black couple they have just met.
Denisa Daplinski hardly searches for words to describe what she feels after the show.
“It’s hard to listen to these horrible, disgusting words and actions ... people who look like you and who do it because they look like you,” she says.
“After that, I think lynchings are still happening,” she adds, “only now it’s called shooting by the police.”
In the other corner of the room, Tyrone Brooks, who remembers his work as a human rights defender, was caught in the spotlight.
He says he's already starting to plan next year's show.
“The situation inspires us, because it not only describes the horror of what we have experienced, but also teaches us,” he says.
“Because if you don’t learn from this lesson, it can happen again.
Those who do not study their history, who do not know their history, are doomed to repeat it.”
The court fined Navalny for violations of the "agitation Saturday"
The Simonov court in Moscow fined Alexey Navalny 300,000 rubles for violating the order of the rally.
The opposition was found guilty of an administrative offence provided for in Article 8 of Article 20.2 of the Russian Civil Code "Repeat violation of the order of organization of the rally".
Earlier, the judge of the Simonovsky Court of Moscow, Khyzyr Mussakaev, concluded the administrative case against Leonid Volkov, the head of the opposition’s headquarters, Alexei Navalny, who claimed responsibility for the same article as Navalny.
Wolkov was convicted and sentenced to a fine of 300,000 rubles.
In this amount, Judge Mussakaev assessed the distribution of leaflets on the "agitation Saturday" that supporters of Navalny held in Moscow on July 8-9.
Having seen the agitation materials that monitored the participants of the Saturday night, the police believed that the organizers of the event deliberately concealed its true essence - a public action (for which it is necessary to ask permission from the capital authorities in advance).
Leonid Volkov and his lawyers Ivan Zhdanov and Alexander Pomazuev applied for the termination of the administrative proceedings due to the lack of criminal composition and indicated that the police allowed certain errors in the drafting of the protocol.
At the very "agitation Saturday" Volkov was not detained, but he received an agenda requiring him to appear at the police station to tell about the event carried out during his active participation.
The same agendas were received by Navalny himself and another associate of the opposition - Nikolai Lyaskin.
Murdered in Mordov<0xC3><0xAD>a who shot the bride and three guests of the wedding
A court in Mordov<0xC3><0xAD>a has arrested a local resident who shot four people at the wedding, including a bride.
This was reported to the Republican administration of the Investigative Committee.
The incident occurred on the evening of July 29.
During the dispute, a 42-year-old resident of Saransk shot several times at the guests of the event, who came to the rural pond to bathe.
As a result, three women and one man were injured.
A criminal case has been initiated under article 213, part 1 (a), article 30, part 3 (a), (e), (i) and part 2 of article 105 (a) of the Russian Criminal Code (“Attempt to assassinate two or more persons in a dangerous manner”) from hooligans.
According to Interfax, local media reported that the man opened the shooting due to the fact that the guests of the wedding, having decided to swim, passed through the territory of his site to the reservoir.
Minenergo to tighten requirements for turbine suppliers for power plants
The Ministry of Energy of the Russian Federation will update the rules for providing information to suppliers of critical equipment, in particular, turbines for power plants.
At the launch of gas turbines, turbines of power plants, oil pumping facilities and oil extraction equipment suppliers will undertake to share data on access to it with the Ministry of Energy and the Federal Service for Technical and Export Control.
The draft resolution of the Government is already ready and is being put forward for public discussion.
The new requirements will only affect the "critical energy equipment" supplied to Russia.
Potential threats in the document include such phenomena as obtaining information and access to the management of the facility by foreign intelligence services, criminal elements and structures, fraudulent partners and hackers.
EU extends anti-Russian sanctions over Siemens
The European Union press service said on August 4 that the anti-Russian sanctions were extended due to the scandal surrounding the supply of turbines produced by Siemens to Crimea.
This was previously reported by the "Arguments of the Week".
The EU Council press service said the sanctions against Russia were extended because of the Siemens production turbine scandal, which was allegedly delivered to Crimea in circumvention of the sanctions.
Today, the Council of Europe is considering all possible complaints and proposals from member states on the extension of anti-Russian sanctions.
Earlier it was reported that the final decision will be made by the end of the day, and the decision has been made, sanctions against Russia have been extended.
“Person” cuts 3,000 more jobs and reduces dividends to bring business back to life
On Friday, a British education group of companies, Pirson, announced that it would cut another 3,000 jobs and reduce the amount of preliminary dividends by 72 percent due to the start of their next business restructuring program aimed at tackling the problems.
These job cuts, which, according to John Fallon’s CEO, will mainly occur in late 2018 and early 2019, are in addition to the 4,000 jobs cut during the previous restructuring.
Pirson announced that it plans to cut costs by another <0xC2><0xA3>300 million ($394 million) in May as part of its third spending reduction program to try to bring the business back to life, which hit the fast transition to digital learning methods.
The company, which last month agreed to sell its stake in Penguin Random House to its partner, the Bertelsman Group, said its forecasts for the year remained unchanged after it announced a year-on-year increase in sales of the primary product by 1 percent to the first.
Attack on a convoy in Kabul: Nato soldier killed in suicide bombing
According to official sources, the suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital, Kabul, killing one NATO soldier and injuring several others.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, according to a NATO report.
According to unchecked data from local sources, three civilians were also killed as a result of the incident in the Karabakh urban area.
The blast is the latest of the bloodshed in Afghanistan this month: more than 30 people died as a result of the explosion in a mosque in Herat on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
According to NATO, the explosion, which occurred on Thursday evening, occurred when a joint convoy with the Afghan army was attacked using a “man-portable self-propelled explosive device.”
According to the report, all the wounded are in stable condition and receiving treatment at the U.S. military hospital at Bagram Airport.
Correspondents report that the growing power of the Taliban and the group known as “Islamic State” (ISIS) in Karabakh is a major source of concern for NATO forces stationed near Bagram.
According to UN reports, in the first half of 2017, at least 1,662 civilian casualties occurred in Afghanistan, about 20% of them in the capital.
At the end of July, an explosion of a suicide bomber in a car killed at least 30 people in the Shia area of Kabul.
The Taliban said they carried out the attack.
On May 31, a powerful explosion in the city center killed more than 150 people – the country’s most serious death toll since U.S.-led troops removed the Taliban from power in 2001.
The violence highlights the unreliable situation in Afghanistan, while U.S. President Donald Trump assesses whether it is necessary to increase the number of U.S. military forces assisting troops and police in the country.
The terrorist attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also created a crisis of public confidence in the government, its line of conduct, and especially the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
Environmental Protection Agency Cancels Decision to Defer the Adoption of the Law on Air Pollution after Trial
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency) has cancelled the decision to postpone the adoption of the Obama-era law, which states must limit emissions polluting the air, a day after 15 states sued the agency for the move.
On Wednesday evening, the Environmental Protection Agency announced its decision to implement the so-called “ozone measurements – 2015”, stressing that this step shows the agency’s willingness to cooperate with the states.
“We believe in dialogue with our partners in the states and responsiveness to them,” said Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, in a statement.
In June, Pruitt announced the Environmental Protection Agency’s intention to postpone the measurements of ozone, in which existing air pollution is measured in different parts of the country, to determine the year in which it needs to be reduced to a minimum, in order to meet more stringent standards.
On Tuesday, a group of 15 states, mostly Democratic, along with the federal district of Colombia, filed a lawsuit alleging that the intent was illegal.
The administration of President Donald Trump is trying to back down a wide range of environmental protection regulations introduced by former President Barack Obama, as part of a broader program aimed, according to Trump, at brilliant economic growth.
But actions in this direction have provoked resistance from Democrats and environmental organizations concerned about the possible impact of large emissions on the health of the population.
The Environmental Protection Agency’s website says that using ozone-containing air to breathe “may impair lung function and intensify respiratory symptoms,” such as asthma.
The Association of European Businesses opposes new anti-Russian sanctions
The European Business Association has expressed disagreement with the U.S. economic sanctions against Russia.
According to the AEB, such measures could lead to a serious reduction in production and the number of jobs.
The AEB said in a statement that business is one of the important linkages between countries and people, so the principles of free trade cannot be restricted.
The European business unites more than 500 companies from the countries of the European Union and the European Free Trade Association.
The Association calls on the heads of state and government of the EU, the US and Russia to develop a new line of behavior that would allow business to separate from politics and find a common, mutually acceptable solution in a spirit of peace and harmony.
MPs ask police to restrict traffic on the waterfront in Pskov
The Pskov People's Electors sent an address to the head of the UMVD on the city of Sergey Surin about the problem of movement along the embankment of the Velika River.
Deputies of the proud Konstantin Bolotin, Grigory Storonenkov and Valery Lesnikov believe that motorists prevent people from walking and resting in this place.
In their opinion, controlling drivers will help make this territory more calm and safer.
The problem is that the perpetrators ignore the signs of the “walking path” and ride freely along the waterfront.
It turns out that capital repairs and improvements have been carried out poorly.
Sports and children's playgrounds are becoming uncomfortable due to cars.
As noted by the Pskov news agency, in the evenings the central promenade is patrolled by employees of the PPS motor patrol and wives.
Thanks to them, the number of passing cars becomes smaller, but the movement does not stop completely.
Putin urges investigative authorities not to remove hard drives
Russian President Vladimir Putin has proposed to prohibit the investigative authorities not to remove servers and hard drives from working computers in enterprises.
This was stated by the Head of State at the meeting on investment programs for the development of the Far East.
According to the president, it is necessary to "exclude the application in the interest of investigation of measures leading to the suspension of the activities of enterprises, including the removal of hard drives from working computers and servers."
Putin noted that if investigators have such a need, "it is enough to remove copies, certify them and use them during the investigation."
The head of state added that it is not possible to "create conditions that prevent the continuation of the business up to the impossibility of paying taxes."
Olga Buzova told how much she wanted to call her ex-husband
TV host Olga Buzova admitted that she really wanted to call her ex-husband - footballer Dmitry Tarasov.
At the moment, the celebrity is in the United States, where it deals with work issues.
Literally on the eve of Olga’s visit to Las Vegas, after which she decided to post a post on Instagram.
She reported that she didn’t get married, didn’t make new tattoos, and didn’t name her ex-husband with the words that he ruined her life, even though she really wanted to do it.
Buzova said that she will remember this trip forever, because she had a great time.
British actor Robert Hardy has died.
British actor Robert Hardy, who played the Minister of Magic Cornelius Faj in the screening of a series of novels about Harry Potter, died at the age of 92.
This was reported on Thursday by the newspaper "Independent".
The actor's death was reported by relatives.
According to them, he lived “a huge life, having achieved success in cinema, theater and television for 70 years of his career.”
Hardy was born in 1925 in the English resort town of Cheltenham.
In 1959 on the stage of the Royal Shakespeare Theatre, he played with Lawrence Olivier in "The Tragedy of Coriolanus".
Hardy also remembered repeatedly performing the roles of Prime Minister Winston Churchill, including in one of Agatha Christie's screenings of Miss Marple.
For his role in the television drama Winston Churchill: The Wilderness Years (1981), he was awarded the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) award.
Robert Hardy also had to play the role of U.S. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt.
There was something missing in the Danish state: Prince Henry, and in fact Henri Marie Jean-André, Count of Labord, refused to be buried together with his venerable wife, Queen Margrethe.
This year, four have a "golden" wedding, but on the agenda of the couple's day - not preparation for celebrations, but a funeral dispute.
His Highness renounced the title of prince-consort, and at the same time he sneered at the Queen that she had never regretted the title of king-consort.
Henry lives in France, although he remains officially the queen's wife.
Russia's Foreign Ministry Calls on Washington to Stop Swallowing Moscow
The Russian Foreign Ministry responded to the remarks of Mike Pence, who accused Moscow of trying to destabilize the Balkans.
The relevant statement was disseminated by the Foreign Office some time ago.
In his commentary, the Foreign Ministry pointed out that the United States is increasingly using cold-war stamps that are inadequate to modern reality.
In addition, Russian diplomats called on the U.S. authorities to stop shelling Russia.
As the "Arguments of the Week" wrote yesterday, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence accused Moscow of trying to destabilize the Western Balkans and organize a failed state revolt in Montenegro.
Mothers Garcia and Vasily Lomacenko meet for the first time, talk about the possibility of a decisive match
Vasily Lomacenko and Mikey Garcia, who seem to be constantly moving towards holding the most exciting game of boxing weighing up to 147 pounds in the near future, met for the first time on Thursday.
They occupied separate rooms in the offices of the ESPN channel in Los Angeles, while Garcia, the unbeaten lightweight champion of the World Boxing Council, did not go through the hallway to welcome Lomachenko, the world boxing champion.
After Garcia’s unanimous victory over former world champion Erien Bronner in four weight categories on Saturday on the showtime channel, both boxers are among the top five boxers regardless of the weight categories.
Garcia stretched out his right hand and said, "How's it going, champion?
Good luck to you.”
Lomacenko defends his belt in a match with Miguel Mar<0xC3><0xAD>aga on Saturday at seven o’clock in the evening on ESPN.
When the boxers posed for the photo, Lomacenko manager Egis Klimas noticed that the potential decisive battle between them would be the most time.
“I used to be half-weight,” Garcia recalled.
“I went up in the category for Bronner [up to <0xC2><0xA3>140], but I’m not that big.
I'm short for 140.
I want to go down to the halfway point.
And he needs to go up to the half-light [up to 135 pounds], and then we're going to have a match.
That's what fans want.
Let’s arrange it for them.”
Lomachenko agreed.
“Boxing needs this game.”
Klimas asked if the fight should be broadcast through the PPV service, as part of the strategy that he adheres to for Lomacenko to conduct their debut fight at 135 weight later this year in order to appoint for the next summer with the battle of <0xD0><0xA5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xBF><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xBC><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xBC><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xBC><0xD0><0xBE><0xD0><0xBC><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xBC><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xBC><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD1><0x80><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xBD><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0>
“The fight can be on the PPV because all the fans have asked for it,” Garcia said, later expressing his willingness to fight on the channel that will offer better financial conditions.
“We are the main names.
No other names will be of such interest.
As soon as they are ready...”
Garcia said he thinks Lomacenko is a “great boxer” and might visit his Saturday match.
But Lomachenko did not immediately beat Garcia with praise and said that, in his opinion, the three-weight champion from Riverside looks “very slow, sorry, Mikey... you asked for a knockout.”
Garcia said he focused on showing the power of the punch, and then boxing.
They both said they felt the tension in front of their own fight was growing.
“This fight has to take place.
No other fights cause so much interest and conversation.
I’m more than happy to work on it,” Garcia said.
Lomacenko said: “I was expecting someone from the top boxers, and there he is, Mikey.
It will be a great fight.”

Putin ordered the Attorney General’s Office to check Baikal
Russian President Vladimir Putin has instructed the Prosecutor General’s Office of the Russian Federation to carry out an inspection of the territory of Baikal on the facts of illegal and environmentally harmful activities.
"I ask the Prosecutor General's Office to check the Bikal area for the facts of illegal and environmentally harmful activities," Vladimir Putin said at a meeting on the environmental development of the region.
In addition, the Russian leader asked to take action if the facts of the violations were discovered.
New test results to assess the age of asylum seekers in Sweden have been published
The latest results of tests of asylum seekers in Sweden, who have been subjected to a new method of medical age assessment, show that more than 80 percent of those tested were assessed as persons over 18 years of age, but not all trust the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish National Agency for Forensic Medicine (Rättsmedicinalverket) started testing earlier this year.
They were designed to make the assessment of age in the asylum process more accurate, after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) criticised for failing to determine the actual age of some refugees who claimed they were imperfect.
At the moment, the Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 cases for testing, and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of 2,481 tests for the period between mid-March and 31 July 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) of those tested were assessed as 18-year-olds or older, and 25 more cases were assessed by the forensic agency as “probably 18-year-olds or older.”
In 432 cases, the finding stated that the person “probably is less than 18.”
Tests are performed only in cases where the age of a person causes doubts.
According to Johan Göransson of the forensic medicine agency, the results correspond to the results of the past months.
"We don't see much difference with the statistics over the past months, the numbers are quite relevant," he told The Local.
The high proportion of cases in which people were estimated to have reached the age of 18 does not necessarily indicate that asylum seekers were lying about their age.
In May, the agency published the results of 581 tests and reported that in 442 cases “the fastest, the age of 18 years or more tested.”
However, having looked at 581 published results, the Svenska Dagbladet newspaper found that in 243 cases the person openly stated that he was performing 18 this year.
The method of carrying out a medical age assessment, consisting in making X-rays of wisdom teeth and tomography of the knee joints and giving them for analysis to dentists and x-rayologists, has also provoked criticism in some instances.
One of the skeptics is an endocrinologist at the Claude Marcus Caroline Institute, part of whose work is to assess people’s biological maturity in order to determine whether they have gone through puberty sooner or later than usual.
“I had reasons to think about it, and I don’t think we need to use the measurement methods that are used now.
The biological age is thus determined very inaccurately.
If we can’t identify it with confidence, we shouldn’t pretend we can,” he told Metro.
However, Göranssen of the forensic medicine agency said in favor of the accuracy of the tests: “In general, it can be said that the risk of mistakenly taking a child as an adult is minor.
We face the greatest risk when a person is soon to be 18, in which case he or she is about 10 percent.”
I wonder if I can run for president.
During a working trip to Buryatia, Vladimir Putin was surprised that he was ready to think about whether he would run for president of Russia in the 2018 elections, Interfax reports.
This statement was a response to the request of the residents of the village of Cheremushka Buryat region.
During the video conference on the elimination of the fire in Buryatia and Irkutsk region, the interlocutor addressed Putin with the words: "Vladimir Vladimirovich, we have a request to you: when the next presidential election will be, we all ask you to vote for this post."
“Okay, I’ll think, thank you,” the president said in response.
On July 28, the press secretary of the President of Russia Dmitry Peskov commented on the statements of some media that the election headquarters of Vladimir Putin will be headed by the head of the administration of the President of the Russian Federation Anton Vyno.
Peskov called these assumptions "neither unfounded, hypothetical reasoning."
"So far there are no headquarters, far before the establishment of headquarters, far before the election campaign," Peskov said.
"Until this is on the agenda," Peskov said.
The governor of West Virginia has said he is moving to another party.
West Virginia Governor Jim Justis, a representative of the Democratic Party, announced on Thursday during a rally with President Trump that he was moving to another party.
“Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have distanced themselves from me,” Justis said.
“Today I speak to you with many prayers and many reflections ... today I say to you, the people of West Virginia: I can no longer be of any use to you as a democratic governor.”
The rally exploded with applause.
“So tomorrow I’m going to change my registration to a Republican,” Justis added.
“As a coach, I’d tell you it’s time to play differently.”
Earlier, Trump promised that an important statement would be made at a rally in West Virginia.
Trump won in West Virginia with a 42-percent lead, and Justis did not support Democratic Party candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justis, who, according to Forbes, is the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states because he inherited the coal business from his father.
His fortune is estimated at $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee on Thursday night issued a statement that “Governor Justis’s transition to another party is another blow to the Democratic Party, which is more impeding than working to make our country great again.”
“Given only 15 governors and control over the smallest number of state legislatures in history, the statement of Governor Justis is just another rejection of the party, which has no leaders from the top of the constituency of the constituency of the constituency of the constituency of the constituency of the constituency and is unable to find a positive, unifying CBS message.”
Mr. Krasavczyk has found a home thanks to social networks
Pittsboro (North Carolina, U.S.A.) ran a cat named Mr. Beauty weighing more than 14 kilograms after it became famous thanks to the internet.
This is reported by Mashable.
At the end of June, a photo of the cat was posted in the pet owner’s Facebook account asking to find its owner, because “it was apparently fed by someone before.”
In the comments, users noted that the expression of the animal's face can become a new meme.
The publication has garnered more than 3,200 likes and 15,000 comments.
In the comments, dozens of people expressed their desire to house Mr. Beautiful.
As a result, he was handed over to Angela Frazee, who promised to deal with his excess weight.
In an interview with WNCN radio, the American said she had already had a similar experience: she took home a cat weighing about 10 kilograms, and now he weighs just over five.
In July, Reddit users turned their attention to a cat from Australia with unusually long legs.
The post with a photograph of the animal collected more than 68,000 views.
The commentators noted that she could well have made a career in the modeling business.
Kou praised Russia’s “honest” apology in connection with the doping scandal
International athletics expert Sebastian Cow on Thursday praised what he called a sincere apology from Russia in connection with the doping scandal, but reiterated that it is now an inappropriate moment to allow the country to participate again.
The Russian representative of the federation of light athletics Dmitry Shlyakhtin said at the congress of the International Association of Athletics Federations, which took place on the eve of the World Championships in light athletics that was the main draw and that the removal of his country from the sports sore.
He apologises to “all athletes who have stolen gold and silver medals in competitions.”
Despite his comments, the Congress of the International Association of Athletic Federations voted in favour of maintaining the removal imposed in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) had published a report on the findings of the testimonies.
“It seemed to me that today’s response, today’s report, was very sincere,” the president of the International Association of Cow Athletics Federations told reporters.
“The whole council and the whole congress liked ... that the Russian Federation itself recognizes that it has been experiencing extremely hot times and is now doing everything possible to take care of the restructuring of the federation.”
Kou said he also "liked" that Russia agreed to the criteria for its recovery.
“I think it was a very constructive day and that we are moving forward, but Congress supports the recommendations of a special commission, which says that now is not the time to restore Russia to rights,” Kou said.
“Over the next few months, we have to do everything we can to resolve this situation.
Our guiding principle was our desire to separate clean athletes from the contaminated system,” he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes, who meet the strict criteria of the International Association of Light Athletics Federations, will participate under a neutral flag in the World Championships in Athletics, which will start on Friday in London.
The head of the special commission of the International Association of Athletic Federations, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that a number of requirements will still be met for the restoration of Russia.
As he told reporters in London after a report made at the Council of the International Association of Athletic Federations, the drug testing is still not carried out in sufficient quantities, and the removed trainers are still doing their job calmly.
The court arrested a Ukrainian journalist suspected of state-sponsored
Detained by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) journalist Vasily Muravitskyi has been sent to prison for two months, reports SBU.
The official of the Internet publication "Journal Zhytomyr" is suspected of treason by posting his publications on Russian websites and infringing on the territorial integrity of Ukraine.
At the same time, Russia does not support the Ukrainian authorities’ action against the journalist, considering it a “barbaric policy” against the media.
Two years after the peak of the migration crisis in Europe, Italy decided on a limited military operation in the Mediterranean.
The patrol ship Commandante Borsini entered the territorial waters of Libya to then, together with the country’s navy, stop the influx of illegal migrants.
The decision to start the operation was taken by the Italian parliament on Wednesday.
Rome agreed with the internationally recognized government of Libya, which, however, does not control much of the country's territory.
The opposition cabinet and the Libyan parliament based in Tobruk accused Italy of violating Libya’s sovereignty.
And the commander of the Libyan National Army, Field Marshal Haftar, ordered his subordinates to counter Italian ships.
In Rome, however, they stated that they do not believe these threats and intend to send another warship to Libyan territorial waters.
The situation was discussed last week at the talks of Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni and the head of Europe-recognized Libyan cabinet Faiz Saraj.
Italian authorities have set up a maritime mission to combat illegal migration after statistics on the number of illegals floating into the country from Libya were released in July: 95,000 people since the beginning of the year.
The government said that the resources for the reception of migrants were exhausted.

On Thursday, August 3, users began sending complaints to the developers of the program.
Microsoft stressed that experts are already actively working on resolving the problems faced by residents of Europe and North America, RIA Novosti clarifies.
In June of this year, there was also a failure in the work of Skype.
Users have been unable to receive and send messages for some time.
Two leaders of the Ukrainian team for light athletics removed from participation in the World Cup
Olga Zemljak and Olesya Povh, who specialize in short-distance running, are excluded from the team of Ukraine for the 2017 World Championships in London.
This is reported on the website of the Federation of Athletics of the country (FLAU).
This decision was made by the Executive Committee of the organization in connection with the excitement of disciplinary productions in relation to athletics by the International Association of Athletic Federations (IAAF).
Trainer Zemlak Sergei Basenko has also been excluded from the Ukrainian delegation.
According to Sportarena, the IAAF suspects the athlete in the use of doping.
Povh is the bronze medalist of the 2012 Olympics and the 2011 World Championships, the 2010 European Championships in the relay 4 by 100 meters, Zemljak - the winner of the 2012 European Championships in the relay 4 by 400 meters.
The World Athletics Championships will be held in London from 4 to 13 August.
How the financial rules of football will affect Neymar's move to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unrestricted spending by European football clubs do not prevent Neymar’s world record-setting transfer from Spain’s Barcelona to Paris Saint-Germain in France.
Whatever the consequences may be further along the chain, for Paris Saint-Germain by UEFA, the governing body that controls European football, whose authority prohibits teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League tournament.
From the rules of the financial "fire play" introduced by UEFA in 2011, it should be noted that "PSG" will eventually have to show that the transfer of Neymar was financed without major losses.
Barcelona paid 222 million euros ($262 million) just to free the Brazilian from the contract, and Neymar will receive a complaint that will reach tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some financial aspects of Neymar’s move to France.
PSG could certainly be lavish to hire Neymar and add him to the galaxy of other stars, given the team’s funding from the energy-rich ruling family of Qatar.
Clubs have the right to spend large sums of money on the acquisition of players, but they have to balance them at the expense of legitimate sources of income in order to reach the threshold of profitability in their football business.
FFP introduced Michel Platini after his election as UEFA president in 2007.
A former French footballer believed that clubs that were indebted to huge debts in their quest for success, in essence, were robbing and risking destruction in the event that banks or owners stopped funding.
In 2011, FFP stopped focusing on the debts of the clubs and instead switched to tracking their losses.
As a result of this change, the business model, which was originally used by Roman Abramovich in Chelsea in 2003 – to buy a club with good potential and then to spend seriously in order to improve the team and create a global brand – became a difficult plan.
During the current three-year valuation period, which spans 2018, clubs could suffer losses of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30 million.
And, despite Platini’s disgraced resignation from the presidency in 2015, his successor to UEFA, Alexander Cheferin, is still determined to curb excessive spending.
“Of course, FFP is alive, and we will, as we move forward, tighten the rules,” Andrea Traverso, who controls FFP at UEFA, told Associated Press last week.
Although PSG will pay for Neymar’s contract at once, it can allocate this amount for the sake of accountability for the entire duration of his contract.
Neymar signed a five-year contract, so the transfer cost can be shown in the annual report as a cost of 44.4 million euros over the next five years.
During the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, more severe sanctions were imposed on PSG, as well as on Abu Dhabi’s Manchester City.
PSG was fined <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60 million (at that rate it was <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>82 million), which was later reduced to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20 million, and was ordered to limit the composition of its team in the Champions League during the 2014-1015 season by 21 players instead of 25 regulars.
UEFA is tracking clubs that may try to trick its financial inspections by inflating their revenues at the expense of companies associated with the club’s owners.
Even if the Qatari company could promote PSG, but if the amount of funding was considered to exceed the standard market rates, UEFA would not allow it to be considered a legitimate income.
This is exactly what happened in 2014, when UEFA decided that the amount of funding from the Department of Tourism of Qatar was inflated.
It was reported that part of Neymar’s earnings at PSG could come in the form of payments from the organizing committee of the 2022 World Championship in Qatar.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 deny that Neymar will become World Cup ambassador, and such a maneuver could easily be detected by UEFA inspectors.
The past sanctions imposed on PSG mean that UEFA will be more closely monitored for any attempts to circumvent the rules.
As reported on Thursday, people familiar with the situation, UEFA did not hold preliminary discussions with PSG about the transfer of Neymar.
They communicated with the Associated Press on conditions of anonymity, as they were not authorized to discuss the situation of PSG.
According to the latest published report, in 2015-1016, PSG received more than 10 million euros in revenues of 542.4 million euros.
Reports for the last financial year have not yet been published.
PSG expects the arrival of Neymar to be a favorable ground for sponsorship deals, sales of attributes and T-shirts with the team’s logo.
The club expects that turnover will increase by at least 30 percent due to the hiring of a new player.
Undoubtedly upset by the departure of one of the best footballers, the Spanish league tried to prevent Neymar's transfer, saying that PSG would disrupt the financial "fire play".
“This is an obvious case of ‘financial doping,’ with the club and the state,” La Liga President Javier Tebas told the Spanish newspaper AS, bearing in mind that the final owner of PSG is Qatar.
Arsenal coach Arsene Wenger, whose club belongs to the American sports magnate, shares La Liga’s doubts about the club’s state funding.
“It’s all the consequences of participation and it has completely changed the landscape of football over the last fifteen years,” Wenger said in a statement.
“When the club belongs to the country, it’s possible.
It becomes very difficult to observe financial fair play, because the country can have many ways and many reasons to be represented by such a serious player.
The order and place of the oath will be determined by the President
Where and how new Russian citizens will swear allegiance to the Russian Federation will be determined by the president - such amendments to the second reading of the relevant law have been developed by the State Duma Committee on Legislation and State Construction.
A week ago, the deputies planned to directly determine the procedure for taking an oath in the law.
Children under the age of 18 will be released from the solemn oath, as well as the incapacitated, follows from the revised text of the amendments to the draft law "On citizenship of the Russian Federation" (there is at the disposal of "Izvestia"), which the committee will consider on July 11 before its second reading.
President Vladimir Putin supported the idea of introducing an oath when entering into the citizenship of the Russian Federation instead of formally signing the documents during a meeting on June 6 with the Speaker of the State Duma Vyacheslav Volodymyr.
The deputies have formulated this idea in the form of an amendment to the second reading of the draft law, which provides for the annulment of the decision on the issue of citizenship to those who were subsequently convicted of a number of crimes of a terrorist or extremist nature.
According to the bill, his logic was as follows: by filing documents for citizenship, a person is signed under a promise to comply with Russian legislation - stood on the path of extremism, he violates this promise.
The bill was introduced in the State Duma in April by the leaders of the Duma factions Vladimir Vasilyev ("United Russia"), Gennadiy Zuganov (CPRF), Vladimir Zhirinovsky (LDPR), Sergey Mironov ("Just Russia") and the speaker of DG Vochev.
On May 19, the deputies adopted it in the first reading.
Last week, the DG Committee on State Construction and Legislation approved the text of the bill for a second reading, but it has now been revised again.
Now it says that the procedure for taking the oath will be established by the President of the Russian Federation.
Earlier, parliamentarians were going to describe the procedure directly in the law "On Russian citizenship", stating that the ceremony should be held in a ceremonial setting in front of the state coat of arms and the flag of Russia in the presence of a representative of the Ministry of Interior.
However, it was not clear from the text of the draft law where such an event should take place - the list of places where it is possible to place the coat of arms of the Russian Federation, regulated by the relevant federal constitutional law.
These include courts, offices of heads of state bodies of subjects, municipal entities, judges, prosecutors, heads of federal executive bodies, etc.
Most likely, it could also be the SATs.
To make a solemn oath those wishing to obtain the citizenship of the Russian Federation will after the officials check their documents.
But a Russian passport a person will receive only after taking an oath, follows from the revised text.
A week ago, the draft said that the oath should precede the signing of the decree.
The updated text says that Russia will be sworn in from the age of 18, not from the age of 14.
There is a rule which exempts those who are incapacitated or incapacitated, as well as those who cannot pronounce, read or hand-sign the oath.
In addition, the President of the Russian Federation has the right to exempt from this procedure and "other persons",
Also, the updated bill stipulates a special procedure for the admission of Russian citizens of Ukraine, who are considered to be holders of the Russian language.
They will have to formally renounce Ukrainian citizenship by submitting a corresponding application to the authorized body of Ukraine for this purpose.
A notarized copy of the statement will have to be transmitted to Russian officials.
The renunciation of “foreign” citizenship, as it is now, will not be required if it is provided for by an international treaty or if it is not possible “for reasons not dependent on the person”.
The corresponding amendment to the law was proposed by a group of deputies, among them the first vice-speaker of DG Ivan Melnikov (CPRF), Natalya Poklonskaya, Pavel Krasheninnikov and Ayrat Farrahov (all - "United Russia").
I think many of you know that getting a reference from Ukraine is unrealistic, just impossible.
Accordingly, a lot of people are waiting for a solution of their fate regarding the citizenship of the Russian Federation, - explained the head of the Duma Committee on State Construction and Legislation Pavel Krasheninnikov (ER).
In addition, the text clarified that the restrictions on the employment of certain positions for foreigners will not apply to those who have given up their "other" citizenship in writing and handed over their former passport to the Ministry of Interior of Russia, but "for reasons not dependent on it" did not cease to be considered foreign citizens.
It is now forbidden for foreigners to hold positions in the municipal service, to be admitted to work at facilities and in organizations whose activities are related to the security of Russia.
Also, a person with dual citizenship or residence permit of another country may not become a State Duma Member or a member of the Federation Council.
It is planned that the law will enter into force from September 1, 2017, by which time the necessary legislative acts must be prepared.
Nostalgia becomes a niche in "Hot American Summer" and "Detective Factory"
Poe's current iteration of the story is nostalgically reminiscent of the glorious days of the characters in the 80s; of the age of the granga in the 90s (about the time the prominent masters David Wayne and Michael Shovalter had more than done the comedy sketches "The State", and MTV);
As a fact of culture, it is at the same time the elevation and embodiment of our era with its constant reminders from Facebook.
But like a franchise, it seems like an anachronism.
“The first day of camp” was surprisingly good, and not only because of the absurdist humor (including the original story of the talking pot of vegetables voiced by H. John Benjamin).
The result doubles the main joke: middle-aged actors play sexually impaired children who have just reached adulthood; as a result, the impossibility of getting back into the joke becomes part of the joke.
"Ten years later", where adults have already played adults, has less deep emotional roots, and its parodicity is more systemic and includes reefs from the stalker films of the 1990s such as "Hands climbing the cradle".
In one episode, the character gets the Apple Powerbook, four-wheel roller skates, and “a bunch of other stuff from 1991.”
Many of the plot moves are the same.
The Welcoming Cup (Shawalter), now a writer, still has not achieved reciprocity from Katie (Margerit Moro).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still not separated from virginity.
And there is also a crazy and vicious conspiracy involving Ronald Reagan (also Showalter), who is now being instigated by George W. Bush the Elder (a tried-and-true parody by Michael Jan Blake).
As always, the best part of a franchise is to deviate from it.
It’s especially fun to see the forever young Radd, who sings Matt Dillon’s song from “The Lonely One,” whose character, the former big man Andy, now looks old.
The success of this franchise could be random insanity in the spirit of the recursive series "Seven Up" until it comes to what I think would be its logical conclusion: "The hottest summer would be the summer of the American summer."
The “Detective Comrade” on the Amazon addresses another type of nostalgia: memories of the Cold War from the “Americans”, “Explosive Blonde” or even “Flash” with its images of the struggle of the East and the West.
This comedy, created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka with director Riz Thomas, depicts a telefilm: an 80s Romanian police drama about two policemen in Bucharest fighting for truth, atheism and a Marxist-Puhlenian.
The main roles - seen the life of Gregor and the idealist Joseph - are played by Florin Piersic Jr and Cornelius Ulic, and their dialogues were voiced in English by Chenning Tatum (the same executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a brilliant idea.
But it's just an idea.
There are several visual jokes (policemen spend time watching a game of chess as Americans could watch football).
A team of famous voices behind the scenes - including Jenny Slate, Nick Oferman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevigny - allows you to play an interesting "Guess the Voice".
But the detective's friend is so attached to the plausibility of a blatant propaganda drama - there's even a killer in Ronald Reagan's mask - that often looks like it.
Six long episodes are prolonged, and funny things don’t happen very often.
If it were to be made shorter, “Comrade Detective” could have better handled his satire in the spirit of agitprop; for example, every time Gregor and Joseph come to the American embassy, there are two fat people in the lobby, absorbing a bunch of hamburgers.
To the imaginary Communist viewer, this image says that Western culture is capable of anything to make an obese.
The fictional Romanian authors of the film are not so wrong: we do so even with our own recent history, and with them too.
The prize fund of the match for the Super Cup of Russia for football between "Spartak" and "Lokomotiv" will be about 30 million rubles.
This was reported by the President of the Russian Football Premier League (RFPL) Sergey Pradkin at a press conference.
According to the head of the RFPL, the winner will receive 70% of this amount, reports RT.
He also added that to date there are almost no tickets left for the match.
The Spartak-Lokomotive match will take place on Friday, July 14, at 9:30 p.m.
As TASS notes, "Spartak" is the current champion of the Russian Federation, and "Lokomotiv" is the owner of the Cup of the country.
Two young Ufimians cleaned a furniture shop for 200,000 rubles
Recently, a 37-year-old Ufimian with a furniture company approached the police.
The man claimed to have stolen expensive tools from the shop, which caused serious damage to his production.
The production of squirrels became tools with a total cost of almost 200,000 rubles: two welding machines, a perforator, hydraulics, a swivel.
The guards of the order began to search for the criminals and soon went out to the residents of the Blagoveshchenko district of Bashkortostan, friends of 23 and 24 years.
According to the press service of the Ministry of Interior of the Republic, the accomplices penetrated the territory of the enterprise, broke the front door and removed the tools.
Shortly after that, the guys sold the stolen equipment to the first caught car service.
The theft case has already been brought against them, and law enforcement officers have managed to return only part of the stolen tools to the legal owner.
Gosdep commented on Medvedev's words about relations between Russia and the United States
The United States and Russia must be able to work with each other.
With such a statement, the official representative of the State Department Heather Nauert in response to the words of the Prime Minister of the Russian Federation Dmitry Medvedev on the relations of the two states.
Earlier, the head of the Russian government said that, by adopting new anti-Russian sanctions, the United States put an end to the hope of improving bilateral relations and declared Russia a full trade war.
Commenting on these words, Nauert acknowledged that Russian-American relations are at a "low level", but noted that it was necessary to look for "areas for interaction".
“Look at the ceasefire in southwestern Syria, which has been in place for almost a month.”
“This is an example of good cooperation between the United States and Russia,” said RIA Novosti.
At the same time, the representative of the foreign ministry refused to comment on the statement of the Russian prime minister that the sanctions are equivalent to a trade war.
The bill on new sanctions against Russia, Iran and the DPRK was signed by U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday.
At the same time, he acknowledged that the document was unsuccessful and contradicts the U.S. Constitution.
Dior "grown" roses from amethysts and quartz
Dior Joaillerie, the jewellery division of the French fashion house Dior, complemented the collections of Rose Dior Bagatelle and Bois de Rose.
They have five new rings and three necklaces on velvet ribbons.
In the line of Rose Dior Pré Catelan released two new rings and pendant made of amethyst, pink quartz and diamonds, made in the technique of glipticism (manual thread on stone) and veneration and dedicated to the 70th anniversary of the house.
The head of Dior Joaillerie, Victor de Castellan, was inspired by the roses that were grown in his estate in Granville by model Christian Dior, and the Parisian gardens of Richelieu and Pre-Catelan.
Trump found guilty of deteriorating relations with Russia
U.S. President Donald Trump has spoken out harshly against members of Congress.
According to the American leader, their actions have led to a worsening of relations with Russia.
Our relations with Russia are at an unprecedentedly low and dangerous level.
“You can thank the Congress, these same people can’t even give us medicine,” he wrote on Twitter.
The day before, Donald Trump signed a law on new sanctions against Russia, Iran and the DPRK.
They will, in particular, affect Russian banks and energy companies.
Subsequently, the White House circulated a statement by the president in which he stated that the law would not allow the U.S. to make profitable deals and would bring Russia, China and North Korea even closer.
Belarusian Entrepreneur Refuses to Buy Ukrainian Daughter of Sberbank
Entrepreneur from Belarus Victor Prokopenya withdrew from the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) an application for the purchase of a subsidiary of Sberbank.
The businessman explained RBC’s intention to “concentrate on other of our planned investments and projects that we are working on.”
According to Mr. Prokopeni, such a step will be "the best investment of time", despite the investment attractiveness of the purchase of the daughter of Sberbank.
Mr. Prokopenya became the main contender for the purchase of a Russian bank in Ukraine after in July the NBU rejected the application of the NorvikBank consortium, Grigory Guselnikov and the Belarusian company Said Gutseriev.
Russian banks began to leave the Ukrainian market after in March the president of the country Petro Poroshenko imposed sanctions on their subsidiary structures.
One of these financial institutions - in addition to VTB and Vnesheconombank - became Sberbank.
Novak named the cause of blackout in Crimea
In the Ministry of Energy of the Russian Federation named the cause of the blackout in the Crimea.
With clarifications about what happened, the head of the department Alexander Novak spoke.
According to him, the peninsula was without electricity due to a road and transport accident in the Krasnodar region.
The truck hit the power transmission lines, as a result, the Cuban and related Crimean networks were shut down.
Disruptions in the electricity supply of large Crimean cities were recorded last week.
The specialists fixed the problems within a few hours.
Initially, it was reported that the cause of the blackout could have been an abnormal heat.
The Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25%
It is expected that the Bank of England will later announce that interest rates will not change after weak economic growth and weakening inflation have led to rumors of a possible rise.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain unbridled, leaving interest rates unchanged amid rising pressure on family incomes.
Experts of the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted with a score of 6 to 2 for maintaining the interest rate at 0.25%, while this month a smaller number of members of the committee voted for the rate increase because the weak economic growth slowed.
In its quarterly inflation report, the bank limited its forecasts to an increase of 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018 and warned that pressure on family incomes would continue, while inflation is still expected to rise to about 3% in the fall.
However, the bank warned that rising rates in the next few years would be necessary to control Brexit-induced inflation, and said that borrowing costs would likely have to rise more than expected in financial markets.
The members of the committee also voted in favour of abandoning part of the huge set of economic development measures launched a year ago following Brexit.
Starting next February, the bank will close its emergency financing plan, under which it provides banks with cheap loans, although it has announced that it now has to provide an additional <0xC2><0xA3>15 billion under this plan – up to <0xC2><0xA3>115 billion.
According to the MPC’s key forecasts, growth in gross domestic product (GDP) will remain slow in the near future, while pressure on real household incomes continues to affect consumption.
On the issue of interest rates, he reiterated that in order to halt inflation, it will require “some tightening of financial policy”, “slightly larger” than markets expect.
At the moment, markets are forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another one in 2020.
But the bank stressed that all increases will be “stage” and “limited”.
The bank’s forecasts for an increase this year and the following year are lower than the forecasts made in May, which were 1.9% and 1.7%.
The Bank remained unchanged its forecast of 1.8% in 2018.
After this news, the sterling fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell 0.5% to $1.31 and 0.4% to $1.11.
The decision not to change the rate was made after recent unfortunate growth rates weakened the expectation of an increase; GDP then rose by 0.3% in the second quarter against 0.2% in the previous three months.
According to the bank's representative, growth is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will begin to increase slightly at the end of the year.
The bank’s latest inflation report gave little reason for joy to households, which were hit by high inflation and quite minor wage increases: according to the bank, the pressure will increase before it falls.
The bank added that the financial policy “cannot prevent” the withdrawal from earnings in the next few years, but expects salaries to “significantly” recover by the end of its three-year forecast.
The economy is also geared to growth as a result of rising demand for British goods, due to the low pound rate, which offsets some of the reduced consumer spending.
The decision was made a year after rates were cut to 0.25% last August after the shocking results of a referendum on leaving the European Union, which led to the fall of the pound.
According to the bank, it will likely take four years to have a full impact on prices and the economy.
Before the bank made its final decision on the rates, the noise around the alleged increase in the rates increased, as inflation increasingly pushed households under and thus under strong pressure: three members of the committee of experts asked to raise the rates to 0.5% in the interest rate.
Last month, inflation fell to 2.6% from 2.9% in July, although, according to the bank, this fall was expected and will be offset again in the coming months.
According to the bank, the higher rate compared to the planned 2% is entirely a result of the low rate of the pound.
Andrew Montlake, director of Mortgage Brokers Correco, said: “If we take into account the recent fall in swap rates, it seems that the mortgage market will once again become even more competitive as the year lenders demand business opportunities and are counting on good.
The market looks particularly favourable to those approaching the end of their existing contracts, as refinancing of loans, often with the possibility of no commission, as well as at a low rate, is becoming more popular than ever.”
The State Health Service will prescribe the controversial drug from HIV 10,000 people
Starting in September, patients will have access to a “revolutionary” drug to prevent HIV after a battle in the High Court on the question of funding the drug from the State Health Service.
The National Health Service of England has announced that pre-exposure prevention of HIV (pre-exposure prophylaxis), a pill taken before sex, which has been shown to reduce the risk of infection in people at risk of a high-risk flight, by an average of 86%, will now be available.
She agreed to fund the trial after the appellate court backed last year’s High Court ruling that the National Health Service had the opportunity to pay for the trial, despite her statements that it should be funded by the authorities.
The move, which was announced on Thursday, was called “the most important innovation” by the president of the National Health Service of England Simon Stevens, and the National Office for the Control of the Spread of AIDS (NAT) called it “a turning point.”
Before the full launch of the program across England by April 2018, venerological dispensers in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to register people, and even more dispensers will join the program in October.
Pre-exposure prevention (pre-exposure prevention) is a course of HIV drugs taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
As studies have shown, PrEP significantly reduces the risk of HIV infection among people at risk.
When taking PrEP before sex in the human body, a sufficient number of certain drugs to prevent infection with HIV infection.
Such drugs can be taken daily or no later than two hours before sex.
Patients entitled to the drug include homosexual and bisexual men, transgender people and people whose partners are HIV-positive and are not receiving successful treatment.
Dispensers will select appropriate participants who have agreed to participate in the study, including men, women, transgender people and individuals whose partners are unknown whether their HIV status is restrained by antiretroviral therapy.
People living and assigned to a general practitioner in England will also be able to apply for potential participation in the nearest venerological dispensary participating in the program.
The program will cost <0xC2><0xA3>10 million, and the National Health Service of England this week after an international procurement tender signed a drug supply contract.
The study was built to assess all the possibilities of PrEP through the collection of clinical data on who is the target audience of the drug, its absorption and its large-scale use.
“This important innovation must complement and intensify the large-scale and increasingly successful efforts aimed at preventing HIV.
This is yet another milestone in more than three decades of success in combating one of the greatest health threats facing humanity. . . .
Deborah Gold, president of NAT, said: “This is a turning point in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, if competently targeting it to people in need of help and at risk, gives an opportunity to change the situation with the HIV epidemic in England.
Starting in September, people who are at risk for HIV, thanks to this study conducted in England at the expense of the National Health Service, will have access to a new opening-up new tool that can be used by a person to control their genitals by themselves without discussing it with their partner.
We warmly welcome this news.”
Ian Green, president of the Terrence Higgins Foundation, said: “Now, first of all, we need to make sure that the test is quickly deployed across the country and that none of the HIV risk group is forgotten.
Now that we’re provided with the experimental drug PrEP, we’re going to protect more than 10,000 people at risk for HIV.”
Shadow Health Minister Sharon Hodgson said: “We very much welcome the start of the PrEP test, it was very late due to months of delays and wires from the government.”
The data demonstrate how revolutionary this drug can become as part of our approach to preventing HIV and stopping the transmission of this perennial infection.
This test will bring us a step closer to fully understanding the benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that the test be deployed as soon as possible across the country to protect those at risk of HIV and to push us forward to a further step towards ending the spread of HIV in society.
World Congress of Tatars Adopts Resolution on Supporting the Treaty of Tatarstan and Russia
The Sixth Congress of the World Congress of Tatars (WCC) adopted a resolution in which noted the importance of maintaining the position of president in Tatarstan.
According to the document, the post is "a positively established form of the organization of the highest state power in the republic and expressing the national interests of the entire Tatar people."
In addition, the congress stressed in the resolution the importance of the treaty on the separation of powers between Russia and Tatarstan.
According to the document, he "played a positive role in the ethnocultural, socio-economic and socio-political development of Tatarstan and the Russian Federation as a whole."
As of July 24, 2007, the treaty between Moscow and Kazan was signed for 10 years.
On July 11, deputies of the Tatarstan State Council asked the President of Russia to renew the agreement and retain the name of the head of the region.
Today, Tatarstan is the only federation that has a treaty with Russia.
The head of the region is the only one whose post is called "president".
In Russia, there are difficulties in obtaining international driver's licenses
The GIBDD units are experiencing a shortage of international driving licences (ICUs).
To get such rights, you have to wait a few weeks in a row, which has become a real problem for vacationers who want to go abroad on their car or rent it there.
It is worth noting that the situation with international driving licences remains contradictory.
The IPU was introduced in order to make it easier for the foreign police to understand what was written in the national certificate, since the information in it is clarified in five languages.
The requirements of international law are enshrined in the 1968 Vienna Convention on Road Traffic, but in countries that have ratified the Vienna Convention, Russian rights are recognized and so on.
However, in fact, it all depends on specific police or rental offices: some require an ICU, and others have enough national rights.
In order to insure, drivers of international law still receive, but it is worth taking into account that in countries that have not ratified the convention (e.g., the United States, Spain, Mexico, Indonesia) the authorities have the right not to recognize either national rights or ICUs.
There is now a problem with forms in almost all units of the GIBDD, reports Kommersant, conducting research in a number of regions.
So, in Moscow, in the units of the UGIBDD, the coupons are simply not issued, the forms are not enough for four months.
You can register for the reception on the website of public services, but there the line has already extended until mid-August.
In Krasnoyarsk, it is impossible to obtain the Ministry of Foreign Affairs "for technical reasons", without going into detail, in the Samarska region honestly say that there are no forms, a similar situation occurs in other cities.
Many Moscowers have already faced the problem, such messages appear more and more often on social networks:
Irina Burmistrov: “Guess why you can’t get international rights in Moscow?”
That's right, because in all the departments of the GIBDD, the forms have ended.
Elena Podkolzina: "A Question to Knowledgeable People!"
We need to get international law urgently.
In Moscow all the time is far ahead, in place the tickets are not issued at all (the button is there, but the ticket can not give).
It seems that the portal of public services shows that in the Spb of free time until Fig.
Did anyone try to get it in another city?
Will it work?
As explained in the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation, the requirements for international driving licences have changed, therefore, the delivery of new forms is carried out in the State Autoinspection units.
This may be related to the deficit, although it is unclear what changes are being made, this has not been reported before.
Blanki purchases the Center for Special Purpose in the Field of Road Traffic Safety (CNSBBD) of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation and then delivers them to the units of the GIBDD.
In recent years all contracts were concluded with JSC "Goznak": in 2014-2015 almost 200,000 forms of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine were produced, in 2016 15 thousand forms were purchased, in 2017 - 90 thousand, but the last contract of the form was concluded on July 18 with JSC "First printed 70".
There is a version that CSN simply did not manage to conduct a tender in time, which caused a deficit.
However, there are other versions of the lack of forms: due to the crisis, many people began to travel independently not to Europe, but to cheaper Asian countries - China, Thailand and so on.
What rights are accepted there, it is unclear to the end, so people are also reinsured, so there is an agitating demand for international “shorts”.
It has recently become known that professional drivers will have to pass the exam to confirm their qualifications.
This is the proposal made by the Ministry of Transport.
The International Driver's License (IDR) of the new model is valid from 31 May 2011.
The Minister of Justice of Ukraine refused to believe in the construction of the Crimean bridge
Ukraine’s Justice Minister Pavel Petrenko said he did not believe in Russia’s ability to build a bridge in Crimea.
On Friday, August 4, he said this in an interview with the Observer portal.
No self-respecting international company will even put a bloc or a hook there, because it risks losing its business on the territory of the EU, the US, Japan – in countries that have joined sanctions against Russia regarding the Crimea.
“That is, in my deep conviction, the prospects for this project are practically absent,” Petrenko said.
He added that he believes Russia is unable to implement a major infrastructure project on its own.
Russia can’t build less-scale facilities as well.
I know that after the Olympics in Sochi, entire stadiums have already begun to be destroyed.
"Therefore, I think the best tool in this situation is sanctions against companies that have been so imperceptible to join this project," the official said.
On July 31, the builders completed the construction of the vault of the car arch of the Crimean Bridge.
On the coast of Kerch, the enlarging assembly of the highway arch of the Crimean Bridge has been completed: its junction will be closed at an altitude of 45 meters from the base of the structure.
"At the same time, the bridge builders prepared for the installation of the railway arch on the stern supports," - said in the information center of the project.
In April, the head of the Ministry of Transport Maxim Sokolov informed the President of Russia Vladimir Putin that the construction of the facility is ahead of schedule.
The Crimean Bridge will connect the Crimean Peninsula and the Krasnodar Region.
In Spain, an official who has not been to work for 10 years has been fired
What angelic patience (or absolute indifference to public service) should the chief of the Spanish official Carles Resio have had?
The permanent walk spanned 10 long years.
However, Mr. Resio was still fired.
But not by his immediate bosses.
What doesn’t happen in the bureaucratic world.
Visitors seem to have long been used to all the jokes of the "servants of the people."
And yet, officials are always able to surprise those on whose taxes they live well.
This time the "sensation" came from Spain.
There, the employee of the archives of Valencia Carles Resio managed to not go to work for a whole ten years.
He received a complaint on a regular basis.
And the whole solid - 50,000 euros a year.
And now Mr. Resio's "wonderful times" are over.
He was fired at the decision of the Valencia legislature.
The investigation revealed that an angry walker came to the office every working morning at 7:00 a.m. to make a note in the electronic system.
And he went home right away.
Once again he appeared at work at 4:00 p.m. to again note in the system that he left.
And so 10 years.
It also became known that all the free time a walker devoted to drawing comics on the house.
Now the deputies of the Valencian legislature are thinking how to punish and the immediate boss of Mr. Resio, who could not help but know how to "actively work" in his workplace.
Judges offer protection from presidents
The Presidential Human Rights Council (HRC) commissioned by Vladimir Putin has developed proposals to strengthen the independence of the judiciary.
The ICC proposes to limit the powers of the chairpersons of the courts and introduce their election.
For the courts of appeal and cassation, the ICTY wants to introduce special districts that will not be tied to administrative and territorial division in the Russian Federation.
Its proposals should also be submitted by the Supreme Court within the framework of the presidential mandate.
The ICTY has completed the development of proposals that will strengthen the independence of Russian justice.
This work was carried out by the ICTY on behalf of Vladimir Putin from January 3, 2017, which the President gave after a meeting with members of the council.
The meeting with the members of the Council on 8 December 2016 discussed, among other things, individual cases of judicial arbitrariness, as well as problems of public control in the places of detention of citizens (see "H" of 9 December).
As a result of the work of the ICC, there were 25 proposals, which concerned both the independence of judges and the detection of judicial errors, as well as the financing of courts and legal education.
One of the ideas of the Kremlin human rights defenders is to limit the powers of the presidents of the courts to increase the independence of the other judges.
If the candidate for the position of a judge has successfully passed the contest and received the support of the judicial community, the chairman of the court, in the opinion of the ICC, must submit him to the appointment, without having the right to refuse, as the law now allows.
It is also proposed to deprive the Chairperson of the right to allocate cases to judges.
To do this, experts allow, a specially written computer program.
Also, the IHR believes that the chairman is not entitled to "pre-determine the results of the qualification certification of the judge, initiate his involvement in disciplinary responsibility, make decisions on the establishment of additional material payments".
At the same time, the Presidential Council considers it necessary to move to “the election of the presidents of the courts by the judges themselves” and “to grant them powers for a relatively short period of time with a mandatory rotation”.
Now all the presidents of the courts (from republican to district) are appointed for six years by the president at the presentation of the President of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation.
In order to protect judges from the pressure of regional administrations, the ICC proposes to reorganize the appeal and cassation in courts of general jurisdiction.
Now their structure is tied to administrative-territorial division in the Russian Federation.
“It is necessary to ensure the organization of individual courts of appeal and cassation not at the level of regional judicial bodies in the subjects of the Russian Federation, but in judicial districts.”
Experts base the practice of arbitral tribunals.
There are “judicial districts” that do not coincide with the administrative division in the Russian Federation, but which guarantee greater independence from regional officials who have difficulty in using the “telephone law”.
The World Court of Justice proposes to strengthen the people’s judges to consider certain “categories of civil and administrative affairs” with their participation.
For example, deprivation of parental rights, rehabilitation at work, protection of honor and dignity, deprivation of driving rights, etc.
“These are just our proposals,” explained the IHR member, a judge of the Constitutional Court in the resignation of Tamar Morshakov.
She also recalled that the president’s mandate was not only for the ICC, but also for the Supreme Court, which has not yet disclosed its proposals.
There is still time for the military (among the co-executors - the Prosecutor General's Office and the Human Rights Commissioner in the Russian Federation) to carry out the assignment.
To inform Vladimir Putin about how effectively the independence of justice is ensured in the Russian Federation, the Chairman of the Armed Forces Vyacheslav Lebedev should by September 1.
Living High Life: Half-floor and clever design techniques have turned this small apartment in Earls Court into a spacious home
Joan Lee, a former banker passionate about real estate repairs, moved from a spacious house in Knightsbridge to an apartment in Earls Court in 2014.
The apartment is on the ground floor of a nice typical house in the style of Queen Anne, and in favor of the new design says that Joan did not collect her things and did not move again.
“I used to live with my ex in Nightsbridge on a much larger area,” Joan says.
“I was looking for something comparable for my money.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and it had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and offered her a price the same day.”
Since the first inspection, the apartment with an area of 1000 square feet has undergone a complete reconstruction.
Originally it was a one-bedroom apartment with a complicated layout – to get into the bedroom, it was necessary to go through the kitchen – and Joanna wanted to add storage space and a half-floor to squeeze the most out of the generous height of the ceilings.
“I wanted high ceilings, big windows, a lot of light.
Those were my demands,” she said.
To this end, she hired Erfan Azadi from the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed in Notting Hill to use the 12.5-foot-high ceilings to create a home that would not only be a successful project, but would fit Joan for life.
The ceiling was not high enough to accommodate two rooms one above the other, so the architectural task was to create a half-floor where it could stand in full growth.
Erfan had to think creatively in order to cope with the letter.
“Working with steel structures is very difficult,” he explains.
“We needed to arrange the premises so that they were on top of each other, and we didn’t have to bend.
It was not just necessary to build a simple platform, but to bend the structures so that they were at the right height and allowed to use the premises from above and below.”
This decision allowed Erfan to arrange two full-size rooms over each other in a space reserved – and a lot more interesting.
From the half-floor through the vintage copper light window from "Retrouvius" opens the view of the chic living room below.
Mirror furniture with a gold finish, silver accents and vintage lighting fixtures from Serge Muja set the style of the project.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding spectacle, space and light.
The short corridor is framed by mirrors to make it look longer.
In the kitchen, the mirror protection panel looks like a window to another room.
At the entrance, mirror cabinets are used to store all Joan's dishes.
To create a feeling of a more luxurious space, the beauty of the living room can encircle the kitchen when it is not used.
There's nothing new in the folding kitchen.
The uniqueness of this kitchen is that it is a sliding door like a garage.
“Engineering art was involved here,” Erfan will tell about the reinforced steel wood-fibre shield door.
“It’s equipped with a counterweight, so when you push the door up, it’s very easy to slide.”
Thanks to the reasonable use of space and storage space, Joan received an additional 16 square meters, an additional bedroom, and an improved layout.
“In the end, the floor area is exactly what you’re going to sell, that’s what your property is valued for,” Erfan says.
“Roughly speaking, a real estate agent will come in and make calculations based on the floor area.”
Here they were able to increase the area of the floors, using quality materials that give the space shades of luxury.
“Materials are what we touch, so they help create an emotional connection with the home,” says Erfan.
“No one likes wiring in the walls.
It’s important, but it doesn’t touch the strings of our hearts.”
This is a testament to the fact that due to a good design and an increased meter, an apartment can turn from something ordinary into something amazing.
In fact, like Joan, you can choose to stay.
The Government approved the establishment of a commission on cultural policy
The Russian government has approved the creation of a commission on state cultural policy.
The relevant decision has been published on the Government's website.
According to the document, the main task of the commission will be the development and adjustment of strategic approaches to the implementation of cultural policy.
The Commission will also develop draft cultural policy strategy, clarify the tasks and prepare new programmes for its implementation.
The Head of the Commission is appointed Vice-President of the Government of the Russian Federation.
The composition of the Commission will be approved separately.
The Prime Minister of the Russian Federation Dmitry Medvedev in 2016 approved the plan of implementation of the strategy of state cultural policy until 2030.
The plan includes 193 events and provides for measures to expand the influence of Russian culture in other countries, preserve a unified cultural space and cultural heritage, it will also contribute to the creation of conditions for the development of culture in the country.
Inflation in the G20 countries fell to an eight-year low
Consumer prices in the G20 countries have fallen to a minimum in the last eight years, according to the Wall Street Journal, citing data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
According to OECD estimates, inflation rates in June 2016 were 2% - lower values were noted in October 2009, when the price growth index reached 1.7%.
Earlier, Rosstat reported a decrease in the consumer price index by 0.1% in Russia.
Thus, the agency recorded the first weekly deflation in 2017.
The inflation target in Russia, according to the Ministry of Finance, is 4.1%.
The Ministry of Economy, however, believes that the target value has already been reached - according to this department, the figure is 4%.
Putin Warns of Illegal Cutting of Bicycle Taiga
Russian leader Vladimir Putin during the meeting on the ecological development of the natural biking territory warned of the illegal destruction of forests.
During the event, the Minister of Natural Resources Sergei Donskoy noted that the bill was prepared earlier.
It permits deforestation during the elimination of fires, and the government plans to adopt it already in the autumn.
In turn, the president said that this project must be monitored so that in the process of cutting "not everything in a row is cut off".
Donskoy noted that this bill involves control by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and supervisory agencies.
Media: U.S. fighters secretly from the command are negotiating with the militias of Donbass
On the line of armed confrontation in the Donbass, regular telephone communication has been established.
Fighters of the opposing parties are constantly communicating with each other on mobile phones, and they do not know about this communication in the headquarters.
The soldiers of the Armed Forces and the soldiers of the Donbass have secretly communicated on mobile phones from their high command.
This was reported on August 4 by Strana.ua with reference to the participants of the military operation in the Donbass.
According to the publication, the commanders of the units know the names of their colleagues on the opposite side of the front and communicate with them daily by phone.
The communication is not at all domestic: the commanders are trying to reach some “tactical agreements”.
Often, the result of such talks is a truce on a certain part of the front.
Journalists became aware of the cases when congratulations on the birthday of this or that officer because of the line of the front, from his formal enemy.
The soldiers and militias of the DPR and LPR have been sitting in the trenches on the line of separation since the spring of 2014, when Ukraine began a combat operation against Donbass.
The Foreign Ministry outraged the blocking of statements of the UN Security Council on attacks on the Embassy of the Russian Federation
The Russian Foreign Ministry is outraged by the actions of some Western diplomatic representatives, who block the statements of the UN Security Council in the press condemning the terrorist shelling of the Russian embassy in Syria.
This is reported by the Russian Foreign Ministry.
The ministry recalled that the territory of the Russian Embassy in Damascus on August 2 was subjected to a mortar shelling by terrorist groups “Hayat Tahrir Ash-Sham” (former “Rh<0xC3><0xA2>n R<0xC3><0xA2>m<0xC3><0xA2>nh<0xC3><0xA2>n-Nusra”.
Taking into account that the international community unanimously qualified Nusra as a terrorist organization, and the UN Security Council resolutions call for counteracting this structure, the Russian Foreign Ministry noted that "it would seem that it would be quite counterproductive to the contrary."
However, as the Foreign Ministry pointed out, the text of the report of the Russian Foreign Ministry is a copy of the document “for the third time in a month the diplomatic representatives of the United States, the United Kingdom, France and Ukraine in the UN Security Council”, in turn, varying the tone of the objections, hiding the evidence of the alleged lack of necessary information.
Let the reluctance to show diplomatic solidarity with us remain on the conscience of these delegations.
"The most disturbing thing is that the inability of the Security Council to condemn the acts of terrorists encourages them to new provocations and attacks, makes them feel impunity," the Foreign Ministry said, adding that the Snobs "wouldn't want these barbarians to be humiliated.
Vladimir Putin advocates limiting the number of unplanned business checks
Russian President Vladimir Putin said during a meeting on investment projects in the Far East that the number of unplanned checks of entrepreneurs should be reduced to 30% of the number of planned, and also said the need to limit the time of inspections to ten days.
"Unplanned checks are usually carried out without appropriate agreement with the prosecutor's office; only 2-3% is agreed with the prosecutor's office, everything else goes on its own," the president said.
Vladimir Putin also said that it is necessary to ban investigators from removing servers and hard drives at enterprises.
In addition, in the President’s view, business associations should have the right to defend the interests of their members in court.
"This, I hope, will bring a certain positive in the consideration of cases related to entrepreneurial activity, or related to violation of the law in the field of entrepreneurship," - said the head of state.
As reported by "I", due to the action of the moratorium on the carrying out of planned inspections, the number of other types of inspections of entrepreneurs is increasing.
In May, according to the order of the business ombudsman under the President of Russia Boris Titov, 5% was conducted a survey, resulting in which it was found that in fact there was a replacement of the planned checks with non-planned (the share of the respondents with them), increased from 21.9% in 2015 to 30.8% in 2016, prosecutors.

The brothers are fighting for the real estate empire worth more than $500 million.
The two brothers fight for one of Victoria's largest empires in real estate trade worth more than $500 million - forty years after their Italian ancestors founded the dynasty.
Former football club director Carlton and developer Colin de Lut<0xC3><0xAD>s lives in Turac Palace through three doors from his younger brother Paul, who filed a lawsuit against him in the Supreme Court over the division of property and assets.
Paul wants to leave the family business since 2014, but the Supreme Court is still in a fierce dispute over the terms of the divorce.
Together with their mother Anna, the brothers own 87 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, purchased since their family bought a shop on Smith Street in Collingwood in 1973.
There, the family founded Westco Jeans, which grew into a network of 160 outlets.
It was sold in 1999 for $85 million.
The money was invested in real estate, and the De Lut<0xC3><0xAD>s family's property list today includes office buildings, plots under construction in Brunswick and Sorrento, apartments on the Gold Coast and in Mount Buller, and shopping malls in the suburbs.
In agreement with Colin's late father, whom Paul describes as the "main driving force and dominant personality" of the De Lute family, he owns about two-thirds of the company's assets, and Paul owns about one-third.
According to the court, this means that Colin's property is 316 million and Paul's is 176 million.
The division of wealth and money became a stumbling block for Paul.
“The division proposed by Colin gives him, in my opinion, the best parts of the property,” he wrote in his first testimony in 2015.
Last Friday, after several unsuccessful attempts at reconciliation, the first hearings in the Supreme Court took place.
The brothers are now arguing about who will control the existing business - from which, in Paul's opinion, Colin excluded it.
Colin argues that this is not the case, but accuses Paul of incompetent management of some objects.
In testimony given by Colin at the beginning of the trial, he says he hopes to resolve the dispute.
“My Italian roots make me think of family as a top priority,” he wrote.
Trial costs are rising like a snowball: hundreds of pages of statements, emails, and reports from companies such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer have been added to the case; both sides have attracted the best-known lawyers, including Royal Counsel Allan Myers and Allan Myers.
Mrs. De Luigi and her late husband Luigi were immigrants from Italy; from the late 1950s they ran dairy bars and caterers, and in the early 1970s they bought a store in Brunswick.
Under financial guarantees, they bought a store in Collingwood, where Colin opened the first family jeans store.
Colin says he launched Westco when he was "in the last grades of school, and Paul was a boy at the time (about 10 years)".
Anna De Luytis says they and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to hand over their possessions to their sons without conflict.
“Luigi has often told me that he doesn’t want the brothers to get along in court,” she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lute group of companies; Colin says Mark received 10 million when he left the business, and Luke 26 million.
According to Paul, both Luke and Mark were “dissatisfied with the financial conditions of their office.”
Colin was not a public figure, although he was a former member of the AFL board of directors and, according to the 2015 biography of Eddie McGuire, the best friend of the TV star.
Farfax Media contacted Colin and Paul and their lawyers on Friday.
Only Colin replied with a text message saying that since the case had not yet been heard in court, “I really don’t have anything to say.”
“I am very, very sorry that my brother Paul has decided to file a lawsuit against me and shake the name of our family in court,” he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in testimony that he was trying to satisfy his brother’s demands.
“Our father wouldn’t want to see Paul and me arguing in court,” he said, adding that “he still hopes to resolve the conflict.”
On Friday, that hope seems to have dissipated.
“The decision on our case will soon be made by the court,” Colin wrote.
The new head of the Trump apparatus is planning to restrict the access of information to the president.
Others tried to do it and suffered defeat.
Maybe John F. Kelly's really gonna make it.
In that case, he will be the first.
Politico reports that the new White House chief of staff plans to limit the flow of information coming to President Trump, including news reports from the media, in hopes of keeping the chief in a more calm state.
This is reported by reporter Josh Dowsie.
“At a meeting held by the new head of the White House apparatus John F. Kelly with the management of the apparatus on his first working day, he pointed out the main problem in the White House under President Donald Trump, which he hopes to solve: the bad channels to the President.”
Kelly told employees that information should go through him — in paper form or through briefings — because the president would be better off making decisions if he got the right information.
Kelly’s diagnosis is perfectly accurate, but others have already failed in trying to reassure Trump by tracking the information coming to him.
President Trump’s relationship with television came a few decades ago – and now that he’s in the White House, his habit of watching TV is still strong.
“When Trump, as a candidate, was outraged by the unfair campaign lighting, it was helpful to show him that he had received fair lighting in publications that could be reassured,” Sam Nanberg, a former Electoral Advisor, told Politico in February.
Tara Palmeri wrote at the time in Politico that “according to six former members of the constituency, to keep Trump’s Twittering habit under control, it was necessary to ensure that there was a steady flow of praise in the information that came to him personally.”
Oh, good.
But the idea that Trump’s habit of tweeting has ever been “under control” is just ridiculous.
Perhaps these members of the constituency know something we don’t know – for example, that if it wasn’t for them, Trump’s tweets would be even more provocative.
We may never find out about tweets that Trump has not posted.
If his staff saved him from trouble at least several times, their efforts were not in vain.
But no one ever managed to keep Trump from pouring oil into the fire.
Part of the problem is that in the White House, divided into rival factions, people are constantly trying to advance their agenda by submitting to Trump material — reliable or not — that confirms their views.
"Politico" - precisely to this story - wrote in May about the tendency of advisers to constantly confuse the president with dubious information.
Here is an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
“Trump’s current and former staff say that Trump can react very sharply to negative press reports, especially containing dangerous leaks of information, and will not calm down until he finds out who was behind them.
That was the case in late February, when someone sent the president a printout of an article from GotNews.com, the website of provocateur Charles K. Johnson, in which the deputy chief of staff Katie Welsh was accused of being "behind a series of leaks" in Behemoth.
It doesn’t matter that Johnson is permanently banned from Twitter for aggressive behavior, that he didn’t present any specific facts, or that he has made false accusations in the past and then turned them down.
Trump read the article and began to ask employees about Welsh.
Goldmacher adds that the then head of the apparatus, Raines Pribus, and the secretary of the apparatus, Rob Porter, were “trying to build a system to manage the flow of papers that Trump receives and document them.”
How did that work?
Three months later, Kelly tries to do the same.
He may be a more effective manager than Pribus, but Trump still has a impulsive nature, and his aides are still fighting each other for influence.
These constant factors make Kelly's task very difficult.
Tyumen Prosecutor’s Office Fights HIV Dissident
The prosecutor’s office has challenged the ruling of the Kalinin district court of Tyumen, which terminated the criminal case against a local resident whose young daughter died of HIV.
According to the investigation, the child died because the mother was an HIV dissident and refused treatment.
However, the court exempted her from liability in connection with the reconciliation with the victim's father.
The prosecution believes that a crime cannot be left unpunished in order not to create a precedent for other HIV dissidents.
The case against a resident of Tyumen was initiated at 1 a.m. of Article 109 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (cause of death by negligence) in April - after her three-year-old daughter died of HIV infection in stage 4B.
According to the prosecutor's office, the mother herself is HIV-infected.
"The woman was not treated alone and refused to treat the daughter, believing that HIV infection does not exist," the prosecutor's office of the Tyumen region explained.
The criminal case came to the Kalinin district court of Tyumen, which on 25 July decided to terminate it.
The father of the deceased girl filed an application for this, explaining that he "forgived his wife, has no complaints to her, she has smoothed the damage and apologized."
The Prosecutor ' s Office disagreed with the court ' s decision and appealed, demanding that the decision to terminate the case be revoked and re-examined.
The girl died, and it is impossible to smooth out the damage caused by the crime.
The HIV-infected mother, contrary to the recommendations of doctors, refused to examine the baby and treat her from a dangerous infection,” the prosecutor’s office said in a statement.
In the opinion of the supervisory authority, it must be punished, otherwise it will be followed by other HIV dissidents.
As told in the Tumenian AIDS Center, now in the Tyumen region about 12 children, who have HIV, do not receive medical care because of the refusal of parents.
"And this situation has already improved - in a year of work of the special group, half of the parents who categorically refused to treat children with HIV, changed their opinion - allowed to make a diagnosis, began to take drugs," - said the press secretary of the AIDS Center Elena Loseva.
According to her, the legislative way to influence parents is impossible, and as a result not all HIV-infected children are able to detect - mothers do not allow them to be examined, hide, run away with children from hospitals.
What are the dangers of HIV dissidents?
At the end of last year, St. Petersburg sociologists presented the results of Russia’s first study of the so-called HIV dissident movement.
HIV dissidents are people who deny the existence of HIV and refuse to take medication.
Doctors and activists of AIDS service NGOs call such views anti-medical, and in their dissemination they see a serious threat.
The ugly photo shoot, which ended in tragedy, took place on Thursday, August 3, at Grechana railway station in Khmelnitsk.
A fun company of suffocating young people strolled over a bridge over the railroads, where a freight train was just standing.
One of the friends had the idea to make a spectacular selfie on the roof of the wagon, reported "FACTAM" in the police communication sector in Khmelnytsky region.
The guy started to get off the bridge on the train, but due to his recklessness stuck behind the power line and immediately received a stroke of electricity.
Luckily, the station manager became aware of this case, which immediately called an "emergency".
Before the arrival of the doctors of the victim were moved to a safe place, and then hospitalized in the burn department of Khmelnytsky regional clinical hospital.
In men, burns of the body were diagnosed by 1<0xE2><0x88><0x92>2 degrees.
Now his condition is assessed by doctors as stable.
Law enforcement officials are reminding that lately, extreme selfies on multi-storey roofs, bridges, moving vehicles are becoming increasingly popular.
The police are urging people to be vigilant and not to allow such photo shoots, especially among children and adolescents.
Scientists have discovered the existence of oceans on ancient Venus
There may have been oceans on ancient Venus.
This is what the French scientists have suggested.
Experts have created a computer model that demonstrates the process of water formation on the surface of planets, writes Science News.
It turned out that at the beginning of its history, on Venus formed oceans, in which there was 10% more water than now on Earth.
Previously, "Arguments of the Week" wrote that, according to scientists' hypothesis, the ocean could have existed on Mars 4 billion years ago.
In the course of their research, foreign experts concluded that the water object was located in the northern hemisphere of the Red Planet.

The group is preparing a conceptual show, which will be the brightest in the band’s concert history.
"Wonderful New World" is the fourth album by Russian rock band Louna.
Its name is related to the famous anti-utopia novel by O. Huxley "On a Strange New World".

To raise money for the recording of the album the group helped listeners: on the site "Planet.ru" the project was supported by more than 1200 people.
Her first album, "Make a Throat!" was released by Louna in 2010.
Two years later, the musicians presented the album "Time X", and in 2013 recorded the album "We are Louna" (2013).
In the autumn of 2015, Louna performed with a symphonic orchestra in Crocus City Hall with the program Songs of the World.

The group has won several times in different nominations of the hit parade "Chertova Duzina".
The gypsies crossed the trench and returned to the “street of millionaires”
Some of West Midland’s wealthiest homeowners once again clash with the resolute Gypsies, who have overcome the excavated by the municipal authorities to retake the field next to their homes.
The gypsies parked 20 houses on wheels in a field bordering the rich Solihalla street, nicknamed “the street of millionaires.”
Bringing with them horses, babies, and many houses on wheels, they returned after being driven away no further than in May, and were not prevented by a trench dug by the municipal authorities to prevent their invasion.
This tactical company found a gap in the defensive structures and pushed its vehicles through a site that was left unenclosed to leave a place for the trail.
Angry residents attacked the municipality of Solihalla, saying that he was “unable to solve this problem.”
An anonymous local resident said: “They came here on Monday evening after being kicked out of Bentley Heath, where they threw stones at passers-by.”
The municipality should be ashamed and made to act, because they are completely incapable of solving this problem.
The gypsies were here in May, they were expelled, and here they are again.
Last night, there were more gypsies, and today, maybe even more.
“The municipality of Birmingham knows how to solve this problem, they get long-term court orders to protect their parks,” she added.
I live on Stratsbrook Road, and I don’t like that I continue to pay municipal taxes, and the municipality can’t even put an end to that.”
One local resident, who wished to remain anonymous, said: “It’s funny, we just saw these gypsies leave the last time, and here, please, this attack continues.”
This time there were more of them, and we even saw a horse grazing on the meadow.”
A Solihalla municipality representative said: “We know about the illegal camp on the ground near Strasbourg Road and we are cooperating with Solihalla police; we are taking the necessary legal action to expel them as soon as possible.”
To help us gather evidence, it is very important that as many locals as possible report any anti-social or criminal behavior to the police by phone 101.
This allows us to create an idea of the situation that the court will consider when we present our case to them.
Crimea shares champagne wine factory "Novay Svet"
The GUP of the Republic of Crimea "Champagne Wine Plant "Noviy Svet"" has decided to act, transforming into OAO "Champagne Wine Plant "Noviy Svet"", follows the order of the Minister of Property and Land Relations of Crimea Anna Anyuhina.
100% of the company’s shares will remain in the state property of Crimea.
The share capital of the company will be 595,5 million rubles and will consist of 5,955 million ordinary shares with a nominal value of 100 rubles each.
The Ministry of Agriculture of the Crimea stated that if within the next three years there are no funds for the modernization of the enterprise, then there will be a threat of stoppage of the plant.
The export of basic funds at the enterprise is about 60-70%.
The modernization of the enterprise requires 1.2 billion rubles. Due to the peculiarities of the organizational and legal form, it is obliged to give 50% of the profit in the income of the budget.
What remains is not enough for the implementation of the modernization plan.
"Getting money from the owner is problematic, talking about attracting borrowing funds of large credit organizations is difficult," said Deputy Head of the Crimean Ministry Sergey Petelin in April of this year.
The Crimean Parliament included the enterprise in the forecast privatization plan for 2017.
It was proposed to hold its stock and put on the market.
The Interfax source in the Crimean authorities estimated the possible value of the sale of the enterprise at $40 million, investment of the investor in the modernization - another $30 million.
In 2016, "New World" increased the production of sparkling wines by 2.8% compared to the level of 2015 - to 1.52 million bottles.
In 2017, "New Light" intended to produce 1.6 million bottles.
The company was founded in 1878 by Prince Lviv Golitsin as a factory for the production of sparkling wine in the name he acquired Novy Svet.
The plant is located on 11 hectares of land.
Nizhny Novgorod Third-Classers Destroyed More Than 40 Tombs
Officials of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Nizhny Novgorod region established the identities of citizens who destroyed 46 graves on the cemetery of the city of Lyskovo.
The attackers were third-class pupils.
The first statement that the gravestones were damaged by unknown, came to the OMVD of Russia in the Lyskovsky district on June 27.
In total, 24 people have contacted the police.
As a result, a criminal case was initiated under article 244 of the Russian Civil Code "Destruction, damage or contamination of burial sites".
According to the results of the investigation, the police identified the suspects, they were two schoolchildren aged 8 and 9.
The juvenile offenders told the police that they were interested to see how the monuments fell, and this prompted them to hooligan actions.
Preventive measures have been carried out with children and their parents.
Italy is tightening its tonnage towards NGO ships rescuing migrants.
Italy has warned NGOs owned by rescue vessels in the Mediterranean that they will not be able to continue their work unless they are subject to new rules regulating their activities.
“If NGOs do not comply with the new code of conduct, it is difficult to say whether they will be able to continue their activities,” Interior Minister Mario Minniti said in an interview with the Turkish daily newspaper Stampa.
Minniti’s warning came the day after Italian authorities seized a ship belonging to the German humanitarian organization Jugend Rettet, on suspicion that its crew was actually cooperating with human traffickers and facilitating illegal immigration.
The humanitarian organization, which worked for a year, declined to comment on the substance of the detailed accusations made against it by Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
“Saving human life is and will remain a top priority for us, so we are very sorry that we cannot continue to operate in the search and rescue zone right now,” the organization said in a statement.
“We will be able to assess all the allegations made now, only after we have gathered all the information and are able to assess the situation.”
The Italian authorities have been monitoring the Juventa ship belonging to Jugend Rettet since October.
His crew is suspected of having taken on board entire lifeboats of migrants sent directly to them by human traffickers, and allowed the smugglers to leave along with the boats that they could use again.
At least one such meeting is thought to have taken place just 1.3 miles from the Libyan coast, according to the indictment, the content of which was published in Italian media.
The crew is suspected of violating the regulations of the Italian coastal authorities, which control rescue operations in the area, rather out of humanitarian zeal than for any other reason.
The Code of Conduct assumes, primarily, that Juventus vessels will have an Italian police officer on board who will monitor their activities.
So far, only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have agreed to comply with the Code: “Save the Children”, the Maltese MOAS and “Pro-Activa Dispersed Embraces” from Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that it considers the new rules unnecessary, but acceptable, provided they do not involve any "significant changes or disruptions" to its rescue operations.
Among those who refused to sign was the Nobel Prize-winning Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Meanwhile, Minniti said that a sharp drop in the number of migrants arriving in Italy as a result of rescue operations in recent weeks indicates that efforts to support Libya’s coast guard and cooperation with local mayors are fruitful.
“In the last few days we started to see the light at the end of the tunnel,” the minister said.
He reported on plans for further negotiations with Libyan mayors on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in hopes of reaching Europe.
“In Libya, we don’t want to associate with either side of the conflict.”
The Russian authorities have recently significantly intensified their policy in the Libyan direction, and with visits to Moscow, delegations of the opposing Libyan parties participated.
The head of the Russian contact group on intra-Libyan settlement under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation and the State Duma, the assistant of the head of the Chechen Republic, Lev Dengov told “U”, what goals Moscow is pursuing in this region and who is betting on.
About the contact group on Libya, which you are in charge of, almost nothing is known.
Here, let's say, the contact group on Ukraine - everyone knows about it.
And here's the secret curtain.
What exactly are you doing, what goals are you pursuing?
The contact group was established on the initiative of the Russian Foreign Ministry and the State Duma.
Its activities are curated by the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Mikhail Bogdanov and Adam Delimkhanov (Deputy Duma from Chechnya. - "I").
The latter is authorized to work in the Libyan direction by the speaker of the State Duma Vyacheslav Volodymyr.
The impetus for the formation of the group was the detention in Libya of the Russian tanker "Mechanik Chebotarev" (in September 2015, there were 11 people on board. - "I").
We've been thinking about how to help the crew.
At that time a contact group of military specialists, representatives of the State Duma, was established, our work was supported by the head of Chechnya Ramzan Kadyrov.
How did you come to be the one who led her?
Since I have been working in Libya since 2008, I was approached with a proposal to lead the work of the group.
Our activity was not limited to the release of sailors from the "Mechanics of Chebotarev".
We were able to establish contacts with the representatives of all the main groups facing each other in the Libyan conflict - both from Tripoli (where the UN-recognized government is based with Faizo Sarajem. - Lietuvi - <0xD0><0x9A><0xD0><0xBE><0xD1><0x81><0xD1><0x82><0xD0><0xB0><0xD1><0x82><0xD0><0xBE><0xD0><0xB2><0xD0><0xB8><0xD1><0x82><0xD0><0xB8><0xD0><0xB5> - "<0xD0><0x92><0xD0><0xBA><0xD0><0xBE><0xD1><0x82><0xD0><0xBE><0xD1><0x82><0xD0><0xBE><0xD1><0x82><0xD0><0xBA><0xD0><0xBA><0xD0><0xBE><0xD0><0xBA><0xD0><0xBA><0xD0><0xBA><0xD0><0xBA><0xD0><0xBA><0xD0><0xBA>"), and with Tobruk (the residence of parliament).
Thanks to the active participation of Ahmed Metig (Vice-Prime Minister of Libya - "I"), we were able to quickly agree on the release of Russian sailors.
It was then that it was decided to use these contacts more effectively, to create a contact group.
Its task is to analyze the situation, identify key factors and players, dialogue with all parties to the conflict.
I would like to stress in particular that in Libya we do not want to associate with either side of the conflict, we have a dialogue with everyone.
How many people are in the contact group and how many of them are permanently in Libya?
There are currently five people in the contact group.
Among them are people who have experience working in force structures, including in the Ministry of Defense.
We also want to include in the group of specialists on the region, representatives of the Institute of the Middle East of RAN.
There is no permanent presence of any of our staff in Libya, so far there is no need.
Are there any Russian military advisers or instructors in Libya now?
And if so, on whose side?
There are no Russian military specialists in Libya.
Not all conversations and publications about this are true.
But your contact group includes ex-military...
Yes, and their presence is necessary.
For example, when we visit hot spots.
Or cities closed to us until a certain point, like Misurata (where militia units are based, which played a role in the 2011 overthrow of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi and have significantly intensified in subsequent years.
We arrived in Misurata in January of this year.
We were scared, we were told that there were all Islamists, terrorists.
But it was important for us to assess the situation there, to analyze the real military potential, who is responsible for what, why are there such rumors, what is the role of Islamists there in reality.
In Misurata we met with all the representatives of the detachments that were engaged in the destruction of ISIS in Sirte (in December 2016 this town on the Mediterranean coast was sacked by the militants of the banned in Russia "Islamic State" - "I").
We wanted to look at them, get to know these people, check the information that they played a crucial role in the destruction of ISIS in Libya, not Khalifa Haftar, who attributed these merits to himself.
And what conclusion did you come to?
Is the Islamic State in Libya not defeated by Haftar?
That's not what he was doing.
Haftar conducted operations on another front, in Benghazi.
And ISIS in Sirte was fought by the structures that were subordinate to the government in Tripoli.
And, by the way, we invited to Russia the people who carried out this anti-terrorist operation.
And they arrived - the visit lasted from 19 to 23 April of this year, the Libyan delegation was welcomed in the Council of the Federation, in the Duma, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Rosgardia.
You, as we have understood, are in all Libyan regions and you probably imagine the mood of local elites and field commanders.
Do you think it will be possible to implement the ceasefire agreements, the elections reached at the end of July in Paris by Khalifa Haftar and Faiz Saraj?
Or again, as has happened many times in the past, the agreements will be broken, the fighting will resume, the parties will try to take power on their own?
For us, a good signal has already been the fact that Saraj and Haftar have agreed to another meeting, not so long ago it was impossible.
In the recent past, the two leaders have reacted extremely negatively to each other.
As for Russia’s position...
It is often written and said that Moscow actively supports Haftar, many believe it.
We faced this situation when we were in Misurata, and it was on that day Haftar got aboard the Russian aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov.
It was a coincidence.
But in Misurata they did not believe by coincidence.
We were told, "You must be very brave people who came to us today."
But our task is precisely to show that we do not only support Haftar, we are in dialogue with all the key actors in the conflict in Libya.
You and Haftar were in touch.
Does the understanding with Russian partners at the human, emotional level facilitate the fact that he studied twice in the USSR?
And, by the way, does Haftar know the Russian language?
Russian, if he knows, is very relative.
But what he learned from us, of course, facilitates the dialogue with him.
And not just with him, by the way.
When we communicate with the military in Tripoli and Misurata, we meet generals who have studied either in Russia or in the Soviet Union.
And that’s why they speak Russian very well.
And they are drawn to Russia, to some extent they are nostalgic about it.
Do you consider the immediate abolition of the arms embargo against Libya possible?
Are your Libyan interlocutors interested in the supply of Russian weapons?
They are interested, of course, but as I said before, we are not taking sides in this conflict and would not want to arm one another to the detriment of another.
We would like everyone to be in roughly equal positions.
As for the arms embargo, there are constantly calls from the Libyans for Russia to somehow contribute to its withdrawal.
The process of drafting the constitution is now being actively promoted in Libya.
We hope that the parties will come up with compromises and reach an internal consensus.
Then the elections will be held, as mentioned at the meeting between Saraj and Haftar.
If elections are held and a legitimate authority is finally elected (and now neither party has such a status), then the question of lifting the arms embargo can be put in the UN Council.
To raise this issue now is pointless and dangerous, it will only lead to an escalation of the conflict.
In recent days, the media reported that Italy, faced with the problem of African refugees floating from Libya, feels left to chance by allies from the EU.
Can Moscow in this situation help the Italian partners by using its links with the Libyans?
How realistic, for example, is the option that Haftar’s forces will establish control over the coast and put an end to the business of smugglers smuggling migrants to Europe?
Very timely question.
We are actively working on this.
The Italians need the support of Russia, because Moscow has a dialogue with both Haftar and Sarajevo and Misurata and the south of the country.
And in this issue, the tribes in southern Libya play a major role, and they are ready to cooperate with Russia.
Is it a matter of the south intersecting the flows of migrants on long-distance approaches?
So, conditionally speaking, did the buses turn back, which are going to Nigerian migrants?
That's what we're doing.
But it's not easy.
Some clans and groups are interested in keeping these flows going on.
We hope to help unite the South in the negotiation process between Sarajevo, Haftar and the tribes in the south.
But first, we would like to see the unity of opinion on this issue between Haftar and Sarajevo.
The head of government in Tripoli, Faiz Saraj, is considered an Islamist, a supporter of the introduction of Sharia norms in the country.
How radically does he think?
Wouldn’t that be an obstacle to building relations with Russia or the West?
I will express my personal opinion of him.
In my opinion, he is, on the contrary, an opponent of radical Islam.
But there are Islamists in his coalition.
Yes, but he himself holds the position that Libya should be an absolutely normal country – a moderately Islamic, open world.
He is also actively fighting terrorists.
Why does he have such a reputation?
It was created by those countries that are not interested in having Russia communicate with Tripoli.
After all, Tripoli is the capital, there is legislative, executive and judicial power.
There is a national oil corporation, a national bank and other state structures.
Of course, some countries were interested in making sure we didn’t get there.
And we mixed all their cards and started to actively communicate with both Tripoli and Tobruk.
And we are already reaping the fruits of this work: Rosneft has concluded an agreement on cooperation with the state oil company of Libya - NOC.
Director of NOC Mustafa Sanalla, with whom Rosneft’s head Igor Sechin made a deal, himself directly from Tripoli.
And two weeks ago there was the first shipment of Libyan oil by Rosneft.
What will Russia do with it?
I guess I'll resell it.
What other economic interests does Russia have in Libya?
It plans to re-sign the contracts concluded with Muammar Gaddafi.
These include, in particular, previous agreements in the field of transport (railway construction), energy (electrification) and a number of others.
Do Libyans have anything to pay?
Well, they have oil.
So, as in the case of Iran, is it a “oil in exchange for services” scheme?
I do not know what the scheme will be, I do not deal directly with these issues.
In fact, the economy for Russia in Libya is not important.
We are, in fact, engaged in peacekeeping work.
The main thing for us is to stop the bloodshed, help the Libyans to agree among themselves so that they can establish order and Libya has ceased to be a favorable environment for the development of terrorism.
For Russia, this is the main task – to help the Libyan people and to expel the terrorists from there.
Do you have any information about the presence in Libya (now or before) of radical militants from Russia or other countries of the former USSR?
One of the tasks of our contact group was to find out.
I met with a representative of the Libyan State Security Committee, who said that to date no one from Russia and other countries of the former USSR is there.
He said that he has about 50,000 records of phone calls from representatives of Islamist and radical groups (in Libya. - "U") and Russian speech does not sound there.
Which country are these fighters from?
I would not like to go into these details.
Then we formulate the question differently.
How many of the Islamist militants in Libya are the Libyans themselves?
There are almost no Libyans among them, they are no more than 5%.
The rest are aliens.
Can Moscow hold intra-Libyan negotiations on the example of Paris?
There are such plans.
We are actively negotiating with the Libyans, several delegations from Libya have already visited Moscow, and have said they are ready to come again - to Moscow or to the Terrible.
When can such negotiations take place?
It's hard to say now.
Several more visits are yet to be made, and then I hope there will be clarity about the time and place of negotiations.
In the Czech Museum, charities raised money for a expensive gift to a sick boy
In the pre-Moscow museum-reservation "Melihovo" nine-year-old boy Sasha Matsola, whose DCP, hydrocephaly of the brain and complete blindness, will receive a specialized runway as a gift on August 5.
A useful gift is presented by the Minister of Culture of the Moscow region Oksana Kosareva and the director of the museum Konstantin Bobkov.
The money for the trainer was collected during the charity marathon “Don’t get tired of doing good”, which took place in Melihovo on July 15 on Chekhov’s Memorial Day.
On the eve of the marathon at the museum, Sashi, who lives in the village of Manushkino Chekhov district, received a letter: "I have no eyes at all, so I asked my mother to write this letter."
“I’d love to get a runway as a gift so that my legs are strong, and I’d learn to walk a little bit.”
Sasha's dream came true!
After the presentation in the museum-conservatory will be held "Concert-postscript" - a well-known pianist, the well-deserved artist of Russia Alexander Gindin will perform popurri from popular classical works.
During the charity marathon in Melihovo performed the Choir of the David Desert, the bells of the workshop of Ilya Drozdichina, students of the Moscow Conservatory named after P.I. Tchaikovsky and the Russian Academy of Gnesini, artists of the Melihovsky Theatre.
Auctions were held for visitors, a book fair and a charity sale of souvenirs with a marathon logo were organized.
The Melihovo Museum-Reserve has made the initiative to make Chekhov Memorial Day on July 15 a single day of charity in all the Museum of Podmoskovy.
A 30-year-old resident of Olevsk Zhytomyr region near the local football stadium shot the teenagers who were there several times.
According to the suspect, he was enraged by the noise, reported "FACTAM" in the communication department of the Zhytomyr region police.
After that, the man went to a cafe located nearby.
In his building, there was a conflict in which the man used a device to fire rubber bullets, injuring one of the visitors.
The 34-year-old victim has been given the necessary medical care, there is no threat to his life.
Police and ambulances arrived at the scene of the incident, but the gunman was hiding by this time.
Law enforcement officers identified him and arrested him on the same day, August 2.
The man couldn’t explain his actions.
He took the device for firing rubber bullets, which was sent for examination.
According to this fact, criminal proceedings under Article 296 (Huliganity) of the Criminal Code of Ukraine have been initiated.
The detainee is threatened with imprisonment for a period of 3 to 7 years.
We will remind, in Kiev on Lukyanovka in the area of Tatarskaya street on the night of July 28, there was an attack with a shooting.
Michelle Carter Sentencing for Reports That Instigated Conrad Roy's Suicide
A resident of Massachusetts has been sentenced to two and a half years in prison for inciting suicide by texting and phone calls to her boyfriend Conrad Roy.
Michelle Carter, who is now 20 years old, will have to spend 15 months of her time behind bars and another 5 years of probation.
Carter was found guilty in June of the unintended murder of Conrad Roy, who committed suicide on July 13, 2014.
Roy's father said at the hearings on Thursday: "My family was killed in grief.
My son was my best friend.”
Carter was allowed to remain at liberty until the appeal.
She was threatened with a maximum term of 20 years, but her lawyers said that both she and Roy suffered from mental disorders.
Carter, dressed in red pants and a cream blouse, listened to the sentence standing, shaking her hands and lowering her eyes.
“By her actions she killed Conrad Roy,” the prosecutor told the court.
"She interrupted his life to improve hers.
She did not accept responsibility,” she said.
"She didn't show remorse."
But Carter's lawyer said it was "a tragic case that she deeply regrets."
However, Judge Lawrence Monis said that, in his opinion, her “age, level of maturity, or even mental illness did not noticeably affect her actions.”
The prosecutor read Roy Lynn Roy's mother's statement: "Not a single day has passed when I would not mourn the loss of my beloved son.
“I want him to be proud of me and how I do it – I try to support his sisters, despite all the pain that will remain with us forever,” he said.
Roy's sister, Roy Camdin Roy, said she was relentlessly chasing the thought that she would never be able to attend his wedding or become the aunt of his children.
“To leave the person who has always been with me since I was born is the pain that will remain with me for the rest of my life,” she said.
This case appears to be a legal precedent, as there is no law in Massachusetts that would provide for the responsibility for counseling a person to commit suicide.
In 2014, when Roy was found dead in a car with symptoms of carbon dioxide poisoning, Carter was 17 years old.
The case attracted the attention of the whole country when it became known that it was pushed to the suicide of the Carter message.
“You can hang out, jump off the roof, stab yourself with a knife, I don’t know there are many ways,” she wrote in several messages sent two weeks before his death when he was resting with his family.
A few minutes before her suicide, she wrote, "You have to do this, Conrad" and "You just have to turn on the lighter and you'll be free and happy."
Judge Monis said Carter wanted to get attention with Roy's death, and forbade her to communicate with the press in order not to give her what she wanted.
The views of the lawyers on this matter were divided.
One of the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted in 2007 of murdering her British neighbor in an apartment in Italy and was acquitted two years later.
The 30-year-old Nox published her special opinion in the Los Angeles Times, stating that "Michael Carter deserves sympathy and help, not prison."
Evgeny Bogachev: "I let Langford go, like a bird of high flight"
One of VTB's top league basketball players, 33-year-old Keith Langford has left UNIX.
The departure of the American defender "Izvestiam" commented on the president of UNIX, Evgeny Bogachev.
Kit made this decision on family circumstances, - said Evgeny Bogachev.
He has a small child, a wife who did not want to move to Kazan.
Keith wants to be closer to home.
I decided to go see him.
Of course, I could say no and extend his contract, but he deserved a different relationship.
He played in UNIX for three seasons and showed a high level in each match, betting on all 100%.
So I let him go like a bird of high flight.
We thanked him for it.
We wish him success in his family life and in his playing career.
Keith Langford played at the Kazan club for three years, earning a silver medal in the 2015/16 Singles League.
In the 2016/17 season, he received the award for the most successful player of the Euroleague season.
He scored an average of 21.75 points per game.
This is the second result since 2004, when the award was established.
Langford, who also won the prize in 2014, became the second player in Euroleague history to have won the prize more than once.
In the near future, Langford will sign a contract with the Chinese "Shenzhen", Eurohops reports.
The U.S. is expected to enter into a two-year contract worth $5 million.
Langford will be the second Euroleague star to enter the Chinese championship in July.
Previously, the Chinese CBA moved to the ex-centric "Panatinikosa" Yannis Burusis.
The burnt in the sun tourist from the Sub-Moscow evacuated by helicopter to Adygea
Adygeian rescuers today by helicopter evacuated from the mountainous area of the republic of the Moscow tourist, who received the strongest sunburns.
The man rested in the shelter "Fist", located at an altitude of 1.6 thousand meters.
The 27-year-old tourist had high blood pressure, as well as difficulty breathing.
Preliminary diagnosis is a serious allergic reaction.
The head of the tour group addressed the rescuers, who said that the man had been burned during the campaign.
Audi to be redesigned for up to 850,000 diesel cars
The day before the announcement by Audi, BMW said it would offer to upgrade the software to more than 350,000 cars.
The chairman of BMW said the company believes that “there are more intelligent ways than driving restrictions,” referring to European cities – including Munich, where BMW is located – that have considered the possibility of banning or restricting the use of diesel cars.
Daimler said on Thursday that it is modifying three million Mercedes cars in Europe to reduce their diesel emissions.
None of the companies called their move a withdrawal.
European automakers have actively promoted the use of diesel cars in Europe and the United States to promote compliance with carbon dioxide emissions rules.
But the nitrogen oxides that release diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.
The cost to automakers of installing equipment that neutralizes the exhaust gases of diesel cars is also rising, and maintaining a competitive price for cars is becoming difficult.
While German automakers are under close attention, Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government has also accused it of undermining influential automakers and ignoring signs of the problem.
The companies are trying not to repeat the mistake of Volkswagen, which concealed the use of so-called "defeat devices" that during testing could adjust the amount of harmful gases emitted to comply with the rules, and in normal driving conditions switched off.
In the United States, the indictment has been handed down to several Volkswagen leaders, while the rest are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, a former head of the thermodynamics department of the Audi engine development group was arrested in Germany.
Former manager, Zaccao Giovanni Pamio, an Italian, is therefore unprotected from extradition and may appear in court in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was subject to a German criminal investigation involving Volkswagen after authorities accused Audi of installing the system in order to bypass European emissions rules and expanded the investigation, which had previously focused on the United States.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could create serious problems for Volkswagen: the manufacturer of elite cars is a source of disproportionately large share of Volkswagen’s revenue.
In Astrakhan, a visitor to the cafe paid for fake money
The police received a message from the employee of the bank’s department about the detection of the recalculation of funds received from the point of general interest, suspicious banknotes with a denomination of 5 thousand rubles.
A study conducted at the Expert-Criminalist Center found that it was false.
According to the UMVD of Russia on the Astrakhan region, the banknote was paid off by one of the visitors of the cafe, who bought the shaurma.
It is worth noting that the cash register was not equipped with a device to determine the authenticity of the bills.
Currently, the police are installing persons involved in the manufacture and sale of knowingly fake ticket of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation.
Such crimes are punishable by imprisonment for up to 8 years with a fine of up to 1 million rubles.
The Regional Office of the Ministry of Internal Affairs urges residents of the Astrakhan region to be careful when carrying out financial transactions; the workers of the trading facilities are advised to install devices to verify the authenticity of the received funds.
Astronomers have found an "advanced" planet on which even iron can melt
After first studying the stratosphere properties of a giant exoplanet called WASP-121b, astrophysicists were greatly surprised by its temperature, which is able to evaporate iron and other metals.
Experts have noted that water molecules are so heated by starlight that they emit infrared radiation.
The Hubble telescope captured the glow of water molecules on this gas giant: this high temperature causes water in the planet's atmosphere to glow in the infrared range.
WASP-121b refers to the so-called "hot Jupiters" - gas giants, in size and mass comparable to the largest planet in the Solar System, but dozens of times closer to the parent star.
Because of this, the year on the exoplanet lasts only 1.3 "earth" days, and its gas shell is heated to almost 2,500 degrees Celsius.
Climate change threatens the lavender in Provence.
It has become a symbol of Provence and Southern France, but now there are concerns that it is threatened by climate change.
Lavender has grown worse because of dry weather and insect-borne diseases; this has caused constant headaches of scientists and farmers who are trying to find a solution.
Eric Shess, an expert at the Provence-based Agricultural Research Institute CRIEPPAM, says: “Lavender in Provence is really under threat because in recent years this plant has been feeling the effects of climate change.
This affects the lifespan of the lavender.
And there are also small, leaf-jumping, microbacteria-carrying insects; in very dry weather, they become very many.”
There is a lot on the map.
Lavender not only attracts holidaymakers; lavender oil is in great demand in perfumery and cosmetics.
Eric Shess says: “Instead of very long squirrels with a large number of large colors, we have small, underdeveloped, weakened, or absent at all.
That’s why we have fewer parts that contain essential oil.”
The solutions that are now being considered include improving water distribution and slowing down evaporation from the soil, as well as spraying plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and removing more drought-resistant varieties.
Ambassador of Winter Universiade-2019 met with Krasnoyarsk schoolchildren
Two-time world hockey champion, Ambassador of the Winter Universiade 2019 Alexander Semin met with novice hockey players the day before and handed out autographs to fans.
The meeting took place in the tent of the Winter Universiade-2019 as part of a thematic week devoted to hockey with a chessboard.
Any visitor to the tent could ride on skates on a site with artificial ice.
In addition, relays, quizzes and games were organized with the distribution of souvenir products of student games, warming up from the federation of aerobics.
Fifty students participated in the event.
Alexander Semin advised the boys to do as much as possible on sports grounds and emphasized that the most important thing in the initial stage of training is hard work and a huge desire to do hockey.
“It’s good that there is such a place in Krasnoyarsk as the Winter Universiade 2019, where beginner athletes can directly ask questions to team coaches,” he said.
We note that to promote student sport and a healthy lifestyle among the Reds are helped by the ambassadors of the Winter Universiade-2019.
The tent of the Universiade will operate throughout the summer season until September 25, according to the press service of the Winter Universiade-2019 Directorate.
In the State Department commented on the words of Medvedev
The official representative of the U.S. State Department, Heather Nauert, commenting on the briefing of the words of the Prime Minister of the Russian Federation Dmitry Medvedev, said the need to find an "area for interaction" with Russia.
According to her, such areas should be found in order to "improve bilateral interaction".
As an example of such successful cooperation, Nauert called the Syria ceasefire agreement.
We are two nuclear superpowers.
“And people around the world agree that the United States and Russia should be able to work with each other,” she said.
Nauert declined to comment on Medvedev’s claim about a full-fledged trade war between Russia and the United States.
“If Russia has said this, then of course, it has the right to speak, but more on this subject I can say nothing,” said the representative of the State Department.
Earlier, US President Donald Trump signed a bill on tightening sanctions against the Russian Federation.
Commenting on the new package of sanctions, the head of the Russian government Medvedev said that Washington declared a full trade war to Moscow, ending the hope of improving bilateral relations.
Medvedev also said that U.S. sanctions would be in place for decades.
In addition, according to the prime minister, the American establishment “clearly defeated” Trump.
The missing bodybuilder in the Podmoscova was found on someone else’s cottage lost memory
Bodybuilder Shamil Hanmetov disappeared on the road to Noginsk on July 25 under very picnic circumstances: he came out of the car salon to go to the toilet.
For seven days he was unsuccessfully sought by familiar and local residents.
And Shamil found himself at a stranger's cottage in Ramensky.
It was discovered completely naked in his toilet by the owner.
The Dagestan athlete could not explain how he was here and what happened to him.
He couldn't even remember his name, and his passport was missing.
Identifying the person helped the announcements of his disappearance.
The doctors who arrived on the call recorded in Hanmetov a partial loss of memory and a skull-brain injury, reports the audience Mash.
Athletes are also likely to have other surprises.
The attackers who kidnapped Shamil may have already visited his apartment, from which the keys were also stolen.
Oil and gas revenues in July exceeded the forecast of 7.4 billion rubles
In fact, the oil and gas revenues obtained at the end of July 2017 exceeded the estimate by 7.4 billion rubles, according to the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation.
The exaggeration, as the department explains, occurred mainly due to the higher exchange rate of the US dollar to the ruble compared to the average monthly value of June used for the estimation, as well as due to the overshoot of the actual volume of gas production and the volume of non-export.
“The rejection of the federal budget oil and gas revenues from the monthly estimation corresponding to the Federal Law on the Federal Budget for 2017-2019, in August 2017 is projected to amount to <0x2B>40.2 billion rubles,” - said in the message of the Ministry of Finance.
Thus, the total amount of funds intended for the purchase of foreign currency in the domestic currency market during the period from 7 August to 6 September 2017 is 47.6 billion rubles.
Accordingly, the daily volume of purchase of foreign currency will be in the equivalent of 2.07 billion rubles.
The Bank of Russia will be involved in the purchase of foreign currency by the Ministry of Finance of Russia.
Each working day during the specified period, the Central Bank will conclude transactions for the purchase of foreign currency at the organized trades of the Moscow Stock Exchange evenly during the trading day.
The foreign currency purchased will be credited to the accounts of the Federal Treasury in the Central Bank.
The murder of a journalist emphasizes that in Mexico it is becoming increasingly dangerous.
Employees of the weekly newspaper “Riodos” usually meet on Wednesdays to discuss plans to illuminate the latest violent crimes in the state of Sinaloa related to organized crime, corrupt officials, or the ongoing war.
But today, depressed by their own tragedy, they met to talk about security.
They were told to change their habits.
Two senior journalists discussed what seemed safer: to take children with them to an office where they had already thrown a grenade in 2009, or to leave them at home.
Security experts wrote on the board hanging in the room, three words: enemies, neutral people, allies.
They asked journalists to name names for each column – evidence is not needed, suspicions and internal feelings will suffice.
These are drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of being held in custody by the government or by the cartel, a whole list of assholes that make the work to illuminate chaos in Mexico dangerous.
The violence does not give way, and among the bodies that are multiplying in the country, more and more journalists: according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, at least 25 since President Enrico Pena Nieto took his post in December 2012; 589 people have been killed in these cases; 589 people are under threat after attacks.
Among the latter are their publisher and inspiration, co-founder of "Riodose" Javier Valdes Cardenas.
“The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist,” Waldes wrote in one of his numerous books on violent drug-related crimes.
His absence is felt very acutely, although his presence everywhere - a large photograph of Waldes, showing the middle finger, with the inscription "Justice" hangs on the facade of the building "Riodose" of the physics; two of the physics of the physics of the physics of the physics; two of the reporters in 30 years, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Fmirez.
The seminar takes place less than two months after his death; journalists discuss his general injury, his nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor’s office was organized for the investigation of journalistic affairs in 2010, only two cases have been investigated so far, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists.
As with most of the thousands of murders perpetrated each year related to drug trafficking and organized crime, killers of journalists rarely appear in court.
Reporters at Riodos insist they will write about the violence in Sinaloa, though they are killed with grief, although it is far more dangerous now.
“Without information about the killers, without justice from security talks at meetings, there is little use,” says Ibarra.
“It’s very foolish to spend time at this seminar,” he says.
“Until we know the reason, we suspect everyone.”
On the morning of May 15, Valdes left the office of "Riodos" in the capital of the state of Culiacan.
He only managed to walk a couple of blocks before his red Toyota King was stopped by two men; he was pulled out of the car and shot 12 times, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which means "Twelfth River."
The shooter got off his car and smashed it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He has a wife and two adult children.
Rumors usually quickly dissipate around the Kuliakan.
But almost everyone is silent about Valdez.
Since Guzman was arrested and extradited to the United States in January last year, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlefields in the country as rival factions struggle to fill the vacuum formed.
Let’s not talk about the fact that one or more people are killed every day in the streets of Sinaloa, or that the cemetery is filled with two-story mausoleums of narcotics, which are larger than the homes of many living people.
Let’s forget for a minute that the state of “rest” is just when one of the cartels takes control of a coastal state with important ports and routes of drug trafficking leading to the United States.
Despite the fact that Valdes was well aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bohorkes, a 60-year-old co-founder and director of Riodos, was crushed by guilt for not being able to protect a friend.
He thinks the murder was helped by two mistakes.
First, in February, an interview was published with Damaso Lopez, the leader of one of the rival factions of the cartel, which is fighting the sons of Guzman.
The publication could have angered the sons; people who were supposedly members of the gang bought all copies of the publication as soon as they were delivered to the kiosks.
The second mistake was that he did not force Waldes to leave the country for his own safety after another newspaper was seized, which wrote about the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder was regarded as another milestone in the development of violence against journalists in Mexico.
He had been out of danger for so long, his friends and colleagues thought he would be forever.
He was an experienced reporter at Noroeste and in 2003, together with five colleagues, founded Riodos, selling his $50 stock.
In Sinaloa “it was impossible to engage in journalism without affecting the topic of drugs,” Bohorkes said.
Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for bold and honest publishing, sales and advertising revenues grew.
Journalists liked that they could publish bold reports without fear of censorship, and readers were attracted to the fact that in this publication they could read about something that no one else dared to write about.
Eight years after her founding, Riodos received the prestigious Maria Murs Cabo Award for her work as a reporter in Latin America.
That same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award for his bravery in investigating the drug trade in Mexico, wherever it led.
He admitted frankly that he was scared.
“I want to live on,” he said at the CPJ award ceremony.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa - "it's a way of life," he said in an interview with Rompeviento TV in October last year.
“You have to take on the tasks that lie on you as a journalist – either that way or you’re just hitting a fool.”
I don't want to be asked, "What were you doing when there were so many deaths around... why didn't you tell me what was going on?"
The staff of the "Riodos" miss Valdes, a joker, who quarreled, like a loader in the port, a friend, generous on hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to snuggle alive.
They depended on the order they had set.
He always had to wear his hat.
He was supposed to go to El Guayabo, the bar in front of the office, and always sit there at the same table.
Now they ask: Has his love for a once-established order destroyed him?
His death caused them to doubt their calculations of how best to do their job and stay alive.
“They don’t like it when you get along with their wives, their children, their legal business, and their underground drug transport airports.
"These things were on the line," Bohorkes said.
The result, even in the best of times, was a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation.
You have to believe your instincts.
Stay away from the bad scent.
The problem, says Riodose editor Andres Villarereal, is that "the cover-up can be tricked ... and then what happened to Javier happens."
The old rules, he says and others, no longer operate in Sinaloa – as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states, where there is a poisonous mixture of lucrative smuggling routes, weak state institutions and corrupt officials.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the room where Riodos staff gathered for security training, it was suddenly forbidden to bring in cell phones: a few days before it became known that spy programs, which are sold exclusively to governments, are being used in Mexico to monitor journalists and public activists.
Outside, two police officers are hiding in the shade of a 104-degree (40-degree Celsius) tree.
They were given the task of the state government to protect the office of “Riodos”, which is located in a four-story building in the bourgeois district of Kuliacan.
Some journalists asked half-heartedly whether these police officers were among the 50 percent of the officers of the order that the governor himself said they could not be trusted.
A few months ago, journalists went to a mountainous area that is de facto controlled by gangs of drug traffickers.
In the next room, "Riodos" relied on three main themes.
It's the Sinaloa murder of the brother of former boxing champion Julio Cesar Chavez.
They also had a disclosure of government expenditures, concentrated in the governor’s hometown.
And there was a group kidnapping of people in one of Kuliacan's most expensive restaurants, in the neighborhood of the prosecutor's office.
It was not officially announced who was kidnapped or how it happened, so we had to be careful when it came time to write about what everyone in the city knew: that it was a favorite restaurant for drug dealers and authorities at the same time.
One of their journalists learned from open databases that the restaurant was registered in the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which has dominated all levels of power for almost the past century.
Several governors of the PRI have recently been made high-profile accusations of corruption.
Villareal asked reporters to write about previous incidents at the restaurant, including when Guzman’s son El Chapo escaped from the military.
A few months ago, readers would have looked for a column of Waldes with the most reliable information about the kidnapping.
“We would have known before what happened,” says 46-year-old Villareal, for his slim body called El Flaco.
"Today, all channels of communication with our sources are broken."
Waldes’s cabinet is now used as a warehouse for posters and stickers protesting the killings of journalists because employees have become what they never thought they would become: activists speaking on behalf of the press.
Journalist Miriam Ramirez took several posters and went to a demonstration the next morning at the local prosecutor’s office dedicated to another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the state of Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n in the west of the country three days after Valdes was killed.
They found the burnt body, and the authorities said it was him, based on DNA tests.
Throughout the country, journalists began to speak louder, organize protests and write “SOS Press” on the pavements and walls of houses.
On that day, Director Bohorkes was in Washington, D.C., trying to gain international support in demanding justice in the Valdez case.
At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after the murder of Valdes Ramirez, she accused the authorities of spying on journalists and ordering their murders for telling the truth.
She then asked not to give her any more tasks to enlighten the government, fearing that anger would harm her objectivity.
Valdes has repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are “encircled” by organized crime, its partners in the government and indifferent society.
In his latest book, Narco-Journalism, he wrote that reporters are not only killed by gangs of drug traffickers; they do so on the orders of politicians and security services who are conspiring with organized crime.
Article 19, the Committee for the Protection of the Press, believes that half of the attacks on journalists last year were carried out on orders from police and government officials.
“In Mexico, you die because they want to shut you up,” Ramirez said.
Murder scares people, of course.
Everyone remembers the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Masias six years ago in the northern border state of Tamaulipas.
On her body was found a note supposedly written from the Zetas cartel's face: "I'm here because of my articles."
The computer keyboard and headphones were lying next to her cut off head.
Some publications preferred to close as El Norte newspaper in the northern border state of Chihuahua after her correspondent Miroslav Brich was killed in March.
Others continue to look like El Manyana from Nuevo Laredo after her leader was assassinated in 2004.
In 2010, “Diario de Ciudad Juarez” publicly addressed drug cartels using an editorial on the front page entitled “What do you want from us?”
Some journalists have left their home states or even the country at all.
It's a painful decision.
In exile it is difficult to find a job, and they are still considering the danger in the streets.
And sometimes they are killed, as it is evident, with photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was killed in 2015 along with four women in an apartment in Mexico three months after fleeing Veracruz.
Those who remain and continue to work balance between risky decisions on a daily basis.
Ibarra, who once dreamed of being a poet, admits that he is afraid to write about the drug trade.
“Mexico is going to hell, and that’s why I became a journalist,” he said.
Last Friday, at midnight, when the last edition was ready for print, the publishers of “Riodos” sat on the sidewalk next to the office and drank beer when their phones suddenly rang at the same time.
A series of shootings between opposing gangs and security forces near the resort town of Masatlan left 19 dead, according to confirmed data.
The war continued to erupt, as promised in a series of messages from cartels discovered in the area.
Sitting on the sidewalk, they posted the news on the website "Riodoses" via a mobile phone.
The next day I had to re-write the first page.
The sirens were raised nearby - another shooting in the vicinity.
Bohorkes looked to see if the police were ready to defend them.
If they were scared, they didn’t show it.
Sitting under a huge portrait of the deceased founder of their newspaper, whose middle finger was exposed to the whole of Sinaloa, the employees of "Riodos" continued his business.
"How can you think of shutting down," said Bohorkes, "if on the same day that Javier was killed, the trainee asked me to send her out to report?"
Dinosaur used camouflage to avoid enemies.
At first glance, it looks like a statue, albeit terrifying.
The researchers said the first remains of an incredible rhino-sized creature discovered by a Canadian miner were so well preserved that experts called it “My Liza among the dinosaurs.”
It was so well preserved that they were even able to determine that the color of his scaly skin was reddish-brown – and to say that he had, in some way, a “dark past.”
In a report published in the journal Modern Biology, it was described as “the most well-preserved of Thyreophorus in the history of the finds and one of the best specimens of the dinosaur in the world.”
This fossil is a recently discovered specimen of a nodosaurus that lived in the middle of the Mele period, between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
Its incredible good condition has stunned researchers who call it “really wonderful.”
This herbal thyreophorus is the best-preserved fossil of this species in the history of the finds, according to articles in the National Geographic.
He was found by Shawn Fank when he was working at the Sancor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
He came across something that seemed to be different from the surrounding breed, and decided to take a closer look.
The fossil he discovered was sent to the Royal Tirrell Paleontological Museum.
Over the next six years, work was carried out to detect the animal inside the ground depth of 2,500 ft (1,100 kg).
Now that all this hard work has been done, the finished result can be demonstrated.
“It’s only a little rattling, and you can almost believe that he is sleeping,” said lead author Caleb Brown, a researcher at the Royal Tyrrell Paleontological Museum, where the creation is demonstrated.
“He will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and well-preserved specimens of dinosaurs – the Mona Lisa among the dinosaurs.”
While studying its skin, the researchers found that it was herbivorous, despite the fact that it was coated with armor and reminiscent of a walking tank, apparently, was exposed to significant danger from the meat-eating dinosaurs.
This powerful armored dinosaur used red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and applied a protective technique known as protective dye, which is also used by many animals today.
This would allow him to merge more quickly with the surrounding environment and avoid encounters with enemies, experts say, suggesting that he was hunted by larger dinosaurs.
This 110-million-year-old creature, belonging to the nodosaur family, was widely exposed in print in May, and is now on display at the Royal Tirrell Paleontological Museum.
Scientists have already studied the animal and named it Borealopelta markmitchelli in honor of museum lab member Mark Mitchell, one of the participants of the group who spent more than 7,000 hours after his meticulous excavation.
The astonishing preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international group of scientists to document the pattern and shape of the ticks and armor plates on his body.
They discovered protective color, a common method of protection in the animal kingdom, which means that the upper being was darker than its lower side.
Although the protective coloration is well distributed, the discovery has become a surprise, because the size of the dinosaur Borealopelta far exceeds the size of the now-living animals with the protective coloration.
It can be assumed that this dinosaur was so actively hunted for carnivorous dinosaurs that evolution preferred the masking of confrontation as a way of survival.
But most modern protective-coloured animals — such as deer, zebras, or armorworms — are much smaller in size and are more affordable prey, indicating that the nodosaurus had to fight seriously for survival.
“The serious threat from predators to a massive, powerful dinosaur armor shows how dangerous the predatory dinosaurs of the Melon period were,” Brown said.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in the dinosaur’s crust also suggests that his skin should have been reddish-brown.
Scientists continue to study the animal, looking for information about its life, including the preserved contents of its digestive tract, to find out what it ate during its last meal.
They believe that when the dinosaur died, it fell into a river and was carried into the sea, where it sank and with its back lunged down to the bottom of the ocean.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as it is now in southern Florida, and the rivers and oceans were likely to have spread far deeper into the land than they are now.
"This nodosaurus is truly remarkable in that it is completely covered with the preserved scaly skin, and at the same time completely preserved in three dimensions, preserving the original shape of the animal," Brown said.
“As a result, the animal now looks almost the same as it looked at the time, in the early millennium.
You don’t have to use your imagination to recreate it, you just need to shake it a little, and you can almost believe that it sleeps.”
The Mele period is the time when giant theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs standing on two legs, roamed the Earth.
Although the most remarkable of them, the tyrannosaurus rex, lived for millions of years later than the Borealopelta, the thyreophorus could be hunted by one of his terrible ancestors.
They include acrocantosaurus, a 38-foot-long monster (11.5 meters) weighing six tons.
Scientists, whose latest findings are published in the journal Modern Biology, believe that Borealopelta was taken to the sea after his death and mummified in the hive.
The creature was found by Sean Fank when he was working on a millennium mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
According to the museum's staff, it is the best-preserved thyroid gland in the world, along with skin and armor, and it targets, from the mouth to the hip bones.
On average, these creatures reached about 18 feet (five meters) in length and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kilograms).
Their characteristic feature was two twenty-inch spikes protruding from the shoulders.
Researchers believe that this herbal-eating thyreophorus was hard to walk on because it is now Canada until a flooded river carried it into the open sea.
But the dinosaur's underwater burial preserved its armor with precision to the smallest details.
The fossil remains of this particular specimen have been so well preserved that the remains of the skin still cover the bogus armor plates along the skull of the dinosaur.
As Michael Gre<0xC5><0xA1>ko wrote in an article for National Geographic magazine, such a degree of conservation is “rare as a lottery win.”
The longer I look at him, the more amazing he seems.
The fossilized remains of the skin are still covered by bulging armor plates, sowing the animal's skull.
His right foreleg is stretched along the side, five fingers on it are twisted upwards.
I can count the scratches on his soles.”
Mikhail Saakashvili managed to get to Poland without documents
Mikhail Saakashvili, who previously headed Georgia and then the Odessa region in Ukraine, flew to Poland.
At the same time, he did not have documents confirming his identity and citizenship.
The arrival of Saakashvili is reported by the Polish publication Telewizja Republika, which posted a video of his performance on its YouTube channel.
Saakashvili spoke at an event in honor of the anniversary of the Warsaw Uprising against Hitler's troops in 1944.
Since the politician does not know Polish, although he tried to start speaking in that language, he had to speak English through a Polish translator.
During his speech, politicians touched on the theme of Georgia’s cooperation with Poland, as well as spoke about Ukraine.
The fact that the migration service of Ukraine deprived him of citizenship, the opal politician learned while in the United States.
How exactly he managed to make a transatlantic flight without documents is not yet known.
Former governor of the Odessa region Mikhail Saakashvili said that his signature on the questionnaire for obtaining citizenship of Ukraine was forged.
The politician stressed that he did not fill out any questionnaires.
Investigation in Weinsiger and Olkhovyk case extended until January
The period of preliminary investigation in the case of the co-owner of the group of companies "Renova" Evgeny Olkhovyk and the head of energy holding "T Plus" Boris Weinsiher was extended until January 2, 2018.
On Thursday, August 3, the Basman court is considering the extension of the accused's domestic detention.
The representative of the SC at the meeting announced the decision to extend the preliminary investigation for the last time.
"The particular complexity and duration of the investigation is due to the need to extract and conduct an examination of a large number of documents, as well as carrying out investigative actions on the territory of several Russian entities," the investigator said.
He added that the suspects regularly bribed the leadership of Comey.
Their total amount is estimated to be at least a billion rubles.
According to the investigation, Vinzicher, Olkhovyk, as well as the former head of ZAO "Complex Energy Systems" Mikhail Slobodin, who until September 5 also headed the company "Vympelkom", the company's subsidiaries and the company's subsidiaries were handed over to the highest officials of the Republic of Komi.
Vinziker and Olkhovyk were arrested, staged in Siktyvkar and arrested for two months, Slobodin fled the investigation and was declared in federal search.
How did one activist learn the answer to the question “Whose Streets?”
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shocked to the depths of her soul.
Just a day after arriving in New York as part of a trip to St. Louis, the native was sitting on a bed in an apartment rented through Airbnb, looking at the Facebook ribbon on her phone.
She ran into the post of someone from high school.
“The police have just killed an eighteen-year-old child, and he’s still lying in the middle of the street.”
Paying attention to the fact that no one else on her tape has left this information behind, puzzled, she closed Facebook and opened a tweet.
There were a lot of user posts in her ribbon with Nick <0x40>TheePharoah.
A real-time rapper from Greater St. Louis tweeted the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black eighteen-year-old who was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He published a photo of Brown’s lifeless body, scattered in the middle of the street, where it will be four hours.
“This is wildness,” Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new for her and her circle.
She put the phone down, and later in the evening she returned to tweets that people were going to Canfield Drive.
There were photographs of a tape and screaming people and a man claiming to be Brown’s father, holding a poster with the words: “The Ferguson policeman just killed my unarmed son!”
She watched a live broadcast of a police officer standing in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In another video, another policeman, she said, took a gunshot and shouted, “I’ll kill you all... animals!”
“It’s a non-standard situation,” Ferrell said, according to her own memories.
“It’s not a murder like the one we’re used to and that we can call typical.
At that moment, I felt a tingle.
I was angry and crying.”
She took a ticket for the return flight and flew home the next day.
Landing at 11 p.m., she took her six-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that they would both go to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson in the next nearly three years became the subject of a new documentary film, Whose Streets?, which will be released on August 11.
It’s a story about survival and protest, about love and loss, strength and resilience from the point of view of people living in the community and filling the streets, demanding answers.
While Ferrell was driving to Ferguson with his daughter, dressed in a flower dress and a colored wreath, they remembered a conversation that had been conducted countless times before this morning, "about the experience of black people and their situation."
She recalls saying, “Do you remember how I told you about how black people had to fight for what they believed?
We’re going to Ferguson now because the policeman killed an eighteen-year-old boy, and that was wrong.”
“I couldn’t help but take it,” Ferrell said later.
“What is happening today is the culmination of ... what has happened before.
She must know it, see it, and be raised on it.
It should not only understand well in activism and organization, but also understand the different levels of experience of blacks and their situations and what we need to do in order to become free to be free.
Even if I manage to provide her with an environment in which she herself will not face obvious racism, she is no different from any other black girl.
I feel like I would have done her a bad favor if I had fenced her out of it.”
When they arrived in Ferguson, they made their first stop on the South Florissant Road, on a site across the road from a police station that became a sort of tent camp, while the activists waited for reports of the final indictment of the officer.
There, Ferrell and his daughter joined a local businessman who cooked lunch packages.
They collected the packages and helped distribute them to the protesters.
Little by little, Ferrell took the form of a new type of activism.
“My activism changed completely after August 9,” she said, noting that as a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was president of the Association of Sanitary Students, Representatives of National Minorities, and engaged in the field of food justice and sexuality.
“I didn’t have the experience of an organizer.
It came by itself.”
A few weeks later, at an evening demonstration, Ferrell met Sabaa Folayan, one of her directors.
Folayan said she and her main operator Lucas Alvarado-Ferrer “just wanted to document” the events.
Ferrell came up with the question: “Do you want to document, or are you trying to find a story that can be played on?”
This skepticism has been inspired by numerous people, often white, who have come to the community in order to benefit from its pain and resilience.
As explained in a recent interview, Foleyan, “We heard that the voices of people who were born and raised in Ferguson did not get in the spotlight, and wanted to do it differently.”
By that time, Folayan had already joined forces with his director, Damon Davis, a local artist known for his activism on the issues of the death penalty.
His participation sparked sympathy for the project with Ferrell and six other locals, with whom the team of the Whose Streets project had maintained contact for the years after Brown’s murder.
“In this documentary, no one is talking about us or us, that’s what we’re talking about,” Davis said.
“It was the most important thing for me how these people will be represented, because it’s how I’ll be represented myself.”
And while the goal of the project was not to focus on Ferrell’s experience – in an effort to show that the movement “is not about the leader-saving, but about how the community unites,” as Folayan said – it turned out to be the most open of the film’s participants.
As a result, Ferrell’s “Whose Streets?” reveals unexpectedly personal aspects of her life, such as how she fell in love and married her wife.
“I felt naked,” Ferrell said, smiling about the first time I saw the finished product.
“But I realized that when you do that kind of work and humanize black people, there has to be some level of vulnerability.”
In addition, Ferrell’s story once again discusses and emphasizes the role of black gay women in the wider context of the “Life of Blacks Matters” movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement – those who created the <0x23>BlackLivesMatter tag on social media after the murder of black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 – consider themselves gay.
“Black gay women in leadership positions support all of this movement,” Ferrell said, “and all because we’re constantly fighting on several fronts.
“Black gay women have to bear all this burden,” he said.
Folayan agreed with this statement, noting that “the movement is, in fact, supported by black women and a multitude of gay black women.”
However, she insists that “this is not a case of positive discrimination” and that Ferrell was not chosen as the film’s central character because of its distinctive features.
“She was the one who awakened that energy,” she said.
"On the other hand, it's not a coincidence that she was on the forefront because when"
You can feel her energy through the screen.”
In the meantime, Ferguson has not had a movie camera for a long time, but there are still complex racial ties between the community and the police.
Ferrell will be on trial for another two and a half years for closing the highway during the demonstration.
She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the place, which she calls home, simply: “Bardak.”
She's still holding a speech she learned when she went out on Ferguson's streets full of three years ago.
We must fight for our freedom.
We have to win.
We need to love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose but our chains.”
Two El Salvadoran footballers disqualified for the bite of U.S. players
Salvadoran footballers Henry Romero and Darwin Serene have received long-standing disqualifications for non-sporting behavior.
During the quarter-final match of the Gold Cup of the Confederations of Football of North and Central America and the Caribbean (CONCACAF), El Salvadorans bit American players.
The first was the defender Henry Romero.
The Salvadoran bit the attacker Josie Altidor, then pinched him to the chest.
Subsequently, defender Serene bit U.S. defender Omar Gonzalez on a corner in his penalty area.
As a result, Romero was disqualified for three games and Serene for six.
The match itself ended with an American victory with a score of 2:0, Goal.com reports.
The Appearance of Similarity: Artist Creates Portraits Using Chelsea Manning's DNA
In the center of the hall at the Fridman Gallery in New York, people’s faces hang from the ceiling to the wire – white, black and brown, all inextricably similar to each other.
These 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey-Harborg from the lashes and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent incisions from the Fort Levenworth prison, where a former intelligence analyst is serving a 35-year term for the famous transmission of confidential diplomatic telegrams on WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition, which closed on August 2nd, is called "The Appearance of Similarity".
It is the result of a two-year correspondence between Dewey Harborg, whose art combines technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transgender woman and a famous dissident whose sentence Barack Obama eased just three days before the end of his presidency.
By analyzing the DNA data from Manning's computer program and using it to create three-dimensional portraits of faces that could have been in people with such a genome, Dewey-Harborg created a deep, though not easy-to-perceptive, manifesto for both of them.
Manning, who was born Bradley Edward, but has spoken openly about herself as a woman since she was a teenager, was sentenced to 20 episodes in 2013, including six violations of the Espionage, Computer Fraud and Theft Act.
Her photographs in the prison were unavailable, so only one of her photographs was known: a grainy black and white selfie, on which Manning in a platinum wig, apparently feeling uncomfortable, sat behind the wheel of the car; with this photograph she and the stali asso.
In 2015, Dewey-Harborg successfully completed her 2012 project “Visions of Strangers”.
In it, the artist created portraits of unknown people using court records such as curls and chewing gum, extracting DNA from this garbage and creating images of what these people might look like.
And then she received an e-mail from Paper Magazine.
“They interviewed Chelsea Manning in prison and wanted some portraits to illustrate the article,” Dewey-Haggorg said at a press briefing on the new exhibition.
Chelsea could not be visited and photographed at the time, so they contacted her and asked if she wanted to get a portrait made from her DNA.
In such an unusual way, the artist and her incarcerated muse became friends by correspondence and exchanged several letters for two years.
They even wrote a comic book called “Pressed Images” illustrated by Shayli Kanungo, who portrayed how in the future the president will mitigate Chelsea’s punishment and be able to visit the exhibition in person.
The fact that Obama really decided to release Manning just a few days after the book came out was a pleasant surprise after seven hard years in a Kansas military prison.
There’s something profound and powerful about the exhibition being opened right now, as Donald Trump declares war on people who reveal secret information in the government, and invents new ways to ignite the enemy he’s called into Twitter.
When Dewey-Harborg was asked about the coincidence of all this over time, she said that "accidentally nothing happens."
In a statement written on the gallery wall, Manning’s huge signature at the bottom (with a heart instead of the “i” in her name) calls for an end to “automatic division based on gender, race, sexual orientation and culture.”
On the opposite side is its mitochondrial DNA, a long gum from the pencils C, G and A.
Including 200 letters (or nucleotides, as the artist is scientifically exquisitely expressed), Dewey-Harborg hoped to show how we all look amazingly similar, at least in its biological structure.
“I hope to explain to people that our genome does not determine what we are, how open the genetic data is for interpretation and how subjective it is,” said Dewey-Harborg; her 2007 video work False Memories is also shown here.
“The DNA data can tell us a lot of different stories, and 30 of those stories are here.”
The last part of the exhibition, which fits in one room, is the aforementioned novel in the comics.
On it, King Kong-style Manning appears above the U.S. Correctional Room building with a loudspeaker in hand.
“If they kill your speech, they will win,” it reads.
"So don't ever shut up."
“This is a direct quote from the letter she wrote to me,” says the artist, welcoming us from Philadelphia.
“I still have ants on my skin when I talk about it.”
Manning hadn’t seen the exhibition in person yet – as it was visibly depicted in the comics – but when it comes, she will be greeted by the masks in the center of the room, her own genomic simulators, gathered as if they were a crowd of protesters.
It was also done intentionally, like everyone at the exhibition up to a height (5"2, Manning's height), on which the pencil was drawn genetic haplogroups.
“I used to hang them on the walls, but now I want them to look like a crowd of people,” Dewey-Harborg says of the portraits.
“I wanted them to be like the mass movement that was formed around Chelsea, like the movement that was standing behind its liberation.”
A professor at the Northwestern University and a staff member at the University of Oxford are searching for the police on the charge of murder.
According to police, a nationwide raid is underway on a Northwestern University professor and an Oxford University employee, who is being searched as a suspect in connection with the fact that a man was found stabbed in a luxury room in Chicago.
According to the protocols of the Cook County court, on Monday, arrest warrants were issued for the premeditated murder without the right to release under the bail of forty-two-year-old Vindem Latham and fifty-six-year-old Corrento.
According to the documents, the twenty-six-year-old Cornell-Duranello died after being sustained multiple stab wounds.
A warning issued by the Chicago Police Department said the body was found on July 27th.
The policeman called, they came to the apartment complex of the Grand Plaza and found a victim with several wounds on the body.
According to officials, Cornell-Duranlo was pronounced dead at the scene of the crime, and now detectives are investigating the death from knife wounds, citing her as murder, while police are intensively searching for two suspects.
Latham has been an adjunct professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Kabbage, the university’s vice president of communications, said in an emailed statement that Latham was on administrative leave and that he was banned from attending the Northwestern University campuses.
“This is now a criminal case that is being investigated by authorized persons, and the Northwest University is cooperating with the investigation,” Kabbage said.
Warren is a senior fellow at the University of Oxford’s financial institutions.
A spokesperson for the University and Somerville College said in an emailed statement: “We have communicated with the UK police and are ready to provide any necessary assistance to the U.S. investigative authorities.”
The statement also said Warren's colleagues were shocked and wanted him to give up.
Chicago Police Communications Chief Anthony Gullelmi said he strongly advises suspects to surrender to the authorities.
“The police have assumptions about their location, but our attempts to find them are intensifying,” Gullelmi said.
According to Gullelmi, local, regional and federal authorities are assisting in the search for suspects.
According to Gullelmi, the policeman called the administrator of the Grand Plaza building, who just received a mysterious message that something happened in room 1008.
The police said the crime scene was horrific.
Guelmi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27.
According to him, video camera data confirms that Letham and Warren were in the building.
"We believe that Professor Latham and the victim have been linked," Guelmi said.
The management of the Grand Plaza issued an address to the residents, in which it was reported: “At the moment the police are working on the chronology of the incident, collecting information about the victim and considering a number of motives, including a possible domestic incident.”
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko: "We will comply with WADA road map requirements in the near future"
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said that the conditions of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), set to resume the work of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA), will be fulfilled in the near future.
“A certain stage in fulfilling the requirements was passed, RUSADA was given the right to plan and conduct tests together with UKAD (the UK anti-oping agency).
The WADA road map has been updated accordingly," Mutko said on Thursday.
The Prime Minister commented on the second part of WADA’s roadmap to restore compliance status to the Code, which lists the conditions for the resumption of RUSADA and was recently published on the organization’s website.
According to Mutko, it does not contain anything that could present difficulties for Russia.
“Everything has been announced, everything will be done.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future," he added.
However, one of the requirements included in the list implies that Russian andioping structures must publicly acknowledge the results of the WADA investigation by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren, which claimed that doping in Russian sports is controlled by the state.
On this issue, Mutko said: “We are conducting an investigation because our anti-doping system has failed.
All measures have been taken.
But there were no state programs, and we will not recognize what wasn’t.”
Mutko repeated the words of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of the Russian independent public anti-doping commission.
On the morning of the same day, in an interview with the Russian newspaper Rsport, Smirnov acknowledged the problems that had previously occurred in Russian anti-doping structures, but added: “We have repeatedly said that the report contains certain controversial positions and situations.
No one is going to accept this report unconditionally," Smirnov added.
WADA removed RUSADA from doping control in November 2015 after a doping scandal.
However, in June of this year, he was allowed to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD).
After visiting the organization’s Moscow office in July, WADA Director-General Olivier Nigli said that RUSADA is “going in the right direction” to restore its work.
Fire extinguished in 79-story tower in Dubai
The big fire that took place in one of the tallest residential buildings in the world, The Torch Tower, has been suffocated, Reuters reports.
It is noted that the firefighters managed to cope with all the foci of the fire by 4.00 local time (3.00 msk).
Local authorities said no one was injured as a result of the incident.
At the time of the fire, the streets adjacent to the skyscraper were closed.
The reasons for what happened are not yet known.
The 79-storey residential skyscraper The Torch, which is one of the tallest buildings in the world, is reportedly burning in Dubai.
All the residents were evacuated in time.
Unimaginable outfit Buzova shock fans: pants, not covering panties
The scandalous leading reality show "Dom-2" Olga Buzova impressed the viewers of the Europa Plus Live festival with dances in underwear.
In the eyes of thousands of fans, the newly revealed singer duet with Nastya Kudry performed the song "We'll Be Hot".
Both girls went on stage in provocative “pants” sewn in such a way that the underwear of the singers was visible.
Inscriptions of Buzova and Kudry were made on the pants.
Earlier, it was reported how the changes in the appearance of Buzova commented on the specialist of one of the Moscow clinics of plastic surgery.
Stoltenberg admits deterioration of relations between NATO and Russia
This was reported on Friday, August 4, by the news service "Radio 4" with reference to foreign media.
According to him, it is the Russian authorities who are responsible for the deterioration of relations between the West and Russia.
In an interview with CNN, the NATO general also criticized Russia for the situation with Crimea and “destabilization in the east of Ukraine.”
At the same time, Stoltenberg assured that dialogue with Russia, however, is possible, and further escalation of the situation will not benefit any of its participants.
Earlier on Thursday, U.S. President Donald Trump said relations between the United States and Russia were at a dangerously low level, and accused the U.S. Congress of doing so.
Metro of Yekaterinburg is mastering a new way of payment
In October, the journey in the Ekaterinburg metro can be paid with a bank card, said Pavel Vedernikov, CEO of I-Set JSC in an interview with the Regional Newspaper.
Our goal is to introduce to the 2018 World Cup the same system of payment for metro rides as in other major cities: Moscow, St. Petersburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Novosibirsk.
"We want fans from other countries, the guests of the World Cup, to be able to use the metro with their bank cards without buying tokens or standing in line," he said.
Startups that will help your company not become the next “Uber”
Amy Errett wanted to assess the level of satisfaction among the employees of her startup in the field of e-commerce, but the surveys did not work.
The answers were often vague, useless, or, worse, untrue.
And even though she had promised anonymity, some staff members did not trust the process.
“It’s never been consistent and objective,” said Errett, who runs a 75-person, San Francisco-based Madison Reed company that deals with e-commerce in hair care.
That is why she appealed to third parties for help.
There is a new kind of start-ups in the field of staffing that help companies find out how their employees feel.
By developing and licensing software, the purpose of which is to measure employee engagement, they allow companies to do express queries, address specific teams and demographic groups to tonnolence tonolence tonolence tonolence tonolence tonolence tonolence tonolence tonolence tonolence tonolence and hotline tonolence tonolence tonolence tonolence tonolence.
“We now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for health monitoring, and where is Fitbit for your company?” says Jim Barnett, co-founder and president of the Redwood City-based Glynt startup, whose analytics programs are used by companies to measure engagement.
Errett said she had a better understanding of what her employees thought and felt over the three years of using Glint.
In addition to express queries and surveys of certain teams, the product offers a thermal map of the company and shows in a visible form which departments have the most complaints and which managers have a low approval rating, allowing it to understand why.
Companies gradually realize that they need to control the situation in the workplace, otherwise they will become the next “Uber” who was involved in the scandal, when a former employee posted a post in a blog post, in which someone described an aggressive situation, in which they did not.
For startups like Glint, this desire to control the situation is an opportunity for a profitable business.
According to estimates from the online portal “Let’s talk about payment” dedicated to financial technologies, the global management, regulation and compliance industry by 2020 could cost more than $118.7 billion.
The Convercent startup from Denver, Colorado, which helps companies prevent and detect bad behavior, noted a slight increase in interest and activity earlier this year against the backdrop of Uber’s falling reputation.
Convercent has nearly 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Recently, "Uber" appeared among the customers.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to send custom-made surveys of staff opinions, collect confidential responses in real time, and view thermal maps of problem areas.
It also provides a hotline for anonymous text messages, which allows employees to report misconduct.
And if the top manager is affected, the complaints go directly to the management.
“The court of public opinion has seized power from the inspectors,” said Patrick Quinlan, founder and president of Convercent.
If it turns out that the company is mishandling employees or behaving unethically, even if the inspector does not intervene, the company may face costly consequences in the form of boycotts from customers, outflows of employees and lawsuits, Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, a network of restaurants with more than 25,000 employees in 500 establishments, has been using Convercent for more than a year to make sure employees are up to date with the rules and procedures and offer a simple way to contact the company’s headquarters.
Previously, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to look for a phone number or head office email, file a formal complaint and hope that it will be taken seriously.
It was often a scary and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, head of Ruby Tuesday’s legal department, who said there was no normal way to track employee complaints.
Now that the company is using the Convercent service, problems that were previously hidden from managers sitting in offices in other cities or states — such as discrimination, harassment, and unfair pay — can be detected and dealt with more quickly.
“I can approach a holistic, comprehensive understanding of the situation of employees,” said Vitrano, who heads the Ruby Tuesday network risk management group.
“And we’re protecting our shareholders from litigation with employees.”
According to Quinland, companies began to take ethics, values and employee engagement more seriously in 2002, after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen went bankrupt due to ethical violations as a result of the Enron case.
But it wasn’t until “social media became widespread,” companies realized they wouldn’t be able to keep their dirty underwear from spreading the virus online.
“Before we started using technology to control ethics, people used hope as a strategy,” he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service, charging companies a regular fee for using their products.
This is a business model and an opportunity that has received approval from venture investors who have supported both startups.
In February, Convercent received $10 million in funding from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, resulting in the company's total capital reaching $47 million.
Glint received $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners, resulting in the company's total capital of $60 million.
These investments are hardly surprising given the interconnected nature of companies, culture, and venture capital.
The growing volume of research shows that today’s employees expect more from their jobs than it used to be.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries, and interesting projects, this is just the necessary minimum.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted and appreciated, and that they are devoting their time to a company with a positive mission.
“When people are happy to work in a company, they feel that they are being heard, and that the work they do is producing results, they are more likely to try to make such a company successful,” says Nina McCuin, vice president of Global Benefits and GIncent, where they use “Glin” and “Lked Employee Satisfaction”.
Investors get income when the business at the companies from their portfolio is doing well; the business at the companies is doing well when the employees are loyal and involved.
If third-party analytics promises to increase employee loyalty and engagement, it’s not surprising that they find support.
As stated by cultural experts in the workplace, it is important to have data on the involvement of employees.
But the data is useless until the company’s trustees take action.
In fact, if a company asks employees for feedback, it can create the impression that changes are coming.
And if the changes don’t come quickly enough, or don’t come at all, disappointment can develop, and employees will lose interest.
“If you’re going to ask for 4,000 bids, you need to be ready to hold 4,000 interviews,” says Russell Rat, President of Consulting at Kotter International, which had to see companies make a mistake by relying too much on data collection.
“Because if you don’t go to the end, the staff will guess, ‘Did you really hear me?
You don't care?
And if you don't care, why shouldn't I care?"
According to Errett, Madison Reed, which now conducts monthly employee surveys, is able to take action on the same day that someone reports a problem using Glint.
And, after collecting feedback from employees dissatisfied with decision-making speed and communication quality, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and introduce communication training to solve problems.
Ruby Tuesday is gaining new knowledge about its employees and hopes that in the long run this knowledge will help it more effectively retain employees in the industry known for its high flow of personnel.
“If you don’t try to create a culture of transparency, you lose people,” Vitrano said.
If you lose people, you lose customers.
If you lose customers, you lose company.
In Barnaul opens a new asphalt on the avenue of the Red Army
In Barnaul, cardinal measures were taken to eliminate the cause of asphalt failures on Krasnoarmiesky Avenue.
The place where the pits on the recently asphalted passage (intersection with Molodezhnaya Street) appeared twice was decided to "open".
Recall that the collapse of a small section of road near tramways was due to the fact that the land in the area of the homeless unexploited network.
According to the Deputy Chairman of the City Committee on Road Economy, Improvement, Transport and Communications Ivan Garmat, a detailed examination and elimination of the prerequisites for the collapse will be conducted.
Depending on its results, the necessary measures will be taken.
It is envisaged that the shaping of non-domestic communications and their concrete construction will be restored.
This is reported on the official website of the regional capital.
The Bruins team has to work longer due to the fact that the National Student Sports Association has canceled training twice a day.
Time is approaching eleven o’clock in the evening; a crowd of footballers from the University of California in Los Angeles is delayed to chat on one side of the team’s new training fields located on the campus.
Some of them pulled out their shirts, stripping their backs, shiny from sweat after the tense first day of the sports camp.
For many players of the team these minutes of indecision constitute a break in the middle of the day.
Players enrolled in summer classes will go back to the dormitory after three hours of training to prepare for the final exams, and the next morning they will return to the Vasserman football center at the meeting at 6:30.
Shortly before Monday turned into Tuesday, Browns team coach Jim Mora said: “In the next three days these guys are waiting for a meatball.”
The fact that the National Student Sports Association canceled training twice a day, which was designed to reduce the burden on players, actually prolonged their working day — at least until the exams ended on Friday.
Therefore, the start of the first three training sessions of the University of California at Los Angeles was scheduled for 7:15 p.m. to fit in the already tight schedule of the players.
The side effect of the absence of two workouts a day has been more days with one workout, and Bruins moves the start of the camp almost a week compared to last year and conducts workouts during the summer school for the first time in six seasons of the Sea in the West.
According to the schedule, they are scheduled to hold 18 training sessions until August 20, including before starting official preparations for the first game of the season against the A&M team at Texas University in September.
Mora said he supports a change in the rules from the National Student Sports Association, despite the fact that because of him in the tight schedule of the players appeared another point.
“In three or four days we’re giving them this huge burden, it’s a serious test,” Mora said.
“And they just got over it, they work, they’re great guys.
I think when we live until Saturday and we have more time, it's going to be really great."
When the camp is over, the University of California in Los Angeles will make the trainings closed; it is not an easy task, as its fields are in direct view with the adjacent parking lot of the front door and the front door of the slums of the neighbouring Laskin Center.
Bruins players are due to occupy the hotel from this weekend, but Mora admits that when the rooms are free during the season, there may be a problem.
“We will have security,” Mora said.
“It’s a serious problem, and I’m not exaggerating the danger, assuming that someone can take the room off, sit there and record the training on video.
If you have a workout video, it’s very serious.
But we'll have security there, and we'll have security in parking lot number eight.
We will do everything we can with what we have.
I won't worry too much about it.
We have a plan.”
All the victims of the terrorist attack in St. Petersburg have been discharged from hospitals.
All the victims of the attack on the St. Petersburg metro were discharged from hospitals in April.
This was reported in the press service of the Vice-Governor Anna Mityanina.
According to data at the end of July, three people remained in hospitals, reports TV Center.
The explosion in the metro station of St. Petersburg broke out on April 3 of this year.
The bomb was exploded by suicide bomber Akbarjon Djalilov.
As a result of the attack, 15 people were killed, as well as the perpetrator himself.
In the criminal case, 11 people, including the alleged organizer Abror Azimov, were arrested.
Recall, on the eve of Rospotrebnadzor recommended to the metro of St. Petersburg to revise the plan of measures to ensure transport safety, in particular, by increasing the number of metal detectors.
Facebook Boosts Fact-Checking in Fighting Fake News
Facebook will more often send texts suspected of mystification to independent experts and show their findings under original posts, the world's largest social network said on Thursday, which is trying to fight so-called fake news.
In a statement on its website, the company said it is starting to use improved machine learning algorithms to identify possible mystifications, send them for verification, and possibly display fact-checking results under the original post.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main ways to spread so-called fake news, which many believe influenced the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
The issue is also being actively debated in Europe after French voters were misled by false messages before the presidential election in May, and in Germany before the September elections declared support for the plan to penalize social networks if they do not be ashamed to quickly undo.
On Thursday, in a separate statement in German, Facebook reported testing a new fact-checking algorithm, which was launched in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
“In addition to seeing what messages are being challenged by independent reviewers, people want to have a wider context to make reasonable judgments about what they are reading and what they are sharing,” Sarah Sue, Facebook’s news ribbon manager, wrote in a blog post.
She added that Facebook will continue to test the “related articles” feature and work on other changes in the news bar to address the issue of fake news.
Create a novel-comic: A castle in English history
In the recent past, Scotty's tiny castle was filmed in the music video "Squeeze", and in the 1970s and 1980s served as a port for Margaret Thatcher.
But 700 years from his cozy place in the Bull River Valley in Kent County, he watched a tumultuous history around, and now inspired Jamie Rhodes, a Yorkshire man with a dry hair and a tendency to historical documents, for a comic novel.
“I think it’s so beautiful to look at the handwriting of a man who died 300 years ago,” he said.
“You feel it so personal when you hold this letter in your hand.”
"The Castle in England" covers the period from the Middle Ages to the Edwardian era and tells about the families who lived in Scotland; each story was illustrated by one of the young British artists - Isaac G. Lenkevich, Brian May Smith, William Axley, Beckley.
This is not the first book by Rhodes, which is based on archival data: in 2014 he wrote "Tooths of a Dead Man and Other Stories" - a collection of documents from the British Library; this project unexpectedly touched him to the depths of his soul.
“I could just scratch a fingerprint on the edge of a letter written in the 1700s by a double agent who worked on the Jacobites,” he says.
"It's his fingerprint."
And the letters always smell like smoke, because in those times a fire was lit for lighting.
And in 300 years, in the future, you think you're there too.
Oh, how I love the archives!"
For a person who has such a passion for old papers, getting support from the National Foundation and the English Arts Council and living in a castle for four months ("Honestly, I've been a little bit over there") seems too good to be true.
Rhodes spent days studying the “new” Victorian castle, walking through the archives, and looking at the many treasures of the mansion and old things – for example, hyenas on the walls or bottles that have been lying in the rubble for centuries.
He walked around the park and the ruins of the old castle, talking to woodworkers, gardeners, and sometimes artists working on illustrations for his book.
Then at night he "drinked the whiskey and sat down to write."
The history of Scottney Castle is not much studied, because the National Fund was given full access to it only in 2006, when the last heiress, Elizabeth Hassy, died.
When Rhodes arrived there ten years later, the staff had only just begun to deal with the archive, which he described as “what the aristocrats had fallen to the attic for centuries.”
Diaries, letters from the times of the British Empire, maps showing who owned what: “You think land disputes are boring,” says Rhodes, “but there were two families fighting for this birch.
That's the way it is, guys!"
In some of the history of the collection, the castle becomes the starting point for wider explorations in English history: for example, in "The Worker", the hero leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant revolution of 1381.
"There is information about the rebellion that took place in the castle in 1380, in a book called The Knights of Kent and Sussex," Rods says.
“The peasant uprising started in these places, and I thought the uprising was the right start.
Maybe they were connected?”
Other plots are closely related to the castle's history - for example, "The Priest", which tells of a Jesuit priest, whom the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or “The Smuggler,” about 18th-century smuggler Arthur Darrell, who is believed to have staged his own burials, filling the tomb with stones (this was discovered a few years later when the tomb was excavated).
Darrells are the favourite family of Rhodes from all that Scottney lived in: “The Gentlemen seem to have been a perfect scoundrel, forever in debt and spent money on things they couldn’t afford.
In different generations, Darrell men have solved their debt problems by marrying wealthy older women – I imagine them as a company of nice guys who know how to care for the heirs of the great estate.
After finishing work at the castle, Rhodes is looking for other opportunities to gain a unique writing experience.
He lived for two weeks in the Finnish deafness, where he wrote a graphic novel about Eliamyamyaki - a place where at the beginning of the 20th century there was a sanatorium, and then it grew again into a forest.
But Scotty remains a special place for him.
“I was sad to leave,” he said.
“I felt like, ‘Fuck you, I have to get back to real life again.’”
Fifteen of the largest banks choose "Russia"
The conflict in the Association of Russian Banks (ARB) is developing: following Sberbank, VTB, VTB-24, Alpha-bank, Gazprombank, Rosselkhozbank, Binbank and Okrtyie FK, seven other credit institutions are going to leave this organization altogether.
As a result, at least 80 per cent of the market will be accounted for by organizations that have left the ARB.
But this is not just an exit - all the banks that have declared a break with the ARB, are negotiating with another public organization that unites credit institutions, - the Association of regional banks "Russia", which is recognized by the <0xD0><0xA8><0xD0><0xB5><0xD1><0x80><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB4><0xD0><0xBE><0xD0><0xB2><0xD0><0xB8><0xD0><0xBA><0xD0><0xB8><0xD1><0x8F> and the financial politician Anatoly Aksakov, Chairman of the Committee.
The conflict within the ARB was set in the course of a discussion in the Federation Council, when the Interregional Banking Council considered new bills, in particular, suggesting a new classification of banks depending on the size of the statutory capital.
At the time, Garegin Tosunyan, the president of the ARB, said that, in the opinion of the association, this bill is adopted in the interests of the largest banks, which in this way try to limit the possibilities of small and medium-sized banks in the regions by intercepting their clientele.
Other claims included criticism of the Central Bank, which, in Tosunyan’s opinion, is not always justified in reviewing the licenses of some banks, which, however, was followed by objections from the representative of the Central Bank of Russia: many bankers, bankers, shareholders.
Evidently, this exchange of mutually exclusive opinions in the relationship with the main regulator of the banking environment has become a visible reason for the fifteen largest banks, having declared a disagreement with the policy of the ARB, began to prepare to join the association.
Investors will be better.
What's the deal going to end?
We will immediately answer the main question that arises with the slightest failure or conflict in or near the banking sector: investors will not be threatened, rather, the reliability of the banking system will increase.
Headed by Anatoly Aksakov, who is known for his ingenuity in everything concerning the interests of banks and their clients, a high-level professional, who is highly appreciated in the Central Bank: the representatives of the institutions of the central bank are through: practically all the management of the central bank is present at the annual events.
In the personnel-organization plan, obviously, there are also no special shocks.
Undoubtedly, the ARB gets into a difficult financial and managerial situation after losing such powerful and influential participants with their contributions and lobbying opportunities.
However, in this oldest organization, established in 1991, there is considerable potential for the banking community to continue to improve the banking legislation and the field of monetary and credit management as a whole.
It can not be said that in the Association "Russia" with extended arms are ready to accept under any conditions new members, judging by the reaction of its leader, Anatoliya Aksakov ("maybe, too much is wanted by the bank"), which is still July 21 at the briefing in the press.
Their proposals are to strengthen the voice of the bankers in the Association Council, as well as to pay more attention to new banking technologies.
The negotiation process is underway, the proposals of both sides are being studied, the agenda is being prepared for the extraordinary conference of the association, which will be held in Sochi in mid-September within the framework of the international banking forum.
That's where we'll figure it out.
Also, Anatoly Aksakov, stressing that "the chair does not hold", called possible new head of the renewed association "Russia" Georgiy Luntovsky, who leaves in September the post of vice-president of the Central Bank, highly characterizes and characterizes it.
On August 18, Anatoly Aksakov, who is now resting in Crimea, plans to pause the holiday for one day and arrive in Moscow, for an extraordinary meeting of the Council of the Russian Association, where it is intended to consider the agenda of the special congress of Russia.
Entry of gasoline-powered cars to major Russian cities will not be restricted
Deputy Head of the Ministry of Transport Nikolai Assaul said that, contrary to media reports, the entry of cars with gasoline engines into major Russian cities will not be limited.
This is a more radical form of our concept.
Our concept is that we need to gradually increase the environmental class.
And there the concept immediately moves to zero emissions.
I don’t think we are technically ready for that.
The question is, from what year?
This is the same thing at the level of slogans of the phrase - let's ban.
Where and when?
- Tomorrow?
Will the whole city shut down?
"In 20 years - I don't know, maybe that will happen," Prime Minister said.
Earlier, the newspaper Izvestia reported that by August 17, Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovic was instructed to study proposals on possible options for the state support of electric transport, submitted to the government by the Director General of PAO KamAZ Sergey Kogogin.
Among the proposals, according to the newspaper, is the use of cars with air conditioning in major cities and resorts.
Washington is changing the rules for getting a green card.
According to media reports, President Donald Trump said he would adopt a new U.S. immigration plan that would change the rules for obtaining a green card.
The plan provides for a reduction in the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, more stringent rules for obtaining temporary work visas and restrictions on obtaining family visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republican Party and supported by the President.
The bill will be discussed in two chambers of Congress.
“This law will reduce poverty, raise wages, and save taxpayers billions of dollars, and it will do so because of changes in how the U.S. is issuing green cards to citizens of other countries.
The law will reduce the chain migration and replace the existing scheme.
“The new application process will give advantages to candidates who own English, have the money resources that allow them to contain themselves, and have the skills that will benefit our economy,” Trump said in a statement.
The emergence of sex robots is real, and it should bother us
We failed to think that 2017 could not get any worse, a new report on technological successes in the production of sex robots has been released.
Yeah, yeah.
Sex robots are at the center of attention.
The Responsible Robotics Foundation (FRR) recently released a report on the development of sex robots in the next 5-10 years.
According to Noel Sharkey, a distinguished professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we should take their appearance seriously.
Users will be able to choose the eye color of the robots, the shape of the nipples and the type of nails.
“People are hilarious about it, but companies are already sending them to consumers in large numbers, and soon we will see a lot more of them,” Sharkey said at the presentation of the new report.
Modern sex dolls evolved from their inflatable comrades to robots with silicone skin, warm to the touch, and with almost human replicas controlled by artificial intelligence.
Users can also “tune” their robots to their taste, choosing everything from the color of the eyes and the shape of the robot’s nipples to the shape and color of the nails.
But the fact that many robots have a “personality” that Stepford Woman would appear to be very progressive is even more worrying.
Modern sex dolls have become robots with silicone skin.
For example, the company "RealBotix robot" allows users to configure the quality of robots that they find attractive - for example, shyness.
There are other Roxxxy Gold sex robots developed by True Companion that come with an already programmed individuality - for example, Cold Farra makes the impression shy, and Wild Wendy has a "brave" character.
“Roxxxy Gold has a character that fits perfectly with yours,” the True Companion website said.
That’s why she loves what you love, doesn’t love what you don’t like, and so on.
She changes her mood during the day, like a real person!
She may want to sleep or chat, or she may be "in the mood"!"
In the appearance of sex robots a lot of concern - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the most important concern is the subordinate image of a woman, the association with the rape, which is caused by the mastery of the Cold.
On the site "True Companion" Roxxxy is compared with a vibrator, only for men.
“If a woman (sic!) can have a vibrator, why can’t men have Roxxxy?”
But these sex robots are not just fetishes or just new sex toys.
Their appearance and increasing complexity points to something darker and deeper in our culture, to a departure from the ideal of gender equality toward the desire for sex with submission as an optional supplement.
Most men, of course, won’t buy sex robots, and while FRR notes their growing popularity, they’re still on the periphery of consumer culture.
But what is brought to us from the periphery can be very instructive in the sense of the epoch in which we live.
And many people are not stupid and not aggressive until the free market gives them the opportunity to do so.
It’s no coincidence that these complex sex robots came about when women’s rights around the world were under threat, when there is a president in the White House who boasts of being attached to women.
The most terrifying thing in the TV series "The Servant's Tale" is not graphic images, twisted bodies and squeezed eyes, but exactly how realistic this vision seems.
The Republic of Gilead is an exaggeration, but now it doesn’t seem that big.
The aim of the sex-robot industry is to achieve such physical resemblance to real women (only with proportions of porn stars) as technology allows.
Their creators want them to look human in the sense of copying the movements of the human body.
But it is precisely their "characters" that robots are not like real women.
They can’t break up with their partners or leave them.
They have neither their own life nor their biography – nothing that could indicate independence or anything else that could destroy the illusion of complete dependence.
In other words, they are beautiful slaves.
Or, as they say in 2017, maids.
The native of Los Angeles Eugene (Puch) Jeter, who has been representing Ukraine since 2013, will not help our national team in the European Basketball Championship, the final part of which will start on August 31.
This was reported in an interview with the BeBasket portal by the general manager of "blue-yellow" Andrey Lebedev.
We tried to make a deal with Jeter, but, unfortunately, he's not coming under family circumstances.
We will go to Eurobasket without a naturalized player because we don’t want to take someone we don’t know.
"This situation will provide opportunities for the development of our young players," he said.
Recall: with the direct participation of Jeter, the team of Ukraine took a record sixth place for itself at Eurobasket-2013 and for the first time came to the world championship of basketball, in which the "yellow-blue" team from the foreground of the 15th and midfielder were not able to overcome the group stage, and the USA was born.
Jeter has ceased to play for Ukraine since leaving the position of head coach of our national team American Mike Fratello, who left this position in 2015.
The men’s Eurobasket 2017 will be held simultaneously in four countries: Turkey, Romania, Israel and Finland.
The Ukrainian team will hold its group tournament matches on the Earth as promised.
Evgeny Murzin will have five matches in Group B: with Germany (31 August), Italy (2 September), Georgia (3rd), Lithuania (5th) and Israel (6th).
As part of the preparation for the tournament, our men's team held two control matches, in which it surrendered to the Dutch and Belarusians.
Trump's big deal?
Imagining Mita Romney seems very reasonable.
In the Trump era, the commonplace was the fact that political disputes that polarized the U.S. electorate have broken down some families at a micro level.
Between Thanksgiving and Christmas, U.S. newspapers smashed columns on how to deal with the terrible relatives who voted for Trump.
Looks like we're all tense so we're gonna blow up soon.
There’s less talk about Trump’s ability to unite families.
I am writing about this because my cousin, the left-wing views of a Chicago poet, who has long been knighted with Republicans in her family, came to me in New York this week.
It reminded me that uniting in the fight against the common enemy can have a strong effect.
With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican brother she’s been arguing with for decades, was suddenly and strangely on one side.
It’s certainly good for dinner; but I can’t help but think that in a broader context it can be quite dangerous.
Trump has pushed the forces to the left, but the deforming effect of his rule can move us all to the right.
When we talk about Trump and “normalization,” we mean the unlikely possibility that one day we will stop being affected by his exits.
There is, however, an even more questionable scenario in which Trump "normalizes" the most right-wing Republicans, who, against the background of his standards, will suddenly prove to be a model of common sense.
I realized that today I miss the old-fashioned madness of Mitt Romney - with a dog on the roof of a car and a 14 percent income tax (but at least we knew what his tax return looked like) - compared to Trump and that, and not much else.
When Trump leaves, the next Republican nominee will just have to be in his mind to see a huge step forward in him.
When my cousin went downtown, we went with the kids to a carousel in Central Park — the largest carousel in the New York State Parks Department’s farm and the best way to spend three dollars in the city if you don’t need caffeine.
The horses are ugly and huge, the images of fiberglass on the central drum - the playful clowns and the animals, who, bend, in horror, look at their backs - are extremely evil, and the ringing music, strangely, leads to delight.
So many famous things in this city are disappointing: the views from the skyscrapers are outdated, the silhouettes of the buildings are too crowded to cause tremors, and the reality of the city does not succeed in the dream.
Thirty-five years have passed, and I’m still experiencing the day when I learned that the Swiss Cottage area is not really a Swiss chalet (the theme pub “Ye Olde Swiss Cottage” is not on account), but a large circular intersection in North London.
And the carousel in the Central Park is still an unusual, magical place where a child of two years, a child of eleven years and two women of forty can have a great time.
If I could give the carousel an estimate, I would have put five, but luckily, no one asked me for it.
And in the department store this week, I was asked before I could hold a card at the terminal, to evaluate my "experience" of shopping on a scale of one to five stars.
In the coffee shop on the corner of my street still the same plus the option to accompany an estimate of tea at 15 percent is for order at the stand.
As a result, not only does neutral interaction slow down, but it is also necessary to introduce a personal attitude to a situation that does not imply it.
The poor seller in the department store was smiling confused while I was tired of evaluating my experience of handing her a five-star credit card.

Last year, he was transferred to a hospital to treat wrist incisions, which, according to the prison administration, he received as a result of a fall in the cell.
Pistorius was convicted of intentional murder after the prosecutor's office appealed to an initial sentence for unintended murder.
He killed Steinkamp early in the morning of St. Valentine’s Day in 2013, shooting at her several times through the door of the bathroom in his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius said he accepted his girlfriend as a night thief hiding from him in the toilet.
The prosecutor’s office has said it intends to file another protest, this time against Pretoria’s six-year term, which she says is too soft.
The Attorney General’s Office said it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the appeal would be considered this year.
The term of Pretorius can be increased by 15 years if the prosecutor's office succeeds.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
Suspect of beating a journalist of NTV selected a subscription for non-exit
Capital law enforcement officers chose a restraining order in the form of a no-show subscription for the man who attacked NTV journalist Nikita Razvozzhaev during a live broadcast from Gorky Park on August 2.
This is reported by TASS with reference to the official representative of the Ministry of Interior of the Russian Federation Irina Volk.
"As part of the investigation of a criminal case initiated under Art. 116 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation ("Poboys") in relation to a 32-year-old man who hit the face of a correspondent of one of the TV channels in the Central Park of Culture - a subreddit - a postcard of the name of Gorky, a suspect.
The representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs added that an administrative protocol had been drawn up in respect of the suspect for non-compliance with the police.
On Wednesday, August 2, during a live broadcast of VDV Day, an intrepid man approached the correspondent and hit his face.
As it turned out later, the hooligan has nothing to do with the airwaves.
According to Rashvozjaev himself, the paratroopers, on the contrary, tried to detain Moscow.
Two Bulgarians Arrested in Greece for Illegal Tent Parking
According to the BBC, two Bulgarian nationals were detained in Greece for illegal tent parking, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
On the morning of August 1, a group of people were detained in Sithonia who set up tents in an uninhabited place, including two Bulgarian citizens.
They were released on the same day, while the investigation is still underway.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed the TV channel "B-T-V" that Bulgarian citizens were later released.
The Greek authorities have tightened control over free camping and are already imposing serious fines on anyone caught while parking in a place not intended for this purpose.
Inspections will be conducted throughout the season.
According to the ministry, the court may impose a fine.
Russia’s Foreign Ministry Accuses U.S. Vice President of “Cold War” Rhetoric
Statements made during the European tour by U.S. Vice President Michael Pence have been criticised by the Russian Foreign Ministry.
“It is regrettable to note that Washington is becoming more and more deeply involved in the primitive ideologized stamps of the Cold War era, which are completely torn from reality,” the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
Thus, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs responded to Pence’s words about the “Russian threat” and attempts to force the crossing of borders, which he said in Podgorica.
The Russian Foreign Ministry pointed to the destructiveness of the choice "either with the West, or with Russia" and the obscurity of the thesis about the alleged unalternative accession of all South-Eastern Europe to NATO.
Russian diplomats also recalled that it was the United States that violated international law, using force to reject Kosovo from Serbia and thus created another focal point of tension.
“We call on our American colleagues to stop the smearing of Russia and its foreign policy line, which is invariably based on respect for partners and readiness to work together constructively, taking into account the mutual interests,” the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
Feldsher was injured in an accident with a "soon" in Podmoskovy
The accident occurred in the Moscow suburb of Stupino, as a result of the collision of a foreign vehicle with an ambulance, the fielder was injured.
Today at about 08:10 MSK there was a collision of Mitsubishi car with an ambulance in the city of Stupino of Moscow region.
"As a result of the collision, the machine "soon" turned," TASS said in the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Moscow region.
Employees of law enforcement agencies work on the scene of the accident, the circumstances of the incident are being investigated.
In the Odessa region, a woman threw on the construction of her newborn son, wrapped in a cellophane bag.
On the evening of August 3, the police department received a message from a local resident that he found in an unfinished private house a package with a baby.
“At the scene of the incident, law enforcement officers and doctors were taken out, who promptly brought the child to a medical institution,” the head of the Odessa National Police said.
Doctors have determined that the boy was born a few hours before his discovery, as evidenced by the presence of umbilical cord.
During the priority operative and follow-up activities, the identity of the Santa Claus - a 36-year-old local resident is established.
It was also found that the woman had three other minor children.
As noted in the chapter, in the field of view of law enforcement, the family did not previously fall and did not hold special account.
At present, the police determine the circumstances and reasons that have offered the woman to do so, after which a procedural decision will be taken.
The baby is now under the supervision of doctors.
As previously reported, in Nikolaev, a 21-year-old woman dumped her unborn child into a sewer.
Gregory Leps: "I'm breaking up in battle, although 55 - not 30"
One of the most successful artists of the Russian estrada, Grigory Leps, will celebrate his 55th anniversary on Sunday.
Before the celebration, the singer spoke with the viewer of Izvestia.
I remember how your "Second Colonel" was tagged.
A special tent in the "Liars", Gloria Gainor sang for the nominee, a powerful salute over the Moscow River.
You must have been pretending like you'd like to spend your next five years.
Plans come true?
Speaking of the profession, it was a good time.
I worked a lot, I toured the whole country three times, gave 120-130 concerts a year.
He has released two good albums.
Of course, I’m not what I was 20 years ago.
Biological clocks are not to be fooled.
Singing like I used to sing in my 30s is getting harder.
However, I'm in a fight, I don't want to stop.
And I'm with new people, I think I'm going to a different level.
You're recording a new album with them, the first in three years.
Yeah, he's working on it now.
Actually, we've all recorded in my studio, and now we're going to send him to Los Angeles for information.
It's called "Why are you so serious?" after the song of the same name, which was written together with Timothy.
It's not quite ready yet, so we haven't posted it anywhere yet.
We'll do it later when the clip is taken.
And the album will be presented in November - to the series of my anniversary concerts in Moscow's Crocus City Hall.
Your new record was hand-in-hand with the great American drummer Chris Coleman.
You seem to want to bring him into your tour crew?
In my opinion, Coleman is one of the most outstanding drummers in the world today.
He came to my studio, he recorded his parties.
I offered him to join my band, and Jeremy Colson (a well-known drummer involved in various projects. - "Izvestia") offered.
But for long-term work in Russia, they put forward, to put it mildly, excessive conditions.
The fees ranged from <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>35,000 to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>45,000 per month.
At that time, I thought that in the post-Soviet space, I would find worthy musicians.
And I found a great drummer Max Malyshev.
It’s better to feed them (laughs).
Sometimes I want to stick to one of them, not for what.
For example, guitarist Fedor Dosumov is highly quoted at the international level.
Western music magazines write about him, he is invited to various guitar festivals.
Steve Wei, after listening to his play, said that "a new generation of guitarists has arrived, with another performing technique."
Your album is set in Los Angeles, American musicians are collaborating with you, but you still can't come to the United States yourself?
Are you trying to lift that ban?
Now, to be honest, I'm not doing anything.
There are a number of lawyers who deal with this issue.
As a musician, I’m really sorry I can’t get to America.
I've said many times that I'm studying there.
The more you communicate with real professionals, the more useful it is.
We don't fool them, but we don't have that experience, school.
In front of our artists of popular music for 70 years, the tasks that have always been decided by American musicians have not been completely taken up.
They strive for the highest quality of sound.
I try to follow the same principles.
Now, for some reason, the UK has refused me entry for ten years.
But I will still submit my visa documents to the British Embassy every year so that I can be allowed to travel there again and, most importantly, to work there.
The rest of Europe is good to me.
And already in August, you're planning a concert in Monaco, not a custom, but a poster, right?
Yeah, Monte Carlo has a good gym. I've been there once.
Now they've been invited again, and as far as I know, all the tickets for the concert are already sold out.
Will you go to the Lyme Vaikula Rendezvous, which starts July 20 in Jurmala?
She invited me, and I, of course, responded.
Lyme is a wonderful singer and a wonderful woman who is able to serve herself both with a beautiful vocal and even a whisper.
After tours and anniversary concerts, as far as I know, you want to turn to Vladimir Vysotsky’s work.
You already have two albums with his songs in your discography.
When will the third come out?
Probably in the next year.
But it will be done in a completely different way.
I want to record about 80-90 songs of Vysotsky in about the same feed as he did himself.
Only the voice and the guitar.
There's no other arrangement.
I will be accompanied by our famous musician Timur Vedernikov.
I try to get involved in the album and Alexander Yakovlevich Rosenbaum.
I talked to him about it, we have a good relationship, but he's a busy man, so let's see how it goes.
You and Boris Grebenschikov's songs are gradually introduced into your repertoire.
Why don't you just record an album of his stuff?
Boris Borisovich is a wonderful man and a great musician.
I crossed over with him several times and asked, “Can I sing this or that song of his?”
He replied, "Hrigory, I'm writing songs to make them perform."
Please, try, sing.
I think it’s interesting to write an album like that.
I don’t have a similar task yet, but in the future, in a year or two, if Boris Borisovich doesn’t mind, I might do a project like that.
Unless you're completely focused on the business of your production center.
I guess until you realised his potential, you didn't sign contracts with all the artists you're interested in?
There are a number of performers I would have dreamed of having under my wing, but they are independent, self-contained people.
You mean Sergei Lazarev?
Sereja is a brilliant singer, I invited him.
I may not agree with his repertoire, but he is a professional and he has his own development strategy.
And in my center now there is Alexander Panyaotov, who I led in the Voice.
He and I signed a contract and we are working.
In our pop music, such singers are rare.
It will be a real shame if it does not reach the heights it deserves.
I'm trying to get him a repertoire, I'm filming clips.
I hope for a good result.
I also try to promote other artists in my center: I buy them songs, I cry to poets, sometimes their tracks get in the rotation of TV and radio channels.
If they don’t reach great heights, I will still bring our cooperation to a logical conclusion.
On the release, they will receive a recorded album, several clips.
And further, if they want, they can go their own way, and I will not insist that they return the money invested in them.
Although I would be happy if any of them were to achieve commercial success and pay me the interest that we agreed on in the contract.
But if that doesn't happen, I'm not going to cover anyone's oxygen.
Let everyone work, break through, prove like I once proved.
If tomorrow you are offered a tour of Ukraine and guaranteed entry into the country, will you go?
I'm still being invited there.
It is mainly about closed-ended events.
As for the big tour...
I am a man of my country, a Russian, of my own conviction, flew to Syria on the same plane that then crashed.
If tomorrow they say we need to fly to some other point in the interests of the state, I will fly.
I don’t care what other bloggers and critics think of me.
I sincerely regret that we have succeeded in this situation with Ukraine.
Because I believe that we are one people and should be together.
I'm sorry that this is unlikely to happen, at least in the near future.
In the past, I gave 40-50 concerts a year in Ukraine.
We met like nowhere else.
Very grateful to the public.
And he collaborated with several Ukrainian artists: Ani Lorak, St. Loboda, Artem Loik...
In Ukraine, there are a lot of talented people, and it is a pity that they are not able to fully express their talent to a wide Russian audience.
Music has to bring people together and entertain them.
I would be happy to invite some great Ukrainian performer to Russia, such as Slavu Vakarchuk, and to do a concert with him.
But I think it's unlikely at the moment...
Andrey Ohlopkova transferred from the cosmodrome
As the "I" became known, the technical director of the Oriental Cosmodrome Andrey Ohlopkov began work at the State Space Science and Production Center (GKNPC) named Khrunicheva.
Previously, he was de facto engaged in the construction of the Eastern Cosmodrome, but due to disagreements with the management of the Center for Land and Space Infrastructure Operations (CENKI) was transferred to the enterprise in the Moscow Branch, where the production will take place.
Mr. Ohlopkov will not have a replacement: the post of technical director is likely to be abolished, and the functionality is distributed to the CENKI units.
About the fact that the technical director of the East and the deputy director general of CENKI on technological development Andrey Ohlopkov went to work at the GKNPC named Khrunicheva, "I" told the top-managers of several enterprises of the government space industry, as well as co-operatives.
“He’s been working on a new post for several weeks,” the industry’s “E” spokespersons said.
It was not possible to get an operational comment from CENKI on Thursday, and Mr. Ohlopkov himself was not available for comments.
However, the information “I” was officially confirmed in the GKNPC.
He made a decision to move to the position of director of production coordination, - said at the enterprise. - Andrey Ohlopkov assigned to him the task of ensuring the launch minimum for the first launch on the Eastern cosmodrome fully fulfilled.
Mr. Okhlopkov went to work at CENKI in 2013, serving behind his shoulders in the space forces, in particular in Baikonur, and in Plesetsk - on the "northern" cosmodrome he held the post of first deputy commander in the name of colonel.
In 2009, Andrey Ohlopkov became a figurehead in the criminal case.
The investigation accused him of bribery: it is alleged that regional merchants received government orders for the cancellation of orders, but did not comply with the commitments made to clean up separate parts of carrier missiles in the Arkhangelsk region and the Republic of Komi.
In 2012, the jury found him innocent.
The responsibilities imposed on him at CENKI for technological development extended to various projects, but the main one was the construction of the cosmodrome in the Far East.
Oleg Ostapenko, the head of the Federal Space Agency at the time, said in an interview with “I” that the situation in the East “was already critical in October 2013.”
The fact is that a strategic mistake was made in planning: the completion of construction and the first launch of the Soyuz-2.1 carrier rocket were planned for the same time - the end of 2015.
To make the launch by the end of the year, it was decided to complete the construction half a year earlier and the deadlines were shifted from December to July 2015.
To speed up the process, it was necessary to go to tricks: CENKI specialists began to conduct parallel installation of technological equipment on underdeveloped facilities.
The main proponent of this idea was Andrey Ohlopkov.
Despite the existing risks and the transfer still taking place (instead of December 2015, the Soyuz only flew on April 28, 2016), this idea justified itself, says the source of the "I" for the spacecraft. "Otherwise we would not have done so.
Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin, curator of the creation of the cosmodrome, jokingly called Andrey Ohlopkova his "cosmic Susanin", but it was he who almost always asked for information about the course of construction.
Mr. Ohlopkov recalled and frankly: for example, in an interview "I" he proposed to deprive the Federal Agency for Special Construction (Specstroy) of the status of the only performer on the Oriental and directly to the corps to work with subcontractors: "Why should we all?
This idea has found support in the government.
Since 2017, CENKI has assumed the responsibilities of a general contractor to complete construction and installation work at the start-up and technical complex by the planned launches in the fourth quarter.
According to the “I”, the reason for the transition of Mr. Ohlopkov to the new place of work was disagreements with the management of CENKI about the ways of completion of the construction of structures and complexes of the cosmodrome, as well as methods of work with subcontracting organizations.
“It was decided that it would be better for everyone,” says one of the top managers involved in the construction of the Eastern one.
An employee of the government apparatus, in turn, calls the decision strange: "He was one of the best specialists, finding him an equivalent replacement will not be easy."
According to the "I", this will not be necessary: the post of technical director of the cosmodrome will be abolished, and its functions will be distributed to the units of CENKI.
In music schools there will be a two-professional training program
In the future, students of children’s music schools will be able to receive two specialties at the same time.
According to the Deputy Director of the Department of Science and Education of the Ministry of Culture Sviatoslav Golubenko, it is possible to re-read the recurring disciplines to students, and the issue with the payment of the remaining classes in the second specialty to resolve with the help of special grants, reports RIA Novosti.
"The Ministry of Culture has taken control of this issue, and together with the expert community we will develop a mechanism that will allow us to master two specialties, but at the same time will not contradict the current legislation in the field of education," - said Golubenko.
Last Friday during Vladimir Putin's "Weekly Conversation" with the educators of the children's center "Sirius" student Maria Andreeva said that she had to pay for recurring subjects for the second specialty at the Moscow Conservatory.
The girl told me that she is studying violin and piano class and has awards competitions in both directions.
The head of state recognized the issue as very relevant and promised to help.
In Mexico, a 17-year-old Russian was arrested on a wall on a skyscraper
In Mexico, 17-year-old Russian Cyril N., who climbed the roof of a high-rise building on the wall, reported the portal El Universal.
The incident took place in the capital of Mexico.
With the help of two unfamiliar men, the young man passed through a three-metre fence to the Nestle office building complex and drove on his own to one of its towers.
At the same time, he did not use any special equipment, insurance and rope.
The young man was already on the roof.
Officials of the Ministry of Public Security dropped him to the ground by helicopter.
He was then sent to the National Institute of Migration.
It is here to find out if the young person is legally in the country.
Meanwhile, a video with a young man climbing uphill has become popular on the net.
Users called the young man a "spider-man".
As the media writes, such experiments are a hobby for him.
Red meat, dairy products, and chocolate can help alleviate COPD.
Red meat and chocolate are considered a nightmare for your digestive tract.
But recent studies say the opposite: a diet rich in meat protein and dairy products can help alleviate symptoms in those who suffer from inflammatory bowel diseases.
This incurable disease, which affects approximately 1.3 million people in the U.S. and 300,000 in the UK, leads to colic and bloating, chronic or bloody diarrhea, weight loss, and extreme fatigue.
Usually, patients are advised to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate symptoms, but researchers at the University of Washington have found that the main amino acid protein tryptophan contributes to the production of immune cells that increase gut tolerance.
Lead researcher Dr. Marco Colonna explained that the immune cells in the intestines ensure that harmful microbes coming from food do not penetrate the body.
Cells that are able to trigger the inflammatory process are balanced by cells that increase tolerance, protecting the body, and at the same time do not harm sensitive tissues.
If the equilibrium is too much violated in the direction of inflammation, it can lead to inflammatory bowel diseases.
Experiments have shown that mice that have a certain bacterium in their intestines have increased cell tolerance.
And this bacterium needs tryptophan — one of the building blocks of protein — to trigger the appearance of these cells.
Professor Colonna said: “We have established a link between one species of bacteria – Lactobacillus reuteri – which is part of a normal gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that increase tolerance.
The more tryptophan was contained in the mice’s diet, the more these immune cells they had.”
He suggested that the same would work in humans: a combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan may contribute to a more tolerant and less prone to inflammation in the intestines.
Postdoc Dr. Luisa Servantes-Barraganvas, studying the variety of immune cells that increase tolerance, found that one group of experimental mice had these cells, and another group that belonged to the same line but was not contained separately.
She suggested that the difference could be caused by mouse gut microbiomes — communities of bacteria, viruses, and fungi that usually live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The DNA of the mice’s gut cells was sequenced, and six types of bacteria were detected in mice that had immune cells but were absent in mice that didn’t have them.
Mice raised in a sterile environment who did not have a good microbiome and did not develop this type of immune cells received L. reuteri, and immune cells appeared in them.
To understand how bacteria affect the immune system, the researchers grew L. reuteri in a liquid medium and then transferred small portions of the fluid — without bacteria — to underdeveloped immune cells secreted from mice.
Immune cells have been transformed into cells that increase tolerance.
When the active ingredient was separated from the liquid, it turned out to be a by-product of the processing of tryptophan, known as indole-3-lactic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice’s diet, the number of these cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the level of tryptophan was reduced by twice, the number of cells also dropped by twice.
Dr. Servantes-Barragan explains that humans have the same tolerating cells as mice, and most of us have L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known whether the by-products of tryptophan from L. reuteri contribute to cell development in humans as well as in mice, but defects in tryptophan-related genes have been found in people suffering from inflammatory bowel diseases.
She says, "Perhaps we need to intensify the development of these cells, because inflammatory processes on the inner surface of the intestines depend on these cells.
High levels of tryptophan in the presence of L. reuteri could potentially lead to an increase in their population.”
According to Jose Mourinho, “Manchester United” hired “genius” in the face of Nemanya Maticha
Manchester United have hired a genius in the face of Nemanya Maticha, according to Jose Mourinho after the defender made his debut in a match against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening.
The player, acquired for <0xC2><0xA3>40 million at Chelsea, started with a 2-1 win in Dublin in the last pre-season match of United before the UEFA Super Cup match, when they played against Real Madrid in a draw on Thursday and made an impression in the role.
However, as Matic did not take part in the pre-season tour of Chelsea in Asia, he seriously lacked preparation for the game, and he lasted only 45 minutes, which, according to Mourinho, requires revision before the start of the Premier League season.
“He needs time, but his experience, his mind, his genius is how he thinks – he thinks with football,” Mourinho said.
“We’re going to help him prepare sooner rather than later.”
Like Matic, his new teammates Viktor Lindelöf and Romela Lukaku started the game at the Aviva Stadium, when Mourinho began forming his main team by the start of the next season.
The Independent reported this week that Mourinho wanted to hire three more players, but stressed that the club had already achieved fantastic results by hiring three of the four players he would like to hire in the first place.
“I’m grateful to the club for getting three out of four,” he added.
“I’d be even more happy if they got me four out of four, but they’ve already tried very hard for me.”

Invalid Anton Mamayev was fined
Mosgorsud has eased the sentence of disabled wheelchair Anton Mamayev from four and a half years of imprisonment to a fine of 200,000 rubles.
Previously, by the Timirazevsky court judgment, the convicted person was released from CISO.
At the same time, the Mosgorsud confirmed that the accused is a criminal, because he organized the robbery and kidnapping of a motorist from a former special forces fighter.
Mosgorsud by his decision reduced the sentence of Anton Mamaev to 200,000 rubles. fine.
"Mamaev is the organizer of the robbery, which also constitutes the composition of the crime, and, accordingly, such a person should be brought to criminal responsibility," Mosgorsud press secretary Ulyan Solopov explained.
In this case, the court took into account the state of health of Mamayev, the actual circumstances of the case, the absence of aggravating circumstances.
In addition, the court applied Article 64 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, according to which it is possible to appoint a punishment below the lower limit.
As for Mamayev’s assistant Vasily Serostanov, the court did not establish the circumstances that would be the basis for changing the severity category of the sentence and changing the sentence.
Anton Mamaev himself said that he remained dissatisfied with the decision of the Mosgorsud.
I am disappointed by the court’s decision.
The only legal solution would be justification, intended to continue to fight for justice.
His lawyer Andrey Orlov did not rule out appeals against the sentence in the Mosgorsud cassation instance and the Supreme Court.
"We will use all the levers up to the European Court of Human Rights," he told RIA Novosti.
Recall, 28-year-old Moskvich Anton Mamaev, suffering from spinal muscular atrophy, became a criminal case figure in the autumn of last year.
Invalid claims to have bought a motorroller from acquaintances for 160,000 rubles to then sell.
However, the owners of the motor vehicle, among them - a former fighter of the special forces, said that the disabled and his assistant Vasily Serosthanov took away their property, threatening to use violence.
On June 30, the Timirazevsky District Court of Moscow sentenced Vasily Serosthanov to three years of colony, and Anton Mamayev - to four and a half years imprisonment with punishment in the colony of the general regime (according to article 2 of Article 162 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation).
After the disabled person was placed in the CISO, the case was joined by the Public Chamber, the Prosecutor General ' s Office, authorized for human rights under President Tatyana Moskalkova.
As a result, in mid-July Anton Mamaev was released from the SISO by the same Timirazev court.
The defence, in turn, appealed the decision of the first instance in Mosgorsud.
ONF to prepare the President's report on the environment
The final "Forum of Action" of the All-Russian People's Front (ONF) in 2017 will be devoted to environmental issues, a source in the ONF told Izvestia and confirmed the head of the executive committee of the movement Alexei Anisimov.
According to him, according to the results of the forum, the "Frontovians" plan to prepare a report to the president on the problems of the domestic ecology, as well as to propose a strategy for their solution.
Interlocutors of Izvestia in the ONF note that the report of the head of state will contain "deep analysis" of the situation in all federal districts of the country.
According to Izvestia, the final forum of ONF will be held in autumn.
The exact date of its holding has not yet been determined – as a rule, it is adapted to the schedule of the president, who is the leader of the movement and is traditionally present at key ONF events.
The Front held several interregional environmental conferences, one for two federal districts - in Rostov-on-Don, Kaliningrad and Kirov.
The final conference will be held in the capital of the Republic of Buryatia Ulan-Ude.
Based on the proposals that were made and will be made at these events, we will also form systemic proposals to solve environmental problems, - told "Izvestiam" an interviewer in ONF.
The Co-Chairman of the Central Headquarters of the Movement, Olga Timofeev, who heads the Committee of the State Duma on Ecology and Environmental Protection, said that the “frontsmen” will report to the head of state on the work carried out within the framework of the Year of Ecology in Russia.
The resulting environmental forum and the ONF Action Forum are likely to be combined.
Within a year, we have grown up with a powerful team of experts in the field of environmental problems, we have seen gaps in the legislation, we have stopped dozens of violations of the law.
All of this will be included in the report that we are preparing for the president as the leader of our movement.
In addition to this document, the "front-lines" are also reported on work on priority projects of the ONF, - told "Izvestia" Olga Timofeyev.
According to her, the special representative of the Head of State on environmental activities, ecology and transport Sergei Ivanov will be invited to the forum.
He had previously participated in the work of the ONF Media Forum, which was held in St. Petersburg in April.
In a few months, the Year of Ecology will go down in history, and the most important thing to do today is to launch environmental mechanisms so that they work for many years.
So that these issues do not fall off the agenda, - added Olga Timofeyeva.
Andrey Kolyadin, head of the regional policy laboratory of the Expert Institute for Social Research (EISI), noted that raising environmental issues, ONF is acting in the direction of the presidential agenda.
Many things they have offered as experts in various forums, and these initiatives have received the support of the president, - said Andrey Kolyadin.
He stressed that the economic potential of the environmental agenda cannot be excluded at present, which could give the regions an additional impetus for development.
In the future, with the help of ONF, the regions will be able to prolobby not only the solution of their environmental problems, but also the development of ecotourism, - added the expert.
The relevance of the environmental theme was demonstrated by a “direct line” with Vladimir Putin in June.
In particular, the president was asked questions about the garbage dump in Balashikh (already closed) and about the coal dust in the port of the city of Nahodka (already draft law on the prohibition of open transportation of coal in settlements, one of the authors - Olga Timofeev).
Experts in the field of ecology believe that the legal basis for solving environmental problems in Russia as a whole is established, the question lies in further law enforcement practice, as well as in the position of civil society.
We need a clear implementation of the decisions taken by the state, - believes the head of the charity fund "Ecology for all" Leonid Bochin.
Sergey Tsiplenkov, the head of the non-governmental organization "Greenpis of Russia" in a conversation with "Izvestia" emphasized that in order to successfully solve environmental problems, a responsible approach of society and business, some legislative efforts are small.
As soon as society and business realize that the solution of environmental problems is a much more beneficial step in the strategic perspective, the situation will change, - said Sergey Tsiplenkov.
The expert emphasized that it is necessary to transform the trend into that the violation of environmental legislation is an economically advantageous solution for the business.
A British inventor invented a microchip to get into a house and a car by swinging his hand.
The British inventor became the first person in the country to install a microchip so that he could open the door of his home, enter the office and even drive a car with a simple handshake.
Thirty-three-year-old Stephen Northam has made a tiny chip between his big and index fingers and now through his company BioTech offers this service to companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives through technology.
He teamed up with Dr. Jeff Watson, an anesthesiologist consultant from the Royal University of Winchester, to ensure that the application procedure was conducted in accordance with medical standards.
The technology is similar to a microchip that is fed to cats and dogs, and the procedure takes only 30 seconds.
The company also replaces locks in homes and cars with chip-compatible locks at a price of <0xC2><0xA3>300 per lock.
The married father of one child has already installed the technology in his home and in his car "BMW Z4", which is manufactured when his hand is on the steering wheel.
The requisite for the White House cost taxpayers thousands of dollars.
According to the records of the armed forces, provided to the magazine «TIME», the decision of the White House last month to squeeze the helicopter of the Marine Corps into the South Lawn at an event dedicated to American industrial production, cost taxpayers as much as 24,000 to.
The white-green Sikorsky VH-3D, known as “Marine One” when the president is on board, became the central element of the July 17 White House event where U.S. construction programs were demonstrated.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, and top White House officials have inspected technology products from all 50 states.
The helicopter, made in Connecticut, was on display next to a yacht from the state of Man, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a truckloader from Mississippi.
According to the records of the First Marine Helicopter Squadron (HMX-1), the department responsible for the management of the helicopter, the Military Administration of the White House ordered the presence of a helicopter in a private order, or "FRAGO" aircraft, only 36 hours before the helicopter arrived.
“I just wanted you to make sure that you were aware because this is an unusual event that is widely discussed in the press,” the commander of the HMX-1 wrote in an e-mail to his boss, the first deputy chief of aviation of the Marine Corps, on the eve of the event.
The letter indicated that the helicopter would arrive at the South Lawn around 7 a.m. on July 17 to participate in an event scheduled for 3 p.m. and will remain there until the lawn is released between 6 and 9 p.m. on the same day.
The letter adds that if the departure from the White House is delayed, a second crew will be required for the return flight in accordance with working hours restrictions.
The first crew escorted the helicopter during the event, and the unit's security personnel remained close to the aircraft while it was on the ground.
From the records obtained by TIME magazine, it remains unclear whether a second crew was required in the end.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal officials from using state property for political purposes.
According to the records, HMX-1 has clarified whether the measure is contrary to this decision.
"We asked if this was a violation of Hatch's law, and we said no," the commander wrote.
“You don’t seem to be going anywhere,” the deputy chief replied.
The "Made in America" event was declared by the White House as an official event, and the Hatcha law did not apply to it.
But even the official events have a political note.
During the event, the president made efforts to advance the health care reform that was in development at the time in the Senate, and praised attempts to regulate government decrees.
The use of aircraft known as “Marine One” and “Air Force One” for political purposes is unlikely to be a new phenomenon.
The presidents are required to use them for travel.
But to ask them only in the interest of photoopportunity is unusual.
Trump had already been the subject of discussions in February, when the presidential plane ran in the background during his first election rally in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account was flooded with complaints about the use of the presidential plane in front of him.
“The White House is thrilled with the show Made in America, which featured products from 50 states made by American workers from American materials,” White House Deputy Press Secretary Lindsay Walters said in a statement.
The HMX-1 crews often carry out training flights around the Washington agglomeration and on the Southern lawn to train the transportation of the President of the United States to the White House with accuracy up to an inch.
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany in early July, the HMX-1 held 58 training landings at the White House.
According to one of the officials, the flight, made for the event "Made in America", was calculated for the crew at the expense of the necessary training flights in a month.
The unit’s helicopters also flew 11 additional hours that day as part of the “non-presidential task of providing support.”
According to the White House, taxpayers were not charged for any of the other exhibits presented at the event.
The representative of the company "Sikorsky" said that the company did not participate in the organization of the demonstration of the helicopter on the South lawn.
HMX-1 does not take into account the budget for presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact amount spent on the event.
But, according to the hourly rates of the Ministry of Defense for the 2017 fiscal year, the rate of compensation of the Ministry of Defense for the VH-3D is 24,380 US dollars per hour of flight.
The records of the unit recorded that the time of the aircraft in the air was 30 minutes in each direction from its airfield based on the air base of the Quantico Marine Corps in Virginia.
The White House claims that the actual cost of using the helicopter is much lower than this rate.
“It’s completely wrong to calculate the value for taxpayers based on the approximate rate of reimbursement,” says Walters.
“These approximate rates include personnel, maintenance and many other irreversible costs that are included in the annual allocations.”
According to a study carried out in 2015 by the REND Corporation, the rates of reimbursement do not include the cost of the personnel, but, indeed, take into account the cost of the fuel, the service and the costs specified in the contract.
At the time, former White House press secretary Sean Spicer was in favour of using the helicopter for the event.
“The idea is to demonstrate the things that were done in America this week,” Spicer said.
“And I know that Sikorsky and Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they are contributing to national security, and that there are, I guess, hundreds, if not thousands of people whose jobs depend on it.
And I think, like most Americans, that we are all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment, which so many Americans have worked tirelessly on.
Therefore, of course, it is quite appropriate to pay attention to this.”
It was unclear whether Trump was interacting with the helicopter while inspecting the South lawn during the event, but he was definitely in the driver’s seat in the fire truck.
Inside the White House, Trump turned to representatives of Sikorsky, joking with the press on the subject of his own fleet of products of the company.
“I know Sikorsky very well,” the president said. “I have three of them.”
Moscow to allocate grants for resuscitation departments of urban hospitals
Each year, "Saving Life" grants will be awarded to resuscitations and intensive care departments of the capital clinics.
The funds will be used to encourage doctors and nurses.
The mayor of Moscow Sergey Sobyanin visited the City Clinical Hospital named Judena.
During the examination of the clinic, he handed over a thank-you letter to the doctor-traumatologist-orthopedist Viktor Protsko, under the guidance of which the most complex operation to reconstruct the foot of a teenager was carried out.
Sergey Sobyanin also told about the decision to award grants annually to the rehabilitation and intensive care departments of urban clinics.
The funds will be directed to the encouragement of doctors and nurses.
According to the mayor, the Yudina Clinical Hospital is one of the largest in Moscow to date.
In recent years, the clinic has received new modern equipment, allowing its doctors to perform unique operations.
The clinic was opened in 1961 on the basis of the Kolomen Rural Hospital.
Currently, the departments of the medical institution are designed for the reception of more than a thousand patients.
In addition to resuscitation and hospital, there are daycare facilities here.
The staff of the hospital has 2,800 people.
The total area of the clinic is 23.7 hectares.
In February of this year, the medical institution became a participant in a pilot project on the organization of short-term hospitals (SCP).
They are designed to carry out relatively small operations.
In the process of surgical interventions, advanced medical equipment is used, which allows to significantly reduce the time of rehabilitation of patients.
After the surgery, they only spend a few hours in the hospital.
In the first half of this year alone, 36,000 patients were hospitalized at the Yudin Clinical Hospital.
Medical staff of the clinic performed 15,800 surgeries of varying degrees of complexity.
NBU reported on the absence of buyers of Ukrainian "daughter" Sberbank
The National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) reported the absence of applications for the purchase of the Ukrainian "daughter" of Sberbank.

Sberbank announced the sale of its Ukrainian “daughter” to Norvik Banka consortium and a private Belarusian company in March this year.
The majority shareholder of the consortium was Said Gutseriev, the son of Russian businessman Mikhail Gutseriev.
Sanctions against the “dotches” of five Russian banks in Ukraine, among which Sberbank was found, were introduced in mid-March.
During the year, they are prohibited from withdrawing capital from the country in favor of parent organizations.

Democracy in Afghanistan depends on the role of women in politics, the UN said.
The elections can only be representative if they are attended by all members of society, including women, the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan said on Wednesday.
According to Nikolas Haysom, the current head of the United Nations Assistance Mission to Afghanistan, hundreds of women are running for provincial council elections, three women are fighting for the post of vice president, and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
“The role of women cannot be overestimated,” he said in a statement on Wednesday.
The choice can be fully representative only when women are fully involved in them and included in all stages of the electoral process.
Elections to the provincial councils and presidential elections will be held in Afghanistan on April 5.
The Taliban is threatening to disrupt the election process, which coincides with the transition of international forces from combat operations to the role of advisers.
In this year’s election, power is transitioning peacefully from one democratically elected government to another for the first time.
Haysom said that increasing the role of women would contribute to the success of democracy in Afghanistan.

Electricity is cheaper for both residents and for the producers of goods in Buryatia
The more than a decade-long efforts of the Soviet and post-Soviet authorities of the Republic of Buryatia (Eastern Siberia) to establish fair tariffs for electricity consumers are beginning to bear fruit.
From September 1, the cost of low-voltage electricity for industrial receivers is reduced by 25%.

As a result, the cost of electricity for Buryat commodity producers is reduced by a quarter, which will make life much easier for small and medium-sized enterprises and individual entrepreneurs.
For many decades, the leaders of the republic have crossed the thresholds of the Moscow cabinets in vain attempts to equalize the region in tariffs with the neighboring Irkutsk region with a cascade of hydroelectric power plants in Angara, the cotor is from Buikal, the main water supply area.
And it was only this year that the moves began.
In March, tariffs on electricity for the population of the republic were reduced from 4.24 rubles/kWh to 3.93 rubles/kWh, or by 7.3%.
With the inclusion of Buryatia by the decision of the federal government in the list of wholesale market price zones, for which the features of the functioning of the wholesale and retail markets have come among industrial consumers.
According to analysts, this is only the beginning, as the population of the Irkutsk region pays per kilowatt hour 1.01 rubles.
But no one dares to name at least the approximate date of the new tariff moves towards the downward trend for Buryatia.

In a letter to the head of the facility owned by the company, the Scottish branch of GMB demanded McVitie's response to concerns that funding would not be allowed for the modernization of the production lines.
Dr. Duffy, senior organizer, said: “The members of our trade union are deeply concerned that we cannot get clarity from the head of the facility on the business needs and investment plan regarding the future of Tolcross.”
Families have worked here for generations, and the concentration of workers is great in local society and in the Greater Glasgow; it is the most important pillar of decent work in the territory of high unemployment and social deprivation.
Thus, from the point of view of jobs, wages and prosperity, and against the backdrop of Brexit, the growth of the living minimum and the chronic decline of production, East & Glasgow desperately needs the prosperity of production at McVitie’s factory.
According to the representative of Pladis, “The manager of the tolcross facility only yesterday received a letter from the Scottish branch of GMB, and the company will respond immediately, as we appreciate our constant cooperation with employees and representatives of the trade union.”
Two months ago, we held a regular meeting in Tolcross with employees and representatives of GMB, at which a number of issues were discussed openly.
We talked with our employees about how, like all companies operating in the most competitive and unstable economic climate, we are constantly revisiting our actions – and this applies to all of our facilities and activities – to remain competitive.
“In recent years, we have invested more than <0xC2><0xA3>5 million in our crossover facility, especially in production lines and improving functional performance.”
We are fully aware of the value of Tolcross as a production facility, and in case of any changes in the work at this facility, the employees and representatives of the trade union will be the first to know about it.”
Putin said the authorities would not give instructions to Rosneft and Gazprom
Vladimir Putin said that the issue of gas supplies to the Eastern Petrochemical Company (VNHK) should be connected by the Kremlin and the cabinet of ministers, but no one will give instructions to Gazprom, like Rosneft.
Thus, the President of Russia Vladimir Putin responded to the request of Igor Sechin to assist in resolving the conflicts.
The head of state noted that the relationship between Rosneft and Gazprom should be resolved solely on the basis of market principles.
Earlier, the head of Rosneft, Igor Sechin, at the meeting on the implementation of large investment projects in the Far East Federal District, said that the lack of agreement with Gazprom on gas for VNHK jeopardizes the implementation deadline.
Sechin noted that the dialogue with Gazprom on this issue is ongoing.
Gazprom offers to find gas resources from the perimeter of Rosneft, but we do not have such resources,” said Sechin.
We will remind that Rosneft has asked to allow it to use gas from the Kirinsky Gazprom field, located on the shelf of Sakhalin, for the Eastern Petrochemical Company.
In June, Gazprom said that negotiations on the issue are ongoing, and “there are no sharp corners there.”
Did PSG warn Barcelona of Neymar’s transition three years ago?
La Liga member may regret his interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not stop chasing Neymar after the club offered <0xC2><0xA3>189 million for his ransom, but did they warn Barcelona about the world record-setting raid that took place three years ago?
The sensational offer revived the summer transfer window, when the League 1 club was ready to beat the world record for the cost of the transition, more than double the previous mark associated with the return of Pol Pogba to Manchester United last season.
When the transition is over, Neymar will be the most expensive player in the world, as well as the highest paid professional athlete in the world, as PSG offers him a salary of over <0xC2><0xA3>500,000 a week net.
It is known that “Barcelona” is angry at how the offer was made and how Neymar broke the contract, despite the fact that, as a source close to the Catalan club’s leadership insists, the club has always done everything possible for the player since 2013.
But wasn’t the football world warned of such an opportunity three years ago by the president of PSG?
When Manchester City expressed interest in hiring Blaze Mathuide in 2014, Nasser Al-Helayfi issued a strong warning to any club that would like to lure one of PSG’s top players.
“I’m not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we’re going to stand against them, we’re going to make offers to their players,” he said.
"We respect all of the clubs with respect.
But if they try to recruit one of our players, they will have consequences.”
Apparently, Barcelona crossed this line when the Spanish club earlier this summer expressed an interest in the midfielder of PSG Marco Verratti.
PSG has made it clear that it will not release the Italian team under any conditions, and now Barcelona is probably feeling the consequences of its offer in the form of the loss of one of its most valuable players, Neymar.
Putin ordered to deal with the payments of the victims of the forest fires.
The President of Russia Vladimir Putin ordered to understand the financial assistance, which is allocated to the victims of the forest fires residents and for the construction of new housing.
Today I would like to hear how the work is going.
Including, please report on the situation of payments and compensation to the affected citizens.
I have some sort of divergence.
“I would also like to ask the relevant colleagues about how much money has been allocated,” Putin said at a meeting with the leaders of the regions located in Baikal.
On August 4, Vladimir Putin visited the Baikal State Biosphere Reserve.
Putin was accompanied by the authorized representative of the President of the Russian Federation in the Siberian Federal District Sergei Menyaylo and the head of the Baikal branch of the FGBU "Glavrybvod" Leonid Mikhailik.
They talked about the work on the cleaning of the lake.
They then showed the kids in an open container next to the container, which they prepared for distillation.
At first, Putin let a few boys out of the box.
Then I pulled a special lever on the lid of the container and released the rest.
Also during the trip, the leader instructed to deal with the environmental situation on Baikal and build a road on the island of Olhon.
According to the Ministry of Interior, one volume is required, and another volume is supposed to be provided.
"I want to deal with this, what is actually happening there with our funding," the Russian leader stressed.
In the course of the forest fires of 2017, the settlements of Buryatia, Irkutsk region, were covered by fire, residential houses and commercial buildings were destroyed.
