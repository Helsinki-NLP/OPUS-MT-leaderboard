The Prague Stock Exchange Has Been Minused at the End of Trade
The Prague Stock Exchange has corrected its losses after the early morning crash.
Transactions with the shares of the Czech Energy Industry Company (<0xC4><0x8C>EZ) accounted for almost half of the usual daily trade.
The Prague Stock Exchange began its downturn on Monday from the start of trading on Tuesday, when it fell by almost six percent.
This time, the fall in Wall Street shares is behind the decline.
This is how the market reacts to the result of the vote of the US House of Representatives, which rejected the support for the stabilisation plan for the financial sector there.
Falling stocks in Asia
The Asian stock market experienced a dramatic drop in stocks on Tuesday, although the indicators over the course of the day eventually erased some of the losses.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng stock index down nearly four percent during trading, but later wiped out some of the losses and reduced the decline to around 2.5 percent.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, which monitors Chinese stocks, fell 3.8 percent, and markets were closed in Shanghai.
The shares of the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than five percent, but in the end the losses fell to 4.3 percent.
Taiwan’s stock market fell 3.6 percent, according to the local index.
“The timing of the U.S. bailout is uncertain and affects the world’s money markets,” said Joseph Yam, head of the Hong Kong Financial Council.
Hong Kong, although part of China, determines its monetary policy independently, i.e. independently of the Chinese central bank.
In Hong Kong, interest rates are at the same level as in the United States.
Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said the U.S. legislators should immediately reopen negotiations and accept a proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, there is a threat that other countries will feel the consequences of this.
The Bloodbath of U.S. Stocks
The U.S. House of Representatives on Monday rejected a plan to support the financial system, which would have to be spent $700 billion (almost 12 trillion kroner).
Lawmakers have thus ignored President George W. Bush’s call to support the plan.
Bush said the bill would solve the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
On Monday, U.S. stocks underwent a bloodbath, and leading stock indices recorded the biggest drop in 20 years.
The Dow Jones fell by almost seven percent, with a similar rate of decline last seen in 1987.
The index fell just before the vote, but as it turned out that the proposal was not accepted in the House, the index began to free itself.

The chief executives of the U.S. Congress and President George W. Bush’s government agreed on a broader form of agreement and financial assistance to the U.S. financial system.
We will vote on this at the beginning of next week.
U.S. lawmakers have reached a breakthrough in negotiations to approve the emergency plan in the form of financial aid to the U.S. financial system in the amount of $700 billion (about 12 billion kroner).
But there's no victory yet.
In fact, the Congress must complete some details of the agreement before they can make public the final form of the law and their vote.
The draft support for the financial system will be discussed in the House on Monday.
This was reported on Sunday by Reuters news agency Barney Frank, the chairman of the Committee on Financial Organizations.
According to Senate sources, the bill is likely to be voted on Wednesday as soon as possible.
According to economists, it should be announced that the bailout plan will be approved, which is the first important psychological factor for the revival of the money markets.
However, due to the complexity of the mechanisms, "exploitation" takes place afterwards.
Paulson: The plan should be effective
“We have taken a big step.
We have resolved our differing views on what the form of the package should be to stabilize the market," Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, told Bloomberg.
He said the final vote could be held on Sunday.
Lawmakers met with U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson on Saturday night to give a final form of government funding.
This should buy out unsold mortgage assets from financial firms, which would put financial firms in serious losses and jeopardise the stability of the entire system.
“We are close to a final agreement on a plan that will work and that should be effective in the market at the same time.
The remedial plan still needs to be continued, but I think we’re there,” Paulson said.
Significance of Asian Trade
The global financial crisis has a significant impact on the stock markets, which are falling sharply.
U.S. Senator Harry Reid says lawmakers are seeking to make a final deal in Congress on Sunday.
They want to reassure investors before trading in the Asian money markets, where the time zone could be the first to impact Monday’s decision by Congress, which would have an impact on trading.
It is not yet clear, however, whether the two chambers of the U.S. Congress will vote on the law, nor whether the hearing will be held at the last minute because of any problem.
The legislators hope that the law will be passed in the coming days.
However, the law is still undergoing many changes.
The total amount intended to assist the scheme shall be divided into two parts.
At the request of President George Bush, the first $350 billion should be made available as soon as possible.
However, Congress could block the issuance of the remaining amount, which was set at an additional $100 billion and later at $350 billion, if it feels that the program is not fulfilling its function.
Bush Appreciates Progress in Negotiations
While the president may veto this decision, Congress may override the veto.
Despite these changes, however, the main idea of the program remained, which was to acquire material assets for the purchase of bad mortgage securities that lost their value, as hundreds of thousands of Americans were unable to clear their mortgages.
"We've worked out everything.
"The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the bill on Sunday and the Senate on Monday," Republican Senator Judd Gregg said.
With the progress made in the negotiations, President Bush was also pleased.
Bush spokesman Tony Fratto said the president was satisfied with Saturday's progress and appreciated the "bilateral efforts made to stabilise our financial markets and defend our economy".
Restriction of bus end-of-life allowances
The chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, Christopher Dodd, who led the negotiations, said the legislators agreed on the responsibility for the financial program, the protection of taxpayers from losses, the closure of benefits, and the timing of funding.
The new law also restricts the end-of-life allowances of the directors involved in the program and establishes a supervisory committee for the fund.
The fund should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
“We have worked very hard on this and have made great progress towards a deal that will work and that will benefit all Americans,” Paulson said.
The plan also counts on the help provided to homeowners who have problems with the cancellation.
The government should develop new depreciation items at the mortgage bonds it buys, with the aim of reducing the monthly depreciation items of debtors and allowing them to keep their homes.
Marek: Spiritual help
According to David Marek, chief economist at Patria Finance, the proposed project is a good idea, but its implementation will be very difficult.
"All this because it is not possible to know by what mechanism and at what price the problematic assets will be purchased.
This will determine how the financial sector and the government divide the losses among themselves," Marek told iHNed.cz this week.
Marek says it's not so important that the plan is approved now or at the beginning of next week.
“It is much more important that Congress decide this week that the plan will be supported and, as soon as possible, be blessed.
The spiritual importance of agreeing that the plan will be approved is the most important thing at the moment," Marek said.
Fight live: MP3 players versus mobiles.
We help you how to choose
While almost all mobile phones are capable of playing MP3 files, no MP3 player can be called.
From this, it seems clear that it is better to just buy a phone.
Nevertheless, there are many reasons why you should get a separate MP3 player.
The choice depends entirely on the method of use and the needs of the future owner.
You’ll probably find it hard to get a high-end record player at home to listen to the latest Maxim Turbolenc disc.
On the one hand, such music products do not appear on backup records, but there is no objective reason for this in terms of quality.
However, if shelves are full of art rock, jazz or blues backing tracks, you’re probably dreaming of such a record player.
This is similarly meant for travel, i.e. compressed - simplified with MP3 music.
There are also price and quality categories here.
For some, it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns for a player, as a Pink Floyd fan is likely to find it difficult to accept a twenty-crown market earbud.
There are two extremes between which everyone has enough space.
The choice is wide.
The lifespan of the elements also counts
Some top-quality music players are capable of much more than just playing music, but also one that most mobile phones don’t even accidentally play.
No device today is as versatile as a phone.
In addition to the primary functions of telephoning and texting, you can also play music and video, record both, have a better or worse camera, and even navigate.
And if you take smartphones and communicators into account, you'll have a small computer in your pocket.
This is a small miracle, because no refrigerator can grill and no TV can take pictures.
There are also disadvantages to more functional mobile phones.
The more features you use on your mobile, the more times the display sends to the charger.
And music playing is one of the biggest energy bars.
Few mobile devices are able to play music for more than ten to twelve hours, which is usually much less.
In this respect, the music players (especially the simplest ones) are significantly more performant.
For cheap phones, you should expect that they won’t be playing for you for more than a few hours.
If you are also on the phone here and there, get an additional charger for your workplace for safety – this also applies to more expensive devices.
You won’t have this problem with MP3 players, even worse ones can withstand at least 9 hours of continuous operation with a single upload.
The next problem occurs when uploading music to a mobile device.
Unfortunately, only a limited number of devices have a universal USB connector, and not all of them can be connected directly to the computer without special software.
Of course, the music can be recorded directly on the memory card, but only a few card readers can cope with the miniature memory cards used in mobile phones without an adapter.
With a few exceptions, players (iPods) don’t need any special software.
It is enough to charge the device from the computer with music via USB.
The majority of mobile phones and players are already creating a music library that is sorted by the performer, album, genre name, or, for example, the user’s rating.
Some devices only depict a tree structure similar to Windows Explorer, and some know both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smartphones with operating system).
Players are easier to handle, mobiles know more
When choosing a specific device, you should be interested in the battery life, the memory capacity, the quality and type of sound output and, of course, the convenience of handling.
If the music is primarily for you as a background and only listens for a short time a day, for example, on the radio, any MP3 player is right for you.
This is what any mobile phone can do.
You don’t have to pay any particular attention to what music formats your mobile phone or player knows.
Everyone can handle MP3, and the vast majority of the music that comes to you will be in exactly this format.
MP3 is one of the most widely used, and the vast majority of devices also handle WMA-formatted music.
AAC (the format used by Apple and iPod) is less common.
Better mobile phones also make it possible to buy music online, for example.
It is enough to visit the relevant pages of the provider (or other service provider) via the mobile internet and buy the song or album.
This service in itself can be a compelling argument for the purchase of a music mobile.
Unfortunately, the offer of service providers is deaf and is usually limited to one-year radio broadcasts.
The prices are also the lowest.
In general, however, it can be assumed that this particular method of selling music (either on GSM, online, or wireless internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
The majority of people are constantly keeping their mobile device with them.
Whenever he wants to listen to something, he puts his cell phone in his pocket, while the forgotten MP3 player is hovering at home.
However, it still depends on whether you always carry the headphones or at least the headphones.
If not, you can use the built-in speaker, which has almost all mobile, but only a few MP3 players.
For many, the most likely advantage of music mobiles will be the price.
The cheapest ones are usually less than 3,000 kroner.
You can get a decent walkman between three and four thousand crowns.
Most of the time, however, you are limited by the lack of output of a traditional earbud.
The best and most technically equipped phones with conventional 3.5 mm-diameter hole earbuds can cost up to 15,000 crowns.
At the same time, the advantage of the players, apart from others, is the ease of handling.
The simplest thing - by no means necessarily dealing with the cheapest players (see our selection) really everyone can cope.
Minimal function, similar to the previously standard cassette magno or gramophone, is obvious.
There is no threat of collapsing in the form of an accidentally turned on mobile internet, nor in the case of a huge account for data transmission thereafter.
What kind of device to choose
The cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) also generally have access to interchangeable memory cards (M2, microSD type, etc.).
With the purchase of the right card, it can be added to a maximum of two thousand crowns.
But you have to be careful.
Basic types only support cards with a maximum capacity of up to 2GB.
Only the most expensive ones know what to do with up to 8GB of memory cards.
If you already have a mobile phone and want to buy a cheap MP3 player, choose Cowont, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iris.
Based on the capacity (max. 2 GB) you do not need to spend more than 1,100 crowns.
If you belong to more demanding students, choose special mobile walkers (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices also have a separate MP3 handle button, so the convenience of handling approximates the MP3 player.
The most widespread in the industry was Sony Ericsson, which has the same user interface for walkman-series mobile phones as the separately sold MP3 players.
The MP3 players of the brands mentioned above can provide the same service in the same price category up to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>4000, but with higher memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery life (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours).
The first virtual service provider will arrive in the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe.
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is relatively advanced and our service providers offer virtually the same services as their Western European partners.
Nevertheless, something is missing for us here - a virtual service provider that forces classic service providers to make significant price cuts.
Maybe it won't be for a long time.
On the website Mobil.cz we have written many times that Czech service providers are among the most expensive in Europe.
This was also confirmed by the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>, which drew attention to the fact that the price of SMS in the Czech Republic is more expensive than in other EU countries.
As a result of the European Commission's recent move to regulate roaming charges, there may be a conflicting situation - some of the customers of the Czech mobile service providers will receive text messages from abroad cheaper than the domestic ones.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic are so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is a lack of competition that really wants to get into a fight.
This may sound contradictory, as we also have three mobile networks and our penetration is well above 100%.
On the contrary, mobile providers are pleased to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
Pavel Dvo<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xA1>k, Chairman of the Board of the Czech Telecommunication Office, has also expressed his opinion on several occasions that there is no place for a new provider in the Czech Republic.
It may be true that a classic service provider with their own network probably no longer has too many chances (however, it would probably be difficult to find frequency).
However, there is another option - the virtual provider.
The entry of virtual service providers into the mobile market brought a significant price reduction, after which the classic service providers had to respond.
In the meantime, even before large fish like Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile entered the market, sounds similar to ours were heard in the UK.
However, it has been proven that such providers have a place and can be truly successful.
However, for example, we do not have to go too far.
In February this year, we informed you about the launch of the virtual service provider Mobilking in Poland.
In less than half a year, this service provider managed to acquire more than 100,000 customers and become the fifth-largest service provider there.
Meanwhile, behind Mobilking is the Penta Financial Group, which in the Czech Republic is also the owner of U:fon.
The advantage of virtual service providers is the ability to focus on a much narrower target group.
In order to operate effectively, you need far fewer customers than a traditional service provider.
This is because it does not involve relatively high construction, mobile network operation and maintenance costs.
Virtual service providers in the world thus usually appear as low-cost - they offer cheap calls and texts, which, however, are often offset by fewer services.
For example, Tesco Mobile in the U.K. offers at least fifty percent cheaper text messages than its competitors.
But as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it is quite good to bet on a target group as well.
This is because this service is specifically focused on men.
“The real men choose the Mobilking provider – who they like, who they can trust,” says David Seibert, CEO of the Mobile Entertainment Company, which operates this virtual service.
It is difficult to say whether we can have an idea similar to that of Poland.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD>, spokesman for Vodafone, said: "The Czech market is relatively small compared to the segmental approach on which the majority of virtual service providers are based.
In addition, it is relatively satisfied in terms of the offer of services."
In the Czech Republic, there is no chance, mobile service providers say
However, it seems almost certain that if there is a virtual provider in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
“We are talking about the successful expansion of this project, but in the Czech Republic the negotiations do not seem to be very hopeful.
The launch of Mobilking will take place in other countries of our region," Jana Studni<0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1>, spokeswoman for the Penta Finance Group, told Mobil.cz in a telephone interview.
Indirectly, it proved that the existing mobile providers in the Czech Republic are not too familiar with this idea.
On the contrary, they are trying to do everything in their power to prevent any potential competition from being created.
For some time now, the GTS Novera Group has not been hiding its interest in the launch of a virtual service provider, which aims to take another step towards making Telefonica O2 a real competitor in the field of corporate customers.
“We are very interested in providing not only wired services to our customers, but also mobile telecommunication services.
And the sooner, the better.
We have repeatedly discussed this possibility with all Czech mobile service providers.
Some of them have already made progress in the negotiations," said Pavel Kaidl, spokesman for the group.
Maybe better times are coming now.
From unofficial information, it seems that we can be lucky for the first virtual service provider by the end of the year.
However, his birth is surrounded by a wall of impenetrable silence.
“At the moment, we do not think that a full-fledged virtual service provider would have a place in the Czech market.
The Czech market, unlike other markets, is very special.
We have not yet been called a single subject that offers a complex and serious project in this area," Vlastimil Sr<0xC5><0xA1>e<0xC5><0x88>, of Telef<0xC3><0xB3>nica 02, told Mobil.cz.
The special situation of the Czech market is also referred to by other service providers.
Martina Kemrov<0xC3><0xA1>, T-Mobile’s spokeswoman for O2, added: “We have not yet noted a single viable and bilaterally beneficial business project on which to build further.”
He added: “In the T-Mobile network by the end of the year, it is unlikely that any virtual service provider will appear.
At this point, there should be a concrete agreement on our table so that we can think about it in such a short period of time.”
Vodafone’s focus is on meeting its own 3G license requirements.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> adds: “We are open to negotiations with potential virtual service providers, primarily in the area of cost-sharing and infrastructure sharing.
This is what we consider to be the most cost-effective for our customers.
Vodafone’s main strategy is to find partners in this area to build networks shared with the fast mobile internet.”
Responsible offices - on a string with service providers
The procedure of mobile providers is easy to understand, and the entry of another provider would lead to an increase in competition, resulting in a decrease in prices and thus a decrease in their profits.
So why should we facilitate the entry of such a competition?
When service providers are able to cooperate with something important, they are also witnessing the connection around the birth of the U:fon.
The biggest pressure on <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> is likely to have been around the birth of T-Mobile’s U-phone.
This is evidenced by publicly available information on the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> website.
But right now, U:phone is a good reason why we should not allow the virtual service provider to enter.
Martina Kemrov<0xC3><0xA1> added: “The environment of competition in the mobile market has recently been hampered by the entry of the fourth mobile service provider to the market.
Given the nature of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is clear that the entry of another player into the market and its services will impose high standards."
However, in view of this attitude of mobile providers, it is quite astonishing that the Czech regulators are completely disinterested.
In the meantime, it is not just about the attitude of the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>, which unfortunately - unlike the UK and other developed countries - does not have the right to intervene in economic competition.
Only the Economic Competitiveness Office is entitled to do so.
But the office is characteristically related to the whole problem.
"The entry of the virtual service provider into the mobile market would only be possible after the conclusion of the contract between the mobile service provider and the virtual service provider for the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
No such contract has been concluded so far, as the offer of potential stakeholders is likely not of adequate interest to traditional service providers," Kristi<0xC3><0xA1>n Chlapua, of the Foreign Relations Department of the Economic Competition Office, said in reply to our question.
A statement made by the representatives of the service providers in this way would probably not surprise anyone.
However, from the office, which should represent the interests of consumers and, among other things, ensure that no one can live back to the market situation, this is more than strange.
Especially if Kristi<0xC3><0xA1>n Chalupa adds: “In the country where virtual service providers generally operate, we can observe that their entry into the market has contributed to the fall in the price of mobile services.”
However, it is likely that the interests of <0xC3><0x9A>OHS do not concern the correct functioning of the market environment and the pressure to reduce prices.
In this case, it is truly shocking that the reaction of the three mobile service providers reveals quite striking consistency.
The question of whether this is really just a coincidence is almost self-evident.
As with the filling stations, the exact same gas stations are certainly only the works of random and hard competition.
"The Office has not discovered the signs of anticompetitive proceedings in this case, so there is no reason to intervene in any way.
Neither service provider has a leading position, i.e. no proportionately greater responsibility for its market events.
The tools needed to open up the mobile market for virtual service providers are likely to be missing from the telecommunications regulator as well," Chalupa said.
The presentation of the market-leading situation is one of the many points of contention.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets developed by <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>, on the basis of which telecommunications is the only market from the point of view of economic competition.
After such a market, of course, no Czech service provider is in a leading position.
However, some legal experts also offer a different approach - the creation of a virtual service provider always requires the approval of the network operator.
And the mobile service provider - relatively logically - has a monopoly on its own network.
So, in a certain segment, it is necessarily dominant.
But even if we do not accept this argument, it should be a minimum incentive for <0xC3><0x9A>OHS to have three mobile providers do the same.
In the meantime, complaints from a number of interested parties (including the above-mentioned GTS Novera) show that they encounter very similar obstacles during their negotiations with all service providers.
Removing responsibility for <0xC4><0x8C>TU is a relatively common trick in telecommunications, with which <0xC3><0x9A>OHS takes its hand off the whole case.
We have seen this in a number of similar situations.
Unfortunately, in the text of the recently adopted Telecommunications Act, the extension of <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>’s competence in the field of economic competition in telecommunications was not achieved, although many experts hoped that this would improve the situation.
The <0xC3><0x9A>OHS representatives need to know this well, but probably their interests are different.
It works when no one is listening.
In the meantime, the operation of some kind of virtual service providers, many of which already operate in the Czech mobile networks, remains unnoticed.
These are companies that issue their own mobile phone service price lists, which, however, are only partially public.
We are talking about multi-level marketing companies.
Thus, for example, Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others offer their own mobile phone services.
The price lists of these companies usually only reach the selected ones.
The magic lies in the fact that the company acts against the provider as a classic corporate customer who orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As a leading customer, you will receive special offers (and other discounts) afterwards.
The problem is that the commercial conditions of all mobile service providers in the Czech Republic prohibit similar prepayment.
"If there were cases that he was talking about, it could be a breach of terms of contract that we would deal with and that could lead to the termination of cooperation with the company," Martina Kemrova replied to our question on this issue.
But it is quite unlikely that the news of such activity would not have reached the responsible people of the mobile service providers.
First of all, in the case of the three mentioned companies, it can be thousands of customers.
In the meantime, no provider defends itself against such proceedings.
In fact, these companies do not have negligible profits from their activities, and in the meantime, unlike real virtual service providers, they are not particularly threatened with their own official marketing.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> warns of possible problems: "The law allows for similar speculation, but only a negligible percentage of customers use the services of these companies.
In addition, they must accept that the SIM card is not in their name on their phone, so they cannot have it in full as the general customers of mobile providers."
But at least that’s what the CTU should do.
In addition, another question will be raised for <0xC3><0x9A>OHS.
If mobile service providers are faced with a similar procedure, why are they preventing the creation of a virtual service provider?
It should be added that <0xC3><0x9A>OHS has a relatively strong right to disclose such activities and, if it does not wish, does not have to be satisfied with the explanation by the service providers that they have not suspected such a thing and that their commercial conditions prohibit it.
When we won't be the most expensive
As has been stated several times in the text, the entry of virtual service providers into the mobile market has led to a noticeable reduction in the price of services.
In the meantime, in virtually every country where virtual service providers have been established, the classic service providers have been trying to prevent their creation from becoming more or less so.
The arguments they used were practically the same - too small, possibly too satisfied market, problems with the quality of services, etc.
However, in developed countries, it is at this very moment that regulators intervened, which in no way defended the interests of mobile providers but their customers.
Then, either through formal measures or informal pressure, they achieved the creation of the first virtual service provider, followed by others.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulators are advocating the whole thing for each other.
Based on our experience, we cannot get rid of the impression that ambiguous competencies are good for them in these cases.
But let's not give up the fight.
If the background information is good and our virtual provider is really coming out soon, the Czech mobile market may be on the move again.
If one of the providers would allow the creation of a virtual mobile service provider, it would be difficult for <0xC3><0x9A>OHS to remain indifferent to the rejection (discrimination) of further interested parties.
And compared to the rest of Europe, we may not be more expensive to call.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best one
Listen to four edits of the new version of the Czech state anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek presented the new recordings of the State Hymn of Where Is My Homeland on the day of the Czech Republic.
The anthem was recorded by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> B<0xC4><0x9B>lohl<0xC3><0xA1>vek.
There are four versions available - male or female soloists, vocalists or instrumentalists.
Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Kn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD>nkov<0xC3><0xA1> and Adam Plachetka sing.
The authors of the amendment of the hymn are Otakar Jerem<0xC3><0xAD>as and Jaroslav Kr<0xC4><0x8D>ek.
On iHNed.cz you can listen to all four versions.
B<0xC4><0x9B>lohl<0xC3><0xA1>vek considers the Czech national anthem to be one of the most beautiful anthems.
He told Czech Radio earlier that he had deliberately chosen young singers with a representative voice to sing solo variations, which were expressive and popular.
“From the very beginning, both of them, and later on, I tried to ensure a clean dictation, a good comprehension of the text, and consistency,” he said.
The Czech national anthem celebrates its 175th anniversary next year.
The song "Where Is My Homeland?" was first performed at the Rende Theatre in 1834 in Josef Kajet<0xC3><0xA1>n Tyl Fidlova<0xC4><0x8D>ka, accompanied by the music of Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek <0xC5><0xA0>kroup.
It became popular, and people regarded it spontaneously as their own.
The first verse of the song became a natural part of the state anthem after the establishment of Czechoslovakia in 1918.
Even after the establishment of the independent Czech Republic, it remained one of the seven state symbols.
What is the "new" anthem?
The Prague transport company will also deliver with a chip card for the first time on Wednesday
On Wednesday 1st October 2008, the Prague Transport Company will enter the history of the Prague Transport Company, when the first passenger to enter the metros, trams and buses will have an electronic voucher in his pocket instead of a paper line.
The voucher is currently available to around 100,000 people who have an Opencard chip card.
Passengers can purchase 30 days and 90 days as well as an annual voucher (valid from 1 January 2009) and at the same time save on their chipcards at the Information Centres and offices of the Transport Company in <0xC5><0xBD>a<0xC4><0x8D><0xC3><0xA1>lk<0xC3><0xA1>, M<0xC5><0xAF>stek, N<0xC3><0xA1>dra<0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD> Hole<0xC5><0xA1>ordavice, And<0xC4><0x9B>l, Lezty Rozly, Ko<0xC5><0xA1>lov.
The coupons can also be purchased online from yesterday through the website of the Transport Company www.dpp.cz.
The service was used by more than 400 customers until the afternoon hours.
Those who are starting to use online commerce can permanently forget the publishing windows of the metro stations, where they have had to regularly finish long lines for the line lines.
The coupon can be purchased via the Internet and can be saved to the Opencard card in one of the thirteen accounts of the City Library.
“In these locations, passengers have a desk with trained servers to help those interested in online shopping and save their purchased coupons on their cards,” said Martin Opatrn<0xC3><0xBD>, the project’s spokesman.
In addition to the libraries, electronic coupons can be saved at Opencard in some of the self-service vending machines in the lobby.
What do these machines look like?
They are red, they remind the ticket managers and passengers may have noticed them at Roztyly, Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovicka, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavsk<0xC3><0xA1> metro stations.
"There are currently five of them in the city, but there should be eighty by the end of the year," Opatrn<0xC3><0xBD> added.
The voucher is checked automatically instead of the driver
It’s easy to manage the machines that start tomorrow.
Simply insert the Opencard chip card and the previously paid coupon will be saved by itself.
Electronic coupons will be valid from tomorrow not only in the capital, but also in the surrounding area.
So on trains and bus stations around the city from 300 to 499, with which mainly the inhabitants of the Central Czech Republic travel to the capital.
"On the trains classified as integrated transport in Prague, the trains were provided with card readers, which will also help to determine the validity of the vouchers," explained Filip Dr<0xC3><0xA1>pal of the Prague public transport network, who compiled the schedule for the checking of the lines.
In the buses around the city, the card readers at the driver's desk are installed at the cash register.
At check-in, therefore, the driver must not only show the chip card, but also place the Opencard at a location specified on the side of the wallet.
The driver checks the validity of the vouchers.
“For example, if a passenger needs to check the validity of the coupons, it’s easiest to ask the driver to do so,” Dr<0xC3><0xA1>pal added.
Passengers who do not travel by bus around the city and will not remember the validity of their voucher when it expires can go back to the self-service ATMs that save the vouchers on cards.
Information on the validity of their documents can be found here on the display of the equipment.
The Sudanese wanted a referendum from the United States.
In 1945, the Germans called for <0xC5><0xA0>umava to join the United States.
This is evident from the letter that is in the collection of the Scientific Library of the South Czech Republic.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, at least we want to live under the patronage of the United States of America.
It is said that in 1945 some groups of Sudeten Germans turned to the President of the United States.
This is also evident from a private archive, which is currently kept in the collection of the Southern Czech Scientific Library (SBB).
<0xC4><0x8C>esky Krumlov’s Germans in a letter urged the US president not to allow the return of the “<0xC5><0xA0>umava County” to the Czech Republic, which Hitler still occupied under the Munich Treaty.
"We have correctly interpreted the situation and really want to be sure in the words that the American troops come to the German territories in no way as an oppressor and as an enemy, but as a liberator," the letter reads, "People who are in their hearts."
As associating with Czechoslovakia, the Sudeten Germans are supposedly - in addition to knowing the national character of the Czech - only to brutality, ruthlessness, not understanding, oppression and enslavement, the authors of the letter ask for their hopes and their hopes.
"We cannot believe that, regardless of the opinion of four million people, this area would be considered a foreign country to us, which represses and uproots the minority, and with almost nothing would contribute to the victory of the allies," the letter said.
The reason why the authors could not sign is supposedly fear of the "Czech oppressors"' retaliation.
So if the president of the United States is supposed to doubt the opinion of the Germans in <0xC5><0xA0>umava, it would suffice to hold a referendum in the county of <0xC5><0xA0>umava on whether its residents want to become part of the United States and whether they want to live under the patronage of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may seem a little naive about the current knowledge of post-war history, some historians say it adequately depicts the expectations of the Sudeten Germans at the time.
Even if the Czech Germans had to minimally guess that it would be their expulsion from the country, only a few of them recognized the possibility of this.
Some expected that the United States and Great Britain would agree on some sort of autonomy for the Sudetenland.
Once again, others believed that they would simply remain in Czechoslovakia.
This is confirmed by Gustav Chalupa, an Austrian journalist born in <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice.
During the war, Chalupa served as a German naval officer in Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice in the Baltic Sea.
At the end of the war, when the British were captured and sent to the Holstein prison camp, dozens of other Czech Germans came to teach them Czech.
"They were confident that if they were to return home, they would benefit from the Czech language," Chalupa said.
Before the war, none of the German prisoners living in Czechoslovakia believed that they would be removed from the country on the basis of the Bene<0xC5><0xA1> decrees.
You don't think - you pay!
The Emotional Campaign Attacks the Leaders
This is the most expensive action in Czech history for road safety.
In this way, it would be possible to characterize the emotional media campaign that the Ministry of Transport intends to launch on Wednesday.
Minister Ale<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0x98>eb<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek’s office hopes that this campaign will deter leaders from the dangerous behaviour behind the government.
The 150 million campaign will be featured on television, radio, cinema, the Internet, but also on the flyers.
You should alert the drivers to speeding and booze.
And you should also remind them to turn on their seat belts before they start.
First of all, young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and, last but not least, professional drivers want to talk about their conscience.
And what's in the ads?
Emotional attacks are primarily human stories.
This is evidenced by the "bloody" slogan of the entire campaign:
You don't think - you pay!
The phrase "don't think" is written in capital letters on the license plate.
And there's the word "pay" in the bloodstream.
This must symbolize that one can pay for a moment's inattention with one's life.
Advertisers will be “feared” by the public until 2010.
The ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in English Saxon countries, where drastic images of the victims of accidents can be seen regularly.
It is hoped that this will reduce the number of accidents and deaths on Czech roads.
The advertising spots were produced by the Euro RSCG agency.
<0xE2><0x99><0xAA> Pull it up <0xE2><0x99><0xAA> <0xE2><0x99><0xAA> Pull it down <0xE2><0x99><0xAA>
"For drivers, the 'tract, drop and drop' system is valid.
For them, the 'get it' is when they cross the red, for example, saving time.
‘Travel’ is a threat of punishment or accident.
The driver should be reminded of the risk," says Martin Ko<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xA1>n, a transport psychologist at Na Homolce Hospital.
And that is why we need an information campaign in the press, primarily a negative campaign, the psychologist believes.
According to him, the driver's attention to the danger boards are less effective.
"If the hazard warning board is fitted, it will probably soon merge with the environment and the leaders will not deal with it," Ko<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xA1>n warned.
Olmert would give back almost all the occupied territories in exchange for peace.
Ehud Olmer, the interim president of the Israeli government, spoke of the return of virtually all areas occupied in 1967, i.e. the West Bank of Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with the Palestinians and Syria.
He said this in an interview published daily by Jediot Achron on Monday.
"We have to agree with the Palestinians, which means that almost all, if not all, of the (occupied) areas have to be returned," Olmert told the newspaper.
“We will retain a certain percentage of these areas, but we have to give the Palestinians a similar percentage of the Israeli territory, because without it there will be no peace,” he added.
He acknowledged that any return would include East Jerusalem as well.
"He who wants security in Jerusalem and above all wants tractors and bulldozers not to cross the road, as he did with one of my best friends, must give up a part of Jerusalem," Olmert noted, referring to the attack on two cities in July.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find a special solution to "the Temple Mount, sacred and historical sites" located in the Old Town.
“Whoever wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city, he must integrate 270,000 Arabs.
It won't work," he stressed.
Departure from the Golan Heights
Olmert also expressed an opinion on the Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which he believes is an indispensable condition for a peace treaty with Syria.
However, this would also require some effort on the part of Damascus.
"I do not propose a peace deal with Syria solely on the basis of a withdrawal from the Golan Heights," he said.
"The Syrians know what they have to give up in order to get Golan.
They must give up their current relationship with Iran; they must give up their relationship with Hezbollah (the Shiite movement); they must give up the regular support that Hamas (the Shiite movement), Al-Qaeda and Jihad (the holy war) have given to terrorism in Iraq."
Questions after the accident: Are the passengers on the buses illegal?
The law does not know them, you should not walk in a long-distance bus
In connection with the tragic bus crash of the Student Agency company in the Italian city of Padua, the question arose whether passengers and escorts could be transported on the bus.
“If we want to strictly and formally comply with the law, the activity of the passenger escort is inconsistent with the law on transport activities,” says Karel Hanzelka, a spokesman for the Ministry of Transport.
Last week, the death of a twenty-two-year-old passenger was likely caused by a truck driver crossing the bus.
The unfortunate girl was sitting next to the driver at the time, in the least safe place on the bus, although two more seats were occupied for her.
The bus may crash or suddenly brake even at the moment when the passenger serves coffee or offers a newspaper. . . .
It has a role to play in determining whether the bus has a parking space according to the traffic licence.
If the bus is not homologated, the passengers must sit.
The Student Agency’s long-distance buses do not have stops; they have been confirmed by Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, the company’s director, for Aktu<0xC3><0xA1>ln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz.
“We were trying to find a solution with this ministry and at first the passengers were not allowed to move.
However, this has been withdrawn and we have come to the conclusion that passengers can go to the toilet on the way if they have their own seat," he said.
The law does not recognize the passenger.
"There is no clear legal regulation regarding the role of the passenger escort - no legislation regulates this position.
However, no law prohibits the carrier from providing the services.
The law on road traffic only knows the concept of a passenger; its rights and obligations are not defined,” says the spokeswoman Hanzelka.
On the contrary, Josef Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD>, director of the Department of Road Vehicle Operations, believes that the law handles the problem properly.
“It depends on whether the bus has a stop in the traffic license.
And that's it," he says.
Buses can be urban by their distinction, where there are stops and limited to the maximum speed, and with stops between cities and at higher speeds allowed, as well as distances without stops and at maximum speeds allowed, with seat belts.
Just like on a plane, says the expert.
Jaroslav Hor<0xC3><0xAD>n, BESIP’s transport safety expert, does not see a fundamental problem in the movement of passengers on board the bus.
"There is not a lot of danger in the course of continuous progress, we can compare the situation with the service on the plane.
It's not safe here when there's turbulence and the airman can smash his head."
“But if the bus suddenly brakes, of course, the laws of physics are valid.
The same as in city buses or trams.
The safety of the passengers must be resolved by the carrier’s internal rules,” he says, and also believes that from the point of view of the law, the problem has not been solved.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura is ready to discontinue services
The Student Agency, as the only bus carrier, offers passenger escort services.
He employs two hundred flight attendants.
The director does not consider their profession to be risky even after the accident.
"However, as I will have the impression that the occupation of the passenger escorts is risky, I will also eliminate it.
Coffee and newspapers are available to passengers upon arrival.
That would be a cost savings,” he said.
The lack of passenger escorts in their vehicles was justified by the safety concerns of Alexej Litvin, the director of Asiana, who operates a fraction of the flights compared to the Student Agency.
"There are no escorts, we are opposed to this from the very beginning.
Sooner or later it ends with some sort of fatal injury," he told T<0xC3><0xBD>den.cz just a year ago.
An Incredible Tragedy Happened
A young passenger from Plze<0xC5><0x88>, who worked for the company two years ago, died on a scheduled flight from Naples.
The Slovenian truck probably turned off the runway without the use of a directional signal and stopped the bus route.
The bus driver suddenly tried to get away with a maneuver, but the right front of the bus hit him.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura refuses that two reserved seats for the rest of the passengers would have been sold.
"These places can't be booked on long-haul flights, they're blocked."
The company wants to sue the truck driver.
With the compensation of the girl's family, the agency does not wait for the judgment of the court, but also expects financial compensation from the culprit.
A law amendment?
In the distant future
A clarification of the movement of passengers on board the bus could be the law amendment, which has been working on for more than a year by a group of thirty experts from the Ministry of Transport.
“But the team has not achieved any concrete results.
Buses are not so much, but rather the point system deals with the maximum speed allowed on the highway and the use of mobiles while driving," says expert Hor<0xC3><0xAD>n.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activities of the passenger escorts to be anything that would fundamentally threaten the safety of the passengers," Hanzelka concluded by saying that the control of the safety of buses is under the jurisdiction of the police and labour authorities.
Düsseldorf's hopes are over in Frankfurt
The letter of the Board of Directors of WestLB to the Bank’s employees is not limited in the big words.
The units of the Düsseldorf financial institution and the Frankfurt-based Deka-Bank could form the “central capital market organisation of the savings bank group,” according to a letter published on Monday.
WestLB would bring a "competence block" that is permanently profitable to such a business.
Such a relationship could give a decisive boost to further mergers in the provincial banking sector.
This is the reading of when a board wants to demonstrate its ability to act in difficult times.
The WestLB bank, which is in a precarious situation, continues to be under enormous pressure.
Not only by the EU Commission, but also by the Federal Financial Services Authority, which has recently informed the Northwestern Westphalia Provincial Government that it is tightening the deadline for finding a lasting solution.
However, for savings banks customers, the famous investment fund between Deka-Bank and WestLB has long been the subject of a kind of relationship - also on the part of Frankfurt.
Franz Waas, the head of the Deka-Bank, already at the end of August, when the semi-annual data was released, was aware that the bank on Mainzer Landstraße and a provincial bank such as Helaba or WestLB did not see the meaning of the merger.
Nevertheless, the Board of Directors of the Deka, which consists of half of the provincial banks and the other half of the savings funds associations, has entrusted the Board of Directors to continue negotiations with WestLB on the joint business activities.
In the course of this, the capital market trade or certain parts of it may be discussed.
Negotiations, however, according to financial circles, have only just begun.
With its 3,000 employees, the name Deka-Bank, one of the most important employers in the Frankfurt financial sector, does not emerge for the first time in connection with the consolidation of the savings sector.
In 2003, it seemed for a moment that the Deka-Bank merged with Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and Helaba.
However, there was no such thing as a third alliance.
The plans were barely made public, and the Hessen provincial government spoke out against Helaba’s interest.
Thereafter, the other two banks did not find each other.
The Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz was replaced by the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart.
However, the idea of the relationship between the Deka-Bank and the provincial banks has been raised over and over again.
Last time, however, Günther Merl, the chairman of the board of directors of Helaba, spoke out against plans to merge with his bank.
Regardless, they come to the realization that there is a need for the convergence of different banks in the public sector.
Now, for the first time since the Bavarian provincial elections, the connection between BayernLB and Landesbank Baden-Württemberg is expected.
That's not necessarily good news for Helaba.
If the pressure on further fusions increases, the potential partners may slowly be lost to them.
In southern Germany, he could only be a younger business partner, although he has so far suffered significantly more from the financial crisis than the banks in Munich and Stuttgart.
The merger with WestLB was excluded at the beginning of the year by the Giroverband Hessen-Thüringen, which has an 85% stake in Helaba.
The NordLB is on the right.
However, such geostrategic considerations represent only one side of the coin.
On the other hand, the question arises as to how the different business models of each bank fit together.
In June, Merl stated that the German Federal Reserve and Fat Association had not yet given an answer to the crucial question of what business model should be used to secure the future of the provincial banks.
In the end, it is still possible to decommission WestLB, which, of course, they do not want there.
Thus, the letter of the board of directors there also states that they are in any case seeking a "complete solution".
How this is compatible with the merger of individual units with Deka-Bank is still the music of the future.
The second weekend of the Oktoberfest is known as the "Italian Weekend"
Elena's first time, it's her third or fourth time.
But now Elena is here as her girlfriend, and so everything is completely different, says Luca.
Behind them, next to the Kaiser-branded five-liter barrel, stands a strong-bodied bearded man, and it proves to about 200 people travelling to the Oktoberfest how deep sounds can be drawn from his throat.
Elena first kisses Luca's face, then she kisses him.
They came from Bologna to Verona.
From here, four buses depart from the parking lot next to the Puorta Nuova station at 23:45 with the destination "destinazione Monaco, festa della birra", arrival expected at 6.30.
Three buses are mainly for Italians, while the fourth one is for Brazilians.
In one corner of the parking lot, the South Americans had already sung a song beside their flag, and the celebration had already begun during the night.
“It’s so loud that it’s not for Italians,” Marco Guarda said.
The buses are owned by Marco, who wears a long coat with leather embroidery and a wide, silver-coloured goggle.
He has been travelling to the Oktoberfest for five years and has only organized three trips this year.
At night there, during the day at the Oktoberfest, at 10:30 p.m.
Accommodation would only be an unnecessary expense, Marco says.
The trip costs <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>75, which includes a welcome Kaiser beer cooked in accordance with the Bavarian Brewery Act, as well as accident insurance and German-speaking tourist guide - Marco took a German language course in Frankfurt.
And they're already getting into the night buses on the highway towards "Brennero".
No beer, not yet.
The bus is falling asleep, the passengers are asleep.
That's right, they'll still need their strength.
In Brixen and Holzkirchen, many Italian buses take a short break on the 8th motorway ahead of Munich.
When Marco’s group arrives at the parking lot near Theresienwiese at half-time, according to the plan, there are nearly 50 other buses that have arrived from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, while Marco is holding one last briefing, he presents the war plan.
First of all, everyone wears the yellow hat.
On the left side of the fracture is the inscription "Oktoberfest" with the Internet address of Marco's travel agency: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Second, "When the doors of the beer cellar are opened, run," Marco calls in the morning.
"Run!" Run and occupy the seats in the back of the tent.
"Not in advance, for we will hang, and not all the yellow hats will sit on the same poles, but let us spread out in the tent."
The one-liter jersey costs <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>8.25, Marco yells.
And don't forget the winemaker.
"Show the security guards that you've behaved well.
As soon as you leave your seats, they will be occupied."
Thirdly, "Be here again at half past eleven tonight!" Do you understand?
And now head to Wiesn.
Along the way, one of the men wears yellow hats on the trees, on the boards, and even on the election poster of one of the great Bavarian People's Party.
We need to prepare for resignation.
This is the second weekend of the Oktoberfest, known as the "Italian Weekend".
There are no exact figures; we are talking about 50,000 people crossing the Alps breaking through the beer fields, with 10% of all weekend visitors reportedly coming from Italy.
The police in Munich are confirmed by seven South Tyrolean police officers, Italian volunteers assist the Bavarian Red Cross, which in its national statistics with about 200 medical care the Italians take the first place, preventing the Austrians from reaching 60 <0xC2><0xB0>C (about 80 <0xC2><0xB0>C) and throwing them at the bottom.
The Hofbräu breweries were particularly popular among Italians.
Sleepless nights for Hypo Real Estate creditors
The German banking system is relatively stable, Federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück stressed just last week.
Luckily, the politician used the word “relatively” and even made it clear that the German banking sector is not spared by crisis-like developments.
Because it happened this weekend, too.
Daxon-listed Hypo Real Estate (HRE) property finance company received a billion-dollar loan from a consortium of German banks to protect itself from market turbulence.
A person familiar with the situation told Reuters on Monday that the loan grants would hit <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>35 billion.
Hypo Real Estate only has to pay interest after the part has been used.
The money comes partly from private and partly from public banks.
In the background are the losses of the Depfa subsidiary.
According to a press release, Deffa, who makes state funding, has been lending money to long-term projects and refinanced himself for them for an extremely short period of time – which is no longer possible due to the lack of confidence in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank’s cash reserves decreased by 95 per cent to EUR 2.37 million, and the share of its own capital also fell moderately, from 1.6 per cent to 1.45 per cent.
Current revenues and net revenues from financial transactions fell to zero compared to the same period last year, revenues from receivables to receivables and fixed securities, and from the disposal of euro banknotes to euro banknotes receivables amounted to more than 70.
Only the higher revenues resulting from the subsequent settlement costs of the transformation of the former Deffa Group, as well as the reimbursement of interest under the Staff Regulations and the transactions made to the companies belonging to the group, had a turnover of around 16%.
The former state financier first speculated on corporate real estate loans after privatisation in 1990, which were later separated from Aeral Bank.
Since there was little that could be earned with classical state funding, Deffa has been more involved in infrastructure projects, as well as joint projects between private investors and the state (private-public-partnership, PPP), and has expanded its activities internationally.
The value of subsidiaries should now be described by Hypo Real Estate as having a "significant effect" on the group's performance - it was reported quite generally.
In fact, the dividend has not been paid.
The dividend has already been reduced to a third by 2007.
Since the acquisition of Deffa, Hypo Real Estate has become a significant state and infrastructure funder.
Compared to other financial institutions, it is more dependent on interbank market refinancing because it has no customer deposits.
With the collapse of the U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the banks' mutual lending has disappeared as banks keep their liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs short-term assets annually to refinance part of Deffa’s loan portfolio – around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>50 billion.
According to a statement from Hypo Real Estate, the group’s financing needs are covered for the foreseeable time by the loan, and the company is protected “from the influence of the currently largely inoperative international money markets.”
According to other sources, thanks to the money, refinancing is ensured by the end of 2009.
In contrast, Georg Funke, Chairman of the Board of Directors of HRE, stated that the Hypo Real Estate Group does not need to use the money markets for a visible period of time.
The German Federal Bank and the Federal Financial Services Authority (BaFin) consider that the market capacity of the Hypo Real Estate group is now secured.
This gives hope to the bank’s shareholders and creditors.
But due to the dynamics and immeasurability of the crisis, they cannot be certain of it.
It is not even unimaginable that we do not have to make full use of the funding.
But the opposite cannot be ruled out.
After the bank was still on the verge of bankruptcy late on Saturday evening, even his temporary bailout could not reassure the prospects.
The share price fell by 75 percent to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.30.
On the other hand, bond rates are quite well maintained.
While the debts listed in the first place are barely changing, the exchange rates of the bonds ordered at the back have fallen significantly.
The crisis particularly affects the bonds of the former subsidiary, Württemberg Hypo, and, in a readily available way, the run-times beyond 2009.
While Hypo Real Estate bonds were previously seen as a speculative investment alternative, their resilience must now be considered dependent on the stability of the international financial system as a result of the Banking Crisis and the financial institution’s transfer to Deffa.
As long as the central banks, governments and less-threatened business banks are still ready to support the system, it is possible to proceed with the cancellation of allowances for a deadline.
Or it is happening, in which at the moment almost no one dares to hope that the financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months.
However, in view of the reports relating to partial nationalisation, the probability bordering on certainty has now become a purely legitimate hope.
For long-term lenders, it can cause sleepless nights to decide whether to withdraw from their investment.
Short-term investors may, however, use the sale to form a reserve for taxes to be paid after the exchange rate gains for the coming years.
Sylvana and the Secrets of the Beneficial Box
When 16-year-old Sylvana Hiltrop has to show up at Tachibana High School on her first day of teaching, the girls start shouting: The German chick is a total cowboy!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from the manga - she tells about Japan in the new exchange blog.
"The first day of teaching in Japan.
I'm so excited.
I was already on my way to school.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo, towards Kavaszaki, and I travel 40 minutes by train to Tachibana Highschool.
I had to find the way by myself, fortunately I didn't get lost.
It seems that the beginning of teaching in Tachiban is not taken as seriously as at home in Lower Saxony.
The students begin to queue at 8 a.m. until 8 a.m. at 40 a.m. a short conversation begins with the teacher, the "home room".
But before I started teaching, it was my turn to introduce myself.
And I'm not the kind of guy who likes to talk to people, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
Since I hadn’t had my school uniform yet, I picked up an old skirt from my hostess, adding a blouse, a blue kneecap and a black leather shoe.
So in this dressing room I stood in front of the cathedral and tried to pronounce everything correctly: "Sajjonara, vo se Sylvana..." - My name is Sylvana, I came from Germany, and in a week it will be my birthday.
At that moment I was very happy that I had started learning the language two years ago.
All the 31 girls were whispering, whistling and integrating, and I kept hearing the word "cow."
I already knew this from my manga.
This belongs to the Japanese girls' basic vocabulary, and it means "sweet, sweet."
Then I quickly moved on to my place.
The girl sitting next to me was smiling, and it was an honour to have the exchanger placed next to me.
The rest of the clock was quite quiet, but when the bell sounded, they were regularly broken.
Everyone was talking and laughing, and with their questions they drilled holes in the stomach - and it was quite difficult to understand Japanese English.
During the break, everyone packed up their own binoculars.
My caterer also prepared me such a lunch - it's completely different from the boring German ten-hour sandwiches.
I got spicy rice, small sausages, lettuce and algae salad, fruit and some tofu-cooked meat.
Most of the time I have no idea what I eat here in Japan.
The food looks strange and has a completely new taste.
In fact, everything is very delicious.
Well, yes, maybe except for the salted peanut butter, brrrr!
In Japanese schools, bento is not just a simple lunch.
It happens that a girl gives a boy a self-made insider, which she creates especially artistically - in the hope that she can get to know the boy more closely during the lunch break.
I read about it in my manga novels.
I'm curious if I can observe this here, too.
“Why Japan?” my girlfriends asked when I told them that I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
I always said,
"Because you're just charming."
After all, I have been reading the sweetest manga for years.
And to better understand the comics and the culture described in them, one day I began to learn Japanese.
It was clear to me that I would have to travel here someday.
Because I'm attracted to tradition and habits.
And they're highly valued here.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest techniques and trends - and on the other hand, it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And since everything was so well organized, I never felt lost, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I’ve ever seen in my life.”
The rats have feelings, too.
If a rat or a mosquito is in danger, does that mean he's afraid?
Joseph LeDoux, a neuroscientist, is convinced that animals also have emotions.
But how can we examine whether they feel the same when they behave in the same way as us?
In the online journal "Edge", famous scientists have been publishing their articles for years.
SPIEGEL ONLINE, in one of its series, looks at the answers to the question “What do you think is real without being able to prove?”
I believe that animals have emotions and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else having been able to prove it so far, and it's true that we can't even prove that other people have consciousness.
In this case, however, we can at least hope that the basic configuration of all human brains is the same.
However, as we examine other species and unravel the questions of perception or consciousness in general, we arrive on hard-to-reach terrain because the hardware does not match.
When a rat is endangered, it does the same as many other animals: it pretends to be dead, flees or attacks.
People behave in a similar way, from which some researchers conclude that there are comparable subjective experiences.
But I don't believe in that.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to transfer our own subjective experiences to animals.
On the one hand, circuits associated with human consciousness almost always contain the lateral prefrontal cortex (due to its role in short-term memory and implementation/control functions).
This vast area is more advanced in man than in other mammals, and seems to be completely lacking in other living beings.
At least in those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cerebral cortex, for example, the awareness of who we are, or in the case of design and decision-making, it can be reasonably assumed that man is different from even the other major mammals.
Another dramatic feature lies in the linguistic nature of man: Since a significant part of human experience is related to language, it is often claimed that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, the animals can be excluded.
However, even if it did not depend on language, the language would certainly influence it, so animal consciousness, whatever its nature, is likely to be very different from most of our states of consciousness.
Therefore, it is difficult to determine what consciousness may be like for other animals.
If the mind cannot be measured as an internal and subjective thing, and because of the special hardware it cannot be analyzed on the basis of our own experience, then his research presents us with serious problems.
Most of my headlines relate to the content of conscious living, but there is also another aspect of consciousness that is probably more easily accessible to science.
The conscious processes of animals could be examined regardless of their content, and this is exactly what happens in experiments on the short-term memory of the main animals, especially in the case of visualization.
However, in this assumption also examined by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, they rely more on the neural connections of consciousness than on causal mechanisms: both may be the same or not.
Interestingly, this assumption also emphasizes the importance of the prefrontal cortex in the creation of visualization.
What is the result of these emotions?
I attribute this to the fact that an emotional system, like its fear, is activated in the brain that is aware of its own activity.
What we call "fear" is, therefore, the mental state in which we are when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its consequences, such as bodily reactions) occupies working memory.
In this way, the emotions are closely related to the areas of the cerebral cortex that are characteristic of the main mammals and in particular of humans.
With the linguistic character, the perception is divided into subtle degrees, because with the help of words and grammar, we are able to distinguish and categorize states, so that we describe them to others as well as ourselves.
Antonio Damasio, on the other hand, is of the opinion that emotions stem from the simpler activities of the body's sensory areas of the cerebellum and brain stem, as does Jaak Pankseep, who, however, prefers to focus on the brain stem.
Since this network has not changed much in the course of human evolution, it can easily play a role in the overall emotions of the species.
I can't theoretically deny this, but I think it's unproven.
Pankseep believes that what appears to be fear in rats and humans is likely to be felt in both cases: How can one check whether rats and humans feel the same when they behave in the same way?
A cockroach escapes in case of danger, does he also feel fear?
In my opinion, only such behavior is not yet proof of the same experience.
Although the neural comparison continues to help: rats and humans have similar brain stems, but cockroaches do not have brains.
But is the brain stem responsible for emotions?
And even if this could be proven in terms of humans, how could we prove it in terms of rats?
I think rats and other mammals, but maybe even cockroaches (who knows?) have feelings.
However, I do not know how to prove this.
And because their emotions are suspected to be fundamentally different from ours (since human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I prefer to research the emotional behavior of rats rather than the emotional emotions.
In any case, progress in this area is at the neural level, if we measure the same in rats and humans.
Just as I don’t research language and consciousness in rats, I don’t research emotions because I don’t know if they exist.
To others, this may seem like a short-sighted attitude, but I'm moving forward rather than constantly colliding with a wall.
Because I'm a practical emotionalist.
Platini, President of UEFA: A time of grace for Poland and Ukraine
Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Vashunik said that preparations will soon be under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government sees the confidence in Ukraine in UEFA's decision in Bordeaux and the testimony of their belief that Ukraine is able to organise the European Championship together with Poland," he said.
“This is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun, and there is still much to be done in both countries.”
In terms of stadiums, roads, hotels and airports, both host countries are in default.
It is possible that the number of EB stadiums will be reduced from eight to six.
“We can’t waste more time.
We have to work at top speed now," said Grigory Surkis, president of the Ukrainian Football Association.
"Uefa will keep an eye on us."
In Poland, they have decided to take a more radical step.
After several scandals, the National Olympic Committee suspended the leadership of the Polish PZPN alliance, which was replaced by independent commissioner Robert Zawlocki.
The Commission met on the initiative of Sport Minister Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There is a "serious risk that the PZPN will not be able to operate according to the rules," Drzewiecki told the Polish news agency PAP.
"We have sent a letter to UEFA President Michel Platini that this will not adversely affect the preparations for the 2012 European Championships."
It was only in the last season that several first-class teams had to be classified into the lower class due to manipulation, and eventually the league start had to be postponed.
The Angry Dennis Quaid cuts back
The actress wanted to promote a new film, she talked about her privacy in the interview - and now she's caught up with her ex-husband. Meg Ryan has described her ex-husband, Dennis Quaid, as a marriage breaker.
The one who cuts and cuts back
Meg Ryan - Dennis Quaid's ex-husband: The two Hollywood actors are having a nasty fight with each other seven years after their divorce - in public.
In an interview with American magazine InStyle last week, Meg Ryan said for the first time about the reasons for the divorce: "Dennis has been unfaithful to me for a long time, causing a lot of pain."
And it wasn't until after the divorce that he found out how many women Dennis cheated on him.
The mental strip takes place because of Ryan's press work on his new film, "Women," which tells the story of a breakup.
Dennis Quaid resolutely responded to the call of an unfaithful husband: “It’s terrible,” the 54-year-old actor told the New York Daily News newspaper, “that Meg is unquestioningly repeating and passing through the history of our relationship.”
In addition, it is also "sorry" that 16-year-old boys together, Jack, are repeatedly "publicly reminded of the so much pain and change that divorce causes a child."
While Ryan has been living alone since the divorce, Quaid has remarried and recently became the father of a twin couple.
His response concludes with the following page cut: “My life is going on anyway.
I can be happy to know that I have a wonderful family in which everything is in order.”
Airline tickets and hotel room prices are declining.
In the first half of 2008, European airports and accommodation were cheaper than in the previous year.
According to a recent study, in Germany, flights have become no less than 50 percent cheaper.
Airline and hotel room prices have become more favourable once again, summarizing the results of a study by American Express travel and financial services provider.
The company analysed its booking data for the first half of 2008 and found a significant price decline in the second quarter after the first quarter price increase.
As prices have risen in the hotel market over the years, accommodation has become cheaper in many places.
Between January and March, prices in 41 of the 48 European cities surveyed increased by an average of 6.9 percent compared to 2007.
However, in the period from April to June, prices were already 3.6 per cent lower than in the previous year.
This trend was most clearly seen in Paris and Rome, where guests had to pay 30-37 percent less than a year earlier.
The reason for this is seen by the American Express at the low exchange rate of the dollar, which has led to "the sluggish desire of American tourists to travel."
Reducing hotel room prices is more likely to affect financial centres such as Frankfurt or London than industrial cities such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
The 26.3 percent increase in hotel prices in the Norwegian city is a European record.
In the first quarter, there was also an increasing trend in airfare prices.
Due to the cost of kerosene, passengers in the tourist class had to pay an average of 7.1 per cent more than in 2007, and long-haul jets with high fuel consumption were 29.2 per cent more expensive.
Between April and June, the prices of tourist class flights fell by an average of 12.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter, but in business and first class prices showed only a much more moderate change.
In Germany, prices have fallen even more than in other European countries.
Between January and March, prices rose by 11.9 per cent, while they fell by 23.6 per cent in the second quarter.
The cost of domestic flights in Germany has been reduced by half, according to the study.
On the one hand, the reason for the price drop lies in declining economic growth, the company says.
Demand has weakened in many segments of the air travel market.
On the other hand, the Open Skies agreement, which liberalises air travel between the US and Europe, is intensifying the pressure exerted by the competitive situation.
The tense situation proves that airlines are cancelling their lost flights, and many airlines reported bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 - only in Europe it affects 24 airlines.
The HSV 1:0 is true to Gladbach
With a goal and simple methods, Hamburger SV was at the top of the table.
At Borussia, Luhukay still fails to find the operational team.
Kristoffer Klein Enlargement Deep Flying for nationally selected Marko Marin.
The gladbachi player was only late in the game, and his promotion kicked back from the gate.
His well-formed message left his lips reassuringly.
He just knew he was right.
"We're tired of the second goal," said Hermann Rieger in the hallway leading to the Hamburg Arena cabins.
Not much happened in the catacombs, the break was over, and most of them sat down again.
Rieger has been a physiotherapist at HSV for nearly three decades, enjoying greater authority than some leading players.
Thus, his request was found for a hearing at the competent place.
Cornelius Jol's assistant sneezed and unanimously pointed his thumb.
Cornelius is the brother of the Hamburg manager, Martin Jol.
His command could have said the same thing: Here with the second goal!
Execution of the command is delayed.
"Today was not always a beautiful sight," Marcell Jansen later admitted.
Bastian Reinhardt also "slowly imagined" it.
The 1:0 (1:0) goal result can be attributed to the hamburgers head Mladen Petric (11th); and the fact that the very weak gladbachians could not cause pain to the weak hamburgers.
"It was a dirty victory," Martin Jol summed up.
Hamburger SV will be 121 years old on Monday.
On Saturday afternoon, the spectators celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the arena, and the table on the projector, which presented their teams as the champions of the championship.
It's gonna be a birthday without a party.
“We know where to put it,” said Marcell Jansen.
It appears that the intermediate certificate in the table indicates the unpredictability of the league rather than the dominance of HSV.
Although the team is slowly recovering thanks to their late commitments - Brazilian Neves and Silva, goalkeeper Petric and FC Bayern - it does not yet shine.
“We need more senses and more picking,” Jol said.
After the vote.
Wall Street is full of fear.
As a result of the first news of the crash of the rescue package, the Dow Jones temporarily dropped 700 points.
This was the biggest loss of points in a single day in history.
Later, the Dow strengthened one of them.
At 8:30 p.m., the world’s most important stock market barometer was minus 5 percent and stood at 10,579 points.
The Nasdaq, which trades in technology papers, fell by more than seven percent to 1548 points.
The Dow’s biggest loser at the moment was American Express with a 14% loss, followed by Bank of America with 12%.
Not a single piece of paper got stronger.
The shares of Goldman Sachs Bank fell almost 10 percent.
Just a few days earlier, he bought a stake in the bank from major investor Warren Buffett.
As part of the rescue operation, funds are planned to be made available for the purchase of so-called dubious mortgage securities.
However, they do not want to pay the amount at the same time, but gradually.
In return, the state would receive share option vouchers from financial institutions, which would be redeemable in the event of a proper evolution of the exchange rates, reducing the burden on the state treasury.
In decline, European and U.S. and stock prices
The billion-dollar aid provided to European and American banks does not dispel investors’ doubts.
Hypo Real Estate’s stock market is falling and taking Dax with it.
The U.S. Dow Jones indicator is declining despite the state-planned bailout of the money market.
The spectacular exchange losses of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank have put the German stock index (Dax) downside.
The Munich real estate lender’s shares fell to a quarter despite bailouts from the federal government and private banks, and Commerzbank fell by more than 20 percent.
The Dax dropped below the mentally important 6,000-point limit and scored 5839 points with a 3.7 percent minus.
Stock markets around the world have been forced to their knees.
In New York City, Wall Street opened with a significant loss.
Investors fear that the U.S. government’s $700 billion bailout will not be enough to boost the money markets.
In the first hour of trading, the Dow lost 334 points, or 3.3 percent, to 10,809.25 points.
The U.S. House of Representatives wanted to vote on the bailout plan, but the Senate vote could take place on October 1.
The other European exchanges also knew only one direction: in London the FTSE indicator showed a weakening of 3.2 percent, in Paris the CAC 40 lost 2.9 percent.
In Asia, Japan’s Nikkei index fell by 1.26 percent to 11,743.61 points after the initial consolidation.
In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index dropped by 2.1 percent to 18,286.90 points.
The Indian Sensex index dropped 506.43 points, or 3.9 percent, and closed at 12,595.75 points.
On the Mdax stock market, Arcandor’s shares weakened following the announcement of the capital increase.
Sal. Oppenheimer Private Bank has registered 23 million new shares.
The commercial and tourism group also announced that Thomas Cook would not sell its shares.
Dark Matter Affects the Flight of Spacecraft
A mysterious phenomenon has been causing confusion among researchers for years. Dark matter influences the velocity of space probes during the so-called swing-by maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity may not be entirely correct.
The Ulysses spacecraft has been flying in space for nearly 18 years.
The soon-to-be-freeze fuel lines threaten the freezing death.
For years, scientists have been causing confusion with a mysterious phenomenon, the swing-by anomaly.
Swing-by refers to the gravitational fluctuation of space probes, during which they gain additional momentum in a celestial body, such as the Earth's gravitational field.
In this way, the probes can save a large amount of fuel.
Just like the Ulysses solar probe, the European-American Cassini-Huygens research probe used this physical trick.
However, what has amazed researchers for years is that flying objects do not behave completely as expected under the ancient law of gravitation.
Instead, anomalies occur at the speed.
The probes are unexpectedly accelerating or slowing down.
Physicists have not yet found an explanation for this effect.
The phenomenon has been dubbed a swing-by anomaly.
Some experts fear that even Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity may not be entirely correct to perceive the mass attraction of matter as the curvature of space.
Stephen Adler, an American physicist at the Princeton Institute for Advanced Study, continues to firmly believe that Einstein was not mistaken, and tries to explain the swing-by anomaly with the so-called dark matter discovered by astronauts in the universe.
“Dark matter may be responsible for the anomaly, which may even be found near the Earth,” writes Adler.
The existence of dark matter has only been known by space researchers for ten years.
It obviously exerts a gravitational force that can be observed to have an effect on your other celestial bodies.
However, the material itself does not emit or strike back any completely invisible electromagnetic radiation, especially visible light.
Scientists estimate that about one-fifth of the total mass of the universe consists of dark matter.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
After spending ten days in captivity of the kidnappers, the smuggled tourists in Egypt are free again, the Italian foreign minister confirmed.
Sudanese kidnappers have demanded a ransom of millions of euros.
In the shooting that preceded the release of hostages, six hostages reportedly lost their lives.
Five German nationals were kidnapped in southern Egypt.
Negotiations on the ransom are underway.
Over and over again, Germans are becoming targets for kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE reports on the most important cases.
European tourists smuggled into the Sahara are free.
This was reported by Egyptian state television, Al-Arabiya Arab TV and the Italian media in a similar manner.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the fact of the release, according to Sky TG 24 television news agency: "Our comrades and the other hostages have been released.
We are currently examining their state of health," Frattini said.
Five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian national, as well as eight Egyptian escorts, are safe and sound, according to Egyptian state television.
The 19 participants of the desert expedition are said to be on their way to Cairo.
The cause of the shooting before the hostages were released is still cloudy: According to an Egyptian security official, the hostages have already shown a willingness to release the hostages when the Sudanese army surprisingly killed six of them.
"The problem is solved.
They accepted the ransom," the official said.
"It was only about taking hostages," when suddenly, "the surprise" happened.
On Sunday, Sudanese soldiers shot six kidnappers on the border between Sudan, Chad and Egypt and arrested two.
The hostages demanded a ransom of six million euros from Germany; the money should have been handed over to the German wife of one of the hostages.
The newspaper al-Masri al-Jom, referring to a German intermediary, reported that the release of hostages was being withdrawn because the kidnappers were concerned about their own well-being.
According to the report, female hostages are released after the ransom is paid.
The men are being held captive by the kidnappers until they find a safe escape route.
The German Embassy in Cairo was not willing to take a position on the report.
'Suicide Leaded' by Mostohapa's Violence
In court, he said a woman committed suicide because her stepfather had raped her for years.
The 57-year-old Michael Trerise, who lives in Stithians, Cornwall County, spent six years in prison after confessing to an eight-step attempt at violent sexual intercourse.
The Truro Criminal Court found out that she had regularly tied up her stepdaughter, Stephanie Randle, between the ages of five and seven.
In one of Trerise's statements, he wrote, "I feel responsible for his death."
Randle, 34, committed suicide at his home in Plymouth, Mutley, on April 1, 2007.
When he lived in Coventry as a child, Trerise tied and closed his eyes in front of the community while his mother worked in a brewery.
Trerise divorced his wife in the 1980s and was re-elected to live in Cornwall.
His daughter-in-law moved to Plymouth.
However, during the court hearing, it was revealed that Miss Randle, who spent a lot of time volunteering with the National Trust’s memorial organization, was being pursued by horrors of repeated violence twice a week.
In 2006, prosecutor Ramsey Quaife told the court that Miss Randle, who had previously passionately loved surfing and cycling, was "emotionally dead" and "resigned from life."
In April 2007, his father, Terrance Randle, was found dead in his apartment in Plymouth.
You're probably suffocating yourself with a bag.
Mr. Randle got into a fight with his daughter's stepfather, who ended his confession in a letter saying, "I've always tied up and closed my eyes.
I didn't sexually harass her.
I feel responsible for his death.”
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise: "You're a very strange fetishist, and I'm sure this was horrible for his victim, especially if he was only seven years old.
This inconvenient family affair ended with the victim becoming suicidal.
Even more thoughtful, however, is the fact that if he did not do so, the case might never have been brought to court."
The judge added: “I draw your attention to the impact that Stephanie’s parents have had on their daughter over the years.
If that didn’t happen, she would probably have been a hopeful, successful and happy young woman.”
An official who lost important data has been indicted
According to the BBC, they are accused of violating official secrecy by the government official, who had forgotten strictly secret documents on a train in June.
The man was on a mission from the Department of Homeland Security when he left two top-secret documents on a train to Waterloo.
The documents were sent to the BBC before they were handed over to the police.
This is the slightest charge of violation of the law, and there is no suspicion of intentional wrongdoing.
Frank Gardner, a reporter with the BBC’s Department of Homeland Security, said the move surprised many at the Whitehall.
"They believed the case would be handled by the Department of Homeland Security and the government as an internal matter," he said.
An employee who cannot be named has been charged on the basis of Section 8.1 of the Act. This paragraph is about the retention of information.
The U.S. Attorney's Office has suggested that the charge against the officer be made by the Metropolitan Police to represent the man for his rather sensitive work related to the United Intelligence Committee.
The documents he lost included covert investigations into al-Qaeda and the capabilities of the Iraqi army.
The decision was announced on Monday and then moved from his home to an unknown location.
The apartment building cooperatives pay the B&A bill.
UK housing cooperatives are expected to pay more than <0xC2><0xA3>80m after the rescue of Bradford & Bingley Bank.
The government has spent <0xC2><0xA3>14 billion on protecting 2.6 million account holders from deposits at Bradford & Bingley.
The interest on this loan will be paid by all the companies that use the money of the depositors, including 59 housing cooperatives.
Adrian Coles, president of the Association of Housing Associations (BSA), said it was “disturbing” that companies and their members should pay.
The 14 billion-dollar loan will eventually be repaid after Bradford & Bingley's mortgages have been repaid.
However, the interest accrued in the meantime is charged annually to the 700 financial companies that use the loans.
The Financial Services Compensation System has confirmed to the BBC that the 59 housing cooperatives are among them as well.
It is frustrating that the institutions that have so far been cautious ... now have to pay the bills of those institutions that have been much less cautious.
Adrian Coles, BSA
We learned that every company has to pay the amount of deposit it owns. The companies share 18% of the costs with each other.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that the loan amount will reach <0xC2><0xA3>450 million in 2009.
This means that companies will have to spend <0xC2><0xA3>81 million to pay interest on the first year.
Adrian Coles, the director-general of the union of housing companies, told the BBC that he considered the measure unfair.
“It’s disappointing that institutions have to pay the bills of the much less cautious institutions that were cautious at the time of the recovery of the housing market.”
According to the BSA, no company has been destroyed since it began operations in 1945.
“In every respect, we need to look into this case over the next few weeks to decide how we can protect housing companies and their members from a significant amount of money,” Cole added.
The interest due in 2009 covers 7 months from the end of September to the end of March of this year.
In 2010, a full-year interest rate will have to be paid, which may even double the current rate.
Since the housing cooperatives are self-help organizations, without shareholders, the members will eventually have to pay the bill, either at higher fees or at lower interest rates received after their deposits.
The price of milk rises by five pennies per litre
In Jersey, people have to pay more for milk.
The Jersey dairy company has announced that it will raise the wholesale price of milk by an additional five pennies per litre from Monday.
This is the second price hike this year since the two-penny hike in February and after a survey conducted by an advisory company.
The resellers themselves decide whether to pass on the price increase to the consumers.
Before the February hike, the wholesale price of milk in Jersey changed for the last time in 2002.
Bangladesh's former parliamentarian's request to be released has been rejected
The Bangladeshi court has rejected a request by former MP Sheikh Hasina to defend his country's freedom, which means he can be arrested when he returns to the country.
His lawyer said the court refused to defend him on the grounds that he had stolen 50 million takas ($729.700) from a businessman during his parliamentary term.
This case is just one of the countless corruption charges brought against him.
Sheikh Hasina's former political opponent, Khaleda Zia, was released on bail this month.
Sheikh Hasina is due to return to Bangladesh in the next few weeks, but her party, the Awami League, is demanding that the country’s military-backed interim government first give her complete freedom.
According to reports, although conditionally released to go abroad for medical treatment, it is not clear from the conditions of free leg placement whether he can retain his freedom when he returns to the country.
His lawyers say he will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the appeals court's decision.
"The Court of Appeal dismissed Sheikh Hasina's request for bail, saying it was not necessary, since he has been temporarily released and is taking part in foreign medical treatment," said lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
"We will appeal against the decision of the Court of Appeal."
According to his lawyers, he needs to be defended in the free market in order to return to the country and prepare for the December elections.
Awami League leader said on Sunday that Sheikh Hasina is expected to return home after Oct. 17.
They were taken into custody last year after the army-backed interim government took power, but were released from prison in June to go abroad for medical treatment.
Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia both deny any charges against them.
Concerns over Afghanistan’s polio vaccination programme
According to the United Nations, nearly 200,000 Afghan children have been excluded from the recently organized polio vaccination programme due to violence against the Taliban.
Last week, the United Nations organized vaccination campaigns in six provinces.
However, they said they could not reach children living in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for safety reasons.
According to a UN spokesperson, all of this happened despite the Taliban’s promise that they will not attack or hinder the work of thousands of vaccine-providing personnel.
BSkyB’s appeal against ITV has been rejected
BskyB’s appeal was rejected against the decision of the Competition Committee, which directed it to reduce its interest in rival television broadcasting, ITV.
The Competition Court ordered BSkyB to reduce its share of ITV from 17.9% to below 7.5%.
In the past, the Committee found that BSkyB’s participation would impede competition and give the company unfair influence over ITV.
BSkyB bought its stake in 2006, effectively preventing NTL - which has since been renamed Virgin Media - from acquiring ITV.
In April 2007, the Competition Authority reported that the share acquired by BSkyB from ITV jeopardises the independence of ITV, prompting the Competition Committee to initiate an investigation.
Virgin's director, Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups, and Ofcom's oversight all opposed the acquisition.
BSkyB argued that the coercive reduction in ITV share was a pointless and disproportionate compensation – in particular given that BSkyB stated that it would be willing to give up its voting rights.
Re-examination of the case of U.S. prosecutors
The U.S. Attorney General has appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the disappearance of nine U.S. Attorneys in 2006.
The move was followed by a report by the Chief Superintendent of the Judiciary on the case criticised the decisions of government officials.
The report criticised White House officials, legislators and former chief prosecutor, Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was ordered because he feared the prosecutors would be dismissed for political reasons.
Nora Dannehy, a special counsel, will now investigate whether the officials who were interrogated during the investigation tried to prevent the prosecution by lying.
“Serious allegations of a possible crime have not yet been investigated and have not even been clarified,” said Glenn Fine, Chief Inspector.
One of his main proposals was to appoint a special prosecutor, who has the power to compel the witnesses to testify.
The series began with the removal of nine state prosecutors from the U.S. Judiciary in December 2006.
At the time, it was said that the prosecutors were fired because of their poor performance.
However, it was later revealed that the state prosecutors who were dismissed received no worse evaluation than many of their other colleagues, which led many to the conclusion that the dismissals were politically motivated.
Some state prosecutors participated in the criminal proceedings of high-ranking Republican congressional members, while others were unwilling to participate in the investigation of allegations of election fraud brought against the Democrats.
U.S. prosecutors are conducting an investigation on behalf of the government and conducting court cases.
They can be removed at any time, but not removed from their position for political reasons.
The then head of the Judicial Fund, Alberto Gonzales, became the target of the attacks due to the leaks and eventually resigned.
A number of other officials of the Judiciary have also filed their resignation.
In his report, Gonzales strongly criticised his role in the case, saying the chief prosecutor had "primary responsibility" for the layoffs, had "resigned" his managerial role, and had "absolutely withdrawn" from the process.
Other officials, including Karl Rove, a former aide to senior Bush, have been criticized for failing to certify co-operation in the investigation.
Meat Loaf Epos Recognized
Rock star Meat Loaf will receive accolades at the Q Awards for his epic anthem "Bat Out Of Hell".
The singer, who will receive a special gold medal next week at the London Celebration, said it was an honor to receive the award.
The nine-minute, fifty-second song was the title track for Meat Loaf's 1977 album, which was released in public.
Coldplay received the most nominations for this year’s awards, including four categories on the nominees list.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said: "There are some songs that go beyond the limits of time or genres, and "Bat Out Of Hell" is like that."
The song won by Jim Steinman required a very large sound, and this sound was Meat Loafé.
The song began with an almost two-minute instrumental phase.
It appeared as a single in 1979 and reached number 15 on the charts.
However, Meat Loaf's album "Bat Out Of Hell" has been on the charts for nearly nine years and has since sold more than 40 million copies.
Meat Loaf - real name Marvin Lee Aday - has recently been struggling with health problems. Among other things, in 2003, he underwent surgery due to a heart rhythm disorder after collapsing on stage.
In 2007, he had to cancel a few concerts due to a severe gum disease.
It was later discovered that there was a cyst on his vocal cords.
Unknown metropolitan street, which is often forgotten and may soon be sold
New York City has thousands of avenues, highways, and other sidewalks, some of which are famous, others are simply practical.
However, many experienced taxi drivers and long-lived locals could hardly tell where the Extra Place is located, mostly because they have never heard of it.
The small street is in East Village and runs north from First Street - without reaching to Second Street - between Bowery Avenue and Second Avenue.
It is about 9 m wide and 36 m long, and much more like a dusty alley than a main transport route.
There's no street signs.
Practically you can't find it on a standard map.
However, there are admirers on the street.
There is, for example, Avalon Bay, the builder of the newly built First Street luxury buildings.
You want to re-cover the Extra Place, and you want to make sure that you can get to the shops and boutiques of new buildings on a cleaner way.
The street’s admirers include the long-lived neighbors who were caught in the skeleton street that was the only remnant of the neighborhood’s past before renovations.
However, it is not in the interest of the street owner, the city’s building conservation and development department, to insist on it.
This month, at a meeting of the district municipal land management committee, the city and Avalon Bay representatives made a proposal that the builder would buy the street.
However, the committee would prefer to keep the street in charge of the city and asked for a new plan for next month, said Susan Stetzer, the district head of the 3rd municipal body.
"We already have very few areas in the possession of the city, and we want Extra Place to remain in the city," he said.
"There may be suggestions for refurbishment and management that Avalon can make, but we also want to ensure that it remains publicly available."
A few months ago, Avalon Bay announced that it wants to cover the small street again and provide seating, some of which would be used by a cafe, which the builder is expected to lease an area.
The idea that Avalon Bay would buy the street was first made public at this month's meeting.
Michele de Milly, spokeswoman for Avalon Bay, said that while the company wants to use the street, it does not insist on owning it.
"The main aspect of Avalon Bay is to renovate this downhill alley and turn it into a pleasant public lighthouse," he said, adding that the city had suggested buying it.
Seth Donlin, spokesperson for the Building Preservation Office, said the city really wanted to sell the street and noted that the office’s job was to develop the buildings and not manage them.
Compared to its more colorful neighbor, the Bowery, the Extra Place does not have much historical significance.
According to some, in 1802, Philip Minthorne was given the name "the land of no one" when his large estate was divided among his numerous children, and no one was required to pay for the narrow landline.
The 2006 closed punk-rock monument, the CBGB's back exit to the Extra Place, opened, and the street was perhaps the most prominent photograph of the film on the cover of Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia".
"It was a great location," said Danny Fields, manager of the Ramones, who took the photo in November 1976.
"It was full of rubbish, with clothes, with pieces of vats and posters, and with leaflets and ropes."
Some residents, including bloggers who write about how they took possession of the middle class East Village, oppose the sale of the Extra Place, arguing that this piece of public property, no matter how modest, should remain in the community’s possession.
Others refer to the Extra Place as a rarity, which is a virtually unchanged piece of the city and should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, author of the blog "Jeremiah's Missing New York" ("The Book of Siralms: The Bitter Nostalgia of the Extinction of the City"), posted on his blog a part of his story about Extra Place in his book "The New Yorker" in his post.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "The Extra Place is a narrow, small pocket that is dark even during the day, bordered by rusty, iron-made warehouse windows and cracked windows, and where one-week newspapers carry the wind in the canals."
The street, with a few exceptions, looked the same a few nights ago.
A rat ran through the end of the street, next to the back door, which once led to the CBGB, and now belongs to a clothing store with a higher price.
It was graffiti on the walls, and an empty 0.75-liter bottle of beer lay next to a discarded, fresh piece of paper.
Some pedestrians have said that the Extra Place rarely comes to mind, but they think it would be worth the renovation.
Fields said he believes some people underestimate the attractiveness of the street in its current state.
“I’ve spent the most beautiful years of my life in dark, stinky and tasteless places,” he said.
Debate on Bilingual Education: Continuous Exposure to the English Language Environment
In this part of the Education Observer, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the views of candidates on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, who is an experienced researcher at the Pacific Institute for Public Policy Research and the head of education research, is entitled “Not as good as you think: Why you need a middle class to have a school choice.”
It is not easy to walk in favor of voters from Spanish-speaking areas.
Barack Obama’s proposals for education are also included.
According to Obama’s campaign, “African-American and Spanish-speaking students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students,” and that’s true.
In order to overcome such performance differences, Obama’s education plan specifically supports, among other things, “transitional bilingual education” for English learners.
At the same time, for Obama, the question is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which places emphasis on non-English school education, outweighs his interest in tackling big performance differences.
Take, for example, the Sixth Street Prep Contractual General School in the eastern part of Los Angeles County.
Most of the school’s students are Spanish-speaking and low-income.
More than one-third of students – many of whom have recently arrived – are learning English.
Despite this, 100% of the fourth graders achieved excellent results in the 2008 State Mathematics Exam.
Equally impressive is that 93% of fourth graders have completed excellent English language and literature exams.
This incredible achievement was not achieved with the tool that Obama would prefer to use.
Sixth Street places the emphasis on repetition, practice, continuous evaluation of skills, and rejection of excuses.
In addition, and this is what Obama should take into account, according to Linda Mikels, director of Sixth Street, the school’s educational principle is the “full immersion” of English-taught students into the language environment.
The essence of the immersion method is the almost exclusive use of the English language in teaching other subjects.
Mikels, who opposes bilingual education, said: “We have achieved tremendous success in saying that if someone walked into a classroom, they wouldn’t notice who was the student who had just arrived from Mexico 12 months ago.”
"It works," he said, "it works for us."
Would Obama set an example for the other schools, such as the Sixth Street Prep, that teach a significant number of Spanish-speaking and English-speaking students?
The results achieved by the school should be clear to make the answer, however, because of the education policy of their own party (the National Educational Associations have long supported bilingual education), and since in our own right they can consistently stand for bilingual education.
While agreeing that immigrants need to learn English, Obama recently deplored the issue when he said that people shouldn’t be so concerned about the legislation being “exclusively English.”
Instead, he said, "They should get their kids to speak Spanish."
If Obama really wants to achieve a reduction in the differences between the results, he should seriously study the models that work, rather than look down and discard them.
Due to renewed concerns about the economy, the price of oil fell sharply
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday due to concerns that the U.S. bailout plan for financial markets will not be able to revive the economy.
Crude oil’s stocks fell seven percent to $99.80 in the morning at the New York Stock Exchange.
Prices have fallen by more than $20 per barrel since last Monday.
In the past two weeks, the stock market has been hit by financial turmoil on Wall Street and some powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After prices reached $145.29 per barrel in July, they fell to nearly $90 per barrel at the beginning of this month before being again affected by the immeasurable uncertainty of financial markets.
On Monday, the concern re-emerged investors even after Congressional leaders announced that they were able to agree on the economic bailout, which is the biggest in history, over the weekend.
The news has been overshadowed by concerns that the financial crisis will not be over for a long time.
In the wake of the crisis, Citigroup will acquire the Wachovia Corporation's banking business, the government announced on Monday.
Meanwhile, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalized the European financial conglomerate, Fortis.
Analysts at Barclays Capital said that the result of the desperate weekend talks "seems to have failed to revive the desire to trade on the stock exchanges with the rescue action."
As the economic situation deteriorates, demand for commodities, such as oil, is expected to decline as well.
“The future of the stock, interest rates and exchange rate markets has become uncertain around the world,” wrote an analyst at Deutsche Bank for investors.
"We believe that the market for goods will not be avoided by the 'epidemic'.
From the point of view of the commodity market, the biggest question is to what extent the “disease” of the United States is infecting the whole world, especially China.
As oil consumption decreased as a result of the slowdown in economic growth, the analysts of the banks fell from their expectations for next year, reducing their forecasts for oil and gas by 20% for 2009.
In the second quarter, the team set a record.
After spending more than eight seasons in the Jets than anyone else, Shaun Ellis, who played defensive end, thought he had seen it all.
But then he watched the second quarter unfold on Sunday, when the Jets turned a pointless game into a sensational match.
"I've never seen anything like this before," Ellis said.
The second quarter began after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals' game of batting was completely in tune with the dark clouds of the sky.
Brett Favre, quarterback, gave 12-yard touchdown pass to Laveranues Coles. This became a perfect forecourt for an afternoon in which their unfolding collaboration was significantly improved.
Favre gave Coles two more touchdown passes in this quarter, including when two consecutive cornerbacks fell 10 seconds before the end of the half-time.
"I didn't regret the effort," Favre said of the pass given to all of Coles.
"He's a hell of a good player.
So far, we have been able to communicate well with each other, no matter what people think.”
While Favre and Coles were battling, the defense stopped Cardinals manager Kurt Warner.
In the cornerback position, Darrelle Revis took a bad shot and threw it back with 32 yards, which reached a touchdown.
Eric Smith, the safety player reached into another pass and got the ball.
David Bowens, linebacker managed to kick the ball out of Warner's hand.
This could have been the last lap of the game's most amazing moment.
However, when the Cardinals lost the ball 10 seconds before the end and the Jets won, Jay Feely scored a 20-yard field goal, setting the 34:0 result.
This was the best result the Jets have achieved so far in a quarter.
When asked to coach the Jets, Eric Mangini, to characterize the game's mind-blowing character, he said, "The second or the third quarter?"
When they told him that both - the Cardinals scored 21 points in the third quarter and the Jets didn't get one - Mangini said: "I have to say that I enjoyed the second quarter much more than the third.
We got a lot of points in a short time.”
The rested Gebrselassie breaks its own world record
The Ethiopian Haile Gebrselassie once again showed why many consider the best mid- and long-distance runner ever, when she broke her own world record in Berlin on Sunday, becoming the first to run the 42.2 km in 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a win at 2:03:59, Gebrselassie improved 27 seconds on a previous 2:04:26 result, which he achieved last year in Berlin.
At the age of 35, he set the 26th world record for Gebrselassie’s career in a wide range of fields, from 1500 metres to marathon, winning world championships in almost all seasons or achieving a world record.
Last month, Gebrselassie missed the Beijing Olympic marathon, fearing — which in turn may have proved too cautious — that air pollution would further exacerbate asthma problems.
Instead, he was nominated for the Berlin Marathon.
In almost perfect conditions – in sunny weather, initially at 9 <0xC2><0xB0>C and at the end at 13 <0xC2><0xB0>C – Gebrselassie won on Sunday at an incredible speed of 2 minutes and 56 seconds per kilometre.
Since previous non-marathon runners such as Gebrselassie and Kenyan Paul Terga turned to longer distances, the marathon record has fallen by more than two minutes in the past decade since Brazil’s Ronaldo da Costa in 1998 at 2:06:05 in Berlin.
After Sunday’s victory, Gebrselassie told reporters that two weeks ago, he had his two leg cranes and could not exercise for two weeks.
It is obvious that during the forced rest, it was refreshed, and it was not irritated.
"I'm so happy," Gebrselassie told reporters.
"It all worked out perfectly.
I started training again a week ago, and today I had doubts, but in the end everything was fine."
He has received some criticism – particularly from Kenya, Ethiopia’s East African rival – for using too many tools in his races, usually avoiding many world-renowned marathon runners, relying on his racing drivers as if he were running on the track, and setting his world record for this race.
However, this criticism hardly diminishes Gebrselassie’s greatness in long-term running.
Gebrselassie reached the starting point in 1:02:04 with the participation of four Kenyan racers on Sunday.
Two top Kenyan runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi gave Gebrselassie the rhythm after the tremors were exhausted.
With just over 4.8 kilometres ahead of the finish, Gebrselassie dropped Kwambai in a final sprint, finishing second to the finish with 2:05:36, improving his personal best by 5 minutes.
Kamathi finished third in 2:07:48.
In the women's race, Kazakhstan-born Irina Mikitenko, who is now a German citizen, finished a remarkable year with her seventh fastest win, 2:19:19.
The world summit is held by British Paula Radcliffe with a time of 2:15:25.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko won the marathon in London with a result of 2:24:14.
He was unable to participate in the Beijing Olympics due to his alleged back injury, but he quickly recovered and won the Berlin Marathon, where he improved on his personal top by five minutes. This was the third long-distance marathon he participated in.
He won the race with a clever calculation: first he allowed a group of four Ethiopians and Kenyans to break through and get a significant lead, and then he got behind them after a run of about 30 km.
Ethiopian Askale Tafa Magarsa finished second with a time of 2:21.31, while Kenyan Helena Kiprop finished third with a result of 2:25:01.
A Separate City, the Pride and Trials of Blacks
In an amusement park in Greater Orlando, a few miles away from everything that’s shimmering, loud, and huge, lies a quiet little town where the pride and complexity of African-American life were born.
Eatonville, the first purely black city to integrate into the country, and which was Zora Neale Hurston's childhood home, is no longer as simple as he described in 1935: "the five lakes, three croquettes, 300 brown leather towns, 300 good swimmers, plenty of guava and cages."
Now it's a pilgrimage site.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison, and Ruby Dee have attended the annual Zora Festival. The Eatonville festivities are held in honor of Hurston, the most famous female writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
However, in many respects, the city he described and made a tourist attraction – which is also included in the Florida travel guide published by the Federal Writers of the Crisis Project – is distinct from its surroundings.
As independent, dignified and closing as it was in the 1930s, when, according to Hurston's writing, Florida, urban blacks were often unwilling to share their true thoughts with white people who "know so little about us that they don't know what they're talking about."
Even in the year when the black presidential candidate, Barack Obama, encourages an open exchange of ideas on the issue of race, many here are distrustful of the views of outsiders.
"We take great care how our story is told," said 59-year-old Hortense Jones, who has lived here all his life and is a member of the city's oldest church.
"You have to tell me."
Eatonville has long been characterized by a paradox of victory and struggle.
At the same time, it is a historically significant model of the black population, but at the same time it is a community of nearly 2,400 people where poverty rates reach double the national average.
Partly a literary node, and partly an example of American slavery, sometimes looked down, sometimes for praise, on a southern, urban, black culture that flourished in the shadow of oak trees.
It’s no surprise, then, that the people here are both proud and defenders.
The image of Eatonville has been important since Zora (here everyone calls Hurston).
In books written in an honest, strong dialect - such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937) - he introduced his hometown to the world.
The five paragraphs of the Florida Travel Guide have transformed the city, located next to Route 17, from Florida’s long-forgotten center to one of the locations of black history and human drama.
Hurston, who was brave in both life and literature, introduced his readers to Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then looked into the more confidential spheres.
He wrote: “We find a modern public school on the right, with a brown-based white border, carefully maintained courtyards and playgrounds that Howard Miller takes care of, although he can barely write and read.”
She mentioned Dash's new husband and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells all kinds of drinks and anything that may be needed in temporary accommodations."
Thus, in a few hundred words, Hurston associated Eatonville with autonomy, but at the same time with illiteracy, remarriage, and sex.
It is clear that Fodor's guidebook presented it differently.
This description really didn’t like everyone.
"She told me things the way they were," said Ella Dinkins, a 90-year-old Johnson girl, who made them immortal by quoting the screaming songs that men sang about their beauty.
He added, "Some people don't like it."
Hurston is still remembered here as the living individual who often visited home after his family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
The 77-year-old Augustus Franklin recalled that when Hurston stormed the city, he usually arrived unannounced in a bustling Chevrolet, smoking cigarettes, and in a city with long sleeves where people still pride themselves on their dignified outfits today.
It fascinated most people, Franklin said, but a lot of people sneered.
“People were always happy to see Zora,” Franklin said.
However, on the terrace overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized, he added, hinting in his chair, "He never stayed too long."
When Hurston died in 1960, he was poor and his books were not republished.
It seemed that Eatonville, along with most of the world, had forgotten about it.
Although she was once a popular writer, a contemporary of Langston Hughes, and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in a signless grave in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she previously lived.
In Eatonville there were no significant memorabilia, or large, public readings.
"I don't think they understood how much he enriched the world or what he left us at all," said Valerie Boyd, author of Hurston's 2003 biography, "Wrapped in a Rainbow."
The turning point came in 1980.
Orange County officials wanted to build a five-lane road across the city through the two-lane main road, instead of Kennedy Avenue, which played an important role in community life.
Expanding Orlando has already penetrated the Interstate 4 motorway that connects the states on the western border of the city.
The proposal came when Eatonville was still on foot after a difficult historical period.
Among other things, forced integration has put an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the struggles related to racial mixing made the community taste of hatred.
“At that time, a team of white boys came over and threw out those sitting on the side of the road with oranges and other things,” Franklin said.
"There was a woman who died in this.
They threw a Greek woman out of a car.”
In a letter to The Orlando Sentinel in 1955, Hurston questioned the Supreme Court's decision to impose violent integration, stating in his "Brown v. Board of Education" ruling: "It violates me rather than you."
Today, residents say that while the school disintegration has been positive in some respects, it has weakened the cohesion of the Eatonvilles and undermined the confidence of young people.
"Black children are used to killing them - I remember that - the man hugged his teacher in the morning and in the evening," said N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins, the executive director of the non-profit organization We Save the Eatonville Community.
"This lasted as long as the students and teachers came from a common place," he added.
“We didn’t hug our white teacher because he was a white teacher — I mean, there were cultural differences between us,” Nathiri said.
However, human rights has helped many others to rise up to Zora Neale Hurston – in black writers, actors, and artists who have risen above prejudices, as she has done, with such overwhelming self-confidence and lines as this: “How can anyone know?
It's inconceivable to me."
In 1975, Alice Walker wandered to Hurston's signless grave and began to struggle to restore her reputation.
Five years later, a well-known Hurston biography, written by Robert E. Hemenway, was added to the shelves of bookstores, and it was re-emerged among the examples of America.
The road construction project had just begun when Eatonville’s most famous daughter was once again at the centre of attention.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbors treated him as a savior.
In 1988, the community began organising a Hurston festival to show what would ruin the county's main route.
Thousands of fans have come to the opening event two years later, and since then many have returned to the celebration every January.
A few years later, the county resigned from its proposed road construction.
"Because of the highway's acceleration, the community has been revitalized, connected to full speed, which is a real civic pride," Nathiri said.
Boyd put it more simply: "So he saved Eatonville."
The victory over the road construction project helped to change the city’s image of itself.
Increasing numbers of people outside the city appeared, such as lawyer Rachelle Munson, who started going to church in 1993, and locals began to reevaluate the past.
Eatonville was added to the National Historic List in 1998.
In 2006, a new, one-storey library (named after Hurston, of course) opened on refurbished and beautified Kennedy Avenue.
Eatonville remains the cucumber of Florida: it’s not just ten miles from downtown Orlando, but sometimes it feels like an out-of-town sidewalk in the summer rain; it’s as small as when 27 black families were founded in the 1880s.
(Today, 90% of the population is black.)
They are still cautiously welcoming outsiders who come here looking for the story of Eatonville to tell.
Most interviews require prior permission, and some things - such as Eatonville's oldest fresco, painted by a white man and depicting black people working on the ground - should not be photographed.
In Eatonville, many – including the self-confident Jones teacher, who is particularly attracted to bright red – are afraid to misunderstand their separate community.
And yet, as the Hurston Festival became more and more extensive, the pride of the hometown grew.
Young people, in particular, are increasingly looking at Eatonville as Hurston saw his own race: amazing, with his problems and with everything not better, not worse, as proud, creative, diligent, foolish, and confused as the other races.
An honest civic commitment is silenced by the words of Franklin’s nephew, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who plans to return after college to work with the local government or the police, who he believes will be in need of help.
And it seems younger people have also learned to properly characterize Eatonville, such as the 11-year-old Winter Park twins Alondra and Alexia Kenon.
"Most of those who just walk through here think this city is nothing compared to the rest," Kenon said on Sunday after the ceremony.
“But if someone stops and takes some time to get to know their history, it’s a very beautiful city.”
We in New York all speak the language of finance.
Nothing on the surface has changed.
If tourists didn’t care about the newspaper-priced boulevard and the huge TV launchers in Times Square, they wouldn’t notice that they’re in the middle of a storm.
They would never realize that with glass-walled, bee-shaped offices over their heads, the bankers and venture fund managers who hold New York in their power have been living the hardest days since 1929.
The couriers are still rolling through their metal tea carts on the sidewalks, carrying trays loaded with muffins for morning meetings.
Men with Spanish lip are still sniffing between the houses, wearing fifty-one-fifths of effervescent wool like human blood, hanging on their shoulders on a rope similar to theirs.
Office workers are still in line for their breakfast sweet pastry at the dining trolleys on the sidewalk, and it is still impossible to catch a taxi every weekday between 4 and 7 p.m.
I didn’t feel there would be any crisis until Thursday afternoon, despite all the alarming news, I decided to open a new bank account.
Although I purposely planned to do this in the afternoon’s quiet at the local bank account of J.P. Morgan Chase, there were already 20 people in front of me.
Not at the cash register window, where you can pick up or pay up, but at the customer service desk, where older customers order a checkbook, tourists ask for directions to the Macy's store, and where new customers have a bank account.
Many before me - I learned later from Starr, the "ordered to me" banker - were in line with the same intentions as I did.
However, unlike me, they have already withdrawn their money from smaller banks at their residence, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Staten Island.
They borrowed money from so-called savings banks (such as housing cooperatives), credit unions, and small-town savings banks that only operate in a single state and allegedly treat their customers as family members.
Over the past year, 15 such banks have been silently destroyed.
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion of capital, has been put under bankruptcy, and when the New Yorkers returned home for the weekend, another bank, Wachovia, sought a bailout with a savings of $440 billion.
The office and store workers in front of me, in fear of another collapse, took their money to a bank that seemed to be a safe haven, to the bank that makes the most capital injection buyouts on Wall Street.
The simple people of New York have become experts in finance over the past few weeks.
A woman in a local Chinese store on her phone went bankrupt about Lehman Brothers Bank and its huge-looking CEO, Dick Fuld, as if complaining to a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, my housemate who was in uniform for the fifties, changed the subject, and we weren't talking about Brad and Angelina, or about my food shipment as we used to.
He said to me after I went to the bank: “I invested all my saved money in money market assets.
I changed, you didn't take any chances."
Muslim Cemetery Degraded While Austria Billed to the Right
Heinz-Christian Strache, from the right-wing Austrian Freedom Party, and Filip Dewinter, from the Belgian right-wing party, from the Vlaams Belang, took part in a demonstration in Antwerp on Thursday, January 17, 2008, in which the "V<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xA1>szl<0xC3><0xA1>k Iszl<0xC3><0xA1>szl<0xC3><0xA1>k" was presented.
They were drawn with signs imitating traffic signs depicting mosques crossed by a red line.
According to police, far-right extremists are responsible for the degradation of Austrian Muslim cemeteries, which happened on the same weekend as far-right parties significantly advanced in the national parliamentary elections.
More than 90 graves were gravely damaged at the Trauni cemetery next to Linz, sometime between Friday evening and this morning.
The perpetrators drew Jewish symbols, such as the Star of David, on some graves, but the investigators said they were only trying to hide their extreme motives, which stem from hatred against Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident can be linked in any way to the elections.
A spokesperson for the local Islamic community said they were “deeply shocked” to hear the funeral, which took place shortly before the end of the Muslim religious month of Ramadan.
Austria, meanwhile, is conducting a scrutiny of conscience following yesterday's parliamentary elections, during which the language of the political balance is on the right.
The two far-right parties, which won nearly 30% of the vote, campaigned for the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, a strongly anti-immigration law, and some of their slogans were branded by their critics as xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the president of the Freedom Party, which has won more than 18% of the vote, has also voiced his disapproval of the campaign against scarves and burqas, as well as against foods allegedly linked to Islam.
At the party’s final meeting in Vienna, he spoke of a “European brotherhood” that would help prevent the consolidation of Islam.
Both parties want to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, arguing that they are political symbols of the ongoing Islamization of Austria and Europe.
According to public opinion polls and analyses carried out immediately after the elections to win the far-right, the change was largely due to young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Garry Glitter Banned From Traveling Abroad
Garry Glittert, a well-known rock star convicted of raping children, has been banned from the court's trip to France and Spain.
The judges then ruled on Glitter's six-month ban to notify the authorities that he was in control of his intention to travel through France to Spain.
The Kent police on Thursday obtained a travel ban after filing evidence to the court of convictions of sexual violence against children against Glitter, according to Reuters.
Glitter, real name Paul Gadd, did not attend the Ashford Magistrates trial in Kent, but was represented by the lawyers of Corker Binning.
A court spokesperson said: "On Thursday, September 25, the Kent police filed a request to the Ashford Magistrates' Court for Paul Gadd's planned trip to France and Spain on March 25.
"Paul Gadd did not appear in person."
The 64-year-old Glitter has notified authorities of her intention to travel abroad because it is required to do so by the law on those in the register of sex offenders.
You should notify the authorities if you intend to travel abroad for more than three days.
You are also required to notify the police at least seven days before your planned departure.
If it fails to notify the authorities, they may be sentenced to five years of imprisonment.
The Kent police said they don't want to talk about their unique cases inside Glitter County and their possible whereabouts.
A Kent police spokesman said: “The Kent police are doing everything they can to protect children at home and abroad.
"In our opinion, it is easier to control someone if they do not leave the UK, because there is a comprehensive system at our disposal that allows us to manage potential risks more effectively.
"The main task of the Kent Police is to protect the people of Kent. Through close cooperation, we continuously monitor the conduct of persons who are registered in the register of sexual offences and those who live in the county, to minimize their behavior."
Glitter returned to the UK last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for raping a 10-year-old and an 11-year-old girl.
After his release, he flew to Bangkok, where he had to board a plane to London.
However, he claimed that he felt bad and was not willing to fly to London.
The foreign authorities were not allowed to pass the passport examination, so they eventually flew to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also refused to allow him to enter the country, so he flew back to Bangkok, where officials from the foreign police and the immigration office insisted that he return to the UK.
Finally, on 22 August, he arrived at Heathrow Airport Terminal 3, and remained there until his lawyer, David Corker, went to the court in West London, uxbridge, as he was acquitted in a court of appeal against the plaintiffs of Scotland Yard.
Glitter spent four months in prison in the United Kingdom in 1999 for possession of photographs depicting the rape of children.
According to a source from the Interior Ministry, Jacqui Smith, the Secretary of State for the Interior, calmly welcomed Glitter’s refusal to travel to France and Spain.
“I don’t take pictures on stage because I want to show the artist on my personal side.” – Günther Bauer
There's no set, no pads, no dance shoes.
The great masters of flamenco are close to the body, without the excitement of acting: to get to know the ordinary face of the dancers.
On the one hand, the artist.
On the other hand, ordinary people.
And these two sides cannot be separated, except in intimate moments, far from the audience, when we can go through a personal movement, we can grab the depth of a caught look, or we can be amazed at the appearance of a skeleton of a veil, not of a stage.
In the German series Flamenco-people, Günther Bauer combines the theatricality of singers, dancers and guitarists with this lesser-known everyday page.
Through the photos, he presents the distinctive iconography of flamenco from different perspectives.
The exhibition, which is part of the Flamenco Photography Month, "reflects the international importance of flamenco from day to day" - the creator believes, adding that the Flamenco-people "can be a character of anyone on the scene, since the images are seen by the observers in the scene of this image that is not shocking to you,
These people on the street are artists who are capable of bringing passion, sadness, joy to the stage... and smothering the audience.
At the same time, stage photography is not suitable for capturing their personality.
Their personality and character resides in the depths of their being.
I wanted to create an intimate atmosphere that would allow me to capture the personality of the great flamenco with the help of the camera.”
The Cante de las Minas festival gave a boost to Bauer’s long journey in 1997, during which he made portraits of flamenco singers, guitarists and dancers with a record camera.
Thanks to the camera and the theme selection, these portraits evoke classic photography.
The use of various stylistic instruments, however, breaks with traditional imagery and suggests modernity. The following idea faithfully reflects Bauer's notion of flamenco: "This is a music with traditional roots, which, however, changes from day to day and is always impressive."
Not the dance, not the song or the music itself, but rather the personality of the artist, character enchants the audience.
The main motif of the works that can be seen in the El Fotomata gallery in these days is the search for an encounter with the essence, the magic of art, which becomes visible through the way of perception, existence and display.
Famous figures of flamenco, including Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, are the metallic names of this collection of photographs that will be presented by 60 artists.
The project has also become a flamenco anthology, of which an album with portraits on display will soon be released.
Two years ago, Bauer’s passion for portraits echoed the idea with the series “Portraits of Veteran Athletes” (“SportARTproject”).
Although the concept of Flamenco-people differs slightly from this, the photographer adds: "I love to photograph people, get to know them and step into their lives for a longer or shorter time.
In my opinion, the most difficult genre of photography is portraiture.
You meet people, you meet people, you meet people you don’t even know, or you spend just a few minutes taking pictures.
But in spite of these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to realize my ideas.
Selected from the contemporary flamenco portraits, the exhibition entitled Flamenco-people can be viewed at the El Fotomata Gallery until October 16th, at the parallel calle de la Mata, Alameda de Herculess.
According to Vargas Llosa, the novel he works on is "ready blindness"
The location and the plot are still unknown to him, but Mario Vargas Llosa is also trying to write his new novel. The main character of the novel is an Irish nationalist, Roger Casemant, who lived in the Congo and visited the Amazon for twenty years.
A Nobel Prize-winning writer at the Hay Festival in Segovia yesterday admitted that his current work is “ready to blindness” and “all signs suggest that you shouldn’t write” the novel.
"If I were smarter, I wouldn't do it, but I'll do it, and I hope someday I'll make a point at the end" - with these words he concluded his speech at the festival of exchanges of ideas, thoughts and opinions, and he took his place in the city of Aqueduct for four days.
The author of "The City and the Dogs" was one of the most prominent participants in the literary festival, and he also exchanged the hopes attached to it.
Vargas Llosa won the Hay Festival Award, voted by the participants, for an old edition of Dickens' novel "Our Common Friend". His performance was filled by the Juan Bravo Theatre.
After the greeting of Félix Romeo, he received a dedicated audience. The hour soon fell upon the audience, during which the Peruvian writer, with a wonderful memory and a great deal of humor, told him how he had developed his reading, his reading, his reading, his reading, his reading, his reading, his reading, his reading, his reading, his reading, his reading, his reading, and his life's desire.
With them, the Latin American novelist acknowledged that it was impossible to measure or prove whether the books would change our lives, but he added: "I don't think that literature is merely a form of entertainment or a flower-life experience", for it is a question of them, for it does not affect people, and it is a question of thinking.
Shorter bye in Pozoblanco due to the weather, the horse-riding bullfighters are also missing
The traditionally held as the closing chord of the Pozoblanco holidays, the horse-riding bullfighting was cancelled from the show yesterday morning after future horse-riders found the grounds of the arena unsuitable for the viadal.
As a result, the committee decided, with the agreement of Ferm<0xC3><0xAD>n Boh<0xC3><0xB3>rquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez, to leave the bullfighter.
The weather conditions greatly affected the festive series, as two of the three events could not be held.
On Saturday, due to the rain, the second bull road was left.
The future protagonists, José Luis Moreno, Curro D<0xC3><0xAD>az and Juan Bautista Castilblanc<0xC3><0xB3>i, would have fought bulls.
So they only had a bullfight on Friday.
The winner Daniel Luque became, brought home three ears as a trophy. After a sophisticated and aesthetic fight, they were brought up on their shoulders.
On the same afternoon, Alejandro Talavante won a number of awards and trophies through his two bulls, but this was due to the audience rather than his own performance.
However, it was followed by El Juli, who contributed little to the aging reputation of the Los Llanos arena.
After a comfortable ride with the second bull, a large part of the audience was able to get out of the saddle.
In Alava, a two-ton hash truck tried to escape road checks.
Four o'clock fifty minutes in the morning.
The Basque Territorial Police carries out traffic control in the administrative area of Armi<0xC3><0xB1><0xC3><0xB3>n (<0xC3><0x81>lava).
The authorities stop a van in which two people are travelling, and the passengers are trying to escape the measure.
The shipment, more than two tons of hashish, at the same time was not noticeable.
Investigators tracked down the passengers and arrested one of them, a 28-year-old man, and identified as A.A.J., the Interior Department of the Basque government said.
The arrested man is accused of drug trafficking and document falsification.
The case took place in the administrative area of Armi<0xC3><0xB1><0xC3><0xB3>n, where employees of the <0xC3><0x81>lava Traffic Surveillance carried out traffic control on the N-1 motorway.
When they wanted to stop the van, the driver refused to obey, suddenly gave gas, and then left the checkpoint.
Investigators took the vehicle to a chase, and the vehicle stopped a few miles away on the runway, and its passengers fled from the highway to a forested area.
The Basque Regional Police finally caught one of them, and after inspecting the Iveco Daily branded van, seized its shipment of 2,178 kilograms of hashish.
The back of the vehicle was loaded with abdominal swabs, which were transported by the police to undergo a more thorough investigation and measure the drug.
In addition, the inspection has shown that the false license plate of the vehicle does not match the data contained in the van’s papers, and therefore a proceeding is also initiated against the arrested person on the grounds of forgery of public documents.
The Basque Regional Police continues the investigation, which is aimed at arresting the other suspect, who, as we have already mentioned, has escaped from the highway, and on the other hand, to determine the origin of the seized drug.
The 28-year-old defendant, A.A.J., was sent to the police to carry out the necessary interrogations, and within a few hours, court proceedings began.
Actress Heather Locklear arrested for driving under the influence of a drug
Actor Heather Locklear, the popular Amanda of the Melrose Place series, was arrested over the weekend by police in Santa Barbara, California, for driving under the influence of drugs.
According to a witness, he was trying to leave the parking lot in Montecito with strange manoeuvres, a spokesperson for California’s traffic control told People magazine.
According to the witness, Locklear "took the gas to the floor at around 4:30 p.m., tilted the engine, tried to leave the parking lot forward and backwards, and passed through the sunglasses several times in retrospect."
Not long later, the witness, who for the first time probably did not recognize the actress, saw Locklear stop on a nearby highway and get out of the car.
He also informed the police that he was "worried about Locklear's life."
When the police arrived, the actress was sitting in her car, which partially impaired the traffic on the highway.
"It looked like magic," that's why the guards were taken to a specialised center for drug and alcohol testing.
According to a police spokesperson, the actress was cooperating and alcohol consumption was almost immediately excluded, and the spokesperson also said that on the first impression of the officers believed that she was under the influence of Locklear's drug.
Lockleart was arrested and suspected of driving under the influence of an unidentified drug. Around 7 p.m. they were taken to the local prison, where they were released a few hours later.
Locklear came out of an Arizona sanatorium two months ago where he was treated for anxiety and depression.
Llamazares calls on the Andalusian Federation of the IU (United Left) to take action in the Silva case
Gaspar Llamazares, the general secretary of the IU and the representative of the United Left, said today that the regional federation of the formation will make a decision in the case of the former Youth and Sports Councillor of the Municipality of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva. Silva resigned after resigning last week.
"I am a far-flung federalist in these matters, and this case is indeed the responsibility of the Andalusian organization," Llamazares said, pointing out the procedure that the party should apply against a former member of the city council in Seville.
On the other hand, the president of the IU stressed that "transparency" should be kept in mind when detecting any irregularities that Silva may have committed: "The IU has always been flattened in order to maximise transparency in such cases."
He added that part of the training was “the strict code of ethics for public servants as well.”
"Majestic Blood", Garci's epic composition
Benito Pérez Gald<0xC3><0xB3>s’s National Episodes inspired José Luis Garci, who evokes the famous anti-French revolt of the Spaniards in the blood of May, which, with a budget of almost 15 million euros, is the greatest work of his filmography.
Accordingly, the director tried to illustrate the human trajectory and social analysis that he had always admired in the work of the well-known novelist. Today, in the presentation of the film Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarr<0xC3><0xAD>a, Garci told the audience of the actors.
The more than two and a half hours of May blood will be shown in the cinema on Friday, and later the Telemadrid will be shown as a mini-series of more than four hours.
José Luis Garci, a great admirer of Gald<0xC3><0xB3>s’ literature, realized his childhood dream with this film. All of this is due to Esperanza Aguirre, because he entrusted him three years ago to his son Garci<0xC3><0xB3>n from the Province of Madrid to make a memoir of his 200th episodes.
The 15 million budget was entirely financed by the Autonomous Province of Madrid, and Garci was given a special opportunity to present, with an age-old ornament and costume, "the confused Spaniards who were mistakenly in favour of the wrong leader, because the struggle for independence would be a great one."
The director expressed his regret, however, that he could not count on the budget of Alatriste or Goya’s phantoms, which had more than doubled in May’s blood. Therefore, he was forced to skip some scenes from the screenplay, which - like many other times - Horacio Valc<0xC3><0xA1>rcel along with his ticket.
So the director of The Reboot turned to his usual way of working, taking up the scenes with the actors with whom he had already started the rehearsals before filming. Casting wasn't because Garci considered it "disgraceful" to us, and because, as he said, "it's a part of the director.
Several actors of the May Blood, such as Miguel Rell<0xC3><0xA1>n, Carlos Larra<0xC3><0xB1>aga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo, did not step in front of his camera for the first time.
Garci, who has won four Oscar nominations and won an Oscar, believes that this year's candidates representing Spain before the Hollywood Academy, namely the Blood of May, the Seven French Billiards table, and his final "spawn of the Blind" are not to be found in any of the sunflowers.
Garci doesn't count on awards with this movie.
“At first you think you’re working for the aftermath, then you realize that happiness matters, and finally you’re happy when another movie is finished,” Garci says with a 30-year professional career behind his back.
Isabel Bay<0xC3><0xB3>n recalls the life and art of the Sevilla dancer T<0xC3><0xB3>rtola Valencia
A flamenco dancer from Seville is also remembered as a dancer from Seville.
Carmen T<0xC3><0xB3>rtola Valencia, a Catalan father (Floren<0xC3><0xA7> T<0xC3><0xB3>rtola Ferrer) and Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valencia), was born in the Triana district and moved to London with her parents at the age of three.
He was an artist of free dance and an expert in Eastern dances.
Throughout her career, she pioneered women’s equality, including Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf, and Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and vegetarian and fought against the wearing of ropes that impeded women’s freedom of movement.
A dance and aesthetic revolution exploded in war-torn Europe, his life stunned Isabel Bay<0xC3><0xB3>n.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gambo, he recommended Tortola to me, whose personality really impressed me."
The flamenco dancer said: “Our goal is not to tell the story of her life, but to capture her soul.
I was reminded of the flamenco styles of her dances.
For example, from the "dance of the bat" to the guajira, or from the "snake dance" to the tango.
"He danced sensibly, and according to others, my style is characterised by this," she says.
The light of the performance is elevated by two extraordinary contributors: Miguel Poveda is now singing Isabel’s performance again after the Open Door; and Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to work with a former student.
"Matilde transforms the older Tortola, the mature woman.
I'm glad you said yes to the request, it's a great honor to be performing in my piece."
In addition, the production includes Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s Torres and Paco Arriaga musical directors and guitarists, Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Mor<0xC3><0xB3>n singers; El P<0xC3><0xA1>jaro batsman, Rafa El Viola brother, and Juanfra Ju<0xC3><0xA1>rez actor, who "continues with his true character."
The piece also largely depicts the life of a woman who lives in London, but also travels to Europe, and then reaches distant landscapes, including India, the United States or Italy.
“I wanted to remind him because his personality had a big impact on his age, but at the same time they are no longer known and valued for his work,” Bay<0xC3><0xB3>n says.
The performance starts at 8:30 p.m. tonight at the Lope de Vega Theatre.
At the end of the Triennium, the diary of a newly married poet will also appear.
The first illustrated edition of A Newly Married Poet’s Diary will be presented in Saint Stephen’s Church (New York), where Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Jiménez married Zenobia in May 1916. The exhibition is presented in the Commission of Zenobia and Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Triennium (2006-2008).
In this way, the final chord of the Zenobia and Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Triennium is the re-issue of this work, the International Congress held in New York, the restoration of the memory of the Nobel Prize-winning poet and the design of the monument to the memory of the poet, and the exhibition "Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Jiménez's Andrés in his provincial collection: The s of the Provincial Nos of the Trees of the Trees of the Trees".
The Cultural Committee of the Regional Government of Andalusia acquired a total of eight hundred copies from the diary of a newly married poet, published by Perdo Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to promote the reputation and work of one of the most versatile Andalusian poets.
Without Paul Newman, America is not so attractive.
"God sometimes brings in perfect people.
Paul Newman was like that.”
The quote comes from actress Sally Field who worked with Newman in the film The Victims of Sensation, and reflects the shock and powerlessness that Newman’s death caused in American cinema and throughout America.
How difficult it was to win an Oscar.
He retired in 2007.
He was unknowingly ill,
But still, his death afflicts all of us.
"Sometimes it is impossible to put our feelings into words, and I have now lost a good friend," said Robert Redford in tears, "his existence has made my life and this country better."
No one was afraid that he might be ridiculed or exaggerated.
One of the heroes of cinema and home has gone through a particularly dark period overshadowed by fear of terrorism and market conditions, a desperate search for American self-esteem and dignity.
When such difficult times are going on and many people easily lose their virtues and there are very few people left that we can look up to, there is no need to be Luis Cernuda to admire Paul Newman.
In people’s eyes, Plato’s vision of beauty and justice embodied reality.
Richard Nixon was a formal enemy and defender of lost and won cases, from the anti-drug foundation created in memory of his first-born son who died of drug overdose to the creation of his homemade bio-food brand.
It was a real gift to a country that could hardly surpass its suicidal nutrition culture.
The astonishing wave of admiration swept through all of Hollywood regardless of nationalities and origins.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, was not a man, but an era passed away with him.
Another Englishman, Oscar-winner Sam Mendes, said his collaboration with Newman clearly marked the pinnacle of his career.
Russell Crowe, a bad boy from Australia, called Newman the greatest inspiration of all time.
“It has made a very high point for all of us,” said George Clooney, one of perhaps the few people who are trying to follow Paul Newman’s lifestyle today: demanding honesty and a serious and camera-free privacy.
It’s not always easy if it’s possible in the middle of today’s media jungle.
Still, there's someone who's trying and Paul Newman's exemplary.
He divorced once, but then lived in a faithful marriage with Joanne Woodward for fifty years, and he would have had many opportunities for infidelity.
"Why do I eat hamburgers somewhere else when the fried meat is waiting at home?" he joked.
In heaven, you can be proud of the fact that your daughters on earth are also fans, which is not so common in America.
“None of his creations was as proud as the role of a faithful husband, a loving father, a caring grandfather and a devoted human friend,” he said.
Category: Roads to the Olympics in Madrid
Indeed, many of us dream of a Madrid Olympics, and after 2012 failed, it might be 2016.
But, I'm asking, are we really prepared for it?
Because if we get out of yesterday's race, I don't think so.
It was called a perfect race, but in my opinion it was the worst of all I've ever been.
It was characterised by a series of misunderstandings, and if you had to evaluate it once, and I would be the examiner, clearly the result would be a failure.
But let's move on and start at the beginning.
The nonsense began with the taking of the serial number, because that was why it had to arrive earlier.
This is not a problem in itself yet, but if you go earlier, at least get everything at once (including the chip, a job in the later row should be avoided).
Well, that didn't happen.
First they gave only the serial number (first nonsense, only to go there sooner) and (after the usual line of work) what a surprise it was only an S-shirt (second nonsense, because for me it is exactly XL in size)!
What world are we living in?
Or because of the crisis, have they decided to save on the material and buy only cheaper, small-sized T-shirts?
But anyway, these things are still broken compared to what happened on the day of the race.
In addition to having to take over the chip at a terrible early stage, the line took 15 minutes from the arrival, and even the backpack had to be dropped.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible for a race with more than 11,000 people.
So, as expected, the race started, and we haven't given up the backpack yet, and when it was finally done, it was even worse.
In addition, the rain made the wait for more than 40 minutes even more pleasant, which was fueled by attempts at popular uprisings and stand-attack.
I think we're going to have about 500 pneumonia by tomorrow, and some of us, including myself, are not going to get our placement in real time, because I suppose my chip set the start wrong.
If you asked me about the perfect race, of course, it wouldn’t happen to me.
So I think we can continue to dream of a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft (Virtual) Reception
At the MIT Emerging Technologies conference, Microsoft introduced the development of a new system of image recognition and human interaction, a kind of - not too intelligent - artificial intelligence, which, however, is able to perform some basic tasks on the basis of some of my field of knowledge.
This "receptionist" with the help of a camera and a form and face recognition system is able to recognize how many there are in the room who they are - in fact, it also notes what kind of dress they are wearing - and also hears and understands the keywords of their conversations.
In addition, you can group the attendees based on the conversations.
In the video, the receptionist identifies a third person, but she knows that she does not belong to the company she is talking to and is not an employee of the company.
He asks if he has come to visit anyone and assures him that soon he will be in a hurry to help.
All this without the big blue screen.
Impressive.
This is, of course, the music of the future.
Currently, the company also has a more important role to play, such as developing a new version of the Windows operating system.
This week, many protested that Microsoft had changed its strategy.
Windows 7 will be smaller and will contain fewer add-ons.
Steve Ballmer realized that if computers were to run only the necessary programs instead of the many commercials, the machines would be five times faster - bravo, Steve, that's something.
They invented the Spanish version, considering that Microsoft has added additional features and extras to Windows in every new version so far.
The change of direction pays off.
Microsoft is right, the operating system is getting more and more in the background, and the software itself.
When Google Chrome was released on the web, I also joined the theory that this was the first step that Google took to make Windows competitive.
Many people have rightly recognized that a browser is not part of the operating system.
The operating system will always be required, as it is an essential element for the hardware and software dialogue.
You play the same role as your wife or husband when you want to say something to your mother.
That's right.
It will never disappear, but it is necessary to account for the "death" of the operating system, not in an absolute, but in a relative sense.
Ballmer's statement this week underpins this idea.
People are paying less and less attention to the operating system, and more and more to the web browser.
We turn on the computer only to open Firefox or Explorer — or Chrome — and more and more time spent browsing than we spend in the world of windows.
What are most of the applications that come with the system for?
Less is sometimes more.
And Windows 7 should be less, much less than Vista.
Less difficult, less burdened, less complicated.
Microsoft’s goal is to integrate its services online and ultimately to provide an alternative to Google.
They need it all, let me give you an example of why.
I took this photo earlier this month in a shared lounge designed for Microsoft employees in Redmond.
They call up a poster on the vending machine, they use the company's browser. - "Your browser. It's our future."
In 2006, an independent study found that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to browse the Internet.
Last week, we also announced the launch of the new version of Windows Mobile 7.
Not at the beginning of 2009, but at the end of 2010.
Microsoft is likely to try to roll out Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
After all, the mobile phone is increasingly functioning as a computer.
But the sliding, given that Android and iPhone are already on the market, will definitely ruin their business.
The Fabulous Marcel
It was worn by Pablo Picasso on the Costa Azulon, Leonardo di Caprio in Edward Zwick’s Bloody Diamond, and by Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola’s Crucifixion, as well as one of the basic costumes of the outspoken gay shopping community.
And if we are already on the list of specialties, we can even recall the peaceful figure of the kackish weightlifter of the migratory circus.
But what are we talking about? Nothing more than a - typically narrow and fingerless - male cotton t-shirt.
That is to say, about the "tank", as the Anglicans call it, but no rival of Le Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles can compete.
First of all, because of his elegant name - although only known as "Marcel" among friends - which can be attributed to the sport, according to legend, it was named after boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lover of singer Edith Piaf.
Marcel’s excellent cotton fabric, unisex dressing, distinctive emblem and small (almost recognizable) Belgian flag make it one of his competitors. The latter is carried hidden in the neck of the shirt by the most distinctive models.
But the Belgian company does not just make tank tops.
Sports tops, retro boxers, cashmere cardigans, woolen trousers, navy shirts, baby clothes, mini-series - and we could even classify them - are all part of the company's products.
And they all fall into the category of comfortable underwear,
It’s a shame that they should be worn as underwear.
They're too good for that.
“I want to be a young mother, no matter who the father is.”
He was very similar to his brother, but at the same time he was able to realize himself.
Monica Cruz is small and fragile, but full of energy.
Currently, the Cruz sisters want to take a more serious role in the fashion world.
For Monica, modeling means a lot more than some pretty and pretty girls give their name to something.
He was present at the promotion of Mango’s new headquarters in Paris, as well as the presentation of the most prestigious fashion awards sponsored by the Spanish company.
There is warmth and tenderness flowing from it.
What are you actually doing in Paris?
We will present Mango’s new autumn-winter collection, which we designed with my brother, Penélope. In addition, we will participate in the announcement of the second Mango Fashion Awards and the gala dinner in honour of Valentino at the Opera.
It's a pretty dense day, it's true, but it's very exciting.
This is your fourth season at Mango. Where did you get the inspiration for the new collection?
We both love the movies of the '50s and '60s; we took a lot of things from there.
And then, I often just walk around the city and watch women dress up, variety and pick out their clothes - this is one of my favorite hobbies.
You work as a dancer, an actress, and a fashion designer, and you're a versatile woman, right?
I think so too, but in the end these three things are related, because a lot of them have in common.
When I was a kid, I was interested in clothes, and I couldn’t wait to go to my grandmother’s and to snuggle in my aunt’s wardrobe.
Well, that was you in Canaan, you almost came up with a playground.
And then as a dancer, I always tried to pay attention to my clothes.
You know, we dancers like to come up with our own style for lessons and rehearsals to make us feel good when we look in the mirror.
As an actress, you’ll really identify with your role when you get the costume.
You see, everything has to do with everything, and all my respect for the designers and their expertise.
You just celebrated your 30th birthday, didn't you go to lethargy?
Oh, no!
I feel better than ever, I love my 30s.
I think women are really good at this time, they've already had enough experience and they're making fewer mistakes in life.
The biological clock doesn’t bother me.
Since I was a child, I have been doing what I want to do, and it fills me with great inner happiness.
Do you want to be a mother or not?
Of course, I know I’m going to be a mother because I was born to be a woman, and in fact, I want to be a young mother, and I don’t want to miss that.
As for the future father, it doesn't matter who he is.
I would like to raise my child in happiness and with great love.
Well, let's just say a few words about the movie, and last year, you made a lot of movies that didn't even show up.
Yes, and I can't wait for them to come out.
I, who started at the theatre, am very impatient and restless, I want everything right away, but of course I know that this is impossible.
I can't wait to be introduced to The Last Hour and the search for the tomb of Christ.
I wonder what you think of them...
To my knowledge, you made your debut with Naomi Campbell on the runway a few days ago.
Well, no, that's not true.
I didn't go up the runway as a model.
I have known Naomi Campbell for a long time, and she simply invited me to a charity fashion show in London, organized for the benefit of her own organization, Women for a Better World. I chose two of my own Mango collections. The clothes presented were disguised in their clothes, and the influence of their N-shirts in their collection.
People don't even know how kind Naomi is.
There are so many things about it, so I know, and I can assure you that half of it's not true.
On the other hand, I always look at the good side of your work.
He asked for a noble case for the fashion show, but if he wanted me to be on my head, I'd do it.
If the fate of women living in the third world is to bet, I do not know the impossible.
Retroactive Drunk Drivers Will Be Forced to Install "Alcolock"
The Ministry of the Interior would require the car to install a structure after a violation of the rules due to three drunk driving, which would prevent the vehicle from starting if the driver is in a drunken state or does not inflate into the structure.
The proposal was submitted in June and is currently being dealt with by the Prosecutor’s Office, according to which the pilot project will last for one year.
Since the project is intended to be put back on the market, the driver will also have to take part in a repetitive course on transport education.
In addition to the Ministry of Transport Safety, the Department of Transport (DGT) and the Institute of Automotive Safety Technology (FITSA) are also involved in the experiment.
According to statistics, 30-75% of people who have been arrested several times because of drunk driving are back in the car.
This would be prevented by Alcolock, as the system connected to the vehicle determines the alcohol level of the inflated air. If the alcohol level is higher than allowed, or if the driver did not inflate the device at all, the system will not allow the coke to start.
The cost of the instrument of more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1000 would be borne by the offender.
A 2007 study in the U.S. found that vehicles equipped with such devices could reduce the number of violations by up to 65% in the first year after installation.
In Spain, it is estimated that this rule could save the lives of 115 people each year.
The measure also focuses on infringements for two reasons: on the one hand, it makes it easier to prevent them from becoming a crime,
on the other hand, it is easier to implement, as the implementation of legal reform takes place in the usual manner, while the necessary criminal reform would require a fundamental law amendment.
The instrument is not yet available in any commercial form on the Spanish market, although it has already been installed in some industrial and public service vehicles in experimental mode.
The House will vote tomorrow on the initiative of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party, which urges the installation of the system into school buses, in a French fashion.
In Mexico, In Closed Shoes
Angolos, at the time announced in the program, at 5 p.m. 40 minutes, the aircraft of the Spanish Air Force’s Prince of Asturias Party landed at President Hangar of Mexico City’s Benito Ju<0xC3><0xA1>rez Airport.
The sun was already setting, but it was still burning so much that we could only use our hand as an eye shield to see the royal party getting out of the plane.
At the foot of the stairs stood the Spanish ambassador and other distinguished personalities.
A few hours before, I asked a taxi driver on the street if he knew the Spanish Duchess Couple was coming to the city for an official visit.
- Well, there's not gonna be an airport transfer for a long time today... the woman's from here or something...
- No, no, sir, the Spanish lady, she just lived here for a few years.
- Yeah, or...
But the Mexican press then knows everything about the Duchess of Asturias and the significance of their visit.
Many are waiting at the red carpet of the airport hangar, at the cordon made up by the 27 naval forces, who provide for the protection of the dignitaries.
The Prince appears, smiling, in a blue robe, and then the Princess too, in long hair, in a windy, restrained outfit, but not in the usual shoes that lift her toes—perhaps they warned that Mexico City was threatened by a storm.
They stop for a moment and smile at the cameras, then enter the room where the official bet is held.
At the door of their hotel - one of the city's four largest hotels - they are greeted by one of Mexico's soap operas.
The Most Valuable Fashion Award
To pass a fashion award is undoubtedly the most suitable place in the world in Paris, and today’s live fashion designers are the most sophisticated and the most brilliant Valentino.
Mango recently announced its second El But<0xC3><0xB3>n-Mango Fashion Awards competition, which aims to introduce the international talents of young fashion professionals.
The main prize is 300,000 euros.
Yesterday, Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first contest, saw her own designer clothes at the Mango strip on the Boulevard Haussmann 54 in Paris, and was slightly relieved of her disability.
By the way, this company is the second largest in Europe and recently opened at 1,335 square meters.
The largest store is located in London.
In the midst of an event of interest and a thank you to Valentino for the jury’s presidency, we finally found ourselves at a luxury dinner at the Opera Garnier in Paris.
In the company of the most lively Chagals, the presidential table prepared by Mango for the gala dinner was even more spectacular.
Nati, who came with a heavy heart and sad heart due to the recent death of his brother, wore one of the pieces of the Company and some breathtaking jewels of the ELAH. He was accompanied by his son, Luis, who was about two meters tall.
Andik, the owner and host of Mango, entertained the guests. Together with Baron Rotchil, they were so knightly that they were eventually left without clothes, as they were both gifted to a lady.
Monica Cruz came to the store in her own designer trousers and shirts, and at dinner she wore a sexy long black dress. On the night of the opera tour, Gaya Toledo was so impressed with the ballet room that she was wearing a skirt to remind her of the old times and a grand odalien.
Inés Sastre did not attend the palace visit, but before he showed some photos of his son on his mobile phone.
The next morning we were able to enjoy Oliver Martinez - he is going to be two meters tall and riding a motorbike - and John Travolta also arrived at the Intercontinental inn in Paris. He also brought his own sheets and towels and said well in advance that he was not in the room at all.
Stars Paris under the starry sky.
Oh, that's life.
1001, the stress-solving number
Not a thousand, but a thousand and a way to turn off the chaotic and bustling everyday life.
Another good news is that we can find them all in one book that will arrive at the bookstores on September 30 to bring you peace of mind.
It is almost painful to watch the clock in the morning at 7 a.m., but even worse to think about how accelerated life is forced by today’s world every day.
The name of the office is tension, and the computer is back pain.
Stress is a disease of the 21st century.
But overcoming day-to-day exhaustion and overcoming workplace problems is not one and not two ways.
No, this number is exactly equal to 1001.
In addition to yoga positions, classical massages, or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott offers a wide range of options in her book, so that everyone can find the solution that suits their favorite and free moments.
The stress-solving work is titled 1001 Relaxation Method and the resulting calm comes from the publisher Pearson Alhambra y DK to the bookstores.
If you’re convinced that stress can hardly be eliminated from the world of work or personal relationships, this manual will surely distract you in faith.
In addition, it also serves with other ideas that all help with relaxation, such as tips on how to get closer to nature or how to cook 100% natural foods.
If you’re already too low to refresh your body’s adrenaline levels and have become a central problem in your stress life, it’s time to sit back in your chair, relax and just focus on reading.
Those who speak in their dreams
Some kids talk at night.
I don’t mean those who wake up and fully awake to tell what happened to them that day, but those who talk while they sleep.
The phenomenon may seem scary at first, but it is actually completely harmless.
This benign sleep disorder is called somniloquism.
It is quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
I'm sure most of you've been told he spoke at night.
In terms of its frequency, it can be completely rapsodic (for example, only occurs once in a disease with a high fever), or more systematic (daily, weekly or monthly), and usually the next day the child does not remember anything.
Its appearance cannot be traced back to a single cause.
It is often accompanied by other sleep disorders, such as nightmares, nocturnal vomiting, bed-wetting (enuresis nocturna) or sleepwalking, but this is not legal.
As we have already mentioned, it can be accompanied by a state of high fever, or even a stressful situation or an elevated state of excitement.
In any case, little has been studied so far.
The intensity of speech is also very variable.
It may be quiet, calm, it may consist of unrelated words, murmuring, but in contrast to all these, it may also occur in the form of screaming, crying, or longer speech.
If the phenomenon is very intense, it is advisable to observe the child and consult a specialist. The examination can reveal whether there is some problem that causes a lot of anxiety in the background and thus can offer a solution.
As already mentioned, it is a benign phenomenon, therefore, there is no cure for it, unless it is accompanied by some other form of sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, insomnia or a stressful situation).
However, there are a few things we can do, here is a preventive measure:
Make sure that the child stays calm before going to bed.
We choose reassuring toys and avoid the child watching frightening or more aggressive TV shows or series.
For children who are prone to nervousness or who are more difficult to relax, we teach some relaxation methods to help them find inner peace.
This will help the child to sleep more relaxed.
If you start talking while you sleep, let's try to stay calm.
Remember, this is harmless for the child, and the next day they will not remember anything.
Useful Advice
Do not wake the child up.
It would be superfluous, because the child is not aware, but it would come out of sleep.
Despite talking, he actually sleeps longer and rests.
Remember, if multiple times of severe anxiety is accompanied by the phenomenon, it is advisable to consult a specialist or to reveal what causes a high degree of anxiety from the child.
If you speak clearly (this is the rarest case), don’t start asking them to learn anything from them.
It would be superfluous, because while sleeping, you are not so conscious as to gather your thoughts.
On the other hand, you only hear the speech, but you do not see the accompanying dream images, so be careful with the interpretation of what you have heard and the possible conclusions.
Never tell a child that they can question their secrets at night.
It's not even a joke.
That caused a lot of anxiety.
So the most important thing is not to worry, as it’s just a few minutes of harmless episode.
Finally straight up the Illaeusern
After a long deep flight, the Illaeusern team finally took on a new momentum and regained victory at home.
Although it was not a ferret match, the yellow-whites got into a position several times, taking advantage of one of which they were finally able to win.
The pace of the match was not too tight, as the attackers had difficulty feeling the right rhythm.
The first cappular shot was attempted by the captain of the guest team, Kauffmann, but the remote ball only touched the upper corner of the gate. Then the Dan Illhausern got into the top, and was followed by the shots: Fonderflick shot him to his goal with a remote shot.
On the other hand, the players were consolidated into a block defending their midfielder, and only the ever-moving Riahi got into the shooting position.
The start of the second half was of crucial importance: first Riahi and Temporale took the position on Dannemarie's side. Immediately thereafter, the first goal was born: the first shot of Diebold).The ball was kicked out by the ilhaeuserni Marais.
However, the goalkeeper of the Illhausern was not able to enjoy the glory for long: twelve minutes later he was forced to leave the course, so his team-mates had to continue the fight in a human way.
Dannemarie, on the other hand, could not take advantage of the advantage: they did not cause much trouble for the home team, who just pulled back a little bit to confirm their defense. Only the last few seconds kept some excitement until the goal, when it was a big hit after the goal.
Sarkozy Meets Angry Fishermen
Before flying to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy makes a trip to Brittany.
On Monday, the demonstration by the fishermen disturbed the traffic of several Breton and Norman ports, so the President of the Republic decided to visit the port of Le Guilvinec in Finist<0xC3><0xA8>re on Tuesday morning to meet with representatives of the demonstrators.
The latter promised to welcome the president in a "constructive spirit" and expressed their Abbey hope that Sarkozy would come up with "concrete proposals".
The president’s visit coincides with the meeting of the “crisis committee” set up by Breton fishermen with the aim of initiating action against the rise in the price of gas oil, as the oil price exceeded the record average price of 1.14 euros per litre.
David Martinon, the spokesman for the President of the Republic, said the president "will discuss with fishermen what solutions could be used to help companies regain their competitiveness and make it safer for seafarers to work and pay their salaries."
The fishermen are eagerly awaiting the arrival of Nicolas Sarkozy.
On Tuesday morning, commercial demonstrations were held in Morbihan and Calvados County, with which they provoked riots of nearly 10 km long.
Quiberon's yacht port was also depressed, but roads leading to Belle Island were not blocked.
On the Quiberon peninsula, roadblocks were placed.
On Monday, the sailors had already testified to their determination, and in the morning, tyres and pallets were set on fire in front of fuel tanks at the ports of Brest, while protests were taking place in Concerneau and Saint-Brieuc.
This was followed by further movements in the Atlantic coast and other ports of La Manche, for example, in the Vendée county of Sables d'Olonne, fishermen did not board the ship, while in Le Havre some twenty vessels prevented the traffic of commercial vessels.
The fishermen La Turballe and Le Croisic, located in the Loire-Atlantique county, have eliminated the massive oil refinery blockade in the Donges.
The fishermen of Boulogne-sur-Mer, on the other hand, decided to wait for Wednesday’s meeting in the ministry with a decision on further steps.
In Le Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" has to decide on Tuesday on its next step and participation in the meeting planned at the Paris Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries.
However, some Breton fishermen do not want their interests to be represented by the leaders of the National Fisheries Committee, as the committee did not support their efforts.
"The strike continues because "fishers are not letting go of their demands" and "not willing to travel to Paris," said Liliane Cariou, chairman of the Lorient Fisheries Committee.
Professional fishermen who do not pay taxes on gas oil are currently paying around 50 cents per litre, but they believe that the operation of a ship would only become profitable if the price of gas oil fell to below 0.30 euros per litre.
The Amazing Paul Newman
"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" is an unforgettable star in his Connecticut home, where he died at the age of 83 due to cancer.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford, and Sam Mendes also paid tribute to Paul Newman, a film legend who died at the age of 83.
Embraer does not change its 2008 shipping plans
Despite the global economic downturn, the Brazilian aircraft manufacturer plans to deliver 215 aircraft this year.
Embraer, the world’s fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer, is able to keep the plans and plans to deliver 215 aircraft in 2008, said Fredrico Fleury Curado, the company’s president.
In the first half of the year, the company delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturing company is highly dependent on the Chinese market, in particular for its 30-120-seat aircraft.
Embraer has delivered a total of 41 machines to Chinese customers over the past eight years.
AIG would sell more than 15% of its assets
The American International Group, which has been reinstated by the U.S. financial authorities, wants to sell more than 15% of its assets in order to pay back the $85 billion it has already paid off, according to the Dominican edition of the Financial Times.
Aside from international life insurance and U.S. pension insurance activities, AIG would be spared from most of its other businesses, the newspaper said, citing sources close to the case.
According to the Times, the AIG board of directors met on Sunday night to examine the possibilities of the sale.
AIG has not confirmed this information.
The assets to be sold by AIG include the aircraft leasing company International Lease Financial Corp., the 59% stake in the Transatlantic Holdings reinsurance company, as well as the property portfolio and private equity investment in Ti.
According to the newspaper, however, there is no final decision on the sale.
AIG needs to quickly get to liquid assets in order to repay a $85 billion loan approved by the U.S. government. This assumes the risk of losing as much as 80% of its capital and losing its share at the same rate.
A Study of the Paris Historique on the Morning Meeting’s Historical Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange reported a historic decline on Monday after the Senate rejected Paulson's bailout plan, with the Dow Jones index falling by 6.98% (which was an unprecedented drop of nearly 800 points), while the Nasdaq fell by 9% to 9%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average Index (DJIA) fell by 777.68 points, closing 10,365.45 points.
The index’s largest drop to date (684.81 points) was recorded on September 17, 2001, when trading resumed after the September 11 terrorist attack.
The Nasdaq, primarily based on technology papers, fell 199.61 points by 1,983.73 points, while the Standard & Poor's 500 extended index fell by 8.81% (i.e. 106.85 points) to 1,106.55 points, according to official closing data.
The Wall Street stock market was already weakening when it opened, and when the Senate unexpectedly rejected the bank bailout plan aimed at restoring the market balance, it began to take a deep flight.
The 228 MPs voted "no" to 205 "yes" and refused to provide the funds requested by Finance Minister Henry Paulson.
Nearly two-thirds of the Republicans voted in favor.
“The market has filtered out bad signals from this, as Congress seems unable to approve a plan,” said Lindsey Pegza, an analyst at FTN Financial.
"It also shows how much the market expected this plan," he added, and then expressed concern that if they accepted such a plan a few days later, it would be "too late".
“If the plan is really doomed to death, then it will be up to the Fed and the other central banks to handle the crisis, and lending conditions will continue to tighten,” warns Brian Bethune, Global Insight’s CEO.
The sense of urgency will continue to escalate, Pigza adds: "Every passing day, more and more financial institutions are going bankrupt" in the United States.
Following the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual on Friday, authorities have ensured that Wachovia's banking branches are acquired by its rival, Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis suddenly accelerated, which required emergency measures to save the banks in the UK, the Benelux states, Iceland and Germany. This indicates that in the market "not only an American, but a global crisis has developed."
The bond market has revitalized significantly.
The yield of the 10-year long-term government bond fell from 3.827% to 3.632% on Friday night, and fell from 4.357% to 4.161% on the previous day by 30 years.
Obama wins the first TV match.
The first debate between the two U.S. presidential candidates was followed by another one, who had to decide whether John McCain or Barack Obama would be the winner.
Not surprisingly, both the Republican and Democratic campaigners have claimed victory in the television match, which is watched by one-third of U.S. households.
According to political analyst David Gergen, while John McCain's performance was honorable, it did not prove "impressive" enough to stop the decline in popularity: this is evidenced by polls conducted five weeks before the presidential election.
According to the Gallup Institute, the Democratic candidate is better in the fight: the results of the public opinion poll published on Saturday show Obama is five points ahead of McCain (44 percent and 49 percent).
Among the most indefinite voters, 39 percent of those polled said Obama would win, while 25 percent said McCain would win, according to a CBS poll.
Obama is expected to further increase his advantage with his partner, Joseph Biden's promising Thursday role, preparing for Biden's first and only public debate with rival Sarah Palin.
But Bill Clinton warned this weekend: “It would be a mistake to underestimate Palin.
He has good senses.”
McCain, in his seventies, never fails to put his own undeniably vast foreign policy experience in the forefront, but he also emphasizes his opponent’s “nativeness” in these issues, which were at the center of their first personal meeting.
"It seems that Senator Obama doesn't understand that... " - the attack was repeated several times.
“I don’t think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge to hold the presidency,” McCain said.
This is the main attack area, which is also being exploited by Republican TV ads that have been running since yesterday.
Obama, on the other hand, emphasized that he represents the future.
He did not allow himself to be embarrassed: he put it together and accurately.
He stressed that he is able to make good decisions and restore the image of the United States in the world.
“McCain still doesn’t understand, but Obama already does,” a Democratic advertisement broadcast over the weekend said, pointing to the Republican leader that he had still not measured the impact of the crisis on the American “street people.”
“In the ninety minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you,” Obama said in front of 20,000 people who gathered in the rain in North Carolina for the voter’s meeting.
He has not even uttered the words "middle class" or "workers". The confusing situation in the financial world undoubtedly favors Obama, whom the Americans deem most suitable to save on the brink of collapse.
“The next seven turning points may prove to be,” said Charles Schumer, the influential Democratic senator.
Rahm Emanuel, a member of the Clinton administration, said Obama had “excellent economic incentives” like Bill Clinton at the time of the 1998 financial crisis.
In the eyes of the Democratic presidential nominee, the current crisis is “the final verdict on the bad economic policy that George Bush created with the support of Senator McCain.”
The Illinois senator reaffirmed that despite the fluctuations in the stock market, he will be able to reduce the tax burden of 95% of Americans. He added that his primary goals include the country’s possible development of a system of energy independence and the creation of a whole, renewable energy use.
McCain plans to set up 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
However, both presidential candidates cautiously avoided the issues related to the $700 billion (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>470 billion) bank bailout plan: the extremely unpopular plan was adopted by Congress last night.
Minsk: "Did you notice that there was an election here?"
Youth and opposition protesters on Sunday evening in the capital city of Belarus to reject the expected outcome of the parliamentary elections.
On Sunday evening, hundreds of Belarusians gathered in the main square of Minsk to protest against the falsification of the results of the elections.
Although no results have yet been published, many young people protested against President Alexandr Lukashenko with the words: "Mr. Dictator, give up!"
Some admit that they haven’t even gone to vote, “Why should I go? They do with my vote what they want!” says a young man.
The demonstrators do not believe that the regime, which sought to present itself in good colour before foreign observers in order to build ties with the European Union, would be ready for a democratic regime change.
If the election were to be held purely by observers, they would be able to dissolve the sanctions that hit the country, under which 40 Belarusian leaders were denied visas and some bank accounts were frozen.
According to the opposition, however, the elections did not take place clearly.
"We were kept away from the election committees and our observers were not allowed to participate in the counting of votes," said Yuri Potyemkin, a spokesman for the U.S. Democratic Forces' coalition of 12 parties.
"The changes were only nominal," emphasizes Aleksandr Milinkievic, opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-European movement. "The main thing is who counts the votes, and in our case this is the executive power.
If the opposition’s envoys enter parliament, it means they have been appointed, not elected.
But their entry into parliament allows them to have a seat on television, to have meetings in the regions of the country, and to submit bills.
The opposition must therefore take the stage in political life, because "it is necessary to initiate a dialogue with the European Union".
In fact, if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, is in crisis and we are not able to renew it, we are at risk of falling under Russia’s sovereignty.
We want to be independent, though.”
The opposition fears that the European Security and Cooperation Organisation, which monitors the electoral process, will accept the result of the vote as valid.
It is emphasized that the participation rate seems too high, and the wide-ranging organisation of the preliminary vote (in which Minsk 26% of the electorate participated) gave the opportunity for any manipulation.
“Did you notice that elections were taking place here?” asks Aleksandr Kozulin, the leader of the Social Democrats, who was released from prison for the last time in August, when he was held as a political prisoner.
No one was staying in the polling stations.
There will be no more than five opposition members in parliament, namely those who are the most appropriate for the leadership.
Again, the silence of the night is pouring into October Square.
On television, President Lukashenko and the members of the Central Election Committee are pleased to succeed.
The blood is safe again.
Yesterday, Héma-Québec celebrated the tenth anniversary of its founding. President Dr. Francine Décary had a good reason for the celebration because Héma-Québec has become one of the safest and most effective blood donor companies in the world today.
And most importantly, he managed to regain people’s trust, which was seriously damaged by the infection-related blood scandal of the 1980s and 1990s.
As is well known, the national blood supply, managed by the Canadian Red Cross Blood Service, became infected with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV) and hepatitis C viruses in the 1980s.
Following the drama and general upheaval, the Government of Canada launched an official investigation in February 1994, led by Judge Horace Krever, to shed light on the circumstances leading up to the tragedy and to make suggestions for future cases.
While Judge Krever's late report was submitted, some provinces set up their own committees aimed at designing a new blood management system for Canada.
In Québec, the Gélineau Committee carried out this task.
Following the Gélineau and Krever reports, two blood services were established in Canada: one is Héma-Québec, which serves Québec, and the other is the Canadian Blood Supply Society, which is responsible for the supply of all other provinces and territories.
“When Héma-Québec began operations in 1998, only 38% of people had confidence in the Québec blood supply system,” recalls Dr. Décary.
The situation was desperate.
"In the years to come, however, we have been able to regain people's trust as a result of improving the safety of blood preparations and our work in the field." Décary proudly declares that by the beginning of 2008, nearly 94% of the population of Québec had been trusted by Héma.
Dr. Décary, however, does not forget that "confidence is an extremely fragile thing".
Since the establishment of Héma-Québec on September 28, 1998, it has been applying the precautionary principle.
A number of cases have been discovered in Europe during this period when a new variant of the disease Creutzfeldt-Jacob, which has infected people, has also been found - says the doctor, who has been in charge of the company since its inception in 1998.
"We had no idea whether this disease was spreading through blood.
Therefore, we relied on one of the most important recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau reports. According to this, if we are uncertain about this and there is a risk of developing a serious disease, then we should apply exclusive measures to the cause of this. In this case, it is clear that the cause of this disease is Creutzfeldt-Jakob.
Therefore, in April 1999, we did not accept blood from people who have spent more than a month in the United Kingdom since 1980.
A few years ago, there was no doubt that the disease was spread in the blood.
This case convinced us that it made sense to apply the precautionary principle.”
In 1999, a technique was introduced on the market that allows for a much more sensitive diagnosis of the HIV virus. This is a nucleic acid test (NAT), which is able to directly detect the virus in the blood of blood donors, and not antibodies against the virus.
With the help of the NAT test, we were able to shorten the window period, which lasts from the infection until we are able to detect the virus in the blood with our technical means.
This period could be reduced for a period of less than a week.
This significantly mitigated the risk of blood donors infecting the bloodstream beyond their knowledge, as well as not being able to detect it.
With these developments, the risk of AIDS spreading through blood transfusions has been greatly reduced.
Nowadays, the risk of someone getting HIV-infected blood is 12 million to one.
“In a nutshell, this means that we should allocate 12 million blood preparations until someone becomes infected with HIV.
Because Héma-Québec distributes between 400 and 500,000 blood preparations each year, it would take more than 24 years for such a case to occur and someone to become infected with HIV through a blood preparation.
I think that today anyone can accept or prescribe blood transfusions for the purpose of restoring health, says the number one leader of Héma-Québec.
“The challenge of the next decade will be to maintain the reliability of our products.
We never know what kind of new pathogen will enter the system.
In fact, it was only last year that the chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, like the West Nile virus, enters the blood with insect bites.
Therefore, we need to be constantly open," continued Dr. Décary, and then stressed that in addition to the test reserves, Héma-Québec must provide sufficient permanent reserves.
“As the population ages, so do the needs.
Because cancer treatments have become more aggressive, patients often need to replace red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also affects the blood donor population, as the number of people eligible for blood donation in the network accounts for only 3% of the population of Quebec.
However, any healthy person at least 18 years of age who meets the eligibility criteria may donate blood every 56 days, i.e. six times a year.
On average, 14% of applicants do not accept blood because they are infected with AIDS or malaria, and those who have been in a country where malaria kills are not eligible for blood donation for one year.
“With this 3%, we have enough reserves to meet the needs of the hospitals.
It's very rare that we're out of stock.
However, we must increase the number of blood donors to the extent that the existing ones age, because after a while they can no longer donate blood.
But it’s very difficult to convince people to donate blood, but it’s even harder to keep them and get them to become regular blood donors.
In today’s fast-paced world, there is hardly a single hour for a person to go and donate blood,” says Francine Décary.
With a budget of $297 million annually, Héma-Québec provides not only blood preparations, but also human tissues, such as bone transplants, heart keys, eyeballs, and skin tissues, which they use almost exclusively for serious purposes.
These tissues are analyzed, transformed and frozen, and then placed in Héma-Québec, which at the same time manages Quebec’s only public stem cell bank.
The hair can be extracted from the navel cord, which is treated only as medical waste, blood that is rich in stem cells, so it also allows the treatment of serious diseases (such as leukemia).
“We have been celebrating for a few weeks that the 1,000th Nail Corps sample has entered our bank, and we plan to take more than a thousand new samples each year.
We will probably start offering these for organ transplants at the beginning of next year," said Dr. Décary, who said that the navel cord blood-removal program is very popular today.
"Many mothers are saddened that they don't have a chance to do this" - this is true, because Héma-Québec is not in a position to make this complex and expensive program available in every hospital in Quebec.
Football - in pre-decision on the Impact
The Montreal Impact team defeated Seattle Sounders 3–1 yesterday in the USL-1 squad and came into the pre-season with a combined 4–3 result. This was their second quarter-final match and their decisive match in terms of the results.
The final goal was scored by Antonio Ribeiro in the 90th minute of the match.
While the first half ended without a goal, in the second, the Montreal team's two midfielders, David Testo and Rocco Plancentino, found themselves in the opponent's net.
From the Sounders, only Roger Levesque managed to knock out Matt Jordan.
Let’s remember that in Friday’s first game, Impact suffered a 2:1 defeat from the Starfire Complex in Tukwila, Seattle.
The Impact is played in the pre-season with the Vancouver Whitecaps.
On Saturday night in Minnesota, the Thunder team, who scored 3:1 in the first game from the Whitecaps, won 4:3, but the Whitecaps came in the preliminary round with a 5:4 overall result.
Impact is expected to meet with the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the matches are still clarified today.
In Di<0xC3><0xB3>hej - Kovalev's winning goal
The Canadiens' favorite triathlon is ready for the next season.
Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostytsyn led the three great strikes and finally the Canadiens won the Florida Panthers 3–2 from penalty shootouts last night at Centre Bell.
Kostitsyn, the first star of the match, scored a goal. Plekanec scored two goals and Kovalev finished the match with a goal pass, which was the fourth victory of the team's six pre-match matches.
The match was decided by Kovalev, who scored the only goal of the shootout.
"I'm not ready yet," warns the Russian player.
"It takes another game to make me feel really fit."
"He was trying to get too much out of himself in the first third," said Guy Carbonneau.
"But I think the end result of the game is happy.
He had a huge ovation.”
The Northern Aspirations of Charest
The Prime Minister does not rule out that the election will begin this year.
Just before the Liberal Party’s meeting ended, Jean Charest traveled to Jean-Talon, Quebec, yesterday, where the new health minister, Yves Bolduc (left) is winning the midterm elections to be held today.
"To restore our last great northern border": this ambitious long-term goal was formulated by Jean Charest at the meeting of the Liberal Party of Quebec in Lévis yesterday. The speech was also enriched with visual elements, but at the same time the president was focused on the effort.
In his presentation, behind his back, he drew lines similar to "Moulin <0xC3><0xA0> images".
The three giant projectors were followed by impressive footage: dams of hydroelectric power plants, mine cultivation, Québec on Google Maps, maps...
Such spectacular tools are used to be deployed in election periods.
The prime minister, by the way, was not willing to guarantee that the election would not start this fall, although he added that the timetable is very close.
The “northern plan” is the fourth pillar of Quebec’s “vision of the future” in a “new economic area” that will be incorporated into a labour agreement with France, an agreement between Canada and Europe, and a number of planned agreements with Ontario.
In recent times, the opening up to the North (i.e. the northern area starting at 49 degrees latitude) has often been featured in the Prime Minister's speeches, but he has never given a lecture on this subject.
The head of state, however, was limited to explaining why he considered the North "a treasure trove full of huge opportunities." But he did not talk about the time factor, investment amounts, nor about a specific order of importance for future projects.
It raised only a few development opportunities: primarily hydropower, forestry and, in particular, mining, which are further fuelled by the growth of countries in crisis and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
It is located in the north "with nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium and even diamonds," Charest said.
This area, which is “double the size of France”, is “our territory, Québec.”
It is not only in us, it is in us," the head of state reiterated, emphasizing that this would create a national founder myth.
He emphasized that Québec’s development was largely determined by its relationship with the North: the gold lacquer in Abitibi, the design work in Québec, the Gulf of James...
"It's ours, it's our future!" he added after taking a stage break, looking at the huge map behind his back.
The North, which covers 70% of Quebec’s territory, also includes part of Labrador, which Quebec has always demanded for itself, the head of government said in a press release.
“This is a historic resolution that has been endorsed by all governments.
There is a border on which there has been no agreement for a long time, and if the opportunity arises, I will reaffirm the same resolution on behalf of the government," he said.
On the other hand, "we also need to rethink our viewpoint on the North in the light of climate change," the prime minister said, speaking of the Northwest Passage, which opens every year as a result of the melting of the ice in the corner.
According to the Head of Government, in this new geopolitical environment, occupying the area is an important task.
And what about the natives of the area, the Indians and the Eskimos?
The head of government stated that the Quebec government is paying close attention to them, and the plan will bring many benefits, especially to young people.
The two ministers of the various parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (the latter was the envoy of the Parti Québécois) have already begun negotiations with some thirty local communities.
The interministerial committee headed by Beno<0xC3><0xAE>t Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (Minister responsible for Transport and Natural Resources) also plays an important role, also started.
The head of government does not rule out the possibility of a large-scale meeting, "not necessarily a summit" where "a common vision is created".
Otherwise, the development of the North would be carried out in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The Northern Plan will be coordinated, integrated and at the same time environmentally friendly,” he said.
Jean Charest described this as a “vision” that is in line with the ideas of the liberal prime ministers who preceded him.
“Like the former liberals, we think differently: our goal is to create new opportunities for growth and development from the challenges.”
This was, by the way, one of the recurring themes of the weekend that began on Friday with a big cocktail party celebrating the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage’s election as party president.
One of the decisions adopted suggests that the Beauharnois power plant should be renamed the Adelard-Godbout Dam.
"Our politicians, including Godbout, the founder of Hydro-Québec, Lesage, the leader of the silent revolution and the nationwide expansion of hydroelectric power plants, and Bourassa, known as the father of James Bay, all knew how to forge the future."
In the press conference, he cited another - true, conservative - work, namely the program of Prime Minister John Diefenbaker, "Roads to the North" between 1957 and 1963.
In connection with the Eastmain1a-Ruper dam plan, President Charest stressed that it is planned to be put into operation by 2012.
"This should remain between us, but I plan to be there," he told his followers, and his statement was received by a loud tap storm.
After all, the Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008 and probably not in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of a vote to be held in the autumn of this year, which the law also allows.
However, he stressed that his calendar is already full, as he took on tasks at the meeting of the Federal Council in China and at the Quebec-New York summit.
The party assembly at the end of the week proved to be an excellent platform for the liberal president to express nationalist decisions, which were approved almost without thinking. This is mainly about the "aspirations relating to the constitution": the liberal party's adherence to the "special character of Québec" in particular.
I would also like Québec to appoint members of the Canadian Radio and Telecommunications Council, and these members would have a veto over decisions made in Québec.
The opposition, however, sceptically accepted the main points of the Northern Plan.
The leader of the Parti Québécois, Paulina Marois, resumed the North Quebec development policy, which was introduced by the Landry government in 2001.
According to Marois, the liberal government, which came to power in 2003, rejected the application of this policy.
If they hadn't, "today we'd be much ahead of time," Marois said in agreement with Mrs. Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise Mercure, who was launched as a candidate in the Jean-Talon vote to be held today.
The opposition party ADQ supports the government's adoption of the Northern Plan.
"What we want, however, is that it's not just a play," said Sébastien Proulx, the party's leader, who replaced Mario Dumont, who is returning from his freedom today.
Letters - A Lost Country
Vic Toews, the Harper cabinet minister (meaning "justice" minister), took the courage last summer to call Louise Arbour a "shame" of Canada.
“To insult a woman who has fought for the truth and deserves all our admiration – that tells a lot about the people around the Prime Minister and about himself as well as Stephen Harper.
This, then, is our government, which has not transported its own citizens from the Guant<0xC3><0xA1>namo concentration camp in any of the Western countries concerned.
This is the government that absolutely ignores the fact that Omar Khadr was still a teenager at the time of the crimes committed against him.
This is the only government that, despite Canada’s signing of the Geneva Convention, has denied its word and allowed a child to be killed in inhumane conditions.
It's the only government that makes a puppet theater out of the justice system while investigating an accused's crime.
Just remember that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association are also demanding Omar Khadr’s return to Canada in order to receive fair trial in Canada.
And our government is watching over torture: it doesn’t matter that a young adult has already been spiritually destroyed, and the many years of torture probably sealed his fate for a lifetime.
Although we are not yet aware of this, at the moment there is an undue destruction of our rights, our freedoms and our democracy. "Democracy": Harper constantly utters this word, which sounds like an empty speech from his mouth.
The time has come, then, when there is no more morality: they can arbitrarily beat, torture and incarcerate any Canadian citizen at the discretion of the leader of a government that has been in the minority so far (and what could come after October 14th...?).
Many voters believe that salvation can be found in a party that honors virtue, law, and order, and they do not see that this government tramples on the values for which the good news and dignity of our country can be attributed.
Dear Mr. Toews, the shame of this is - don't look elsewhere.
Review - The Barrick Gold Orwell Speech
In the September 17 issue of Le Devoir, a letter appeared from Patrick J. Garver, vice president and CEO of the Barrick Gold mine in Canada.
Following Orwell’s inauguration, Garver said the world’s largest gold-producing company had filed a $6 million lawsuit against three authors and a small-money publishing company to initiate a so-called “public debate.”
Although the judges are independent and impartial, their decision – especially in insolvency proceedings – is not made on the basis of truth, but on the basis of law.
It is not surprising that Garver has heard deeply about this fundamental difference.
For Barrick Gold, would it really be the best way for a public debate to destroy anyone whose position is contrary to his?
Regardless of the outcome of the lawsuit, the authors and publishers of Noir Canada must spend significant amounts of money to defend and fight in an unequal struggle where, on the other hand, there is an army of lawyers supported by almost inexhaustible resources of the mining industry.
In such an unequal struggle, by the way, they often use the tactic of destroying the alperes and making a friendly agreement, which not only silences the opposites, but also frightens those who try to re-engage.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it would have had to have expressed its views in front of the public.
While in many other countries where Barrick Gold operates, this is different, in Canada, the parties to the dispute usually do not strike each other with a stick, but tell their thoughts.
The mine would therefore have had enough to open its books and files and to prepare for a real debate in the press, the media, in publications, paying for independent research groups that could have shed light on the issue.
But it seems that Barrick Gold does not trust the public, and with one move he erased petitions and letters written in defense of Noir Canada’s authors.
Could Mr Garver perhaps explain how he can initiate a "public" debate if, at the same time, he ignores the opinion of this public?
In the head of the Vice-President, this word probably means only the low-paying lawyers, and not the totality of Canada: the meaning of the term is thus very narrow.
In a democratic state, even those who despise others are entitled to freedom of speech.
Barrick Gold, however, does not understand – or does not want to understand – that Noir Canada’s authors and publishers are primarily supported by the public because it condemns the crude method of mining.
The public is ready to hear Barrick and make a judgement, but it would do so on the basis of civilized arguments, rather than by a lawsuit aimed at silence for many. (By the way, the term "public debate" refers to the term "public debate"), as Barrick Gold recently quoted in Canada.
In addition to Garver’s surreal headlines, Barrick Gold’s approach is an open attack on the freedom of university research and the search for truth, which are the building blocks of all democratic societies.
The proceedings as a whole deny the right to cite authentic sources, to argue about the facts and their interpretation, which form the basis of the intellectual activities.
If in a country like Canada it is only possible to study and discuss issues that the wealthy companies of today’s world do not like, who will take the courage to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted an open and transparent debate, it could do so according to the scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada.
You have a right to respond.
In our university environment, we have been able to deal with debates, differences of opinion and conflicts for a long time.
Barrick Gold’s reckless approach is a good indication that, contrary to his claim, there is no willingness to engage in an open debate.
This is a loss for both the world of universities and the Canadian public debate institution, and it is time for governments to finally introduce measures that limit the legal procedures initiated for such abuses.
Wall Street Rescue: Democrats and Republicans Agree
The Bush administration and the Republican and Democratic leaders of Congress have finally reached an agreement yesterday on the economic bailout, which has been the largest such plan since the great world economic crisis of the 1930s.
The $700 billion plan, aimed at curbing the financial crisis that has been falling on Wall Street for months, has yet to be approved by the two houses of Congress.
Key points of the plan: more effective monitoring of implementation by Members; new mechanisms to ensure the repayment of allotted public funds; new provisions for keeping the number of houses occupied due to non-payment at the level of commitments; right of access to assistance.
U.S. Secretary of Finance Henry Paulson, Nancy Pelosi, President of the U.S. House of Representatives, and Judd Gregg, the Republican MP who participated in the hearing, announced the good news yesterday, minutes before midnight, after the two-day marathon ended.
“We have made great progress towards a solution that will work effectively in the markets,” said Henry Paulson, a representative for the Bush administration.
“We have done everything with the aim of saving the real economy and American citizens from the current crisis that hit Wall Street,” he said.
“The most important aspect is that if we don’t do this, there will be huge shocks, chaos and confusion in the everyday lives of Americans,” Republican Rep. Judd Gregg said.
The trial has been accelerated in the last few hours in fear that another failure would have a detrimental impact on the investor’s mood.
They have given themselves a deadline for the deal until the opening of the stock exchange this morning.
The two presidential candidates who joined the negotiations late showed themselves willing to reach an agreement, however, they expressed their dissatisfaction with the fact that the situation had escalated to the end.
US Senator Barack Obama has attributed the extension of the agreement to elements such as provisions relating to the preservation of household ownership or the salaries of managers of state-aided companies.
“When we ask taxpayers to take certain extraordinary steps because of other people’s irresponsibility, it’s not too joyful.
These steps, however, are necessary,” he said on a U.S. television show.
When his opponent, John McCain, asked another channel if he would vote for the proposed plan, he replied, "I would like to know the details, but I hope so."
“What I’ve read in the big lines, we can already see that this is something that we all need to digest and through which we can move forward.
“The opportunity to do nothing is simply unacceptable,” he said.
Under the $700 billion plan, taxpayers would buy out the dubious claims of U.S. financial institutions, some risky, undisclosed assets.
The plan was preceded by a 14-month crisis, initiated by the collapse of the real estate license. This led first to the collapse of risky real estate loans (secondary mortgage loans), then to the collapse of mortgages and spread of other debts, bank debts, and mortgages (trade bonds).
The first draft deal, a group of Republican lawmakers, collapsed last week.
It seems that we have managed to get out of this slump since the Democrats agreed that certain “toxic” tools of companies in a difficult situation would rather be provided by the government than purchased.
In order for all members of Congress to be satisfied, a provision was also included in the plan, which stipulates that if the government has to bear the losses for five years under the program, it may impose new taxes for the purpose of recovering its resources.
As part of the new plan, a $250 billion fine would be paid for the first time, followed by an additional $100 billion if the president deems it necessary.
The remaining $350 billion is expected to be approved by Congress by a new vote.
In return for the aid, Washington will receive a share in the subsidized companies, through which it will receive a dividend from the profits, and which it will be able to sell after the crisis has elapsed.
The federal government will be able to delay the seizure of properties to cover the mortgages involved in the plan. It will also be able to breach the maximum value of wages and end-of-payment to managers of companies affected by the crisis.
The drafters of the plan would like the plan to be voted on by the House of Representatives and the Senate on Wednesday.
However, despite their efforts, it is still uncertain whether the plan will be approved.
In fact, yesterday, statements against the plan were repeated among both Republicans and Democrats.
"It is clear that Washington will not hear your voice," said Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House Finance Committee.
“Yes, we have serious financial problems.
Yes, there are solutions.
But there is no one that would benefit taxpayers.”
Brad Sherman, a Democrat who leads a small congressional group called the “sceptical faction,” presents things differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
“One hundred excellent economists, including three Nobel laureates, have written to us to ask Congress not to rush and look carefully at which path it chooses,” Sherman said.
In Europe, at the same moment, it was once again understood that this was a global crisis.
Following a crisis conference, the three Benelux states announced that they are nationalising a part of the Fortis banking group worth 11.2 billion euros ($16.3 billion).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after the French BNP Paribas announced it would not buy up its bankrupt competitor after losing its <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2 million (US$2.9 billion) to the US.
With 85,000 employees, Fortis is one of the twenty largest European banks and ten largest insurance companies.
"It's not money spent," Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said yesterday.
“In return, we are gaining voting rights and influence in the bank.
This is exactly something that depositors and households are highly valued now that the situation promises to be uncertain."
Meanwhile, on the other side of La Manche, the British government seems to be preparing to nationalize another bank, which has been devastated by the financial crisis.
According to the British press, the government would take over the total of the Bradford and Bringley bank's ongoing loans, of which the real estate loans amount to <0xC2><0xA3>41 billion (US$75.5 billion).
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it will acquire the UK bank's subsidiaries and customer base.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank to be nationalized by the British government since the start of the crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Farewell to the Actor statue
The eyes of beautiful azures were considered by some to be his main punch card, and by others his main weakness.
Have you ever been rid of the narcissistic mirror of the charming American actor with a smile?
Yeah, well, I'm not.
Because of his shyness, sensitivity, and congenital talent, he was also far from being the harbinger of the very great monsters of the art world.
But what a huge track it was!
Paul Newman died of lung cancer on his property in Connecticut on Friday at the age of 83, one of the last icons of the American cinema boom.
There was less monumental individuality than Brando, who for a long time considered his rival in the film industry. He was more restrained and undoubtedly more vulnerable in his roles, but he also proclaimed freedom and the destruction of dramatic conventions.
The mixing of blood often results in extraordinary children.
Newman was born in 1925 in Ohio to a German Jewish father and a Hungarian-born mother.
The European roots contributed to the birth of one of the symbolic forms of the American dream.
He didn't think much of himself, which only increased his merits.
In fact, it embodied the idea of a "self-made man" and the ideal of a fighter in the Pacific war. In the early 1950s, Yale University was a dramatist, and he did not study in the New York Actor's Studio.
In addition to being a civil rights fighter, she finished second in 1979 as a racer in the Le Mans 24 Hours, but was considered a sex symbol, although she had been happily married to actress Joanne Woodward since 1958.
Now we can never know what side of his life he had in this mysterious, locked-in, dedicated to his work, who hated the stardom of the show business. It will remain a mystery forever.
He was an honest man, in the best sense of the word.
Paul Newman’s death at the end of the week shocked movie fans: his big role is only seen on the black screen of his memories.
Overlooking his life’s work, the seventh American art movement has been plagued by continuous changes for more than fifty years.
In our memory is mixed with the charming "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" cowboy (1969) and the cool young man from his sensuous wife (Elizabeth Taylor), whose role is in "The Cat on the Hot Teddy" in the Tennessee Williams film 19th production.
From the recent times (1990) we can recall in the image of the sensitive Mr. Bridge, who is facing his old age with the fact that his marriage did not change his hopes.
We have also seen many other faces of Paul Newman in his films.
In Robert Wise's film, "Somebody's Gone" a memorable remake of the stormy life criminal boxer, Rocky Graziano, originally intended for James Dean - and taken over after his death - began his role in Newman's 19-year acting career.
He also played a sympathetic villain in the brilliant play "The Great Whale" which won the Best Picture Oscar in 1973.
In Robert Rossen's ingenious film "The Swindler" (1961), he portrayed a frustrated, vengeful billiard player and returned to a similar role in Martin Scorsese's film "The Color of Money" for his performance in 1987.
Times are changing, but it’s always the same face: it was him.
It's always been like this.
The period of his career was marked by a change of epochs.
The younger are best known for George Roy Hill's cult film "The Icebreakers" (1977), in which he plays Reggie Dunlop, a coach of an ice hockey team who works in less-than-normal methods.
Fans were able to see the Coen Brothers' "The Big Jump" in 1994.
Sam Mendes' film, The Road to Destiny, was released in 2003, and was last seen as an Irish mafia boss.
Unlike many cinema legends who left the film industry relatively quickly, Newman remained in the spotlight for a long time, although he condemned Hollywood for its brilliance, brilliance, and imagination.
Bertrand Tavernier, a French film director, did not see all of the humor as a "live criticism of underplay": he thought his play was too powerful.
The profession, however, was not always generous with the handsome Paul Newman, who for a long time had just fallen into the bosom of the film roles.
Yet he played more rarely young and successful characters: he preferred to form characters living on the periphery of society - neuropathic, alcoholic, malignant, or hopeless - whose turmoil and rebellion he was able to return with perfect credibility.
As a director, Newman showed a lesser-known face: a really ugly and sensitive man in the depths of his soul.
In the 1968 film "Rachel, Rachel" (an adaptation of the novel by the Canadian writer Margaret Laurence), Joanne Woodward portrayed a fine portrait of a melancholic woman in the lead role.
The 1984 film, "Harry and his Son," is a reminiscent of Scott, his son who died of drug overdose.
Yesterday, Newman's innumerable admirers recalled the actor. His close friend and former fighter partner, Robert Redford (who played with him in "The Big Whale" and "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"), devastated by the sadness of his life and declared: "His presence is for the better.
Happiness and the joy of being: that was the secret to the vibrating personality of this great actor that we have just lost.
In addition to his legendary career, his critical remarks for civil rights, the environment, his struggle for independent filmmaking, and Hollywood's hiccups are obscured.
We have often seen his image on the packaging of sausages, sauces, cookies and other foods. He did it with a bad mouthpiece, although at first he thought it was still funny.
However, the proceeds from such sales have always been transferred to the foundation established for children suffering from the disease.
Newman never sat on his lap: he remained committed to the profession until the end.
In a letter to his five daughters, he wrote the following sentences: “Your father was always and to the end unimaginably grateful for his lucky star.
It was a privilege for me to be here.”
We are also privileged to have been able to accompany the career of such a brilliant and generous American artist.
He was an exemplary citizen, above all.
What did you produce in Zuschlag & Tsai?
Soon, on 8 October, the trial of J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Zuschlag and his colleagues will begin.
The politician and his comrades are accused of fraud and other crimes, including document falsification, which have caused significant damage to the criminal organization, on an ongoing and commercial basis.
According to the prosecutor's office, the winning bid money was used for their own purposes, and the performance of the tasks was often verified with false accounts.
The state and local government funds – a total of about HUF 65 million – partly moved into the Young Left’s cash register, partly into the pockets of some people.
The method also described by the investigative authority was that the winning bids were collected on the basis of cost accounts that did not have a real performance and that the associations never met the commitment.
According to the prosecution, most of the bills were fake.
In the Jozsefv<0xC3><0xA1>ros market, the billboards were purchased and the circular stamps were manufactured in Kiskunhala.
And in order to name which companies to produce invoices, among other things, fell on the Balaton-Alpes-Route, to which Zuschlag J<0xC3><0xA1>nos sent Istov<0xC3><0xA1>n Lados.
According to his last statement, he had to look at bed and breakfasts and restaurants.
He asked for an invoice for his consumption there, for which he prepared the invoices to be submitted for the applications of the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Social and Labour Fund, and the Capital Municipality, among others.
Most of these were recorded by Lados Istv<0xC3><0xA1>n with his partner, <0xC5><0x90>ri Andr<0xC3><0xA1>s, who, according to our information, wrote the most necessary reports to receive the grants.
One of the highlights of Lado's "study trip" was a brewery.
According to two accounts issued by Zuschlagék in 2003, the restaurant provided food for a group of nineteen people of the Biztos Pont Association.
However, according to the head of the company, they would not have entered the restaurant at the same time.
In the same way, the bill issued to the Foundation for a Better Future - later called Together for the Third Millennium - in the summer of 2002 was covered by form and content errors.
A bed and breakfast in Badacsonytomaji consisted of only three rooms, more than ten people could not sleep in one night, yet the bill was about a hundred and thirty guests.
But the imaginative form-fillers were too exaggerated even when they identified Pigal Kft., which also deals with hospitality, whose accounting - according to the information given to the prosecution - was not even included in the document for Better Futures and the name of Hopp<0xC3><0xA1>.
The head of the company, Farkas Gy<0xC5><0x91>z<0xC5><0x91> told hvg.hu that when they called the prosecutor’s office and showed him invoices, he immediately knew that they were fake documents.
"Our company name and tax number were in the wrong place on the stamp."
For formal reasons, he added, the fact that according to the bill, there were hundreds of people accommodated, because they have a total of eleven rooms in which there is not enough room.
In addition, the bill was also intended for catering, while their restaurant no longer works.
The enthusiastic account makers did not follow the fact that the Budapest travel agency they looked like only organizes foreign trips, so botor was designated a trip to Hungary as a service on the cash payment account, which also did not agree with the company’s practice of issuing invoices.
In addition, as the investigation revealed, VAT was also included in the document, although the travel activity to countries outside the European Union was VAT-free.
Among other things, the rate of VAT was also faulty on the four documents issued by Hotel Révfülöp Kft. for Better Future, because the company’s service is charged not by the 25, but by 15 percent VAT, in addition, the hotel’s employees were required to pay only a mechanical invoice.
In addition, the "exhibitors" have deteriorated the bill by designating a road haulage in the case of a company as an activity carried out - it was revealed through the prosecution procedure - which the company based on the original investment advice did not carry out.
In addition, differences in form – an incorrect account format, not a real stamp – have resulted in the fact that the accounts for the Joint Foundation for the Third Millennium, the 21st Century Cultural Association and the Security Point are false.
As in the case of Ravenna Bt. or the Sportt<0xC3><0xA1>bor in Klanfehért<0xC3><0xB3>i, whose representatives denied that the invoices would have been issued by them.
For example, the falsifiers did not notice that the pyregyh<0xC3><0xA1>zi HIB Kft. was under extermination at the time (2001) when the group of the Young City Association was eating there, which is why the company's extermination commissioner - as we know it - stated that
Deliberately Exposed
Another group of account issuers are those who were aware of the need to issue a fictitious invoice.
At the request of the Young Left - Young Socialists, the Esély Budapest Foundation issued an invoice for the Joint Foundation for the Third Millennium, about four million HUF.
According to the prosecution, one of the accused, Györfi Ludovic, hired the head of Collab Kft. to issue the fictitious invoice.
He also collaborated with Zuschlage, the currently under liquidation Biogate Ltd., which in 2003 provided the Foundation for a Better Future, the Atlassian Association and the Röösfeny<0xC5><0x91> Association with invoices that were not issued at a gross value of five million forints.
It’s not a movement of money either, because the bills that have been prepared have been scanned afterwards, but the organizations have already forgotten to include it in their documents.
The next group of companies that issue the invoice includes those that can be linked to the defendants.
Thus, Kubatov Ivan was the delivery officer of the Ukrainian Managing Director of Delta Tri<0xC3><0xB3> Kft., based in Budapest, which deals with the trade in fuel and motor vehicles.
The company also issued several invoices in October, November and December 2005 for the sale of computer equipment, valued at approximately HUF 18 million.
According to the data of the investigation, these invoices were purchased by Cash Investment Kft., which has been under liquidation since 14 September 2005.
This company was led by a Romanian man, to whom Ivan Kubatov would also have transmitted documents relating to the company between 2002 and 2005.
As we know, during the investigation, Kubatov acknowledged that he had issued an invoice on behalf of the company to Atlasz, Hoppa and the Joint Foundation for the Third Millennium, and that he had taken up their compensation.
At the request of Ivan Kubatov, Romanian stoneworkers founded Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Ltd. and Jos-Investment Bt..
In fact, however, none of the companies operated, which the defendant said was the reason why they were not given a job.
However, he took advantage of the companies because his co-defendant, Szente Zsolt, who also produced the company’s papers, issued invoices on behalf of the companies to the associations associated with Zuschlag: Atlasz and Y-Generation.
Kubatov, on behalf of Cash Investment, Delta Trio, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, gave the organizations a total of 15 accounts worth HUF 14.2 million.
The prosecutor's office believed that 10 percent of the amounts on the bills and the VAT hit the Kubatov mark.
The man even used the Szi-Beri Bt. to issue fictitious invoices, these were manufactured for the Commitment Point's bid.
In January 2006, the Y-Generation and the Alliance for Modern Hungary submitted an application to the NGO of the Socialist Party, the T<0xC3><0xA1>ncsics Mih<0xC3><0xA1>ly Foundation (TMA).
They also won 500,000-500,000 forints, but the amounts were not spent for the purposes indicated in the application.
To avoid this, five fictitious invoices received from Works Team Kft. were submitted to TMA.
These invoices were found during a house search carried out in the office of <0xC3><0x81>rp<0xC3><0xA1>d Kemecsei at his educational library.
At the trial, some of the defendants, as they did at the prosecutor's office, are likely to report on the course of the bill-making process.
The most interesting thing may be if you are the first-defendant, J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Zuschlag decides to put the veil on top of everything.
His testimony so far is not very detailed, and although he has repeatedly promised to speak extensively, he has not yet done so.
The question is whether it is for this purpose, or for the greater part of the damage, fifty million forints were contracted by the Socialists in return, and Zusi takes away the bargain.
Those who may have been offended even today, as their requests for the easing of their circumstances, i.e. for the placement of house arrest, have always been deaf ears.
While the perpetrators of much more damaging and unrecoverable economic crimes can walk freely, or at least wait for the end of the proceedings against them in their own homes, they have no chance of doing so.
The Psychology of Over-Citation: Why Do We Spend More Money?
At auctions, buyers tend to spend more money, overvalue the goods.
The neuro-economic foundations of this well-known — and seemingly irrational — behavior have been discovered by neurologists and economists at the University of New York.
According to a study published in the journal Science, people don’t want to succumb to a type of competition such as an eBay auction, so they’re more likely to pay too high a price.
The research tried to map the nervous system scheme of this "game" using experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers took part in the lottery, while the other group took part in the player auction, while the active brain areas of the experimenters were examined using the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) method.
In both games, participants were able to win money, but during the auction game - in which an essential element is the over-licensing of the other party - the complex called striatum, under the cerebral cortex, went into intensive operation when the game was lost.
This area of the brain plays a role in the "rewarding" mechanism of the nervous system along with several other functions.
Therefore, according to the researchers, the rise in price can be explained by avoiding the intense reaction of the striatum.
To support their theory, the members of the research group of economists also carried out a financial follow-up study.
In this, three groups tendered against one partner under different circumstances.
The control group was simply informed of the real value of the product in question and they made their bets.
Another group was also promised that if they were to get out of the game, they would be rewarded with another $15 in cash.
The third group, however, received $15 just before the auction, but the members of the group lost that money in the event of a losing auction.
So the difference between the two groups was only so much that for one group the gain was emphasized, for the other group the loss.
However, as evidenced by the hypothesis of neurologists, the members of the team playing "against loss" were willing to bet higher than the control and the "force" group.
“These results cannot be deduced from any previously existing economic theory.
So far, they have only explained the phenomena experienced at the auction with the joy of winning and the avoidance of risk.
"Only neurological imaging methods have helped to resolve the contradiction between these two theories by coming up with a third explanation," said Andrew Schotter, a professor at the University of New York's Faculty of Economics.
Hepatitis: When to see a doctor?
Around half a billion people in the world suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C infection, and in Hungary, chronic liver disease is one of the leading causes of death.
The number of people infected with hepatitis at home can be up to one hundred thousand, but they only treat seven thousand, which is the reason: patients often do not know that they have been infected.
The name hepatitis is a collector name for infectious liver disease caused by various viruses.
There are many similarities in their symptoms, characterized by inflammation of the liver and jaundice, but their pathogens and the diseases caused are different from each other.
Hepatitis viruses are spread in two main forms depending on the pathogen: hepatitis A and E through the digestive tract (e.g., contaminated food, water), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses with blood and body tissues (e.g., vaginal discharge, vaginal discharge).
Travelers should definitely be protected against the A and B viruses, there is no vaccine against C.
Symptoms of hepatitis A occur two to three weeks after eating the infected food, generally accompanied by feeling unwell, weakness, abdominal complaints, nausea.
After this, yellowing of the skin and eye whites develops, the stool becomes bright, the urine darkens, the healing can take up to two to three weeks.
Every year, one million people worldwide die from the most severe form of the disease, from liver cancer and hepatic insufficiency caused by hepatitis B.
The main reason for this is that it is estimated that only one in ten infected people receive drug treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: if not treated, it can lead to liver contractions, liver cancers.
Most infected people do not even know about their disease, because the pathogen destroys the liver cells involuntarily, in many cases, the first symptoms only appear after 20-30 years.
Thus, after that, it is very important to carry out early prevention, regular screening tests.
In three groups, there are far more than average such diseases: people who had had blood transfusions before 1991, drug users, and tattooists.
There are currently 200 million people infected with the chronic hepatitis C virus in the world.
Since the disease can already be detected by a routine laboratory test, it is worth seeing a doctor if any symptoms of unknown origin are detected.
By recognizing the disease in time, it can be cured, the virus can be expelled from the body, thus eliminating the ability to become infectious and prevent the development of cancer.
September 30th is the World Hepatitis Day, which was first organized in 2004 by organizations representing patients around the world.
It aims to draw attention to the chronic hepatitis caused by viruses, the causes of their development and the importance of early detection of the disease.
Who believes in God is the least hurtful?
According to recent research, religious faith acts as a kind of painkiller, which may have facilitated the death of Catholic martyrs.
Scientists at the University of Oxford conducted an interesting experiment, investigating how the belief in god affects people’s pain perceptions, the British Telegraph reported.
As part of the rather bizarre study, 12 Catholic believers and the same atheists were given electroshocks while all studied a painting depicting the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to rule out much of the pain.
Thanks to the technique of brain scanning, it also turned out that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain that is responsible for regulating pain.
The study is the first in a series of research in which, in addition to academics, scientists, philosophers and theologians from different parts of the university are also involved.
The test was carried out precisely by amplifying a sparkling device to the left hand of the subject who supplied the electroshock.
The researchers asked the participants to look closely at two paintings, Sassoferrato’s 17th-century painting of the Virgin Mary and Leonardo da Vinci’s 15th-century painting of Lady Hermelin.
The authors of the study hoped that the sight of the Virgin Mary provoked some sort of religious condition among the believers, while the da Vinci image was chosen because it was not too different from the other and was thought to have a soothing effect.
The subjects spent half an hour in an MRI scanner machine, during which time they received 20 electroshocks in four successive sections while either looking at the religious theme or the general picture.
The Catholics reported that during the vision of the Virgin Mary they felt “safe” as if they were “thinking about” and “rested, filled with peace.”
While viewing the religious-themed image, 12 percent less pain was reported than when they saw Leonardo’s work in front of them.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who himself took part in the study, believes that a similar effect can be achieved with any strong image, even among atheists, only the right photo needs to be found.
"We should find a picture that they feel very positive about as a mother or a father," the psychologist said.
Bishop Tom Wright of England welcomed the results of the study.
“The practice of faith should and in many cases it will change our personality,” Wright added.
After the excellent results, the question is, if Leonardo or a painter of a similar calibre showed the image of a madonna to the believers, what effect would it have on their pain management?
Would the vision of the quality Virgin Mary bring even better results?
You are what you share about yourself
On Google’s 10th birthday, you can tell: people are at least as much in their pocket as they are in the sky; you know where they’ve been on vacation, what special orders they’re going to, and what interests them.
And that’s still not enough for Eric Schmidt, according to one of the company’s chief executives.
As for the skeptics who draw parallels to the Orwellian nightmare, they do not see the very essence of web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google’s main goal is to collect even more personal data about its users, and this is necessary to keep themselves in line with the original goal of the Google founders, who said: “Put information into the world.”
According to Google, after 10 years of global exploration, the company is still at the beginning of its ability to handle all the information.
Asked what would happen in five years, Schmidt said: “I want Google to be able to answer questions like ‘what should I do tomorrow?’ or ‘what kind of work should I do?’ – but software can’t really answer that simple question.
Not all internet users are aware of the fact that when searching the Internet, the search words are recorded exactly what IP address they were searching for and which page the interested parties went to after the search.
For example, with the Personalized Search launched two years ago, users can save their own surfing background history, view what they are looking for, click on it, and by doing this, they will give you our products that you prefer in the long term, and will not log on to our system, and will generate more personalized results for them.
What if they use my data against me, if they look at what I'm doing? - asked users who are concerned about Google's data monopoly.
In most cases, the degree of potential power represented by the company can be frightening, not the feeling of guilt, fear of punishment, the desire for freedom, or the rebellion against power triggers counter-reactions on the internet.
It is confirmed, however, that all sought terms are not only recorded, but may also be passed on to a third party if justified, and in such legal cases nothing protects the personal rights of internet users.
Perhaps the most prominent example of this in recent times was a coordinated action against Brazilian paedophiles, during which Google provided the Brazilian government with information about the paedophiles from its social network called Orkut, which it maintains.
Internet users who are concerned about personal rights, however, may have been on the rise as early as May, when the company successfully proved to be right in court against the FBI with the help of the EFF’s electronic defense organization: according to this information, Google will not force you to do so in the future.
(At the same time, the federal government successfully fought out about fifty thousand web addresses and a thousand search terms, which it obtained with a reference to the confirmation of the child protection law passed years ago, but it was not able to obtain a complete list of snowflakes and a list of snowflakes, a list of individual users.
So Google’s judgment is quite contradictory: they obscure those who fear the provision of their personal data, because they feel their private sphere and privacy are ingrained by the fact that they start using Google’s services and by the fact that these companies are anti-conservative.
In the meantime, the American geek culture and its enthusiastic computer fans, activists, and users, who are in a number of countries, are all looking at the next generation of large corporations as a “going corporation” in them, as opposed to Microsoft and its rival Windows.
This may be because Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask for a code to identify its users, does not ask for money for their applications, the open, free, constantly updated source code and software package is much more accessible, younger, cooler than the official time.
However, it can also happen because the geeks are precisely translating the very problematic relationship between personal rights and the internet, which has been one of the most frequently spoken keywords in recent years, web 2.0.
Web 2.0 is all about collaborating, about deliberately leaving behind traces and taking advantage of the communication channels we have at our disposal, and while the extent of these channels varies individually, the point is the same: we show ourselves.
An average young person can take profiles from Facebook to Xang<0xC3><0xA1>, link them to other services, such as Twitter, or list their music habits with last.fm, and then automatically link them to following systems such as Pivny or FriendFeed.
While we can read about a number of exemplary cases from which it is clear: the girlfriend easily realizes the photo pairing of the morning of the joint circle of friends, seeing that his cheating friend spent the evening with you, or you can fire a company employee for today: you can fire him for the sake of blogging.
Who lives online is made up of what he shows himself, this way we can define the underlying assumptions behind the behavior of today’s young people.
Anyone who wants to hide something, or at least want to avoid Google’s monopoly, can do so (for example, by using Google’s search engine but at the same time deliberately leaving no trace of Scrooge).
For example, the number of people who do not intentionally register for social sites so that they can not be uploaded, Google’s online applications from text editor to image editor and our best newsreaders can be replaced with alternative versions that do not link to it.
The public doesn’t expect it to be so secretive when Google shows off the protein of the tooth.
The company is worth more than IBM (140 billion dollars), Intel (124 billion dollars) or Coca-Cola (110 billion dollars), AdWords/AdSense accounts and other ad platforms are not responsible for the revenues of other ad agencies.
Critical viewers, however, will find in addition to these, all the counterpoints that cause concern in 2006: for example, the top management completely rejected the objection of the employees, after doubled the price of the company’s kindergarten, found too expensive the management of the company’s employees.
One of the internal rules of the company is that you can not announce a new service in advance, only when it is already in use, but you can see the problems of the next few months and years, and you can move the world at a different point: while some people think Google is a book and magazine
And the fact that Google is building a genetic database can also provide a good foundation for the next generation of sci-fi writers, the novella by the popular Cory Doctorow, the Scroogled dot, describes the future in which a person can only be alarmed by Google’s data.
Two teenagers helped the Uzdi double-murderer in the prosecution
Two juveniles were interrogated by the police in the case of the Uzdi double murder, according to a well-founded suspicion, assisted in the removal of traces of the crime, a spokesman for the Borsod County Police Chief Command said on Tuesday.
The young people have acknowledged the act that has been inflicted on them, and they are currently being charged with felony.
The two teenagers, according to the MTI, are defending themselves for free.
Penalty can also be imposed for up to five years of imprisonment.
A 23-year-old local man, who was suspected of a double murder in Oz, was placed under preliminary arrest on Sunday.
Premeditated, profit-driven, multiple-person homicide suspects.
The investigation revealed that the 23-year-old man owed a larger amount of money to a 53-year-old man.
The suspect did not want to settle his debts, so last week he cheated on his creditor at a settlement in Oz, where he killed him and then his 9-year-old daughter.
According to the MTI, the young man was pre-prepared to commit the crime, which is also a sign that he committed the murder with a gun stabbed at the scene.
The circumstances of the weapon and its use are investigated by the police with the involvement of an expert.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange has made an offer to acquire the Prague Stock Exchange.
Two hundred million euros – about five billion Czech crowns – were offered by the Warsaw Stock Exchange for the purchase of the 100 per cent shareholding of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, Ludwik Sobolewski, confirmed the offer made by the Poles despite the fact that the Warsaw Stock Exchange had previously been excluded by the Czechs from any new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason for this is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in the state hands.
99 percent of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which intends to sell more than 60 percent of the securities in a few months’ expiry.
The Czech economic daily E15 knows that the offer of the Poles represents the highest amount that has so far been offered by those interested in the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to Czech newspapers, so far, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic Stock Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Börse have submitted an offer.
Petr Koblic, head of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst new owner among those interested, and did not rule out that this could lead to the Prague Stock Exchange ending in the future.
The value of the Prague stock market is estimated at 5-10 billion kroner by market experts.
According to the shareholders’ agreement, about 90 percent of the securities could be sold.
The largest shareholder of the Prague Stock Exchange is the Patria Finance Investment Bank with a 25 percent stake, followed by the Czech Sporitelna Bank with 14.7 percent and Tiger Holding Four S.a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
On the financial crisis from the point of view of European newspapers
In their comments on Tuesday, leading European newspapers devoted to the deepening international financial crisis are already mentioning "Second September 11".
The global financial disaster is due to the US president, La Repubblica, accused in Rome, who has not even been able to raise his own party behind a bill that has been put together to remedy the desperate situation.
Instead of another Pearl Harbor, mentioned by billionaire investor Warren Buffett, it’s better to talk about September 11th.
Part of the Madrid press also sees the crime scene in Washington.
According to El Mundo, the lack of political leadership there has put the world economy on the brink of collapse.
There is an increasing risk of the collapse of the American financial system, and then the whole world will suffer.
While Bush’s plan was not perfect, following the congressional vote, the danger is that Washington does not offer a political tool to deal with the crisis.
The world economy hangs in the air – just when one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism takes place.
The threat can no longer be ignored, according to the Geneva-based Tages-Anzeiger.
Today, some states may still provide a lifeline to financial institutions around the globe, and with taxpayers’ money they can save them from bankruptcy.
But if more banks collapse like dominoes, then neither the funds nor any further impositions will suffice.
In the long run, it is necessary for the Member States of the European Union to overcome their national selfishness and centralise control over the fragmented money markets.
On Monday alone, more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 billion was given to the infirm financial institutions, the Vienna-based Der Standard said, according to which concerns that, like the Americans, European taxpayers have to go deep into the pockets of the crisis are becoming more and more realistic.
The EU has so far not taken the crisis seriously, which is sweeping through the old continent as a tsunami.
The "savers" don't have to spend almost 100 billion euros, but it would be good if I put it this way: in which case it would be reasonable to touch taxpayers' money in order to prevent more damage.
The flight of the donggo is imitated by the smart car
What would be the best way to develop technologies to avoid collisions if not to imitate the barrier sensors that occur in the world of nature?
For example, bees.
In a surprise project presented at CEATEC in Japan, dong bees gave Nissan engineers the strategic starting point for how to build the next generation of collision-avoiding systems.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built a BR23C-type, bio-engineered autorobot control system, a robotic minicar equipped with the characteristics of bees, with the ultimate goal of helping to develop a system that is capable of all kinds of impacts.
Each bee forms its own oval-shaped personal space during flight, which is actually very similar to our safety casing,” Kazuhhiro Doi, Chief Technology Officer for PR and R&D, explained at the exhibition.
It is important for the complex eye of the uterus, which is able to see at an angle of more than 300 degrees in all directions.
In order to replicate the function of the complex eye, the engineers approached the idea of a laser distance meter.
It identifies obstacles within 2 metres of the 180-degree viewing range before BR23C, calculates their distance, and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which is immediately transformed into a collision avoidance operation.
During the fraction of a second, the obstacle is detected, and then the car robot mimics the movements of the uterus, immediately shifting the direction of its wheels to the extent necessary to avoid collision.
Unlike any current system, this avoiding maneuver takes place in a completely instinctive manner.
“If this were not the case, the auto-robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles,” explains Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the Mobility Laboratory and the auto-robot project.
You must react in an instinctive and immediate manner, as this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable and innermost layer of the safety pads, a layer within which collision is currently considered inevitable.
The whole process should reflect what a bee does in order to avoid other bees.
This process should take place at a glance.
However, unlike bees, the deviation cannot be directed upwards, downwards or transversely, it can only be two-dimensional, and only in the direction of the rotation of the wheels.
In this way, instead of the endless possibility available to bees to avoid the other bees, only the rotating movement and acceleration and the slowdown were used as the option available to the car robot.
BR23C uses lithium-polymer batteries that are lighter and higher in energy density, which means that they have a longer service life than the lithium-ion version.
According to Andoh, instinctive intelligent response is important, not the ability to process data, let alone the ability to store it.
This structure only needs to process a few incoming signals per second and respond to them.
You don’t need to keep them and react with intuitive logic based on data from previous maneuvers, so you’re constantly using just a few dozen kilobytes of memory.
There is no need for gigabytes or megabytes of memory.
This is the first step in the development of instantaneous avoidance technology, which, according to Nissan’s estimate, can be incorporated into mass-produced cars within ten years.
An additional application can be used by integrating the unit with the GPS satellite navigation system to avoid obstacles on the road to drive the car to the specified end destination.
The name has also been given to the toxic child.
The written version of the $700 billion Economic Rescue Package Act, which is applicable in more detail, aimed at buying bad loans from banks, has been completed.
In the first round, half of the amount is spent.
During further talks on the east coast, which lasted until midnight on Saturday, congressional leaders came to terms with a dispute over a total bailout of $700 billion, which has been going on for days, according to Reuters.
"We have made serious progress," said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic president of the U.S. House of Representatives, who said there was only paperwork left for the deal.
The compromise on the package was supported by both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain.
Speaking about the outcome of the compromise, Finance Minister Henry Paulson said: “The program will work and be effective, but further action is needed, not to save Wall Street, but to turn the corner of the economy.”
The written version of the package was released by the Asian markets in Washington, D.C., before the opening of Sunday night at 8 p.m. (i.e. at 2 p.m. Central European time) but did not cause a spectacular run on the stock exchange.
The House of Representatives will vote on the draft law on the program, which will be passed in the name of the 2008 Economic Emergency Stabilization Act, on Monday, and then in the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi on Saturday night, and then the White House welcomed the news of the deal.
"We are pleased with the progress made tonight and greatly appreciate the efforts of the two parties to stabilise our money markets and protect our economy," said White House spokesman Tony Fratto.
The program differs from the Bush administration’s original proposal that the $700 billion would have been spent on the purchase of low-quality, credit-based securities at the same time.
Now, in the first round, up to half of the $700 billion can be spent by using $250 billion as soon as Congress is expected to vote on the matter on Monday, from which the Treasury Department buys a series of $100 million in bad credit.
The program will be supervised by a separate body, in which the President of the Federal Reserve will also participate.
Spending the other half of the $700 billion depends on another Congressional decision.
Under the law, the Ministry of Finance can apply a combined tactic: it can buy bad loans, mortgages and mortgage-backed securities at the same time, as well as other types of "toxic" loans.
The purchase can take place within the framework of auctions and directly, the officials of the ministry said.
The legislation allows the companies concerned to participate in an insurance program, where the financial portfolio guarantees the means of providing cause for concern, for which the companies will be paid a fee corresponding to the expected damages.
Henry Paulson said: “The law provides the necessary means to meet the urgent needs of the American financial system, whether it’s a large purchase of bad assets, insurance, or a large-scale collapse of a financial institution.”
“We will take the necessary steps to be ready to introduce the law as soon as it is signed,” he said.
Heads of banks in trouble and waiting for state aid, on the other hand, can count on the government limiting their withdrawal funds – which the overseas sling simply calls the golden umbrella.
Payments will only be limited in certain cases, and the limits will depend on the way in which the Ministry of Finance provides assistance.
The restriction essentially means that if you buy from the Ministry in the framework of an auction, you will be extradited on the gold parachute, unless you are sent to retirement for the banker you have levied.
When buying bad loans directly, the government will intervene aggressively to ensure that the manager’s money is not exaggerated.
The picture is that existing gold parachute contracts do not change, the restriction applies only to new ones, in order to incentivize participation in the programme.
"This is the first time in U.S. history that a legal restriction will be in place on the benefits of CEOs," Barney Frank, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, said in a statement.
In addition, in the banks participating in the program, the state acquires the right to take part, thus reducing the risk of taxpayers, as they can finally win the transaction, as the economy and the saved bank recover.
The bill states that over the next five years, the president will have to submit a motion to Congress that provides for how taxpayers can recover the expected losses from the financial sector.
There were, of course, those on both sides who expressed their doubts about the plan.
“This is not what American citizens have asked us to do, that is, it does not protect taxpayers’ dollars,” said Republican Rep. Darrell Issa.
Mary Kaptur, a fellow Ohio Democrat, said the measures were pushed by the same people who were responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.
Industrial prices continue to rise.
The industry's domestic sales prices rose by 0.1 percent in August 2008 compared to the previous month, compared with 12.9 percent in August 2007, KSH reports.
Industrial export sales prices were 1.1 per cent higher than in July 2008, a decrease of 3.9 per cent compared to a year earlier.
As a result of domestic and export change, industrial producers’ prices were 0.7 per cent higher than in the previous month, up from 3.2 per cent a year earlier.
Domestic sales prices of the industry increased only to a minimum, by 0.1 per cent, compared to the previous month.
Domestic sales prices in the processing industries also increased slightly, by 0.1 per cent, compared to July.
In August 2008, the highest price increase occurred in the leather and footwear manufacturing sector (2.8 per cent), mainly in the case of poultry, belts and footwear production, at 4.6 per cent and in the case of footwear production at a rate of 2.5 per cent per month.
The higher price levels of plastics and chemical raw materials resulted in a significant monthly increase in the price of the chemical, product production sector (1.6 percent).
Price reductions occurred in the petroleum processing (1.4 per cent), electric machinery, instrument production (0.9 per cent) and - to a minimum - wood processing (0.1 per cent) sectors.
The prices of papermaking, publishing and printing activities have not changed.
In the rest of the processing industries, we measured a price increase between 0.2 percent and 0.9 percent.
In the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sectors, which represent a significant weight in the domestic sales of the industry, prices increased by 0.3 per cent in August, mainly as a result of the prolonged effect of official gas production from 1 July.
In the twelve-month comparison - in terms of domestic sales of the processing industries - prices in the petroleum processing industry rose the most (32.4%).
The production of metal processing products in the sector was 13.2 per cent, with a price increase of 11 per cent in the area of food, drink and tobacco production representing the decisive weight.
Price reductions occurred in the textiles, textiles (2.5 per cent), as well as in the electrical machinery and instrument production (0.3 per cent) sectors.
In the other processing industries, the rate of price increase was between 0.6 per cent and 9.1 per cent.
Prices in the processing industry as a whole have increased by 10.2 per cent over the past year.
Prices in the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sectors were 18.7 per cent higher than they were a year earlier.
In domestic sales, the highest monthly price increase (0.7 per cent) was recorded in August among the target groups of the sectors in which the investment goods were produced.
In the sectors producing consumer goods, prices have increased by 0.3 per cent, and in the energy and re-use sectors, prices have not changed compared to the previous month.
In August 2008, compared to the same month of the previous year, the highest price increase was observed in the energy and re-use sectors (16.8 per cent).
In the consumer goods manufacturing sectors, we measured a price increase of 6.8 per cent and a price decrease of 1.4 per cent for investment goods.
Export sales prices in forints increased by 1.1 per cent in August compared to the previous month, down by 3.9 per cent in 12 months.
In one month, our domestic payment instruments fell by 1.7 per cent against the euro, 7.1 per cent against the dollar, compared with 7.5 per cent against the euro, compared with August 2007, 15.9 per cent against the dollar.
Do I need a visa to the United States next year?
Göncz Kinga sees a good chance that the U.S.-Hungarian visa waiver agreement will come into effect around January 12th - the foreign minister spoke about this in Chicago, before the local Hungarian leaders.
In his opinion, “it all depends now on whether the electronic access and control system is being built in time overseas.”
At the same time, he pointed out that there will be no entry permit in the new system, but tourists will have to register themselves before departure.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy is currently holding talks in Washington.
He will meet with Foreign Minister Condoleezza Rice, to whom he will hand over the Medal of Honor of the Hungarian Republic to the Star and will hold talks with the Democratic Party of Barack Obama and Republican President-elect John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain are also on the side of the bailout package.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Barack Obama and John McCain, the two major U.S. parties' nominee for the government's 700-billion-dollar bailout package on Sunday, have a politician demanding the resignation of the finance minister.
After the marathon negotiations that have been going on for days, representatives of Congress and the administration announced at dawn on Sunday: a principle agreement was reached on the bailout package.
The Wall Street crisis and the financial package aimed at defrosting the frozen credit market have become a central issue in the presidential election campaign.
Obama and McCain also point out that they are better suited than their rivals to get the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the latest polls, Obama has once again gained some advantage with the introduction of economic issues, dissolving McCain’s advantage after the Republican convention, with the nomination of Vice President Sarah Palin.
At a campaign rally in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed hope that the bill on the $700 billion package would be quickly passed by Congress.
He stressed that the proposal included those consumer protection passports, which he also supported.
"Now we have to act responsibly ... your position, your savings, whole industries, the stability of the whole economy is in jeopardy," he said.
He did not fail to call McCain’s economic ideas past time.
McCain told ABC in an interview, “We’re all going to be hard to swallow... but doing nothing is simply not the way to go.”
The Republican senator announced that the proposal included setting up a Finance Minister's Supervisory Committee and limiting the final approval of top executives, and he insisted on this.
Obama told CBS that McCain did not have a worthy role in the negotiations, but he was in daily contact with the minister.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Sunday that the House is expected to vote on the bill on Monday.
Child's View of the German Language
The right-wing camp is unaffected, only within the camp the voters have become more self-aware - so the Der Spiegel analyzes the weak role of CSU in Bavaria.
Haiderék is ready to govern Austria in order to prevent the Red-Black Coalition.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
In an online edition of the left-wing German news magazine Franz Walter, Bavaria’s Revolution eats up his parents, he analyzes the causes of CSU’s dramatic defeat.
According to the well-known political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo took office.
The Christian socialists have been renovating Bavaria for decades – and now these modern citizens are turning away from them.
At the same time, the change of the era is the problem of all Christian democracy, as is Angela Merkel’s problem.
The failure was not quite surprising for CSU, but it ended on Sunday a process that was almost exactly ten years ago probable: the undisputed hegemony of a state party ended.
For the first time since the 1950s, CSU has landed at 47.7 percent in 1998, below the 50 percent level.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 Bundestag elections, so even in the Stoiber era mentioned so much.
The reason for this is the constant modernization carried out by the CSU in the province, which eats up its parents.
Sociologists have been predicting this for 40 years, but at the same time they made a big mistake. However, without the consequences of the CSU’s loyalty to secularisation, educational results, the settlement of East and North Germans in the developing regions of Bavaria, it could not have been possible.
Modernisation is accompanied by an increase in opportunities, and the political consequences of this can also be seen.
The right-wing camp is intact, only within the camp the voters have become more self-aware, more critical, more self-centered.
It is also striking that in the last few weeks, it has been the classic civic groups that have moved away the most from the CSU; they are freelancers, industrialists, graduates and graduates.
The CSU’s support has already shrunk to below 40 percent.
The press (diepresse.com)
The conservative newspaper in Vienna, entitled "Who, by whom? The party presidents in the repressed coalition issues", deals with the confusing domestic political situation that emerged after the Austrian elections.
The SP<0xC3><0x96> wants to negotiate with the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
The <0xC3><0x96>VP prohibits the SP<0xC3><0x96> from intervening in its interior.
The BZ<0xC3><0x96> is open to negotiations in all directions, and the Greens do not want to negotiate the coalition yet.
The election took place, now everything revolves around the coalition; in the debate held on public service television, party leaders barely allowed insight into their cards.
SP<0xC3><0x96> President Werner Faymann confirmed that he wants to negotiate with the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
The SP<0xC3><0x96> wants to show that it is indeed possible for the two parties to cooperate - in some provinces and in the social partnership.
The question of whether a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer - the current <0xC3><0x96>VP president, as well as the deputy chancellor - could be imagined, Faymann left open.
As he said, the Schüssel-Molterer course was voted down anyway.
The repetition of this direction is not discussed.
Molterer responded cautiously to the red offers.
As he said, the cooperation will certainly not be successful if Faymann tries to intervene inside the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
Whether his party elects the opposition or joins the coalition, which is currently fully open in the party, the issues must be discussed within the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
President Jörg Haider BZ<0xC3><0x96> was once again open to all directions.
"To prevent the Red-Black coalition, we are ready to take on the responsibility of the government," Haider said.
Walker: We must break the cycle of poverty, segregation
The European Summit on Equal Opportunities, which this year will be hosted by France, which represents the current Presidency of the European Union, has started in Paris.
L<0xC3><0xAD>via J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka, the fide representative of the European People's Party, drew attention to the segregation of education in her message to the plenary as one of the main speakers of the professional council, because this is one of the most serious violations of the law affecting Roma children.
The high-level conference - on behalf of the French Presidency - was opened by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs, and Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
The meeting was attended by representatives of governments, the European social partners and the most important European advocates and civil society organisations in the field of equality of opportunity.
J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka - according to the press office of the Fidesz MEP group - warned that, in addition to discrimination in employment, Roma are mainly deprived of the labour market due to their low education.
"The vast majority of Roma youth do not have a secondary education, and only a small part of them can obtain a secondary education as a result of poor quality of basic education."
He also stressed that, as a fundamental human right, education has a key role to play in the enforcement of other human rights.
Investing in the early education of Roma children could mean strengthening the economy of the EU Member States.
The MEP believes that it is necessary to raise awareness of these links in the broadest possible range - including among Roma and non-Roma.
The sooner a Roma student starts school, the more likely they are to become productive members of the labour market; they contribute to the national budget through taxes paid by income and consumption.
"The Roma must legally guarantee their right to quality education and guarantee the elimination of their low-quality and separate education," said L<0xC3><0xAD>via J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka.
She believes that the European Union's objective and action-oriented coherence are needed to speed up the process of school decentralisation immediately, and that the proper adherence to existing and planned anti-discrimination directives is essential.
"We must break the devilic circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment, we must give Roma children the opportunity given by the democratic space to contribute as a full-fledged citizen to the future of Europe," J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka said.
The European Summit on Equal Opportunities, which has been held every year since last year’s European Year of Equal Opportunities in Berlin, aims to provide a unique forum for equality of opportunity and distinction between the objectives of equality at European and national level.
CSU: grace for the transitional period
The fate of the Huber-Beckstein duo will be decided at the end of October
Despite the sluggish election failure, the heads have not yet fallen, so far the Bavarian CSU summits have paved the way for the discussion of personal issues.
President Erwin Huber and provincial head of government Günther Beckstein can still remain in place, questioning how long the grace will last.
The fate of the tandem, which has suffered a disastrous vote loss of 17 percent, will be decided by an extraordinary party congress on the last weekend of October.
In any case, the highly criticised couples felt that they did not stick to their chairs with all their might.
They tried to soothe the angry members of the faction and the base, who one day after the "Bavarian tsunami" demanded personal consequences because of the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - right, even under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber at the top of his career - the Christian Social Union gained 60.7 percent, but now, a year after a coup against Stoiber, it has only run to 43.4 percent of its strength.
For 46 years, the CSU has been a “single interpreter” in Bavaria, which accounts for 18 percent of Germany’s GDP.
Although conservatives continue to count highly in the southern region, which is key to the Hungarian economy, they will be forced into a coalition in the future.
As one of the first signs of the party’s reorganization, Vice-President Horst Seehofer and Federal Minister of Agriculture, who is the possible successor of Huber, will also take a place in the narrow exploratory team that organizes a slingshot along the right-wing values of the liberal FDP.
The strange fiction of fate is that Gabriele Pauli, whose action against Stoiber was used as a coup d’état by Huber-Beckstein, entered the list of Free Voters, and then was ruthlessly dismayed by the very concerned municipal politician.
The CSU leaders are now putting all their energy into stabilizing Beckstein somehow.
In the transition, he will also take an active role in the process, as Stoiber, who has drawn the threads from the background, has called 28 September the worst day of his political career, the former provincial prime minister and former CSU president.
Huber stopped some remarks to the CDU on Monday, saying they would have deserved much more support from the brother-in-law.
Other CSU politicians have interpreted defeat as a warning to CDU and Angela Merkel as well.
After the Bundestag election in September 2009, Merkel cannot be chancellor if the CSU, which plays a significant role in national success in 2005, is somehow not restored by a joint force.
Merkel, who has been very disappointed by the boy, said the CSU’s land loss would not have a negative impact on the Berlin Grand Coalition.
Which of course is relative: the injured CSU will not be easier to manage, and the crisis of the Social Democrats continues.
The SPD achieved its weakest result in Bavaria with 18.6 percent since 1946.
Lukasenko counterweight: 110-0
Not a single opposition MP has entered the Belarusian parliament following Sunday’s election.
According to Russian observers, this is due to the well-being and stability of the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, but according to the European Organisation for Security and Co-operation (OSCE) the irregularities in the counting of votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the elections.
Although the legislature of tens of millions of countries has been without opposition for many decades, the opposition leader of the United Democratic Forces (ODS) party, who joined yesterday's elections, was seriously hoping that the "controversial election" would not result in the "controversial election" of the 2006 constitutional amendment.
The ODSZ has thus refrained from the pre-balanced boycott.
Against the backdrop of opposition expectations, the fact that Belarus, increasingly economically dependent on Russia, has taken credit for the declining Russian natural gas imports, and has not contributed to the political conduits of the EU and to the conduits of the country.
Earlier, he pointed to the alleviation that when assessing the election campaign, the OSCE put emphasis on positive moves rather than deficiencies - for example, to prevent a third of opposition candidates from starting.
However, the OSCE press briefing on Monday has already objected to the campaign - during which the opposition candidates were essentially unable to appear in the press - and in particular the fact that the opposition could not be present at the counting of the votes.
Along with this, according to the opposition, there is a noticeable improvement in the political system: political prisoners have been released, and Minsk is ready for a minor confrontation with Moscow, continuing to deny the fact that the territory of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, which departs from Georgia, is under the jurisdiction of Feszhétia and Abkhazia.
"We have taken two steps forward, one backwards, but most importantly, the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun," Alexander Milinkevich said.
According to the opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election, it is desirable that this should remain, despite the fact that "the power is afraid to allow even one opposition to enter the weightless parliament".
The opposition is not planning protest actions in view of the results, but is trying to send a message to the voters about the need for economic reforms.
- With this, of course, we have a lot of problems, we have to print the opposition newspapers in Russia, the local authorities are putting up barriers to distribution, but I also see that more and more people are supporting the change that is right, it is also the most important achievement among the elderly. - said Milinkevich, referring to his father, Lukasenko
“Because of the country’s indebtedness, the increase in the trade deficit, the question of time is the breakdown of social security that is “causing the silence of the cemetery,” Milinkevich said.
In contrast to the opposition politician, Russian observers have deemed the elections democratic.
Sergei Lebegyev, the leader of the mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States, told the Russian news agency Ria Novosti: "people believe not in words, but in deeds", so the lack of opposition is nothing more than proof of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "Breakfast only before work time"
In the history of the Chigi Palace, rotary doors were installed in a unique way for the entry and exit of workers.
From today, this new measure will come into effect against shopkeepers, to filter out those who are blocking, and then go for a coffee during working hours.
The anti-solar novelty was presented today by the Minister of Administration Renato Brunetta and Mauro Masi, the Secretary General of the Prime Minister’s Office.
"The turntables," Brunetta said, "are for better and more efficient work, to reduce shortcomings and to increase services."
“There will be a new, more responsible and transparent period.
This is a real reform," Brunetta said.
The Chigi Palace completes the installation of all the buildings of the Council of Ministers.
According to Masi, "the installation of rotary gates is also important from a symbolic point of view".
There was no resistance on the part of the employees, the secretary-general confirmed: "The workers put the measure in place, everyone cooperated."
In a nutshell, breakfast is over, no more coffee and brio's.
Brunetta advises smiling: "A good little cappuccino at seven in the morning is capable of miracles"
the College of Public Administration of Rome
At the meeting, the minister said: "In three months, the shortages of workers in the public sector have decreased by 50 percent, which means that in a year, sixty thousand more people are going to work."
At the same time, he added that the Italian administration should be made more efficient.
"whose wage dynamics, according to the minister, have been twice as high in the last 8-10 years as in the private sector, and far exceeded the inflation rate."
At the same time, thousands of public servants gathered, joining an application supported by the Italian Association of Environmental and Consumer Protection Associations, to protest against the provisions of the Brunetta-like regulation.
“While the Minister of Public Administration boasts data to support the reduction of the shortages due to the disease, the number of ‘untiring sunflowers’ continues to grow,” the association writes.
"Thousands of honest and hard-working administrative staff from Italy have gathered to fight against the illegal provisions of the regulation."
The regional administrative court is charged, among other things, with the abolition of supplementary nutrition due to illness attributable to service reasons, the extension of the period of residence of workers on sick leave at home by means of several periods of residence, which may, in the course of another period of time and within the minimum period within which the period of stay may be filled.
Workplace accidents: Napolitano says prevention is more important than anything
There are 2,500 accidents at work every day in Italy, with 3 deaths and 27 with permanent disability.
According to the Workplace Accident Insurance Agency, there were nearly 1,200 deaths in the workplace in 2007.
The numbers testify to the seriousness of a phenomenon that is still one of the most common causes of death today, and that requires nearly twice as many victims as the killings.
Today, for the 58th time, Anmil is organising the Day of the Victims of Workplace Accidents, traditionally held on the second Sunday of October in all provinces of Italy, to draw the attention of institutions, social organisations and mass communication to this problem.
"The worrying data provided by Anmil, as well as the tragic events of the past few days, support the fact that prevention plays an important role in workplace accidents," said President of the Republic of Anmil, Giorgio Napolitano, in his address to Pietro Mercandelli.
The head of state sincerely praised the Union’s “persistent commitment to workplace prevention, the protection of the interests of workers who have suffered an accident, the assistance of the victims’ family members and the resilience of the public.”
“It is natural and genuinely shared by all to be outraged by tragedies of this kind, which, by their size, have aroused the interest of the media and the public, but in reality we have to face dramatic, repetitive cases every day.”
Napolitano openly admits: "We are undoubtedly struggling with a shortage of resources, funding of education and information is crucial.
Initiatives within the school are of paramount importance, aimed at direct educating young people on the threshold of entry into the world of work.
Our duty is to maintain interest in the phenomenon, not to allow attention to be drawn to the societal importance of the issue, and we need more effective legislation that needs to be enforced.
The president of the lower house, Gianfranco Fini, emphasized for his part, "how serious the accidents at work that result in death are of social significance to the conscience of all of us, and the institutions are required to end this as soon as possible".
"The data on workplace accidents show a slight improvement, but the number of such deaths is still astonishingly high," said Pietro Mercandelli, president of Anmil.
“We don’t want this downward trend to be accompanied by a downward trend, because the greatest tragedies happen when attention is lost.”
“We believe that at the general level, we are still not doing everything we can to overcome the phenomenon that could be solved through a complex programme of action.
In our view, stricter supervision and scrutiny would be needed, Mercandelli stressed, as well as more significant intervention in the field of labour training, starting with school education."
"Further efforts are also needed to inform and make the public more receptive," he added.
What would be most needed, however, is a more responsible employers' environment in the face of a phenomenon that poses a social problem."
Mercandelli then criticized "the gradual deterioration of the network of compensation for victims of workplace accidents" and the "help direction towards which the system has been drifting in recent years".
“The goal is to give workers back the security provided by the insurance, because the fate of those who suffer the accident cannot depend on where the legislators are arbitrary and where they are divisive.”
Mp3 Players May Cause Hearing Impairment
Persistent hearing loss can be caused by listening to portable playback devices for longer periods of time and at high volumes, such as MP3 devices.
In its report published in Brussels, the European Commission, the EU's Scientific Committee on New and Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR), said in a statement.
"The expert opinion shows that 5 to 10 percent of those who listen to their portable music player with a high volume for more than an hour per day for five years may suffer from permanent hearing loss," the statement said.
“It’s worrying that young people who use high-volume portable music players and mobile phones in bulk and occasionally are not aware that they can irreversibly damage their hearing,” Kuneva said.
"Scientific surveys indicate an undeniable risk to which we urgently need to respond," the EU Commissioner added.
The main task is to inform consumers and to disseminate information on a wide range of issues.
In the light of this expert opinion, we also need to review the existing control systems so that they can operate properly and keep up to date with the latest technologies."
Brussels invited the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem in view of the prevalence of portable music players and the increase in the number of young people exposed to the harassment caused by them.
"Researchers confirm that there is cause for concern, and the European Commission, in cooperation with the Member States and stakeholders, is ready to examine what measures could be taken for the sake of portable players and similar devices" is a member of the group of children who are exposed to the harassment caused by them.
The European safety standard currently in force specifies in 100 dB the maximum level of noise that can be emitted by portable music players, but there is growing concern about the data on hearing loss resulting from excessive use of such sound sources.
At the same time, there are solutions, such as reducing the level and duration of noise, which can significantly reduce these hearing damages.
In the opinion of the EU Scientific Committee, it is stated that in the case of users of portable players who listen to music in high volumes (more than 89 decibels) for five hours a week, the noise level exceeds the maximum level of noise in the workplace.
If a person listens to music for a longer period of time under similar conditions, after five years there is a risk of permanent hearing loss.
This affects about 5-10% of users of the portable device, which could amount to 2.5-10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Alemanno set up committee responsible for the future of the capital
It starts today, lasts until March, the results are expected in June.
This agenda was set up by the Metropolitan Municipality for the work of a committee called "The Future of the Capital of Rome", which met this morning at the new headquarters behind the Caracalla baths.
In the next six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will draft the Rome directives.
After the end of March, the study and plans will be evaluated in the General Assembly and in the Municipal Committee, so that the strategic plan of the capital, officially approved by the Municipal Government and Mayor Gianni Alemanno, can be submitted in June.
"This is a completely independent committee, in which all kinds of political, social and cultural ideas are represented, and it is the task of Alemanno to devise proposals for the ideas of Rome's development, to which you are entrusted by the political decision-makers.
We are not talking about any conflict of competence, we would only have wanted a platform where great plans can be made for the benefit of Rome.
In March, after completing its work, the committee will be split because it has a fixed-term mandate.
In June, we will present a strategic plan based on the work of a committee called "The Future of the Capital of Rome", the Mayor said.
To those who consider the Commission's work to be superfluous, Alemanno replied: "It all depends on what kind of work the Commission is going to do and what quality proposals it puts on the table.
If the standard proves to be adequate, as in France, as in the case of the Attali Committee, which I am sure of in the case of Rome, the contribution it has made will play an important role.
The power of politics is often disintegrated in the management of daily affairs and in the management of emergencies from time to time.
On the other hand, we, taking into account the far-reaching aspects, look further and plan for the longer term and are committed to the development and future of Rome.”
The mayor of Rome wishes to point out that "this Commission cannot be considered a useless 'head of water', as it is completely free, it will not cost Roman citizens a single euro, but serves as a thought-provoking tool and aims to involve the capital's best minds".
According to Alemanno, “there is a need for an open and flexible strategic framework that allows our city to take the leap of the quality it needs so much, thinking in a united spirit about its future.”
On the future, in which the mayor of Rome emphasizes: "it will be limited not only to the current municipal framework, but will look far further", not only as the future metropolitan and the capital of Europe, we can see in it what the status of the capital is, but also as "the capital of Europe".
The first anti-American president, we'll show you why.
A well-known, independent American politician wrote about it: “Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
He was the first Jimmy Carter to break up the American economy with his decisions and maintain close ties (as he does today as a private person) with hostile Islam.
As the timing of the elections approaches, the attacks on Obama are getting more intense.
A Miami woman wrote on the Internet: “This man is full of ambitions.
In a faceless way, Obama believes he can win the highest public dignity of a nation whose two governors and five senators have been black so far.”
These attacks are actually nothing; they are of a racist nature, of course, but they do not give an answer to the voters' question of whether he will be a good president. Then here are the public opinion polls: they indicate that Obama will win, with a significant advantage.
In this case, there is also someone who listens to his emotions and not his mind.
Inside the Southern States, a Mississippi newspaper wrote in a headline article: “We know very well that in the polling booth the real American patriot casts his vote.
A side of the American way of thinking appears here, which remained hidden until the last moment.
"Just say what you want and we'll know where we're going to put the twins, Obama or McCain."
There are those who swear that if Obama wins, they will leave the United States.
Such words have never been uttered until now, when the success of the black candidate is almost certain.
However, despite all these ingenuity, the winning weapon of the Democrats is George Bush himself.
1,500 people were asked what were the mistakes made during Bush’s tenure? 89 percent answered that Iraq.
America is changing.
This nation lost 50,000 soldiers in Vietnam, and it was hit in the ass by flying home.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers lost their lives and the Americans did not have to pack.
Most people believe that Iraq was Bush’s weak point.
It's a huge task for someone who takes George W.'s place.
USA: The economic collapse is already felt by journalists, and the time has come for restrictions in the editorial boards. Many blame the Internet for the "death" of the print press.
The PEW Research Institute asked five hundred American journalists what they think about the future of their profession and its intellectual power.
Well, almost every journalist right now is a pessimist about his own future.
However, they did not make it clear that their concerns about credibility had been reduced.
They don't feel as isolated as they used to.
The problem with American journalists is money.
They believe that the 2008 crisis is a failure of a weak economic model.
There are other serious problems for the newsroom, i.e. restrictions on the editors who make the newspaper.
“If we don’t want traditional journalism, in the sense that the general public understands it, to be reduced to a minimum, this problem needs to be solved,” the journalists asked.
Pessimism, which is clearly visible and complex today, is a characteristic of American journalism.
Sixty percent of journalists and top executives working in the print press are convinced that national journalism is on the wrong track.
At the local level, 65% of journalists are in the top leadership position.
Printed versus electronic press.
It is not difficult for the press to see where the world network is going.
The biggest publishers are paving the way for themselves to the Internet, which many consider to be the "killer" of the print press.
The “economic pressure” perceived by journalists has increased to 79 per cent.
The 500 interviewed journalists admitted that they were in favor of technology, in the hope that it might be in favor of journalism.
Today, in the American press era, there is a gap between editors, that is, directors, and journalists working for them.
At the national level, 56 per cent of leaders are confident that their journalists will share their information with others, while at the local level, this rate can only be reached at 23 per cent.
Some people associate this with the safe working environment.
At the national level, 47 percent of executives fear that they will lose their jobs within three years.
In the case of journalists, this rate is 30 percent.
In America, the issue of “safe work” is constantly on the agenda at the team level (for our editors, etc.).
Only 13% of journalists have a contract.
In a huge nation like the 300 million-strong United States, where thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio, television, and Internet service providers operate, employers usually offer as much as they want, so the thing works on a “must or shouldn’t” basis.
Directors usually get a high salary, and editors can earn tens of thousands of dollars a month, in addition to paying the pension and health insurance premium.
The principle of freedom, however, is quite complex: in the first year x day, in the third, too, until after a certain period of time it reaches a maximum of 15 days.
But U.S. journalists, according to their own admission, often "sicken" during the year.
It all depends on the climate.
UNIPOL: ROMANIAN BIROS: DANILO COPPOLA GROTTAFERRATABAN MARAD
Carmelo Rinaudo, the President of the Second Chamber of Criminal Justice of the Court of Rome, rejected the request of Danilo Coppola, who wanted to move from his residence in Grottaferrata to a Roman apartment.
Coppola is being investigated in the context of an investigation into the agreement on the exchange of shares between Unipol and BNL.
Last week, during the proceedings initiated against him, the house arrest was dismissed and it was turned into a residence ban on the Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, have requested that the real estate expert be allowed to move from the rural small town to the capital’s apartment.
However, according to the court, these incitements (for which the prosecutor had made a rejection proposal) would allow the company to influence its cases and to have access to the evidence brought against it.
The Elite Is in Danger
The phenomenon was felt a few days ago, when the House did not vote on the $700 billion bailout filed by the White House: a significant part of Americans were more interested and are still interested in the Wall Street punishment than the punishment.
This is also supported by yesterday’s New York Times, which informs that the current crisis has created a breakthrough within the Republican Party, which shows an increasing division between the traditional, restrained, world-wide, state-of-the-art, state-of-the-art institutions and business-of-the-party circles in Washington.
This direction was critically reflected in the House vote referred to in the introductory.
The above event, however, is just one of the significant changes that the economic reorganisation still taking place foreseen or foreseen, and not only in the United States, but throughout the Western world, perhaps even beyond that.
It seems that the crisis, also in the US and Europe, is only accelerating the phenomena that have been flawed for a long time, which are solidifying in this new atmosphere and are finally coming to light.
The first such phenomenon is the re-update, the return of the dual category of state sovereignty to public consciousness, a kind of re-establishment of the economy.
In fact, the crisis affects those banking and financial institutions, which, while maintaining close ties with the foreign country, are, in the first place and quite broadly, transporting people and families who live in a single country, in a single state.
This, however, represents a direct political difficulty for those in government: what to answer to the difficulties and protests of those people who are also by the way voters.
So the crisis seems to be world-wide in economic terms, but in political terms it is almost exclusively national.
It seems that political internationalism is essentially stranded off the coast: a clear proof of this is the European Union, which is not able to draw a uniform political line between different interests and different national strategies.
Thus, everyone expects from each national government intervention, the bailout, the resurgence and the new rules, but most importantly the opening of the funds: since in a situation of need, only the individual states have the means to make money for it.
They also have the tools and the power to use them: under certain circumstances, they have two invaluable resources that no other market and no international organisation is likely to ever have to this extent.
By the way, the new emphasis placed by the crisis on the nationality is in full agreement with the fact that recent economic growth attributes increasing importance to a factor that is closely linked to this element: this is territoriality.
Paradoxically, while we were convinced that we had already entered the network, into the abstract world of increasingly sophisticated technology, and we were convinced that the global financial world was destined to dominate the world as one of the most important things in the world, we had to realize that once we had no idea about it.
Things that can be transported from one side of the planet to the other, but are bound entirely to a confined place, to an area.
So then the one who dominates the area has far more punch cards than the one who was unfortunately born in a place where there is no harvest, no petroleum and no water.
In this way, I would also go back to the second novelty, which is a kind of broken line.
Whoever says territory, state, government, necessarily also says: politics, in other words, leadership.
From this point of view, it seems that the economic crisis is producing two conflicting phenomena:
On the one hand, the recognition of the objective that authentic leadership is needed, by people who can take control of events.
On the other hand, the current leadership, in particular, brings the total loss of credit to economic leaders, who have proved themselves completely unsuitable and proved that much is still ahead of them in the blurred area.
Together, the two have even deeper significance and, in a certain sense, more alarming: a sense of loss of credit, impatience, impotence and isolation that is affecting the entire ruling elite in more and more Western countries.
It seems, therefore, that the belief that the time of the social elite at the height of the world has come to an ever-increasing extent, is spreading among the population, that the time has passed, even before their deeds, their experiences, their ways of life, their ways of life, their ways of life.
In other words, the demand for leadership in a series of conglomerates, in the form of a covert conglomerates, is a multi-branch but strong delegitimization movement that feeds the ruling class against the traditional political system. This is a series of conglomerates in a series of conglomerates, in a series of conglomerates in a series of conglomerates, or in recent times in a series of conglomerates in a sudden change.
It seems that the traditional elite, with its parties, its programs, and even with its habits, its press and its famous intellectuals, together with its universality, understands less and less, and therefore it is less and less capable of representing it in its realm, in its realm, in its realm, in its time, in its Western society.
Nevertheless, it would be an exaggeration to speak frankly of “the insurrection of the masses on the threshold.”
But walking with an open eye doesn't hurt at all.
We can walk on the wall with super-strong glue
With the help of a super-powered adhesive to defeat gravity and walk on the wall as Spider-Man.
This goal has been set up by several U.S. research centres, and a group of four institutions is close to finding a solution.
With an adhesive piece of just 2.5 square centimeters, the researchers managed to glue a 100 kilogram body to a vertical wall and keep it there.
The American journal Science has published the findings of some researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the group of scientists was born from the further development of materials already existing, special, such as carbon nanotubes.
“The principle of adhesive operation should be imagined as a package of spaghetti-like tube systems,” says Zhong Lin Wang, a researcher at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Researchers have come up with the idea from the feet of the gecko covered with microscopic scarves, which provides perfect adhesion to the animal.
Tests with various materials, such as glass, teflon and sanding paper, have confirmed that the new adhesive is ten times more effective than the bases of the aforementioned pads, while at the same time "it easily breaks off the wall" - explains Liming Dai.
"This material can be useful as a temporary adhesive," adds Liming Dai.
We can walk on the wall, just like Spider-Man? Maybe so, but researchers think of a less impressive use than connecting electronic devices, because carbon nanotubes conduct heat and electricity well.
You can find more applications in space exploration.
The superheroes can wait.
MASIC CLEANING – The University of California at Berkeley is also experimenting with a new adhesive.
According to an article published in the journal American Chemical Society c., California scientists have introduced an adhesive made of hair-like microfibre material that undergoes self-cleaning during surface movement, thus always providing perfect adhesion.
Medications? Fruit juice is forbidden!
You should be careful with grapefruit, orange and apple.
These high-vitamin-containing drinks, especially popular in summer, when they are ingested with certain life-saving drugs into the body, alter their absorption, depending on the case, can also strengthen or reduce their effects.
David Bailey, a professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, drew attention to the risks associated with the use of canned or fresh fruit juices and certain medicines. At the American Chemical Society’s 236th National Meeting, he presented his report to his fellow professor at the University of Western Ontario.
Grapefruit has already been put on the defendants’ pad before, when it has been found to be capable of increasing the effects of some antibiotics, antihistamines, anxiety suppressants, heart rhythm regulators, and nerve agents to a degree that can be considered toxic.
MEDICINAL PRODUCTS - Two years ago, the Italian Pharmaceutical Institute itself published the news in its official press release, and also warned doctors and patients that they should take diazepam seriously, take it as a supplement, take it as a supplement, take it as a supplement, take it as a supplement.
GRAPEFRUIT - According to researchers, orange and apple malt also contain substances that inhibit the effectiveness of drugs.
A long list of active substances that are inhibited by the absorption of grapefruit and other fruit juices could be listed.
Michele Carruba, professor at the Department of Pharmaceuticals at the State University of Milan, said: "Discoveries of this kind are usually immediately reported to the various national and international pharmacological institutes of his or her own, who, if necessary, inform him or her.
Therefore, it is always necessary to read the package leaflet of the medicine you intend to take, and if something is not understandable, let us not let ourselves be influenced, but ask our doctor or pharmacist clearly," said the Ansa Institute specialist.
Paul Krugman Receives the Nobel Prize in Economics
The American Paul Krugman was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics, for his analysis of the territorial links between business models and economic activity.
The 55-year-old neokeynesian Krugman teaches at Princeton University and is a well-known reporter for the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the least critics of the Bush administration’s economic and foreign policy measures.
A few months after the September 2001 terrorist attack, when Enron went bankrupt, Krugman predicted in a headline article published in the New York Times that the latter event would have even more fatal consequences for U.S. history than the twins.
This forecast has provoked not a lot of debate, it has been pointed to the eyes of the economist on several occasions, but we know today that it was accurate.
“I’m surprised and a bit shocked at how quickly public interest has gone beyond the scandalous collapse of Enron or Worldcom,” Krugman said in a statement.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, a member of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a “greatly valuable economist,” while at the same time “spreading his criticism of the Bush administration’s excessive liberalism in a rather aggressive manner.”
Open Office, third edition worth the "anti-Microsoft" package
Today, OpenOffice.org 3.0 is a personal productivity-enhancing, open-source suite of applications that is aimed at expanding layers, from home to office users, from freelancers to administration, as a free alternative to Microsoft Office.
After almost a year of work carried out by SUN Microsystem and volunteer developers, the new Open Office brings more innovations to the general public: it is a welcome screen and a redesigned version of the system.In addition to the new version, it is also a new version of the system.
Special attention has been paid to compatibility with Office 2007, so Open Office can also open Microsoft documents with the new extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting is the specific feature of some modules, such as the one that allows you to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations. This can be useful when sending files via email. Another feature supports importing PDF files into a graphical module, keeping the page layout.
You can also create "hybrid PDF" documents on this interface, which combines the typical Adobe format with table manager or text editor elements.
Sharing within applications has also gone through a number of improvements: the spreadsheet manager supports the sharing of workbooks, but prevents overwriting of each other’s work. Each employee’s post can be labeled with a different color. This is the checkout process.
Some companies are already working on making some of the features of OpenOffice available on the Internet (on the cloud), so the final version is likely to be released in the coming weeks.
The Italian version can be downloaded from http://en.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html after it has been available in English on the mirror pages since Friday.
The program package is also available for Linux in addition to the usual Windows and Mac OS operating systems.
On request, we can download the installation CD either at home or at our workplace.
When it comes to the spread of the home app, free will probably be the biggest attraction, but the Open Office program package is now trying to kick your ass in the business sector, as you can count on a number of administrative and school projects.
There is no shortage of ideal education, consultancy and service services for small and medium-sized enterprises, which can open up new business prospects.
Open Office consists of five basic modules: Writer, Word-compliant text editor; Calc, table manager for replacing Excel; Impress, PowerPoint presentations; Dbase is similar to the most well-known, Access database manager; and finally Draw the graphical module.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads. But if we consider that with the release of the new version we are already at 3,600,000, this number is likely to be higher than expected.
Kohl's result is positive, it's already the fourth doping case
At the final stage of the Tour de France, one of the participants, Bernhard Kohl, who competed in the colours of the Gerolsteiner team, once again produced a positive pattern, who also won the best mountaineering shirt in addition to the bronzer.
The news is the day light seen on the website of the Internet newspaper Equipe.
The 26-year-old Kohl is the fourth driver to be named after Italian Riccardo Ricc<0xC3><0xB2> and Leonardo Piepol, as well as German Gerolsteiner driver Stefan Schumacher, who has produced a positive result on the Cera test for the third generation version of the EPO.
Kohl’s blood samples, like tests carried out in recent weeks, were examined by the labs in Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the control tests also confirm the positive Cera result, the Austrian will lose third place and, according to the regulations, will be banned from the competition for two years.
The positive result of Kohl’s third-generation EPO test was confirmed by Pierre Bordry, head of the French Anti-Doping Agency, and told the Associated Press news agency: The positive doping result was reported by the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrians managed to get behind Spanish Carlos Sastre and American Cadel Evans and also won the best mountaineering t-shirt.
BEV<0xC3><0x81>NDOROL<0xC3><0x8D>K: THE NEW YORK TIMES FEATURES IS THE QUESTION, IS THE ITALY RESPONSIBLE?
It has only recently turned from Italy’s emigrant country into one of the favorite destinations of the defiantly accepted immigrants.
This question is being raised by the New York Times, which starts with the case of Abdul William Guibre, a young man in Burkina Faso, who was murdered last month in Milan, because he stole a box of biscuits in his suit.
The case is well characterized by what the New York Times calls the "paradox of the North": in the northern regions, the "strongest is integration and the highest is employment" at the same time, the "immigrant resistance and the support of the Northern League" is also the strongest in the country.
To support the escalating tension between Italians and immigrants, the NYT also cited cases in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Oh, yes.
The new laws demanded by the League, which would tighten the lawn on immigration and facilitate the expulsion of illegal immigrants, have been set as an example of the mood change taking place in Italy.
The Pope and the President of the Republic also emphasize this tendency: "Giorgio Napolitano XVI met with Benedetto at the Quirinale Palace and urged the State and the Church to work together to defeat racism."
Students suffer from expensive rental fees, it can cost up to 900 euros per room
The crisis does not affect the market for housing leased to university students.
According to the most recent survey by the Renters’ Association, Sunia, a student can pay up to 900 euros for a single room in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples and 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has now taken such astonishing dimensions that - due to the substantial total costs incurred by the families - a wide range of students will be excluded from the possibility of learning," explains Laura Mariani, head of the study department of Sunia, in an interview with the professor of the university.
In most cases, real estate offers also contain a number of irregularities: unregistered, non-rent-restricted contracts, linked rent.
According to Sunia, an emergency measure would be needed which would allow the revision of the taxation system to maximise prices.
The details of the survey show that in Milan, near Brianza, a bed is also requested for 450 euros; the price of a single room is from 650 euros (in the vicinity of Bande Nere) to an average of 800 euros (in the vicinity of Lambiate, Udine and Fiera).
In Florence, a bed costs an average of 350/400 euros, and a room costs about 700.
In Bologna, where the majority of students live in the vicinity of the university, a bed costs <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>250/280 for doubles and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>370-500 for single rooms.
In Rome, in areas close to central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna) about 600 euros are requested for a single bed and 450 euros for a double bed.
Somewhat cheaper (550 euros for a single room) are the prices in the vicinity of other universities (Ostiense and Cinecitt<0xC3><0xA0>).
In suburban districts you can save a lot: it costs 300 euros for a bed and 450 euros for a single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and other similar districts.
In Naples, a bed costs 300/450 euros, a room costs 400 to 600 euros, the highest in the price ranges of Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari, you have to pay 250/350 euros for a bed and at least 350 euros for a single room.
In smaller cities, prices are lower in absolute terms, but they represent a greater weight within the city’s budget.
In cities such as Perugia, where students from outside the EU are often looking for accommodation, there is another disorder: the rental fee applied for by foreign students is about 25-30% higher than for Italian tenants.
Goodbye good old Cinema Paradiso, in the cities sacrificed the time of the old cinemas
Traditional cinemas are closed in favor of multiplexes.
“A city where there is no cinema, a blind city, is like a face without eyes.”
The pictures taken by director Giuseppe Tornatore effectively show everything that is happening in Italian cities, but also in rural regions.
The demolition of cinemas – the appearance of large multi-purpose cinemas in the suburbs, and consequently the demolition of multi-dimensional cinemas in the city centres – is an inevitable and irreversible process, but at the same time it bears all the characteristics of a true cultural crime itself.
"It's like a friend of ours is leaving, a friend with whom we have shared our journey and a lot of experiences," says the director of Cinema Paradiso. The film, which was released twenty years ago, will be a tribute to the Oscars, as well as to the Cannes Film Festival.
The largest association of operators, the data provided by Anec, speaks clearly: in the last five years 316 traditional cinemas have been closed. The biggest losses were recorded in cinemas in the major cities in Pal<0xC3><0xB3>ly in R<0xC3><0xB3>logo 5 and in Bopo in R<0xC3><0xB3>logo, 10 cinemas in R<0xC3><0xB3>logo 5, Toen<0xC3><0xB3> 9, Florence.
The most affected regions are Emilia-Romagna, which has lost 82 cinemas, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
And the fact that it is precisely the multiplexes that have disappeared proves nothing more than that Italy has the highest number of newly opened multi-storey cinemas in these three regions: in the last five years, the number of rooms has increased by 195 and in the last five years, the number of rooms in Lombardy has increased by 81.
"The number of units in Italy has increased irrationally," says Paolo Protti, president of Anec. "It's okay to build new facilities, but the survival of existing ones should also be ensured, because when an urban cinema closes, not all those who are willing to enter multi.
Not to mention the unfinished financial funds to support operators: the state’s expiry debt could amount to around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>10 million.
From an ethical and moral point of view, it is shameful that the government does not comply with the laws in force.
It would require <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>16-18 million a year to maintain the market."
It is the first Italian city to decide, in its concern over the closures, to remedy the problem by means of an agreement between the municipality and the Anec, in order to protect and promote cinemas in the out- and downtown areas.
The provisions would include the tax benefits granted to operators and the benefits granted to the public to facilitate accessibility: viewers can park in restricted areas and in certain parking lots at a discounted rate.
"I like this initiative," says Giuseppe Tornatore, "and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna, even with the introduction of other measures.
But it is also certain that traditional cinemas, in order to be able to engage the fight with the domination of multiplexes, need to improve the sound and image quality, because today’s audience is much more demanding.
The preservation of traditional cinema has always been an important issue for me: the closure of Supercinema in Bagheria – where I spent my childhood and adolescence – gave me the spark that eventually led me to make Cinema Paradiso, even though I had been thinking about it for 10 years.
I have been living in Rome for 25 years, so when I go to the Via Nazionale in front of the closed Rialto or Quirinale, not to see dust-blacked posters, I would rather turn my head.
Tight threads between politics and 'trangheta, arrested mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro supported the interests of the Piromalli clan in the municipal decisions".
The judges of the Anti-Mafia Directorate of Calabria have made serious accusations against the mayor and deputy mayor of Gioia Tauro, Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, as well as the mayor of Rosarno, Carlo Martelli, who was arrested this morning in the presence of a criminal case.
Gioacchino Piromalli, a senior intermediary between the clan and the administration, and a nephew of the same name, a lawyer with the same name as the boss, who had previously been convicted of involvement in a mafia-like crime, was also arrested.
“The absence of any legal and moral rule, what’s more, a good taste,” the prosecutors write. The two local municipalities expressed Abbey’s intention to pay an advisory fee to Piromalli’s lawyer.
"So the clan would have had an official entrance to the town hall, which would have given additional opportunities to control and control the administration, which can be said to be significant by the way.
Agazio Loiero, the president of the general assembly of the Calabrian region, does not hide that there is "numerous clashes between local institutions and the organized underworld" in the region: there are areas where the spread of the mafia is stronger than elsewhere where the clash is almost avoided.
Many local politicians, however, are resisting the pressure of the ‘drangheta, they are the heroes who remain pure.’
The arrests this morning are a continuation of the July events, when the police also announced that they had succeeded in completing the Piromalli clan.
At the end of April, local politicians were relieved of their mandate to administer the municipality. The municipal commission of Gioia Tauro was disbanded in 1991, even when it was due to alleged mergers between organized crime and the local government.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, the Christian Democratic mayor at the time of the dissolution, took the lead in the second round of 2006.
He shouted outrage when the County House ordered the dissolution of the municipal commission.
The court cited the then deputy interior minister Marco Minninit and accused him of designing everything for political purposes, but the court in an arrest warrant signed this morning stated that he had dared to follow the Piramalli clan to the A3 project.
The hearing ordered against Dal Torrion, the prosecutors write, reveals that "it was willing to meet the demands of a large group of entrepreneurs who are known to be close to the Piromalli family, the decisions of the local government being made by the clan."
The energy comes from the waves, and now the big ones come.
An inexhaustible source of energy that accounts for 70 percent of the planet’s surface and is only now discovered by large international energy companies.
Waves, sea currents, lightning bolts, all renewable energy sources that have been spotted by giants like the Chevron, who are now trying to get their hands on.
For hundreds of years now, they've been researching the possibility of how to extract energy from the motions of the sea, and in the 1970s, during the first oil crisis, research was on the rise.
Around 1980, when the price of petroleum fell, the idea of utilising marine energy was dismissed, but today the demands of environmental protection and the re-increase in the price of petroleum are giving the sector a new impetus.
The World Energy Council in London (WEC) estimates that 15 percent of the world’s electricity needs could be covered by facilities that use waves from the seas.
That’s twice the amount that nuclear power plants are currently producing.
In addition, there would still be streams and streams.
The giants are in decline.
Enersis was the first company to commit itself to marine energy and signed an agreement in 2005 on a power plant to be established in northern Portugal.
It seemed like a revolutionary step when the signature was announced.
Two years have passed since then, and more and more companies have voiced their support for marine energy, including those who have been committed to traditional energy so far.
“Chevron is studying technologies that utilise ocean energy and is considering cooperating with us,” said a spokesperson for the Wall Street Journal, one of the U.S. oil giants.
The cooperation in question relates to the acquisition of the licence required to launch the Alaska project for the utilisation of marine energy issued by the U.S. Energy Committee.
This is not a small matter, especially considering the fact that the United States is currently producing oil in Alaska, and President Bush has also recently launched a plan for further drilling.
In addition to Chevron, Verdant Power Inc. in New York and Ocean Power in New Jersey are also on the path of energy from the sea. The amounts invested so far, as far as details can be known, are evidence of increasing interest.
The technology is waiting for development.
Experts say that this is still an initial technology, just because the energy from the sea does not dispel doubts about the environmental impact.
The facilities that currently exist, such as those of Portugal or Scotland, are all small and therefore do not cause too many problems in terms of the ecosystem.
However, in order to be able to produce energy on a larger scale, there is a need for facilities that also have a greater environmental impact.
There are several options available: for example, Ocean Power uses an interconnected boiler system.
The shocks caused by the waves and moving the boobs upwards are converted into hydraulic pressure by the pistons and cylinders placed inside them.
The pressure rotates a turbine, which feeds a generator.
Electrical power is supplied by cables under the sea to land.
At the same time, there are four facilities of a similar nature in the design phase, which are only waiting for federal approval. Some of the energy produced would be used in a military facility.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, has already started energy production for a shopping mall and a parking lot with six underwater turbines located in the East River, New York.
When the water moves in a stream, it rotates the blades of the turbines, and this rotational movement feeds the generator.
Verdant has announced that it has a long list of partners who are only waiting for permissions needed to use the energy.
After the waves, it's a stream.
At present, differentiated attention is being paid to the opportunities that can be exploited through the waterway.
Although this is a periodic phenomenon, the trend is more predictable than the wind, the sun, or the waves, so it can be considered a more reliable source of energy.
New York, Maine and Alaska, as well as the rest of the coastal states, spent $7.5 million in 2008, precisely to exploit the energy supplied by the pipeline. This amount is expected to increase to 35 million in 2009.
