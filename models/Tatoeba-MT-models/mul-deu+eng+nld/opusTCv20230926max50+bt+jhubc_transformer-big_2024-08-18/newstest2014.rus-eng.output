In Kineshma and the area, two men killed themselves.
Previously, one of the hanged had already committed suicide attempt.
On October 30, about 1-00, in the village of Lugove at his place of residence, a 1947-born man committed suicide by hanging.
He is known to have attempted suicide in the past.
What prompted the man to take such a step is unknown.
On October 31, at 11-50, at the place of residence, he died by hanging a 41-year-old man, a resident of Kineshma.
Signs of violent death have not been detected, reports the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs "Kineshemsky".
Do you have a black box in your car?
While U.S. road designers are trying to find money to repair a dismantling highway system, many begin to see the solution in a small black box neatly mounted on the dashboard of your car.
These devices, which track every mile driven by a motorist and pass this information on to officials, are at the center of a controversial attempt to modernize America’s outdated highway financing system undertaken by the planned authorities of Washington and the state.
Usually, the boring arena of highway planning unexpectedly sparked intense debates and colorful alliances.
The libertarians joined the environmental groups in lobbying for the government’s right to use small boxes to track the number of miles you travel and perhaps even where you travel them – and then use that information when creating tax accounts.
The tea drink movement is in shock.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also deeply concerned and raises a number of privacy issues.
And while Congress cannot yet agree on whether to continue or not, several states are not going to wait.
They’re thinking about how, over the next decade, we can move on to a system where drivers pay for every mile of road they travel.
Thousands of motorists have already tested these black boxes, some of which have a satellite tracking function.
This is really necessary for our country.
“This is not the issue on which we may have the right to choose,” said Hasan Ihrata, executive director of the Southern California Government Association, which is preparing plans to begin tracking the state’s mileage of every California motorist by 2025.
There will be changes in how we pay these taxes.
The technology for that already exists.
The need for this is exacerbated by the lack of funds from the Government Road Construction Fund, which is financed by taxes that Americans pay on gas stations.
Americans don’t buy as much gasoline as they used to.
Cars travel more than a mile per gallon.
The federal tax, 18.4 cents per gallon, has not risen for 20 years.
Politicians do not want to raise the tax even by one cent at high prices for gasoline.
“It’s simply impossible to save a tax on gasoline,” said Lee Mannich, an expert on transportation policy at the University of Minnesota.
In his state, 500 tracking devices were recently installed on cars to test the system of incorrect payment.
“This will be the best alternative in the long term,” he said.
Zanudas call this an incorrect user fee.
It is not surprising that this idea attracts urban liberals, because with the help of taxes it will be possible to change the nature of travel to reduce road congestion and greenhouse gas emissions, for example.
Planned bodies in California are monitoring this system in the course of developing strategies to achieve the targets set by the state’s ambitious laws to combat global warming.
However, House of Representatives member Bill Shuster (Republican, Pennsylvania), chairman of the House Transportation Committee, said he also viewed the system as the most viable long-term alternative.
Free-market advocates at the Reason Foundation are also thrilled that they will make drivers pay for every mile.
“It’s not just a tax that will go into the black hole,” said Adrian Moore, Vice President of Political Affairs, Reason.
People are paying directly for what they get.
The move is also supported by two former U.S. transport ministers, who in 2011 called on Congress to move towards mispayment.
The U.S. Senate approved last year a $90 million pilot project that would involve around 10,000 cars.
However, the House of Representatives rejected the proposal due to concerns from rural legislators representing voters who often have to travel many miles in everyday life to get to work or to the city.
Several states and cities, however, are on their own.
The state of Oregon, where 5,000 drivers are attracted to participate in the largest experiment in the country, is the most enthusiastic.
These drivers will soon pay the state for mileage instead of a gasoline tax.
In Nevada, the pilot project has already been completed.
In New York, it is considered.
Illinois is testing it on a limited basis with the participation of trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes the transport departments of 17 East Coast states (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Florida), is exploring how they will be able to make these changes.
This concept has not been universally recognized.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteer cars were recently equipped with these devices, drivers were concerned that the government could track every step of the way.
“The concern about the ‘big brother’ and things like that is a big problem,” said Alauddin Khan, who heads strategy and efficiency management issues at the Nevada Department of Transportation.
That was not what people wanted.
When the tests went full-time, the U.S. Civil Liberties Union branch in Nevada warned on its website: “It will be easy to turn these devices into full-scale surveillance devices.”
There is no need to create a huge, bulky technological infrastructure that will inevitably expand to store records of the daily movements of individual citizens.
Nevada is one of only a handful of states where a difficult search for inexpensive technology is underway that would allow state authorities to count the miles driven by a car, but without information about the location and time.
If you can do that, Han said, society will feel more at ease.
Searches for this technology have led some state agencies to a small young company in California called True Mileage.
Initially, this company was not engaged in assistance in collecting state taxes.
It sought to enter the developing market of car insurance, in which drivers pay on the basis of the run.
But the devices it is testing attract road designers because they do not use GPS and provide a limited amount of information that is periodically loaded using the modem.
“People will be more inclined to do this if you don’t track their speed and track their location,” said Ryan Morrison, CEO of True Mileage.
There have been a few big mistakes in some of these state pilot programs.
There are far less expensive and less intrusive ways to do this.
In Oregon, designers are experimenting with providing drivers with a variety of options.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
Or they can completely give up the device, deciding instead to pay a fixed fee based on the average number of miles traveled by all the residents of the state.
Elsewhere, they hope to sell the idea to a vigilant public, forcing devices to do more, not less.
In New York, transport officials are aiming to develop a taxable device that will also accept payment for parking bills, provide “pay as you drive” insurance, and collect a pool of speed data from a real-time demand from other drivers that cars.
“Automobilists will be attracted to the participation of the benefits that will be offered to them,” – says in the document of urban design.
Some transport system designers, however, are thinking about whether not all conversations about incorrect payment are simply a huge distraction.
In the San Francisco Bay Area City Transportation Commission, officials say the congress could very easily overcome the bankruptcy of the Trust Fund for the Construction of Highways by raising taxes on gasoline.
An additional one-time or annual tax could be levied on hybrid car drivers and other persons whose vehicles do not use a lot of gasoline to make them pay their fair share.
“There’s no need for radical surgical intervention when all you have to do is take aspirin,” said Randy Rantschler, director of the Legislation and Public Relations Commission.
If we do this, hundreds of millions of drivers will worry about their privacy and a lot of other things.
EU prepares measures to support Ukraine in case of economic pressure from Russia
The European Union has a backup plan to provide Ukraine with gas, as well as to reach an agreement with the IMF on emergency credit if Russia takes any action in response to a possible signing of the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement at the Vilnius Summit.
The IMF is negotiating a stand-by loan, and another EU official, who is directly involved in the negotiations, added that their goal is to conclude an agreement in the near future.
In addition to a potential loan from the IMF, Ukraine could receive 610 million euros from the European Union itself.
Analysts interviewed by Reuters doubt that Ukraine and the IMF are able to overcome long-standing disagreements about funding terms.
He does not believe in the possibility of reforms needed to get help, and the international rating agency S&P, which lowered on Friday the sovereign rating of Ukraine by one step - to "B-" with "B".
However, EU representatives say that the IMF can show flexibility in terms of lending, taking into account the circumstances of Ukraine.
In addition to the country’s financial support plan, the EU has a spare option to provide Ukraine with gas, the bulk of which supplies are now coming from Russia.
Perhaps it will be gas from the North Stream or reverse from Slovakia.
The latter, according to officials, is the most possible and acceptable way in case Russia “isolates” Ukraine.
Analysts believe that such a method of reversible deliveries to Ukraine can be used only for a few weeks, and will likely lead to a decrease in deliveries to other regions.
“EU countries and Ukrainians are negotiating how to create favorable conditions so that Ukraine can import gas from other sources, not from Russia, or from the same source, but on other routes,” the source added.
Russia out of the fight for pollution of cities by cars
Attempts to solve the transport problems of major cities have been observed in most of the world’s metropolises since the second half of the 20th century.
As a rule, it was either about their reorganization and extension of the highways, or about attempts to reduce the demand for road trips, the number of cars and their time of use.
A well-known example is Singapore, where a strict quotation of the growth of the number of private cars has been introduced, and the right to purchase them is purchased at auctions.
Its price can be two to three times the price of the car itself.
European cities, including London, have introduced a fee for entering the city centre.
In Germany, for example, in Hamburg and Stuttgart, so-called green zones are introduced, where entry is allowed only for cars with a certain eco-class, also using high-quality fuel (including biofuel or electric cars).
Beijing’s Environmental Protection Agency, for example, approved in 2012 a “five-year clean air plan” totalling about 250 billion yuan (about $40 billion).
As told by the Director of the Department of Transport Pollution Control of the Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau of Beijing Li Kunsheng, the main goal of the five-year period is to reduce the number of air pollutants by 20-35% by 2017, the number of non-private vehicles to increase.
According to the agency, currently, road transport in Beijing is responsible for 22.5% of the total air pollution.
Among the main measures of the program is the restriction of the use of road transport, as well as the introduction of additional taxes for car owners.
Among other things, the urban transport measures of the so-called "green five-year" so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called-called so-called so-called-called so-called so-called-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called-called-called so-called-called-called so-called-called-called so-called-called-called so-called-called-called-called-called-called-called so-called-called-called-called-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-the-called-called-called so-called so-called-called so-the-called-called-called so-called-called-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called-called-called-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-
Among the years of automobile innovations of the year of the year of the Beijing also includes a ban for all private cars to travel within the fifth transport ring (in total in the capital of the PRC of them six) one day a week (the corresponding information is contained in the registration number of the vehicle, and also the issue of registration marks for the car.
According to the current state program “Environmental Protection 2012-2020”, the number of cities with high and very high air pollution should be reduced to 128 (in 2012 there were 138).
According to the Ministry of Nature, in 2011, “moving sources” accounted for 41% of all emissions of pollutants into the atmosphere of cities.
In Moscow, for example, emissions from cars are ten times higher than industrial ones, and in St. Petersburg - nine times.
Russia is only beginning to think about the possibilities of restrictive regulation of cars on the streets of cities.
Mikhail Blinkin, Director of the Institute of Transport Economics and Transport Policy, believes that administrative and fiscal measures aimed at suppressing the demand for road trips are unpopular, they can only be adopted by society if they are fully universal.
In the case of Moscow, there is a unique problem related to the structure of its fleet, where there are two clusters of weakly sensitive to any regulatory effects - service and personal cars, as well as cars of the "privileged" pair of cars, the total number of which is about 5%.
In the days, urban planners from the ECOM center in St. Petersburg prepared a study, which analyzes the balance of urban areas between residential construction, road coverage area and the number of road transport.
The main conclusions of the researchers: the city center is provided with roads twice as much as required, and most motorists living in the center do not use cars every day, leaving them for a long time in the parking lot or just in the streets.
As a result, it is proposed not to build parking spaces, but the storage of cars, not to expand, but to reduce the passage part (so that the streets become more pedestrian-friendly), as well as to limit the use and placement of the districts of personal transport in the vicinity of the territory of the protection zone of the historical center).
Penalties for unauthorised street trade in Vologda will increase at times
According to the city authorities, the increase in the size of the fines will help to put order in Vologda and free the streets from natural tents and trays.
Most street vendors do not pay taxes, the products they sell are often not subject to appropriate sanitary checks.
This means that the health of the wetlands is at risk.
Thus, the lower limit of the fine for citizens for unauthorized trade from November will increase six times - from 500 rubles to 3000 rubles, the press service of the Vologda Administration reports.
Goldman Sachs warns of risks to Russian economy
Goldman Sachs warned of the growing risks to the main driver of fragile economic growth in Russia - consumption.
This is primarily the crisis of non-payments on unsecured consumer loans and mass reductions in workers.
Our main concern right now is not that growth has slowed down, but rather the structure of that growth.
Lately, it is entirely due to consumption, which will almost not reduce turnover," said Goldman Sachs chief economist Clemens Grafe, presenting yesterday's quarterly report of the investment bank on the Russian economy.
The nominal wage growth in Russia is now about 10%.
With inflation at 6%, it will be able to provide future consumer demand at around the current level, Goldman Sachs expects.
But the profitability of Russian companies is declining, so they are likely to optimise personnel costs.
Today we see a significant increase in the share of wages in GDP: if wages grow by 10%, then GDP - by only 2%, - Mr. Grafe explained.
The companies are facing a reduction in profitability.
If it does not grow, it can lead to layoffs and unemployment growth.
Russian business can not raise salaries, says chief economist Barclays Capital on Russia and the CIS Vladimir Pantyushin.
Unemployment near historical lows, competition for workers is high.
In order to lure employees from the side or keep current ones, employers have to raise wages.
Consumption in Russia support is alive and very fast growth in consumer lending.
According to Mr. Graf, because of the extremely high rates on consumer loans, this type of lending does not have a multiplier effect on the economy of the country.
“We have not seen any benefits for the economy from the growth of consumer lending, money does not diverge across the economy, but returns to the same banks in the form of interest payments,” the economist said.
But the problem is another - Goldman Sachs expects a growth in the delay on unsecured loans.
They are mostly taken by the poor, who have nothing to provide for.
Interest rates on such loans are high.
As a result, they are often not returned," said Mr. Grafe.
Therefore, the second threat to the growth of the economy in Russia is a possible crisis of non-payments on unsecured loans.
Vasily Solodkov, director of the BSE Banking Institute, is already seeing signs of a growing banking crisis.
Small credit organizations, not having access to cheap resources such as the state banks, were forced to attract the funds of the population at high rates.
In response, the state banks went on the path of war and began to reduce credit rates, - continues the economist.
Small credit institutions cannot issue loans at the same rates, otherwise they will have a negative interest margin.
If the state banks do not give up dumping, Russia is in danger of a full-fledged banking crisis, believes Vasily Solodkov.
The deprivation of licenses of a number of banks in recent weeks, the economist considers a forerunner of a mass collapse.
“The state banks themselves will not be able to cope with this situation: the deposit insurance system was not originally designed for a systemic crisis,” warns the head of the institute.
But the growth of consumption will slow and without a crisis of non-payments, the investment bank believes, - due to the refusal to index the salaries of civil servants and military, laid down in the current version of the draft budget.
In part, the impact on consumption will be mitigated by freezing tariffs on natural monopolies (and, as a result, a decrease in inflation).
But only partially: if the investment does not grow (and there is no prerequisite for this yet - see the reference), consumption growth will still slow down, Goldman Sachs is confident.
Vladimir Pantyushin of Barclays Capital does not yet see the prerequisites for implementing pessimistic scenarios.
“The main risk is still falling oil prices,” he said.
According to him, Russia’s economy will begin to decline at oil prices below $90/bar.
Goldman Sachs also noted that the central bank is not yet in a position to reduce interest rates in the economy.
There is a paradoxical picture: inflation has fallen and banks have started to raise rates.
This may mean that they didn’t believe the central bank that announced the transition to targeting inflation,” Clemens Grafe said.
The Central Bank’s interest rate policy on market rates does not affect, it only affects interbank lending rates.
“For the Central Bank, this is a breakdown of all hopes,” Clemens Grafe said.
The money received at the Central Bank’s auctions is not used by banks to lend the economy, but to manage their liquidity.
As soon as the rate decreases, the exchange rate immediately changes, this means that the funds are trying to escape speculation against the ruble.
“Sooner or later, the Central Bank will understand that this strategy is not working,” Grafe said, recalling that the state plans to let the ruble into “free swimming” by the end of 2015.
But it will have to do so sooner or raise the central bank’s key rate (5.5%), he believes.
According to his estimation, the rate of the ruble is now artificially exceeded by 10%.
The ruble only one way - to weaken, - concludes the expert.
But if the central bank falls into the financiers at least a shadow of doubt that the liquidation of the currency corridor is not part of the policy of weakening the ruble, it can crush the ruble much more strongly.
In Chelyabinsk there was the 2nd Congress of the peoples of the Southern Urals.
The forum is dedicated to the Day of National Unity, the 400th anniversary of the restoration of Russian statehood and the 20th anniversary of the adoption of the Constitution of Russia.
The congress was attended by delegations from all cities and regions of the region, representatives of national cultural associations, religious denominations, legislative and executive bodies - a total of about 350 people.
The course of the forum is aimed at strengthening international consensus.
We can set an example here, not only to other regions, but also to other countries.
There are no differences and disagreements.
We live in complete mutual understanding,” says Theophan, Metropolitan of Chelyabinsk and Zlatoustovsky.
A number of issues were discussed during the meeting, including the upbringing of patriotism, cultural cooperation.
At the end of the session, a resolution was adopted.
The unofficial part of the forum continued in the theatre of opera and ballet.
Here an exhibition of national and cultural associations of the Chelyabinsk region was opened.
Snowden is ready to "cooperate" with Germany on the issue of U.S. intelligence
Edward Snowden, the U.S. intelligence official, said he was ready to go to Berlin to testify to the German parliament if the U.S. National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander could not answer questions about his activities.
German MP Hans-Christian Ströbele met with Mr Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he was granted asylum to discuss his country's testimony in Germany.
In a letter from Mr. Snowden, a member of parliament presented to the media in Berlin on Friday, it said: “While the result of my efforts was clearly positive, my government continues to treat dissent as treason and seeks to criminalize political statements by non-criminal charges.”
But telling the truth is not a crime.
Mr Snowden said in a letter that he believed that the support of the international community could convince the U.S. government to abandon criminal charges against him.
The charges filed by the U.S. Department of Justice include espionage and theft of state property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, Germany’s interior minister, told Zeit Online: “If Mr. Snowden is ready to talk to German officials, we will find ways to make it possible.”
Relations between the U.S. and Germany have become strained after allegations that the NSA was listening to Chancellor Angela Merkel’s phone.
Thomas Opperman, an MP who heads the parliamentary group curating the intelligence service, said that if there is an opportunity to listen to Snowden as a witness, “without putting him at risk and without destroying relations with the United States completely,” it should be used.
Mr. Ströbel, a member of parliament from the Green Party of Germany, published his photo with Mr. Snowden on his Twitter.
During his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr. Ströbele said that, according to the lawyer of the former NSA contractor, Mr. Snowden would not be able to return to Russia if he left.
If Mr. Snowden had given testimony in Germany, he would need assurances that he would be there “safely,” the deputy said.
Mr Snowden said in his letter that he faced a “hard and persistent” persecution campaign that forced him to leave his home.
However, he said he was inspired by the world’s reaction to “his political statements.”
Citizens around the world, as well as high-ranking officials — including in the United States — have seen the revelation of an uncontrolled system of all-pervasive surveillance useful to society.
The letter contains a proposal to cooperate with the German authorities “when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation will be resolved”.
Frontier Airlines to charge for manual depot
Frontier Airlines plans to charge passengers up to $100 for carrying a hand luggage on board their flight.
Frontier Airlines plans to start charging up to $100 for manual deposit and $2 for coffee or gas, though their announcement on Wednesday announced that passengers will be able to leave the entire bank.
The new hand luggage charge applies to the bags in the top luggage compartments, so the small bags placed under the seat will remain free of charge.
Frontier said it would charge $25 if the fee was paid in advance, and $100 if travelers would pay only after boarding.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said the $100 fee should make passengers take care of the payment in advance.
“We don’t want to pay for it,” she said.
The airlines began charging for the first and second bags delivered to their luggage in 2008.
Passengers trying to avoid these charges fill as much as they can in a hand luggage compartment placed in the upper luggage compartments, which is often the reason why there is not enough space in these compartments.
Fees are one way to make passengers spend less on board.
O'Malley said this new collection wasn't really about making money.
The fact is that Frontier’s most loyal customers say that finding a place in the top luggage compartments is getting harder and harder.
Passengers who purchase tickets on the airline’s website will not have to pay.
This means that one passenger in the queue at the departure of the Frontier flight can get the opportunity to carry the bag for free, while the next passenger in the queue can pay $100 for the same bag.
O’Malley said the change of procedures on the Frontier website and check-in counters is meant to ensure that passengers will be aware of the pick-up before they reach the boarding exit.
The new Frontier manual loading charge will not start charging until the summer, although the date has not yet been set.
Passengers often complain about baggage charges and other charges, but the airlines love them.
They claim that the handling of luggage costs money, and passengers who need this service, have to pay for it.
Many on Wall Street consider the addition of baggage charges to be a sign that airlines charge enough money to cover the cost of flights after several years of losses.
However, most of them did not concern the fees for manual storage.
Spirit Airlines Inc. introduced the first manual loading charge three years ago, and another Allegiant Air discounter later followed suit.
The only other airline with such a charge is Hungarian Wizz Air, said airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely monitors the additional charges.
According to his estimation in a December 2011 report, the hand-holding fee brings Spirit $50 million a year.
Sorensen, a former top manager at Midwest Airlines, recently flew the Spirit flight, and he was curious what he would find at the boarding pass when passengers encounter an unusual collection of Spirit for hand luggage.
“The landing process was the smoothest of all I’ve seen in my airline career,” he said.
I was expecting to see a tooth decay and a fight on the way out on the landing.
The plane was full, he said, “and the landing was fast.”
Frontier also follows Spirit in relation to a $2 fee for coffee, tea, soda or juice.
Frontier said that passengers who receive a gas stove or juice can leave the entire bank and that a portion of the coffee will be provided free of charge.
She'll still be giving away the water for free.
US Airways had been trying to charge for drinks for a short period of time in 2008, but abandoned it seven months after passengers started complaining and no other major airline followed suit.
Frontier’s winter pay-for-hand luggage initiative, when passengers don’t buy tickets directly from the airline, is its latest move to attract customers to its website.
Airlines pay online ticket vendors, such as Orbitz, between $10 and $25 for each ticket sold.
This gave all airlines a stimulus to encourage passengers to buy tickets directly from them, rather than contacting an online travel agency.
However, Frontier went further than anyone else in this area.
In September, she began giving twice as many bonus miles as a frequent-flying passenger to customers who bought tickets through an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, she cut the premium mileage to 25 percent of the mileage.
For example, a 1,000-mile trip with Frontier, purchased from an online travel agency, would allow you to get 250 miles.
In addition, passengers can choose a seat in advance only if they buy tickets directly on the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base in its hometown of Denver, but its business is shrinking and becoming a loser.
Revenue fell by 9 percent, and flight opportunities fell by almost 13 percent in the first quarter, according to financial results published on Wednesday by the parent company Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
The Republic is trying to fix Frontier's finances as part of the airline's sale.
The NSA blames “internal error”, not hackers in stopping the site
The covert National Security Agency said on Friday evening that the cessation of their site for several hours caused a technical failure, not hackers, as the network claimed.
“NSA.gov was inaccessible for several hours tonight due to an internal error that occurred during the planned update,” the intelligence agency said in an official email.
The problem will be solved tonight.
Statements that a failure in the work was caused by a distributed attack such as a "default in service" [DDoS] are incorrect.
Earlier this evening, online server monitoring systems registered that the NSA website was not working for at least six hours, and the site is still unavailable to some users.
A NSA spokesperson told ABC News that the agency’s internal secret network was “not at all” hacked.
No confidential information is in jeopardy, the representative said.
At least one online group of hackers said it was responsible for decommissioning the NSA website through a DDoS attack.
DDoS attacks are designed to overwhelm the target site with traffic until the servers are overloaded and the site goes offline.
Hacker tactics are relatively simple, and attacks are not designed to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
Previously, the super-secret NSA, once nicknamed “No such Agency”, has been in the center of public attention and fierce criticism after a series of revelations about its extensive surveillance programs by the Sovjets, and files by the Sovjets, all are a reaction to the Sovjets.
The growing controversy around the agency has sparked speculation that today’s incident was the result of targeted hacking.
Bombardier's profits are falling with drop in deliveries and number of aircraft orders
Bombardier, a Canadian manufacturer of aircraft and trains, said on Thursday it had cut net profits by 15 percent due to a decrease in orders and deliveries of aircraft in the third quarter and problems with contracts in its rail division.
Montreal-based Bombardier has also not published any data on the flight tests of its latest CSeries aircraft and has not provided new information on whether ambitious plans to put the aircraft into commercial operation will be implemented by the next quarter.
After the first flight of an experimental sample of the aircraft, which took place about a month and a half ago, it flew only three more times, which raises questions about whether the stage of testing is on schedule.
The results did not justify the forecasts and led to a fall in stocks of more than 8 percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at National Bank Financial, lowered his valuation on Thursday from “higher-middle-market” to “medium-market” due to the belief that stock growth is limited to the next quarter or two.
“Although the decline in the number of aircraft deliveries was generally predictable, we are certainly disappointed by the revenues of the transport department,” Doerksen said in a stock market review.
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries as the flight test program continues.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we assume that the market will become more skeptical of the program.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries family of aircraft will allow it to take a place in the lower price segment of the market, where Boeing and Airbus now dominate.
The first experimental sample of the aircraft was introduced in March and made its first flight in September after several months of delay.
However, the firm orders on the CSeries are not yet too many — 177, as potential buyers are waiting for the results of flight tests to check the company’s claims about fuel efficiency and potential economy of the new liner.
There are currently 403 orders and agreements with 15 customers and operators.
Chief Executive Officer Pierre Bodouan was confident that Bombardier would achieve its goal of 300 firm orders by the time the first aircraft was put into commercial operation.
On Thursday, the leaders also assured analysts and the media that the program is moving forward as planned.
“The test model of the aircraft did not stay on the ground longer than expected,” Bodouan said during a telephone conference, adding that ground tests and software updates were planned during the aircraft’s downtime.
All manufacturers plan the tests in a different way.
We decided to make the first flight and pause for updates, so we did.
This will be the case throughout the flight test program.
The second of the five test specimens is scheduled to fly in the coming weeks and all the rest will soon follow, the company said.
Still, analysts are skeptical of the statement that the first customer will be able to start operating the CSeries aircraft 12 months after its first flight.
Bombardier said it is assessing the timeline for commissioning and will provide new information in the next few months.
“This slow pace of flight tests – albeit, apparently, and in line with Bombardier’s internal schedule – reinforces our view that commissioning will be postponed to the first quarter of 2015,” Doerksen said.
In the third quarter ending September 30, Bombardier’s net income fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, from $172 million, or 9 cents per share, last year.
Adjusted earnings per share remained the same – 9 cents.
Gross income decreased slightly from $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion.
Analysts expected a profit of 10 cents per share and a gross income of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world’s fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer said it delivered 45 aircraft per quarter, down from 57 in the previous year.
The total number of orders dropped from 83 to 26 aircraft.
The aerospace division’s order portfolio stood at $32.9 billion on September 30, unchanged from December 31.
“In the aerospace field, the results were in line with our goals, but the small number of incoming orders and the overall market conditions have become an unpleasant factor,” Boduan said.
The gross revenue in the aerospace direction fell by 13 percent – to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world’s largest train maker, said the sector’s gross revenue grew by almost 11 percent to $2.1 billion.
The portfolio of orders in the transport division amounted to $32.6 billion as of September 30, which is slightly higher than December 31.
The revenues of the transport unit were negatively affected by the problems with the execution of several major contracts.
The management said that a new development plan would be presented in the fourth quarter.
Bombardier’s shares, which also announced that Google’s chief financial officer, Patrick Pichett, would join the board of directors, fell 8.5 percent to $4.83 on Thursday’s auctions.
Brazil’s Embraer SA, the world’s third-largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and its closest competitor, Bombardier, said on Thursday it had cut quarterly revenue by 10 percent.
Sony Expects Lower Annual Profits
The Japanese electronics maker, Sony, finished the quarter with a net loss of 19.3 billion yen, or $197 million, reduced the forecast relative to profit for the current fiscal year.
Sony’s results for the period from July to September 2013 were more daunting than expected due to the drop in demand for televisions, video cameras and personal computers produced by the Japanese corporation.
Sony’s television business, which in the second quarter brought the company its first operating profit of 5.2 billion yen in three years, fell again to 9.3 billion yen in operating losses in the reporting period.
The Japanese consumer electronics market is going through difficult times, especially because of the decline in demand for televisions.
And while competitors are looking for a way out of a difficult situation, Sony continues to focus on the consumer segment.
For example, one of Sony’s main rivals, Panasonic, has recently shifted the focus to industrial components: here the company’s sales are growing at a high rate, especially due to automotive systems and environmentally friendly technologies.
As a result, by the end of the fiscal year, which will end in March 2014, Sony expects to receive 179 billion yen operating profit versus the previously expected 230 billion yen.
At the same time, according to Thomson Reuters, analysts predicted that the figure would be significantly higher and would be 221 billion yen.
Trying to get out of the crisis, Sony is expanding its product range.
In the middle of this month was announced the start of sales of "smart" watches from the Japanese corporation, endowed with a number of fashion features that will allow you to get rid of the need for 100 times a day to get out of the pocket of the smartphone.
After Sony lowered its annual earnings and earnings forecast, the company’s shares lost more than 11% in the early morning of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, falling to 1,668 yen per share.
The speech gene proved to be a stimulator of synapses formation
Scientists at Johns Hopkins University and the Mount Sinai Medical School have discovered a protein that allows Foxp2 to perform its function by stimulating the formation of new connections between neurons.
The study is published in Science, on the website of the journal you can read its short content.
The Foxp2 gene is the first known gene whose function is directly related to speech.
Its role was established in 2001 thanks to the discovery of a family of several people who could not pronounce words correctly and sometimes did not even understand each other.
The researchers found that members of the family had disrupted the work of the Foxp2 gene, but how it performs its function remained unknown.
In a new study, biologists have shown that at least part of its functions Foxp2 performs as a stimulant for the formation of new synapses in the brain area associated with speech formation.
This is done through another gene, SRPX2.
The latter was discovered as a result of the search for factors that stimulate the formation of synapses.
SRPX2 has been one of 10 similar genes found by the authors, with only Foxp2 vying for its activity.
The fact that SRPX2 really affects vocalization, the scientists confirmed in an experiment on mice.
When the animals were artificially reduced in gene activity, they cried less when separated from the mother.
If the activity of the gene was restored, the frequency of the sounds emitted was also restored.
Previously, the mice were also shown to be associated with the vocalization of Foxp2 itself.
Animals that were given a human copy of the gene ate more actively and at a lower frequency than normal mice.
To date, however, scientists do not know whether Foxp2’s work and, accordingly, its managed SRPX2 are linked to purely “mechanical” sound-forming properties or thinner processes.
A cocaine-addicted lawyer who warned the head of a criminal group about a police investigation was jailed.
42-year-old Basharat Ditta handed over information to criminal authority Nile Scarborough
The lawyer feared that his secret drug addiction would be unraveled.
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Royal Court of Liverpool.
A prestigious lawyer, who told a drug addict about a major police investigation because he was afraid of revealing his secret drug addiction, was jailed for three years.
The 42-year-old Basharat Ditta handed over secret information to the criminal authority to Neil Scarborough about his illegal drug trafficking investigations after he was under threat because of his cocaine addiction.
The lawyer, nicknamed Bash and named among the perpetrators a “crude lawyer,” was arrested at his home in 2011 after a police operation to track down Scarboro, whom he had previously represented in a drug-related court.
Officers noticed how 32-year-old Scarborough left three bags of cocaine at a lawyer’s home in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was at a bar dinner with colleagues.
The investigation revealed that Ditta “regularly used” a class A drug after tests showed traces of cocaine in his hair, wallet, and credit cards.
For eight months from January to August 2011, he attempted to illegally obtain information about the arrests of two people on Scarborough’s behalf, as well as one of his accomplices.
All four suspects were under police surveillance at the time as part of a large-scale investigation into the activities of the criminal heroin and cocaine trafficking organization in Lancashire, Cambria, Mercisaide, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
They and 32 others were later jailed after police seized heroin and cocaine in a series of <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million and more than <0xC2><0xA3>200,000 in cash.
The 42-year-old Ditta passed on information to criminals for fear that his cocaine addiction would be revealed.
Today in the Liverpool Royal Court, Ditta, who works for the law firm Forbes Solicitors, located in Blackburn, was covered with shame after admitting his guilt in two cases of intentional obstruction of justice following the results of a three-week trial in Lidvern.
He admitted to the cocaine storage at one of the previous court hearings.
The lawyer’s disclosure came after police investigating Scarborough’s activities found that he had been talking to Ditta on the phone regularly since February 2011.
Two detectives tracked down the suspect and discovered how he approached Ditt’s home in Blackburn and placed 60 percent pure drugs in a black golf glove under a lawyer’s trash can.
Shortly after the transfer, Scarborough repeatedly called with Ditta, who was at a dinner at the Iwood Park football stadium of the Blackburn Rovers team.
The lawyer returned home for the drugs; there were nine conversations between them.
The court found that Ditta had "regularly used" cocaine after tests found traces of the Class A drug in his hair, wallet, and on his credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested, but denied cocaine use, said he had spoken to the suspected dealer because he was his client, and insisted that their communication was a “lawyer’s secret.”
During his detention, Diett took his wallet and tried to extract several credit cards, but all of them were confiscated, and he also had a hair sample taken.
When questioned by the police, he said that along with the workplace, he also had a home office, and clients came to him home on legal matters.
However, the court learned that after important arrests, he called the largest participants in the illicit drug trade, a number of which he had previously represented in the court to tell them what the detectives know about them.
In her indictment, Ann White said, “If anyone knows that you shouldn’t break the law, it’s a criminal lawyer.”
Mr. Ditta is accused of misusing his position as a lawyer in criminal matters because he has entered into too close a relationship with certain clients.
The contact we’re talking about isn’t just a drug dealer, it’s a drug dealer who supplies his own lawyer with drugs.
Some of his conversations will certainly prove legitimate, as he was their lawyer.
However, this has largely crossed the boundaries of the usual relationship between a lawyer and a client.
He prevented the police investigation as much as possible in order to allow these individuals to continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta did not respect his profession, but disgraced it.
He was too close to certain clients, in particular Scarborough, and allowed himself to doubt his lack of interest.
Dietta did not admit guilt and stated: “If I were a corrupt lawyer who I am not and would like to pass on the information to Mr. Scarborough, I would not have waited 15 hours, I would have done it immediately.”
But after the meeting, senior officer Lee Holstead of Lancashire Police said, “Mr. Ditta turned from a criminal lawyer into a criminal criminal as soon as he began to acquire drugs from representatives of organized crime.”
His addiction to cocaine has made him hopelessly compromised and vulnerable to the goals of the main members of criminal groups, which have entrusted him with obtaining valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers must adhere to the highest standards of professional ethics and inspire trust and confidence in society.
Mr. Ditta betrayed this trust and tried to cover up his profession.
The investigation into Mr. Ditt led the Lancashire Division on a particularly dangerous organized crime, which has already been handed down to him on three cases of cocaine storage, and now on the prevention of pre-trial detention, demonstrating our aspirations.
Let this case serve as a warning to criminals that no one is out of reach of the law.
We will find you and bring you to justice.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years after pleading guilty to conspiracy to supply heroin, cocaine and marijuana.
A further 35 people involved in the fraud were sentenced to 153 years in prison for drug-related crimes.
On his website, Dietta organized a conversation in the form of questions and answers, in which he says that the work of his dream is a lawyer representing clients with the death penalty in America, the ideal companion for him at dinner - Mohammed Ali, and motivation at work - is inequality.
The stadium in Yaroslavl is not ready to welcome 22,000 spectators, police officers who were present today at the meeting of the CCC of the Russian Federation.
The ticketing program is, in their opinion, about twice as high.
During the 1/16 final of the Cup of Russia with Spartacus, only a thousand stewards were involved at the norm of nine thousand.
Spartakov fans had 2,200 seats, i.e. 10 percent of the capacity of the stadium, however, in agreement with the Moscow club, they sold 5,000 tickets.
This data was announced by the head of the CCC, Arthur Grigoryants.
U.S. Listens to Japanese Senior Officials
On Friday, November 1, one of the representatives of the U.S. intelligence services, who preferred not to disclose his name, said that the United States was listening to the phone calls of high-ranking Japanese officials.
This man confirmed that in the land of the rising sun there are several points intended for listening.
At the same time, he noted that the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, New Zealand do not conduct intelligence activities against each other.
According to him, this happened during the Second World War, when these countries were allies.
But Japan, like Germany, despite allied relations with the Americans in the post-war period, are objects of intelligence activity, NHK TV reported.
Officially, none of the parties has yet commented on this information.
We will remind, news of the US intelligence surveillance of the Chancellor of Germany appeared last week.
According to German journalists, the NSA has been able to listen to Merkel’s phone for the past ten years.
The chancellor herself, according to some data, received the news of her audition very painfully.
She stated that, in her opinion, Germany and the United States have been allies for decades, such an observation of the head of government is unacceptable.
Meanwhile, Edward Snowden said he was ready to share details of Angela Merkel's phone conversations with officials of the German prosecutor's office.
The German flew specifically to Moscow to meet with a former CIA employee.
Bashkiria may put grain on sale not before the beginning of 2014
Bashkiria in the course of state procurement interventions can put grain on the market not before the beginning of 2014, according to the Minister of Agriculture of the Republic Nikolai Kovalenko.
To date, market prices are such that they do not stimulate sales to the intervention fund.
While the price in the market is higher, there is demand.
"Maybe the grain will be put on the market after the New Year," he said at a press conference yesterday.
The Minister recalled that in the current year, the crop crop yields for 2013 amounted to 3.1 million hectares, including the area of cereals - 1.7 million hectares, which is 3.3% more than last year.
Under the 2014 harvest planted 550,000 hectares (per 105,000 hectares more than in 2012).
Increased areas for winter wheat and triticale, the harvest remained at the same level.
In the bases of the Ministry of Internal Affairs there is no group "Brotherhood", to which in the United States was attributed Leps
In the databases of Russian military personnel of the group "Brother Circle", to which Washington attributed the singer Gregory Leps, does not mean.
As noted by Interfax in the law enforcement authorities of the Russian Federation, after reports appeared in the media about the inclusion of Gregory Leps in the checklists on suspicion of belonging to the Eurasian criminal syndicate "Brotherhood", all were verified.
The dissemination of this information contributes to the support of the myth of the so-called “Russian mafia”, which allegedly operates abroad, is believed in the power structures.
"Even in the very name, 'The Brotherhood', there is some element of mystery, there is a hint of a secret lodge.
"It's all very much like a pier-share," the agency's spokesperson said.
On October 31, the U.S. Ministry of Finance announced the inclusion in its checklists on suspicion of belonging to the Eurasian criminal syndicate "Brother Circle" Arthur Badalyan, Grigory Lepsveridze, Vadim Lyalina, Sergey Moskalenko, and Yakova Rbalyan.
The persons on this list are suspected of links with some Vladislav Leontiev and Gafor Rahimov, who are considered influential members of criminal groups and have been on the U.S. sanctions lists since February 2012.
According to U.S. authorities, Gregory Leps "will serve as a courier for the delivery of money on behalf of Vladislav Leontiev".
In the production center of Gregory Leps refused to comment on the US accusations against the singer, calling them "false".
In 2011, U.S. President Barack Obama referred to the Brotherhood Syndicate as “significant transnational organized criminal groups” and instructed the MINFIN to “stimulate and prohibit their global criminal operations.”
The blacklisting of a person by the U.S. Treasury means blocking his assets in the U.S. and banning him from doing business with people living in the U.S.
The scandalous video went to the police.
The head of Toronto, Rob Ford, known for his scandalous and frankly ruthless outings, got caught on a crack smoking.
Police in the Canadian city said they had a video footage and were ready to begin an investigation into the mayor.
He said he would not leave his post, CNN reported.
The information that the authorities have evidence of drug use by Rob Ford has appeared on the Toronto Police website.
The head of local law enforcement, Bill Blair, held a press conference on the matter.
The sheriff said he is not authorized to share the data with the public, but he is responsible for their existence.
According to Blar, Rob Ford’s compromising video was discovered during an anti-drug raid conducted by law enforcement in the summer of 2013.
Earlier, the Canadian press had written about the existence of the video, but until recently there was no confirmation.
The mayor himself does not comment on the matter.
He just says he's not guilty of anything and he's not going to resign.
The video found by the police is one of the evidence in the case of a 35-year-old friend of Ford, Alexander Lisi, who is accused of trafficking in light drugs, extortion, illegal income, as well as criminal conspiracy.
Sometimes Lissy served as Rob Ford's driver.
Residents of the city have long demanded the resignation of their mayor.
He has repeatedly fought with journalists, appeared in public in a drunken way, allowed himself racist and sexist statements.
OJSC "Rostovaeroinvest" has recognized the German company Assmann Beraten <0x2B> Planen as the winner of the tender for the selection of the object's engineer.
The amount of the contract in "Rostovaeroinveste" is not disclosed.
According to the press service of OAO, nine Russian and foreign companies participated in the competition, under the terms of the tender, the project should be prepared and sent to the state examination in the spring of 2014.
The winner is to design a new passenger terminal of the airport, as well as infrastructure facilities, internal roads and elements of the improvement of the airport complex.
In the first stage of construction, the internal area of the terminal will be 50 thousand square meters, in the future it is possible to increase it.
According to “Rostovaeroinvest”, the project documentation will take into account the prospects of the development of the airport complex: by 2025, the terminal will be able to serve about 5 million passengers, and by 2035 - 6 million passengers.
At the time of the conclusion of the tender, the architectural concept of the aerospace complex "South" was defined, which was developed by the British company Twelve Architects.
The project of the building of the main terminal embodies the idea of an air bridge between Rostov-on-Don and other cities of the world.
Assmann Beraten <0x2B> Planen has experience in the implementation of major projects, the company has designed terminals C and E "Sheremetyevo International Airport" and a new aerodrome complex at the international airport "Knevichi" in Vladivostok.
The international airport complex "South" will be built in the Aksay district of Rostov region and will replace the current growth of the airport, which will be closed and in the future integrated into the urban development.
The start of construction of the aerospace complex is planned for 2014, the introduction of all facilities - for 2017.
A Turkish politician has declared a hunger strike against a wall on the border with Syria.
In mid-October, authorities began construction of a partition wall in the area of the city of Nusaibin in southeastern Turkey.
Local residents and representatives of the PMD pro-Kurdish party strongly opposed the construction.
The mayor of the Turkish-Syrian border city of Nusaibin Aishe Gekhan has declared a famine, protesting against the construction of a partition wall on the Turkish-Syrian border, RIA Novosti reported in the press service of the Party of Peace and Democracy.
The police have repeatedly accelerated the protests.
Turkish Foreign Minister Muammar Güler first denied the construction, then said the wall was being built to ensure border security.
"The mayor of Nusaibina, Ayshe Gekhan, a member of the PMD, declared a famine, thus turning his protest against the construction of the wall into a deadly struggle," the party said in a statement.
The mayor of the city believes that the construction of the wall is meant to isolate the Kurdish population of the two countries from each other, the Kurds have crossed this border freely for half a century.
“This is an inhumane situation with which the Kurds will never agree,” Aishe Hekhan, the party’s representatives, said in a statement.
According to the press service, on November 7, a rally against the construction of the partition wall is planned in Nusaibin.
Venezuela to set a foreign exchange rate for tourists
Venezuela will introduce a special exchange rate for its national currency - the bolivar - against the dollar for tourists.
This was reported on November 1 by Bloomberg with reference to the government decree.
Foreign travelers will be allowed to exchange amounts equivalent to tens of thousands of U.S. dollars in a year.
Venezuela will also allow tourists to sell up to 25 percent of the bolivars purchased in the country at the time of departure.
The specific rate of the bolivar against the dollar will be established later.
In February, Caracas was forced to devalue the local currency to 6.3 bolivar per dollar.
In the black market, however, one dollar is valued at 57 bolivars.
Since the beginning of the year, Bolivar has lost almost 70 percent of its value.
In September, inflation in Venezuela was close to 50 percent.
The Minister of Petroleum Industry and Vice President of Economy Rafael Ramirez said on October 18 that Venezuela has no plans to devalue the bolivar.
According to unofficial information brought by the agency, Caracas may still decide to lower the rate of the national currency after the municipal elections in December.
The policy of restraining prices for consumer products and commodities, as well as the high degree of regulation of the Venezuelan economy, has led to a shortage of a number of commodities and the functioning of the black currency market.
In the spring of this year, the media wrote that there was a shortage of toilet paper in Venezuela.
Yugra director Andrey Belmach noted that it is still difficult to say how long it will take to find a new head coach.
This post became vacant after the resignation of Sergei Shepelev.
The resignation took place just a few hours ago, so to say how much time it will take to find a new coach, I am not ready, - quotes Itar-TASS.
Maybe a day.
Maybe a month.
We are studying all possible options.
Priority will be given to the Russian specialist.
I don’t just want to find a coach, but a person who will work in our club for several years and achieve certain results with him.
Kenyan press outraged by provocative media law
“This is a terrible place, and there are grounds for the question: what can prevent Parliament from destroying the independence of the judiciary in the future?” the newspaper said, calling the law unconstitutional.
“This law is very strict and punishable, and we reject it,” said Cyrus Kamau, managing director of Capital Group, the parent company of CapitalFM, which includes one of Kenya’s most respected independent radio stations and news site.
He said the new media judiciary “will always be biased as it is a continuation of the government,” and restrictions on content and advertising would hurt Kenya’s position in the global economy.
“I hope the president will listen to us and we are asking him to reject this bill and return it to the deputies,” he said.
According to The Star newspaper, the new law will essentially allow the government to “take the media to a dead end,” and The Standard reported that democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya “have received a serious blow” and criticized the bill as “draconian.”
The adoption of the bill is part of measures taken to strengthen national security following the September attack by Muslim terrorists at the Westgate shopping mall.
Kenyan media has angered authorities by broadcasting surveillance camera footage where troops sent to the attack site are allegedly looting an expensive shopping mall.
Police chief David Kimayo’s response was to call two journalists and a media official for questioning, although the call was cancelled after mass media protests.
Under the new law, publishers can be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings, and individual journalists – up to one million with the additional risk of being “excluded from the lists”, i.e. to get a ban on obtaining official journalistic accreditation.
The court also has the right to confiscate the property of the infringer if the fine is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, “even one fine is enough to paralyze the work of most FM radio stations.”
She also said that these measures could have a devastating effect on Kenya’s so-called “enlivened blogosphere.”
Politicians understand that by making the media silent, they will be able to do whatever they think is impunity.
“No one will ever know,” wrote Nation journalist Mutuma Matthew, describing Kenyan media as a key source of restraint and balancing forces in public life.
“The politicians themselves will destroy the country and bring us back to hunting and gathering,” he wrote.
Kenyan lawmakers have been targets of public anger in the past.
In May, they voted to cancel the cuts appointed by the National Commission on Salaries, and to restore the size of their huge salary of about 532,000 shillings a month, tax-free, one of the highest in the world.
In the municipal payments of the Voronezhs will appear a new line of expenses - deductions for the capital repair of the house.
According to the most approximate calculations for a standard one-bedroom apartment from the new year will have to pay from 100 to 400 rubles per month.
The exact norm will be determined by the government of the region.
But when you paint the entrance, put the staircases in order or even replace the elevator - the residents will decide themselves.
Such a law was approved by the deputies of the regional duma.
Vladimir Klyuchnikov, the chairman of the Voronezh Regional Duma, noted: "In this case, too, it is necessary to order - to establish the order of the renovation of houses, to accumulate funds not in the management companies - which will be the headquarters of the states that will often register in Moscow, then in Orenburg.
Under the control of the state, the construction of shares is now also under control.
The law that protects against scammers is approved by the defamation in the final reading.
The document was not born in an empty place.
In our region, 4,500 people have been harmed by dishonest developers.
Most of the problems have been solved.
By the way, the new law prescribes rights and obligations for all participants in the construction of shares.
Vladimir Klyuchnikov, chairman of the Voronezh Regional Duma, said: "It is no secret that in this area, too, abuses have begun, related to the fact that in the 98th year the same dealers got the same, and in the 2000s the same dealers."
People started making money on this to cover the gap, including adopting these two laws.
Under Voronezh, it was decided to build a temporary residence center for foreign citizens subject to deportation.
The regional parliament passed such a law not only under the pressure of the federation.
Problems related to illegal migrants in the region at least get rid of.
So, last year, a little more than 100,000 foreigners came to the immigration account.
But only one in five has issued an official work permit.
Where the others work and whether they pay taxes is a big question.
Vladimir Klyuchnikov, chairman of the Voronezh Regional Duma, said: "They have violated the legislation, but they are not criminals."
There is no court, and they must be deported - they must be contained somewhere.
This decision was taken by the federation that, at the expense of regional funds, such places should be equipped.
In Voronezh region such a place is defined as Old Olshank of Semiluk district.
Well, and finally, the regional parliament has granted new benefits to many-child parents.
First of all, families raising 5 or more children are exempted from transportation tax.
The budget in this case loses 3.5 million - but as much is saved by the parents of many children.
Secondly, and this is important, those who adopt three or more children will be granted housing subsidies from the new year.
For each member of the family, the new law provides for 18 square meters, at a price of 30,000 per meter.
A family, for example, of 6 people - father, mother, born child and 3rd - adopted.
For them, according to the norms, the state acquires housing with an area of 108 square meters - for 3 million 300 thousand rubles.
For the left bank or the South-West micro-district - quite an acceptable option.
Well, in the district center for this amount you can already buy an entire cottage.
Baumgertner Nominated to Uralkali Board of Directors

The goalkeeper of "Neftchemistry" Matt Dalton refused to comment on the departure of Vladimir Krikunov from the post of mentor of the Nizhnekamts.
Golkiper believes that head coach Dmitry Balmin enjoys great authority from the players and will cope with his responsibilities.
Recall, today the "Neftechemist" sent to resign Crikunov.
To be honest, I would not like to comment on the dismissal of Vladimir Krikunov, - quotes Dalton RIA "Novosti".
I can only say that Dmitry Balmin will be able to cope with the obligations placed on him - I have no doubt about that.
In the team he enjoys great authority, this young specialist definitely expects a great future.
Juventus defender Leonardo Bonucci will not help the team in the next match of the Italian championship with Parma.
As reported by Football Italia, the coaching staff decided not to include him in the application for the game to keep ahead of the 4th round of the group round of the Champions League with Real.
They will also not take part in the match with "Parma" Lichtsteiner, Vucinic and Pepe.
And the forward Fabio Kvaljarella recovered after the injury and is ready to play.
The fuel will be driven by a tax maneuver that envisages an increase in the crude oil extraction tax (NPR) at the same time as a reduction in export duties and an increase in excise duties.
According to experts, these measures could bring an additional 619.3 billion rubles into the budget.

U.S. Secretary of State: Secret Service sometimes "walked too far" in data collection
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry admitted that when collecting data and interceptions, U.S. intelligence agencies sometimes "came too far," however, the politician noted that the information that appeared in the media about the interception of 70 million people did not correspond to reality.
I assure you that innocent people were not hurt in this process, but the attempt to gather information was.
Yes, in some cases it went too far and was illegitimate.
I recognize this, as the president acknowledges ... and we will make sure that this does not happen in the future,” the AFP secretary of state said.
Italian workers with internships are stepping down the road for young people
Unemployment in Italy hits record highs.
The data released on Wednesday showed that 12.5% of the country’s residents are now without work.
Things have not been so bad since the Second World War.
Among young people, this figure is several times higher.
40.4% of residents between the ages of 15 and 24 are unemployed.
According to the Italian authorities, one of the solutions to this problem is early retirement of older workers.
This experiment is already being carried out by the country’s largest energy company, and the adopted laws allow regional authorities to provide part of the early pension for workers with internships.
However, on the other hand, Italy is waiting for the common problem of the aging population for Europe.
And economists aren’t sure that a premature rotation of staff will justify itself.
What will lead to the construction of the TPU in Moscow
With each year, the capital authorities promise to arrange more and more transport and transit nodes (TPUs).
By 2020, it is planned to put in place 255 TPUs.
What the project is really turning around, our correspondent understood.
A couple of months ago at the metro "Smolenskaya" Arbat-Pokrovskaya line there was a construction fence.
The inscription stated that the installation of the transport and relocation node is underway.
All this was very strange, because next to Smolensk no ground transport stops and therefore it is not possible to relocate to it.
To get to the nearest trolleybus stop on the Garden Ring, it is necessary to cross about 130 meters, including the land crossing through Karmanicki alley.
Now at Smolensk, it's almost over.
A floral larek disappeared, a stand for newspapers was dismantled, and the asphalt before the entrance was replaced by a bar stool.
Here's the whole transport hub.
Transport and transfer nodes are flat and capital, - explain in the press service of the capital department of transport.
There are no capital TPUs yet.
And the flats involve the construction of parking lots, the removal of commercial objects that interfere with the movement of passengers, the creation of small architectural forms and improvement.
In fact, flat TPUs are not even carried out by transporters, but by professional improvers from the department of capital repair of the city of Moscow.
The transport node is not necessarily a complicated design, - explains the director of the Institute of Transport Economics and Transport Policy of the Higher School of Economics Mikhail Blinkin.
Sometimes it is enough to have a roof over the head and a dashboard that warns about the time of arrival of the transport.
Here, for example, at the Yasenovo metro recently opened a fully-fledged flat transfer node.
Let it be without a hanger, but with intercepting parking lots and a sign indicating when the bus will arrive.
But in pursuit of the number of officials record in the TPU everything that hits.
As early as 2011, the city council planned to build on all 151 nodes, 59 of them with capital construction.
There are now up to 255 TPUs in the plans for 2020.
One and a half of them are promised to give up this year.
Although there is a TPU development program in the city, no qualitative criteria are indicated, - states Alexander Morozov, co-chair of the public organization "City and Transport".
They are reported by the number of objects, but the quality of transplants on each of them often deteriorates.
Criteria, in the opinion of the expert, should be two: first - reduction of the time of transplantation, second - convenience.
First of all, the possibility to change the mode of transport without going out in the rain.
In Moscow, when the TPU is installed, it sometimes goes exactly the opposite way.
A bright example of the metro "VDNH".
Previously, suburban buses from the Yaroslavl highway came to the square in front of the main entrance to the VVC.
Now their stops have been moved to the opposite side of Yaroslavka to Kosmonautov Street.
Further from the metro, much further from the monorails, but closer to the residential houses.
It was a gift that the residents absolutely did not want the bus station under the windows and complained to all possible instances.
With the capital of the TPU in Moscow somehow did not immediately.
The first of them began to build five years ago at the metro "Planerna".
The project was designed to be a model.
And it really turned out to be a sample of how the transfer node, given for redemption to investors, turns into a banal shopping mall.
No, there's a bus stop, a canopy to keep it from raining on the subway, and three floors of parking lots.
However, the chemical trolleybuses No202 and No203 in the Moscow TPU did not give way in principle.
They were pushed away from the subway like strangers.
There are more places to trade.
There are only 32 stores, and in general there are almost all of them - from zookeepers to car dealerships.
Well, actually, what if one of the passengers of the bus will need to buy a new car on the road?
When we build a capital TPU, for some reason there is always a shopping center.
Recently, the situation reached its logical conclusion, when a part of the parking lot decided to give to the market.
Now on the third floor of TPU "Planernaya" among the marked on the floor parking spaces is a boy trade.
Vegetables, spices, Chinese jeans, non-Russian speech and security guards who look maliciously at our photographer.
The transfer node has finally become a bazaar.
The fact is that before the metro "Planerna" had a market, but it was taken down.
And in the prefecture of the merchants regretted and allowed to intercept the parking of the transplant node.
However, because of the high prices there is always empty.
The funniest thing is that the market was shut down in order to build a new flat TPU in its place.
That's rocking.
In the metro "Kaluzhskaya" the distance of the approach from the lobby of the metro to the bus was 50 meters, - Alexander Morozov tells.
After the construction of the shopping center, allegedly TPU, the distance increased to 170 meters.
To get on the bus, you have to go through the entire shopping center.
After 22 hours, when it is closed, you have to bypass it under the open sky.
However, the designs on "Planerna" and "Kaluzhskaya" will soon appear flowers.
In mid-September, the municipal commission approved planning decisions for the first eight capital TPUs.
Four of them will be 25-storey, not counting two or three underground levels.
The main monster will grow near the metro "Tushino", it will have 418,7 thousand square meters of area.
Representatives of the directorate of railway stations of the RZD, responsible for the construction of the TPU near the metro, have already told journalists: in the future multi-storey stores, hotels and apartments will be located.
At the same time, officials assure that the multi-stage parking lot is mutated from a third to half of the area.
Take, for example, the “people’s” garages.
For example, the garage for 258 cars, which was recently built on International Street, has an area of 8015 square meters.
So, for parking for 2,600 cars in "Peterovsko-Razumovsky" will need about 80 thousand "squares".
That's less than a third of the machine they're going to build there.
Let one or two floors go to all the bus stops.
There are at least 150,000 square meters of commercial real estate.
And that's, for a minute, almost two gums.
If the capital TPUs at stations and stations are built by railways, then the rest of the sites will be conquered by metropolitan people.
They also promised that there would be a lot of “functional facilities,” including hotels, offices, and even gyms.
By the way, in the property department of the city of Moscow recently told journalists that they are developing a draft resolution, according to which investors will be able to apply for a plot for TPU to officials directly.
Without any competitions.
Therefore, pray that transportation issues for the city are a priority.
The ideal TPU is, for example, the station "Harvard" in Boston or "Spadina" in Toronto, - Alexander Morozov is sure.
There trolleybuses and trams descend underground to the level of the subway and the distance from the subway to the tram is only 50 meters without exiting the street.
There is no over-trade.
But Moscow's officials are being thrown in extremes.
Either we’re not going to build anything, or we’re going to build 25 floors with offices and apartments.
Eser proposes to equate to extremism the insult of patriotic feelings
For the legislative protection of patriotic sentiments of citizens against provocations and insults directed against Russia, "Just Russia" proposes to equate the insult of patriotic sentiments to extremist activity and punish for this five years in prison.
According to the newspaper Izvestia, such amendments to the legislation, prepared by the deputy of the Duma Energy Committee Oleg Mikheev, have already been sent to obtain a ruling in the Supreme Court and the government.
Under the patriotic feelings of citizens, the author of the amendments proposes to understand the emotional connection of the person with the country of which he is a citizen, characterized by a love for that country, a responsible attitude to its fate, respect for its history and culture.
According to Mikheev, in the domestic legislation there are sanctions for violation of formal signs of state power - flag and coat of arms.
At the same time, according to the parliament, the protection of Russians, whose feelings can be affected by the insult of state symbols, and other manifestations of disrespect for our country, in Russian legislation has not worked enough.
As an example, he brings up the annual Victory Day debates, when some media figures allow themselves to question the heroic feat of the people of the USSR in the fight against the fascists.
On the eve of the main public holiday - Victory Day on 9 May - a real vaccanalia takes place every year.
Practicing in wit and an “alternative view” of history, some publicists come to reason that, to say the pity, the cultural Germans did not conquer the wild Soviet Union!
I consider this to be absolutely unacceptable in a country where pride in history remains the nation’s main “spiritual stronghold,” says Oleg Mikheev.
In addition, according to Mikheev, patriotic people in Russia are much more than religious, but at the same time the law punishes for insulting the feelings of believers, and to insult patriotic feelings can be almost impunity.
In the opinion of the popular elector, it is necessary to equate the insult of patriotic feelings to extremist activities and to prescribe an appropriate punishment in article 282 of the Criminal Code.
The bill provides for punishment for insulting patriotic feelings: from a 100,000 fine to 5 years in prison.
The 6.6-magnitude earthquake took place on Thursday, October 31, in the area of the city of Cokimbo in central Chile, Reuters reported.
The quake was in the ocean at a depth of 10.7 kilometers and at a distance of 54 kilometers southwest of the city, according to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS).
The pulses were recorded at 20:03 local time (3:03 November 1st in Moscow).
Nothing has been reported about the victims or the destruction caused by the subterranean shocks.
Chile is located in one of the most seismologically active areas of the Earth, so earthquakes of various magnitudes are not uncommon there.
One of the most serious incidents occurred in 2010.
The magnitude 8.8 earthquake and the tsunami caused more than 550 people to die in Chile and 220,000 buildings to be destroyed.
In addition, the most powerful earthquake in recent history occurred in Chile: in 1960 there was recorded a magnitude of 9.5.
As a result of this natural disaster, more than five thousand people died.
Dmitry Medvedev: Greenpeace case will be treated fairly
Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said on Friday that the case of Greenpeace activists will be considered in strict accordance with Russian legislation.
France may not doubt that the case will be considered in compliance with the legislation, we hear all the concerns.
"We can guarantee compliance with the laws," Dmitry Medvedev said at a meeting with French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Eau Claire.
Among the detained Greenpeace activists is a French citizen.
Pierre Pisani, as well as other activists, have been charged with hooliganism.
“I asked if we could expect a humanitarian gesture against a detained citizen,” Mr. Ero told RIA Novosti.
"Our country cannot support activities that can harm the environment, no one has the right to violate the laws," said Dmitry Medvedev.
According to him, the activity of any structure that tries to influence technologically complex and insecure processes, including the extraction of energy sources, is dangerous.
He stressed that these objects were "like a powder barrel" and recalled what was happening in the Gulf of Mexico, reports RIA Novosti.
The United Nations announces new targets for poverty eradication
The United Nations should immediately begin to work on a new set of tasks to replace the Millennium Development Goals, which were formulated 12 years ago to overcome poverty around the world.
Australian diplomats have played a key role in advancing the “sustainable development goals” to replace the CRT, which expires in 2015, before the UN Summit on Sustainable Development, which began in Rio de Janeiro last night.
They were included in the final version of the document to be signed by world leaders, including Ms. Gillard, during the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said on the eve of the summit that the time had come to “be above national interests.”
“I am pleased that the UN member states have agreed to launch and take control of the process of setting universal sustainable development goals – the SDGs,” he said.
These SDGs will build on our progress in achieving the Millennium Development Goals and will become an integral part of the post-2015 development concept.
I will make every effort to use the powers granted to me by Member States to implement our vision of the Sustainable Development Goals, which are based on the successful implementation of the ICC.
Security concerns in Mozambique are on the rise due to conflict of influential people
Looking at them from the top to the bottom of the statue of Samora Mashel, Mozambique’s founding president, thousands of people gathered in the center of Maputo to chant slogans about the world at one of the rare demonstrations here.
“We want peace back; we want stability,” said Vanessa de Sousa, CEO of the investment company.
Fearing for the future of her country, she changed her business suit to a T-shirt decorated with the inscription “We demand security” in Portuguese, and joined the crowd on Thursday in the capital’s Independence Square.
Within two weeks, almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo were received, one of the most violent clashes since the truce was concluded more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a well-known rebel movement, backed first by the white Rhodesia authorities, and then by the South African government of the apartheid era as part of efforts to destabilize the country's independent government.
After the 1992 truce, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe that the country is unlikely to revert to a full-scale conflict, but recent events have made foreign investors and locals nervous.
Wages are high for a fast-growing economy as the opening of huge shelf reserves of gas and coal mines in the northwest could attract more than $50 billion as an investment in the next few years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil and Ana from Eni.
The ruling Frelimo Party, a leading political force since 1975, and the Renamo Party blame each other for the tension they have created.
The Renamo party claims that the government has become the cause of recent clashes by attacking its members in the province of Sofia, the traditional siege of Renamo, on October 17.
The attacks on the former rebels then escalated when government troops attacked Renamo bases and tried to kill Afonso Dhlacamu, the group's leader, said Fernando Mazang, a representative of Renamo.
The government blames Renamo for initiating clashes, accusing the party of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Gebusa has tried to dispel concerns about instability.
Gebuza told AFP, a French news agency, on Wednesday that Mr Dhlakama felt he was a “failure” who wanted to use “everything that was left of his power to try to prove that he could impose his own decisions on the government.”
Both Frelimo and Renamo insist that they want to avoid war.
However, fears grew after it was reported that Mazanga had declared that Renamo had withdrawn from the 1992 peace agreement.
He told the Financial Times that he meant non-compliance with the Frelimo party.
“Our goal is to return to the negotiations, but with all seriousness,” Mazanga said.
Previous negotiations between the parties have done little to alleviate tensions that have been intensified by a series of clashes this year.
“These are two influential people (Gebuza and Dhlakama) who have faced their elbows,” said Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer at the Open University and an expert on Mozambique.
None of them is a good negotiator and none of them are willing to make the necessary concessions.
The Renamo party, which is trying to achieve electoral reforms, has already said it will boycott the municipal elections scheduled for November.
The presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted this pressure as an attempt by the weakened movement to obtain concessions and financial bonuses from the government.
The share of votes for Renamo has been falling since 1992, while the new Mozambique Democratic Movement (MDM), which is founded by a former member of Renamo, is expected to improve its performance in these elections.
Mr. Mazanga said that Mr. Gebusa, who had to step down next year, when his second term expired, wanted to destroy democracy in the country.
“He doesn’t want multi-party democracy, he doesn’t want transparent elections, he doesn’t want peace, because he doesn’t want to leave the presidency,” Mazanga said.
It is not clear what capabilities Renamo has, but it has already carried out destructive and rapid attacks on police stations and cars on a key highway leading from the north to the south.
Most of the clashes took place in the province of Sofia, which is several hundred kilometers north of Maputo, but includes Beirut — a port that mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, use to export coal.
In June, Rio suspended the use of railroads for about a week after Renamo threatened to attack a railroad.
Mazang was elusive when asked if Renamo would repeat this threat.
The Renamo party wanted to “warn the international community that things are not going very well in Mozambique,” Mazanga said.
Instability has heightened government dissatisfaction, and many people are also concerned about corruption, the slow pace of development and recent kidnappings, says Fernando Lima, head of independent media company Mediacoop.
“People think that the responsibility for the future of the country lies with the government and the president, who must find a solution to these problems,” he said.
Omar Sultan, who participated in the demonstration, said people just want stability.
“No one cares about Renamo or Frelimo, they just want peace renewal, they want free access to roads,” he said.
A series of premieres of "Art Mainstream" will be held in Moscow
A series of film shows "Art Mainstream", where viewers will be able to see one Russian and four foreign films a few days before their release, will be held in the cinema "Rolan" from November 1 to 5, reports RIA "Novosti" with reference to the project.
The program "Art Mainstream" will open the French comedy of director and actress Reim Kerichi "Paris at any cost".
This is the story of a model working in the French capital Maye (Kerichi herself), who is deported to Morocco due to visa problems.
In addition to Kerichi's film, viewers will also be shown a new picture of the famous South Korean director Kim Ki Duc "Mebius", the melodramatic biopic of Oliver Hirschbigel "Diana: The Story of Love" (Diana) by Adasha in "Adsha" with Naomi Watts in the lead role and the main film.
The only Russian participant of "Art Mainstream" will be the winning film of Alexander Veledinsky "Geographer the globe drank" on the basis of the novel of the same name by Alexei Ivanov.
The main role - the charming unsuccessful teacher Viktor Sluzhkin - in the film was played by Konstantin Habensky, whose work was also awarded the prize "Kinotavura".
Children should study myths and legends as “lifestyle models,” says the author.
Tales of the Torah could show that “rough power cannot overcome subtle cunning,” and legends of King Arthur show how important it is to have a dream.
Saying that many myths will turn out to be “too wild, too scandalous, and in some cases too obnoxious to teach in schools,” Crossley-Holland advocates “a careful selection” of age-appropriate texts.
“I think it’s wonderful that in America, myths and folklore are already part of education,” he said.
I was in favour of introducing them into the 20-year training program.
He added that “excessive moralization” of authors and teachers “distracts interest” in children, and basic ideas are “sublimated” into fascinating stories.
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from the Anglo-Saxon language, and also wrote the Norwegian Myths Collection for Penguin and the British Folk Tales, said: “You may have intentions, of course, but you’d better keep them with you.”
Perhaps the big difference between an adult author who writes for adults, and an adult author who writes for children, is the need to feel some hope.
Not that everything should be simplified or lead to a happy ending, but it is necessary that an innate understanding of good and evil be born.
And it must be sublimated; revealed through history, not clearly formulated.
The old principle is to show, not tell.
In Voronezh region, a football fan has been detained, breaking a window in the waiting room of the station
At nine o’clock in the evening of October 29, at the station of Griazi-Voronezh transport police officers removed from the passenger train two football fans - natives of the Moscow region.
Going to the game of a favorite team, the guys on the way arranged a drunk deboss on the train.
The young people were taken to the duty section of the linear police station at Griazi station to draw up a protocol on an administrative offence.
There, the fans regretted their anti-social behavior.
The police have made up administrative material on them and released them.
Young people bought tickets for the next train and at the station began to wait for his arrival.
In the middle of the first night, the fans left the train station building, but one of them, a 22-year-old boy, suddenly returned and broke the window of the front door in the waiting room of the station.
On the bell of the broken glass, a transport police officer and a guard of the CCP "RZD" rushed.
They were able to arrest the perpetrator who tried to hide from the scene of the incident.
Employees of the South-Eastern LU of the Ministry of Interior of Russia carry out an inspection.
The issue of initiation of a criminal case is decided, said Sergey Olkhovyk, senior referent of the direction of information and public relations of the South-Eastern LU of the Ministry of Interior of Russia on transport.
Vitaly Mutko: Watermelons?
I think we came back 15 years ago.
Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko expressed his opinion on the riots in the stands during the match of the Russian Cup "Shinnik" - "Spartak".
I am a supporter of the fact that the organizers of sports events are responsible for all this: clubs, the league, the Russian Federation.
But we can see that they have taken a tough position.
They're waiting for someone to come by and get it right.
This is a very good position, but not the right one.
It is necessary to organize fans, clubs should invite their stewards, not let the case go on their own.
We have now drafted a special government decree on the rules of conduct in stadiums.
Once it has been adopted, we will deal closely with this problem.
But I will definitely invite all the organizers of the football process.
I read Leonid Fedun's interview.
State, please, give the law a rush.
The feeling that these are the fans of "Bavaria" came to Yaroslavl and all arranged it.
We are external observers.
And in general, it's horrible to see the tribune being watered out of the fireplace.
And that's in a country that's preparing for the World Cup.
“I feel like we came back 10-15 years ago,” Mutko said.
Snowden may be questioned in Russia
Former U.S. intelligence officer Edward Snowden is not likely to travel outside Russia to give testimony in the case of overhearing telephone conversations with German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
As stated by Interfax on Friday, a source familiar with the situation, the American can answer the questions of the representatives of the German Prosecutor General’s Office in writing or clearly in Russia.
Edward Snowden’s departure from Russia is virtually excluded.
"In this case, he will lose refugee status and may be extradited to Washington by the allies of the United States," the agency's spokesperson said.
"At the same time, in principle, the German Prosecutor’s Office could send its representatives to Russia or transmit written questions to Snowden," the source added, adding that this issue should be worked out at the interstate level.
Earlier, German Bundestag MP Hans-Christian Strebele reported that Edward Snowden was ready to testify in the case of the US intelligence services overhearing the German Chancellor’s talks.
Snowden is ready to give testimony to the German law enforcement authorities either in Moscow or on the territory of Germany.
An ex-CIA employee has made it clear that he knows a lot.
Despite the fact that the US NSA blocked all of his moves, Snowden is ready to come to Germany.
However, for this, it is necessary to clearly define all the conditions of his arrival," Strebel told Euronews.
Snowden's lawyer Anatoly Kucheren, commenting on the statement from an Interfax source, said his client could cooperate with German investigators, but when and how - he will decide for himself.
A U.S. citizen, Edward Snowden, who worked for the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) and the CIA, fled to Hong Kong in May 2013, after which he released information about secret U.S. intelligence operations through surveillance online.
Snowden flew through Moscow by transit, but was unable to leave the airport due to the cancellation of his passport by the U.S. authorities, who made serious accusations to him, and remained in the transit zone of Sheremetyevo airport until the beginning of August.
On August 1, Snowden received a document on granting him temporary asylum on the territory of Russia for a period of one year and left “Sheremetyevo” on the same day.
Yesterday, the lawyer of the American Anatoly Kucherena said that his client went to work for a "big Russian company".
The NSA’s follow-up to Angela Merkel last week was reported by German media.
According to reporters, the chancellor’s telephone conversations began to be listened to by the Americans back in 2002.
The surveillance station was reportedly located at the U.S. Embassy in Berlin.
After the publication of this information, the German authorities said that the monitoring of Merkel violates the laws and sovereignty of Germany.
Ponomarev has left "Just Russia"
Deputy of the State Duma from the Just Russia party, member of its branch in Novosibirsk Ilya Ponomarev made a statement about leaving the political organization.
As stated by the parliamentarian, he submitted a statement to the Novosibirsk regional branch of the party.
According to her charter, this automatically means that Ponomarev left the ranks of the "truths".
We sit down, drink tea...
"For some reason, many want to see the picture "Ilya Ponomarev puts a ticket on the table", but there is nothing epochal about it," the deputy commented on his decision.
Ponomarev noted that it maintains good relations with the regional division of "Esers".
Meanwhile, the mandate of Deputy State Duma Ilya Ponomarev is not intended to refuse.
He explained that despite leaving the party, he remains a member of the faction and cannot legally leave it.
Messages about Ilya Ponomarev’s intention to leave the Just Russia party appeared on October 30.
It was reported that Dmitry Gudkov and Valery Zubov would come out with him, but the latter soon denied this information.
Japan will discuss with Russia the issue of the conclusion of a peace treaty
Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kisida met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov to discuss issues related to the conclusion of a peace treaty between the two countries.
"We would like to openly exchange views on the issues of further development of political dialogue, to discuss issues related to the conclusion of a peace treaty," he said at the meeting.
Japan’s foreign minister recalled that after Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe visited Russia, relations between the countries became warmer and acquired a bilateral character.
The Russian minister, in turn, noted that the Russian Federation will meet Japan in the resolution of complex political issues, writes RIA Novosti.
The conclusion of a peace treaty between Japan and Russia implies a solution to the issue of the disputed Northern Territories.
In this regard, protests are taking place in Tokyo today with a demand to return the land lost after the Second World War to the country.
In the Japanese capital, cars are driving, from which the loudspeaker says: "Return the Northern Territories!".
The police do not stop the protesters, they are watching to ensure that the noise level is not exceeded.
Ben Greenman: 10th Anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: New Yorker
It can be argued that New York is the birthplace of stand-up comedy in America: almost a hundred years ago extrovert artist Frank Fay, who worked at a conference at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began to tell jokes directly to the public in a conversational manner.
Faye’s innovation has been captured over time by others, most recently the New York Comedy Festival.
Created and curated by Caroline Hursh, the founder of the Carolines stand-up club, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year, featuring more than sixty shows in small clubs and large theaters.
“Most of these headliners started at Carolines and then achieved more success, reaching a level when they were already too famous to perform at the club,” Hursh said.
We created this festival as a way to continue working with them.
This year’s event includes performances by Vanda Sykes, Katie Griffin and Bill Mara, as well as “Standup for Heroes” – an annual musical and comedy charity concert for military veterans at the Beirut Beirut Madison Square Garden, where they will appear among others.
With the expansion of the festival, the world of comedy expanded.
Several comedians participating in the festival this year have gained popularity in an unconventional way, for example thanks to shows on small TV channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Crawl gained fame due to his role in a comedy series on a little-known cable channel (especially the FXX's short-lived "League" on the theme of fantasy football), and now runs his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was cast in both "Saturday Night Live" and "Parks and Recreation Areas", although she is best known for her viral film series "Marcel - The Shoe Bunny".
Both Crowley and Slate, as well as other young comedians with a distinctive style (surrealist pessimistic Anthony Jesselnik, naive, racially-focused Kamau Bell), are the result of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the highlights of the festival will be David Steinberg’s interview with Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian, but later became a successful director on television and film, as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he starred in the TV Land show Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg.
The meeting will take place in the Town Hall Hall in downtown Manhattan.
“This city is certainly a central element of Larry’s work,” Steinberg said.
He told me that coming here, he sometimes walks down some street between two houses and thinks, “Here if I’m left without money, maybe I’ll live here.”
Pakistani authorities start talks with local Taliban <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
The Pakistani authorities have started negotiations with the Taliban.
This was reported by the embassy of the country in the United Kingdom, where the Prime Minister of Pakistan Nawaz Sharif is visiting.
The head of government of Pakistan made a statement on talks with Islamic extremists during a meeting with British Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, with whom he discussed the issues of Pakistan-India relations, the world energy market and economic reforms in Pakistan.
"The Prime Minister said that the dialogue with the Taliban had begun," the Pakistani embassy in London said in a statement.
"He said that he hopes and prays that the dialogue will work in accordance with the Constitution of Pakistan," the diplomats added.
The Pakistani Taliban (Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan) are allies of the Afghan movement of the same name, but operate independently of it in the northwestern regions of the country bordering Afghanistan.
The Pakistani Taliban is seeking the establishment of an Islamic State.
Earlier, the Islamabad government had attempted to start negotiations with the local Taliban, but the movement refused to engage in dialogue.
It said it would only enter into negotiations if the authorities took troops stationed in areas where the Taliban are active and released from prisons of Islamists arrested on a permanent basis.
Navaz Sharif arrived in London at the World Islamic Economic Forum.
On Tuesday, October 29, British Prime Minister David Cameron, Pakistan’s head of government and Afghan President Hamid Karzai held a trilateral meeting in London to discuss the prospects of a peace process in Afghanistan.
The price of oil fell to $96 per barrel.
The price of oil continued to fall on Friday, as concerns about the formation of large reserves overshadowed a message showing that China’s energy-efficient manufacturing sector is gaining momentum.
The U.S. oil benchmark in December’s supply fell by 14 cents, and its price was $96.24 per barrel in late-morning European time in e-commerce on the New York Stock Exchange.
On Thursday, the contract fell by 39 cents, which amounted to a fall of 5.8 percent in October.
Wealthy oil reserves have impacted its value over the past few weeks.
The U.S. energy ministry said on Wednesday that U.S. stocks had increased by 4.1 million barrels in the past week.
In five weeks, the stocks have been replenished by more than 25 million barrels.
But on Friday there was an indication of a possible increase in demand, judging by two reports of Chinese industry, which showed an increase in its activity.
This indicates that China’s economic recovery could continue to gain momentum after the third quarter’s growth rate rose to 7.8 percent after a 20-year low in the previous quarter.
Brent oil, a benchmark international oil used by U.S. oil refineries, was 26 cents to $108.58 per barrel on the Intercontinental Stock Exchange in London.
The head coach of "Colorado" Patrick Rua, explaining the decision to release the goalkeeper Semen Varlamov from the first minute in a Friday match with "Dallas", expressed the confidence that the recent night of the <0xC5><0xA0>kortaEmébna did not hesitate.
And what are we waiting for?" said Rua after the morning skiing "Lavin".
Of course, what happened worries us all, but we are confident in him and feel that it will be useful for him to go out on the ice today.
We want him to go out on the ice and show his usual level.
So are you completely sure that the situation did not affect the conditions of the gatekeeper?

"Undoubtedly, our players will support Varley by helping him protect the goalkeeper as it was in previous games this season.
The main thing is that no one in the team is going to make any conclusions until the court finds out in this situation.
In Siberia should not be vegan: greenhouse tomato will not replace soup
Why vegetarianism is not suitable for life in Siberia, RIA Novosti correspondent found.
People who have completely renounced animal products should not live in Siberia.
Here they do not spend the winter without loss of health, and no greenhouse tomatoes compensate them, according to the vegan dietitians and doctors polled on the eve of Vegan Day.
Drinking oil in liters
Strict vegetarianism, when you give up not only meat and fish, but also milk, honey, eggs, becomes a fashionable way of life.
However, dietitians are convinced that in Novosibirsk and other cities of Siberia to adhere to such strict norms in nutrition, at least, is unhealthy.
Complete rejection of animal products is harmful.
Animal proteins contain essential amino acids, which are very difficult to compensate for by plant proteins.
It is necessary to include in the diet at least milk or eggs", - convinced dietitian Marina Bogay.
It is an example of a fish that contains the essential omega-3 fatty acid.
Their richest vegetable oil is linseed oil.
"To consume it in the quantities necessary for a person, you need to drink in liters!" - says a dietitian.
Doctors are convinced that the inhabitants of Siberia should pay special attention to the diet in the winter.
This season, vegetarianism is especially in doubt.
In the conditions of our realities, there are high demands on food.
In order not to freeze, you need an increased calorie content.
“If a person restricts himself to animal products, accordingly, he doesn’t get that calorie,” says the specialist.
With this agrees dietitian Olga Pozniak.
She adds that importing vegetables and fruits is not the way out.
It is better for a person to eat mainly foods that are grown in the region of residence or where he was born.
The genetic code is designed to improve the absorption and digestion of these products.
And in winter people do not want to bite cucumbers, but hot soup or something more satiating," - explains his position.
According to her, from what vegans can eat, a variety of cereals, cereals, beans, local vegetables, apples that remain in the winter, frozen berries are really useful.
But this, of course, is not enough for a full-fledged diet.
According to the gastroenterologist Claudia Arifulina, Siberians have enough vitamins in their bodies only from mid-August to mid-September.
The complete transition to vegetarianism in our harsh natural conditions, when the temperature can change by 30 degrees per day and in May the snow is lying, is inappropriate.
The body needs energy for life, and that is, first of all, fat,” says the doctor.
Doctors note that veganism is especially harmful for children and pregnant women.
Children grow up, they need building material, including in the form of amino acids.
And by adhering to vegetarianism, we give them incomplete.
Pregnant women also need an increased content of protein, vitamins and micronutrients in the menu.
“They are not God’s people,” he said.
Arifulina says that an adult is free to choose anything, "to play the toys he wants."
He has an already formed body, skeleton, organs.
The kids should still be eating well.
If parents deprive him of any trace elements or amino acids, choosing for him what he will eat, it is simply a violation of the rights of the child.
"The lack of some substances for the development of the brain, vision, bones will not be restored tomorrow," she says.
All the medical experts surveyed agree on the low quality of the cultivated in the winter in greenhouses and import vegetables and fruits.
What is brought to us and grown in greenhouses, contains less of the micronutrients we need than (grown) in open ground.
“The quality of food is not that,” says God.
Arifulina also notes that edible and greenhouse vegetables and fruits are far from ideal standards.
Sometimes the desire of producers to harvest more crops is detrimental to quality.
"Apples don't get brown on the cut, cucumbers get yellowed and molded quickly, tomatoes tasteless and flavorless," the doctor said, adding that they are likely stuffed with excess fertilizers.
And they become suppliers not of vitamins, but of fiber.
This does not agree with the institution of the Siberian physical and technical institute of agrarian problems, the candidate of agricultural sciences Vera Petruk.
She says that with the correct approach and compliance with all the norms and requirements in greenhouses it is possible to grow whole-grained vegetables.
If you try to expel more than a square meter, then of course, watering will become more frequent, and feed the plants with mineral fertilizers.
For example, when too much nitrogen fertilizers, tomatoes grow quickly, they are large, but water-tight and non-sweet,” she explains, adding that the question of quality, first of all, depends on the conscience of the manufacturer.
The court suspended the execution of the decision on the practice of “stop-and-over” in the New York Police Department
On Thursday, the Federal District Court of Appeals suspended the enforcement of a court order requiring changes to the New York Police Department’s “stop-and-over” program, and removed the judge from the case.
The U.S. District Court of Appeals has said that the enforcement of Judge Shira Sheindlin’s decisions will be suspended until the city receives the results of the appeal.
In August, the judge ruled that the city violated the constitution in how it carried out the program of street arrests and interrogations.
The city filed an appeal against its decision and resolutions on corrective measures, including a warrant to appoint a controller to help the police department change its work practices and the related training program.
On Thursday, the appellate court heard a dispute between the parties over the application for the suspension of the case.
The appellate court said it was necessary to dismiss the judge because it violated the code of conduct of U.S. judges and did not consider it necessary to avoid the demonstration of bias, in part because of a series of media interviews and official statements containing a public response to the judge’s criticism.
The judge ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people, unreasonably addressing blacks and Latinos under the “stop-and-over” program.
It has appointed an external controller to oversee large-scale changes, which include policy, training and control reforms, and has decided to launch a pilot program to test body-mounted video cameras in those police stations where the majority of detainees are held.
In August, New York decided to stop the practice of storing the names and addresses of people whose cases were terminated after a police check.
The city’s appeals debate should take place after March 14, 2014.
The tactic of “stop and search” has been criticized by many civil rights lawyers.
“Stop-search” has been practiced for several decades in one form or another, but the number of documented stops increased sharply under the administration of the independent mayor Michael Bloomberg, reaching an absolute record of 684,330 people in 2011.
In 2004, four people, all representatives of national minorities, filed a collective lawsuit in court.
Supporters of the “stop-and-over” program in the New York Police Department say that these changes will put an end to unfair practices, create a more reliable and effective police service, and may affect how other departments retaliate.
Opponents claim that the changes will reduce the fighting spirit of the police, not the level of crime, lead to unnecessary spending of money, and will not solve the more global problem of complicated conditions in the police due to a reduction in the number of officers by several thousand in recent decades.
The judge noted that it does not stop the practice of “stop-and-over,” which is in line with the constitution, but changes the way New York police stop people.
In the area of Tretyakov Gallery opened a pedestrian zone
A new pedestrian zone has emerged in Moscow.
It is located in the area of Tretyakov Gallery and occupies a site two kilometers from the metro station "Novokuznetskaya" to Bolotnaya Square.
Street signs, flower beds, pavements, urns and toilets have been installed throughout, deaf fences have been removed and illegal advertising has been carried out.
In addition to Klimentovsky and Lavrushinsky alleys, which were already pedestrianized, five streets were closed for cars - Ordinsky Dock, Big and Little Tolmachevsky alleys, Kadashevsky promenade and Bolotskaya Square.
The traffic on the streets of Maroseik and Petrovka is not limited.
On the section of Friday street from the lobby of the station "Novokuznetskaya" to Klimentovsky alley, conditions for pedestrians were created without removing the movement and cutting the passing parts, reports newsmsk.com.
Inside the pedestrian zone were the Tretyakov Gallery, the temple of the Holy Martyr Clement of the Pope of Rome, museums, libraries, monuments and other sights.
Previously completely pedestrians were the Tver Prozd, Stoleshnikov alleys and Kuznetsky Bridge street.
Big Dmitrovka, where the pedestrian zone opened in early September, was decided to close for cars on weekends and holidays.
Coulson resorted to a phone hack to check confidential message
Former News of the World editor Andy Coulson allegedly used a “phone hack, surveillance, and confrontation” in an attempt to confirm false information about Charles Clark’s novel, which at the time held the post of Home Secretary.
The prosecutor, royal lawyer Andrew Edis, told the Old Bailey court that in May 2005, the News of the World newspaper received unreliable news that Clark was meeting with his "attractive special counsel" Hannah Polby.
The newspaper ordered private detective Glenn Mulcair to hack Paulby's voicemail and warned her at home to take an interview, but Coulson also called her and left voicemails, the court heard.
“The prosecution believes that Mr. Coulson, who is now the editor of NotW, is not the kind of person who will stand next to someone at home hoping to catch someone in surprise, he is the kind of person who likes to offer history to people to see what they’re going to say.”
He said News of the World used three ways to investigate stories: phone hacking, tracking, and confrontation.
The editor is personally involved in the third.
Obviously, he knows about the second, about the surveillance, he just has to.
What about the first one?
Does he know about the phone hack?
He says no, we say, “Oh, yes!”
Rumors of Clark’s novel first caught the attention of News of the World when a source sexually interested in Mrs. Polby said, “Don’t waste time, she’s with Charles.”
The cassette with voice messages received from her phone at least three times was taken from Mulcair's house in August 2006.
Investigators also found footage on a private detective's computer in which Miss Polby and her sister were portrayed as "Projects."
During the period during which she was under surveillance, Ms. Polby's grandmother and grandfather received anonymous calls requesting information about her, Mr. Edis said.
During this time, former chief reporter Neville Turlebeck and former reporter James Weserap monitored Ms. Polby's movements.
After leaving her voicemail on June 18, 2005, Coulson said, “I have a story that we plan to publish tomorrow and that I would very much like to discuss with Charles.”
Mr. Edis said that Coulson’s involvement in this story was in the same scenario as with other influential people, such as former Home Secretary David Blanquet.
The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson had entered into a confrontation with Mr. Blanket about a romance with a married woman while he himself met with correspondent Rebecca Brooks, who was married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks deny conspiracy with other people in order to hack phones between 3 October 2000 and 9 August 2006.
Mulcair, Turnbeck, and Weserap have confessed to hacking their phones.
Snowden declares readiness to speak with the German authorities on the case of the hearing
Former CIA employee Edward Snowden expresses his readiness to come to Germany as soon as he has a legal opportunity to do so, and to meet with representatives of the German authorities, reports RIA Novosti.
A letter from a former CIA employee to the German authorities at a meeting with journalists in Berlin on Friday was presented by Bundestag MP Hans-Christian Strebele, through which Snowden delivered the message to the German authorities.
Schtrebele met Snowden in Moscow the day before.
Four people were injured as a result of a fire on Tverskaya Street
As a result of the fire in the collector in the center of Moscow, on Tverskaya Street, four passers-by were injured.
According to Interfax, with reference to a source in the emergency services, one of the victims is hospitalized.
According to the source, the passengers were injured during the fire in a smoked underground passageway.
As RIA Novosti writes, with reference to Pavl Livinsky’s head of the capital’s fuel and energy department, the electricity supply has now been fully restored in all houses on Tverskaya Street.
The fire in the thermal collector near the house 15 on Tverskaya Street occurred on the evening of October 31.
There was strong smoke from the shower vents, and in the underground passage, located at the "Armenia" store, smoke was formed.
As a result of the fire, 11 houses on Tverskaya Street were devastated.
At 21:45 Moscow time, the fire was extinguished.
U.S. Cuts Food Allowance for the Poor
The food allowance for a family of four is reduced by $36 per month
From Friday in the United States, the financial provision of food stamps, known as “food stamps”, is being reduced as the corresponding state program expires.
A family of four will now be allocated $36 less per month for the food allowance than before, officials say.
This will affect 47 million of the poorest Americans.
According to Reuters, in the 2012 financial year, the allowance per person was an average of $133 per month.
Food aid spending in the U.S. rose to $80 billion a year due to rising unemployment and food prices.
Approximately 14% of Americans rely on free food aid issued by FoodStamps, which has been called that since the time when they were in the form of paper coupons.
When the current economic crisis began, the program was expanded to stimulate the growth of the economy and to help the poorest Americans.
However, Republicans in Congress are demanding that further cuts be made to the program, stating that it should be aimed at helping those who need it the most.
Owners of grocery stores across America are concerned that the cuts will lead to a reduction in consumer spending.
U.S. Congressmen continue to argue about how to further reduce government funding.
Blizzard releases 19-year-old platformer for free
Blizzard released its 1994 Blackthorne platformer for PC for free.
This is reported by WoW Insider.
According to him, the game became available on Battle.net in the classic Blizzard games section.
However, some gamers note that at the moment it can only be downloaded by those users whose accounts belong to the U.S. part of the service.
For Russian users, the game is not yet available.
According to media reports, the version that Blizzard has now released on the PC is no different from the original version of the game.
The soundtrack to Blackthorne also remained unchanged.
The Blackthorne platform, which Blizzard released 19 years ago, was originally released on the SNES console.
His events unfolded on the planet Tull, whose inhabitants were divided into dark and light kingdoms.
Once the dark ruler Sarlak decided to kill the bright king Vlaros and become the sole ruler of the planet.
The main protagonist of the game is the son of Vlaros Kyle, who was rescued from death by sending him to Earth.
Twenty years later, he returned to Tull to fight Sarlak's foes and protect the inhabitants of the planet from them.
The original Blackthorne was the first game released by the studio after its renaming to Blizzard Entertainment.
Previously it was called Silicon & Synapse.
The publisher of Blackthorne was Interplay.
There will be new machines in the Moscow metro.
But to sell tickets to passengers, they will not be for money, but for sittings.
One trip at a cost of 30 rubles will cost a potential passenger in 30 seats.
The number of sittings will count the special device using modern technologies, reports ITAR-TASS, citing the press service of the Olympic Committee of Russia.
The first device will be installed at the "Exhibition" station on November 8, 2013.
In the presentation of the new ticket machines will be received by the President of the Olympic Committee of Russia Alexander Zhukov and Olympic champions gymnasts Alexey Nemov and Elena Zamoladchikov.
Recognitions of the National Security Agency intensify the paranoia of corporations regarding state surveillance
On a warm day in late August, a German police helicopter flew low over the U.S. consulate in Frankfurt, the financial capital of Germany.
According to the instructions of the Federal Constitutional Protection Service (BfV), the German Internal Intelligence Service, his task was to photograph the roof of the U.S. embassy building, which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
German media say BfV was hoping to detect the antennas of the hearing devices, and these actions led to negotiations between the US and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, director of U.S. National Intelligence, said in September that the U.S. did not use foreign intelligence capabilities “to steal the trade secrets of foreign companies in the interests of U.S. companies to increase their international competitiveness or increase their profits.”
But ever since Edward Snowden, a contract clerk who became a whistleblower, began publishing his treasure trove of U.S. intelligence secrets, European governments and corporate executives are no longer sure if they can trust the director on their word.
Reports that the U.S. National Security Agency monitored Brazilian oil company Petrobras and accessed data stored by U.S. cloud service providers, including Google and Yahoo, raised the paranoia of corporations caused by state surveillance to new heights.
The last drop was the news that Chancellor Angela Merkel’s phone had been listening for about a decade.
If the most influential person in Europe can be a target, then, of course, the potential targets are also business leaders.
Snowden has made clear the intense cooperation between the U.S. intelligence services and companies.
I think it is quite likely that this data is being used with mutual benefit.
“Germany needs to wake up,” says Oliver Grün, president of BITMi, which represents Germany’s small and medium-sized IT companies.
German companies are convinced that the U.S. now poses almost the same risk as China in the field of industrial espionage and data theft, according to a study published in July by the consulting agency EY.
In all of Mr. Snowden’s documents, however, there has been no evidence to date that the United States has passed on the trade secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians expressed concern that the EU lacked certain opportunities in the field of information technology and the Internet, and expressed the view that it should try to reduce its dependence on the United States.
Businesses are sceptical about this.
Someone in the German parliament says we have to create a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again...
“It’s not an option,” says Gasso Plattner, president of the German company SAP Business Software.
If there is a need for a powerful European IT industry, it should not have been allowed to die more than 20 years ago.
Everything is subsidized in Germany: from coal to cars and farmers.
All but the IT industry.
Nevertheless, the coverage and technical development of U.S. espionage agencies, which became famous thanks to Snowden’s revelations, was a shock to some companies who previously thought China was the biggest risk of surveillance.
A big shift is taking place in cloud technologies, where the leaders of European companies are better aware that the data stored in the US is in the same jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to a study by the Cloud Security Alliance trade association, about 10 percent of its non-U.S. participants refused to plan to use the services of a U.S.-based cloud provider after revealing the U.S. program for intellectual data analysis Prism.
Jim Snowb, one of SAP’s executive directors, said: “We see consumers asking a new question that didn’t arise a year ago, namely: where my data is stored and whether you can guarantee that it will stay in that jurisdiction physically.”
Many German leaders argue that the latest messages are just a confirmation of what they already knew: powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets, and therefore, this data must be protected at all costs.
What’s happening with economic espionage is not surprising.
He's always had a place.
“This has been the subject of discussion for many years and has not changed significantly in the current controversy,” says Kurt Bok, chief executive officer of BASF.
The Americans are spying on us on a commercial and industrial level, and we are spying on them too, because it is in our national interests to protect our commercial enterprises.
Corporation leaders usually don’t like to brag about the retaliatory measures they’ve taken, as this can give an advantage to the opponent.
In large companies, the idea has long been learned that taking a free flash drive at an exhibition or leaving a laptop unattended in a hotel room is, at least, reckless.
Ulrich Hackenberg, member of Audi’s board of directors, says it has been a standard practice for many years to collect mobile phones before board meetings so they can’t be used as listening devices.
The Federal Constitutional Protection Service of Germany recommends that company managers consider the possibility of using simple prepaid mobile phones during trips abroad due to the vulnerability of smartphones.
Prepaid mobile phones are subsequently discarded.
However, there are concerns that small and medium-sized companies remain vulnerable to hacks and surveillance.
In Germany, many such companies are leaders in the world market in their particular niche.
“Small and medium-sized companies often lack the expertise, staff, and financial resources to effectively protect corporate secrets from unauthorized access,” BfV said in a statement.
The U.S. warns its own companies of economic espionage from other countries.
A U.S. national intelligence briefing in February placed France, along with Russia and Israel, in the second row of hackers who engage in economic intelligence after China, The Washington Post claims.
A member of the board of directors of a prestigious German company confirmed that when it comes to economic espionage, “the French are the worst of all.”
Bernard Scarsini, the former head of the French intelligence agency DCRI, reportedly said in an interview this month: “The services know very well that all countries, even when they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, are spying on their allies.”
The parents of a Georgian teenager who died in a “stupid accident” believe their son was killed
The parents of a Georgia teenager whose body was found inside a folded sports mat in his high school gymnasium believe their son was killed, a family lawyer said on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson of the city of Valdosta, Georgia, was found on January 11 in a vertically standing mat attached to the back of the stands in his high school gymnasium.
Investigators from the Loundes County Sheriff's Department have concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident, but the family of a 17-year-old boy disputed it.
“They are absolutely certain that their son was killed,” said Benjamin Kramp, a lawyer representing Kenneth and Jacqueline Johnson.
They never believed that he died the way the sheriff said.
“They think this contradicts logic, the laws of physics, as well as common sense,” Mr. Kramp said.
They think it's a cover-up to protect the person or people responsible for their son's death.
“They sent their son to school with a school bag, and he was returned to them in a body bag,” he said.
U.S. Attorney Michael Moore said on Thursday that he was conducting an official investigation into Johnson's death, noting that several key questions remain unanswered.
What was the cause of death?
Was his death the result of a crime?
Moore made a statement at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I'll study all the facts, wherever they lead.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I hold the view that there are sufficient grounds" for the official investigation, he said.
Moore told reporters that the initial revelation showed that Johnson died as a result of “positional asphyxiation.”
However, the second revelation, according to Moore, showed a different cause of death.
“There are a few issues that need to be resolved or clarified,” he said.
Moore added that if he finds enough evidence to demand a criminal or civil investigation into Johnson's death, he will ask the FBI to conduct it.
A representative of the Loundes County Sheriff's Department was not available for comment when he was approached on Thursday.
A judge in South Georgia on Wednesday ordered authorities to publish all video footage of surveillance cameras that investigators had viewed.
The teenager’s parents said they hope the videos contain the key to the mystery of how he died.
"Spartak": For information about the persons who hung the fascist symbol
On the official website of Spartak appeared the statement of the Moscow club regarding the appearance of the fascist flag on the tribune in Yaroslavl.
"In the Cup match "Shinnik" - "Spartak" on October 30, unknown provocateurs at the stadium in Yaroslavl demonstrated fascist symbolism.
We appeal to anyone who has reliable information about the persons who committed this criminal offence, with a request to provide it to the <0x3C>security service of FC Spartak-Moscow" at the e-mail address fcsmsec<0x40>spartak.com.
“Remuneration is guaranteed,” the statement said.
We are looking for fans who hung a fascist flag in Yaroslavl
Recall that in the match 1/16 final of the Cup of Russia "Shinnik" - "Spartak" was interrupted several times due to riots on the stands.
Also, fascist symbolism was demonstrated in the Spartak fan sector.
In the form of a penalty, Spartak can hold about three matches without spectators.
A committee meeting will be held on Friday.

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Issued Recommendations for Schools on Allergy in Children
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published a list of recommendations for the control of food allergies in children in schools.
This is the first list of such recommendations issued by the U.S. government, while the number of school-age children suffering from food allergies is growing.
Today, one in 20 children in the United States has a food allergy.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that the prevalence of food allergies among children increased by 18 per cent from 1997 to 2007.
The guide contains information for schools on how to raise awareness of teachers and caregivers about food allergies in children and how to provide assistance in the event of an allergic reaction.
It also recommends that schools keep supplies of adrenaline — most often used for injections with the EpiPen automatic medical syringe — to help with potentially fatal anaphylaxis.
State legislatures have recently made changes to the regulations to allow schools to make adrenaline reserves with less difficulty.
The notification also contains a list of typical symptoms that are described by children who have had an allergic reaction.
Children can say, “It feels like something’s sticking in my tongue,” “It feels like I have hair on my tongue,” or “the tongue pinch.”
Parents of intersex children may choose ‘uncertain sex’
Germany became the first European country to recognize the third sex in children born with external sexual organs of the intermediate type.
Newborns will no longer need to be attributed to male or female sex.
The new law does not require parents to name any gender of such children, allowing parents to indicate the gender as “uncertain” or “unidentified” in their birth certificates.
The purpose of the law was to remove pressure from parents who can make hasty decisions about the sex-assignment operation to newborns, and to combat discrimination against intersex people.
One intersex man, according to the BBC, said many years later: “I am neither a man nor a woman.”
I will remain a doctor-created shiny product with bruises and scars.
About one in two thousand children born each year is neither a boy nor a girl.
They have intersexuality, one of about 60 pathological conditions that fall under the diagnosis of "sexual developmental disorder" - a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, gonads (ovaries or seedlings) or abnormally developed external sexual organs.
Wallis Simpson may have been an intersex person.
Gender identification has not yet been sufficiently studied, but most experts in the United States say that if the sex cannot be determined, it is better to use all the available information and assign it than to wait for and track the outcome of the operation if the psychological and physical development is not determined.
New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Dresher, who specializes in gender identity issues, said the new German law “sounds like a good idea.”
Intersex children create an ethical dilemma.
“Some people have life-threatening disorders that require prompt intervention, but most children don’t,” he said.
You can assign the floor without surgery and then see how the personality develops.
The science of how a child develops any gender identity is not too accurate.
No one can answer questions about why this is happening.
It's like a mystery as to why people are gay.
The report, sent to the European Commission in 2011, describes intersex people as being different from transgender or transgender, as their condition is not related to gender, but to their biological structure, which is neither sexual nor gender-appropriate for males nor females.
These characteristics can be manifested in secondary sexual signs, such as muscle mass, hair distribution, breast and body structure; primary sexual signs, such as reproductive organs and genitalia, or in the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
The report also provides a general overview of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender people in employment, as well as the level of harassment, cruelty and crimes on the grounds of prejudice.
Boys with gender biases now have a special camp.
Australia and Nepal already allow adults to put male, female or “third sex” in their official documents.
In June, the 52-year-old resident of Australia Norry May-Walby became the first person in the world to be recognized as "sexless", defending in court the right to preserve "uncertain" sexual status for life.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, German passports will use the third designation in addition to M and F — X, that is, intersex.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are still causing controversy, according to a news release on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of legislators from France, this highly expressed Catholic country, signed a petition to remove “gender theory” from school textbooks.
The American website Catholic Online also expressed disagreement with German law, writing that "in a situation where the world is dragged into a new state, where sex is the subject of choice, and sexual activity - no, we are reversing two more pillars of civilization."
A mother of a newborn child from Maryland also told the Baby Zone website that she would prefer that the children were given a sex at birth.
“Growing a child is hard enough and without any additional restrictions, especially if you don’t know the gender of your child,” she told the parent’s website.
Children need stability and self-confidence.
Historically, children born with male and female sexual organs were called hermaphrodites — after the name of a beautiful Greek god who had the features of both sexes.
And just ten years ago, the medical community perceived gender as a sheet on which everything can be erased and then drawn again.
But now many dispute the ethical grounds for surgery, knowing that gender identity is complicated, and doctors sometimes make the wrong choice, not knowing how the child will perceive the sex assigned to him when he grows up.
“In the middle of the 20th century, this was called an ‘emergency psychiatric case,’” Drescher said.
When such children were born, you didn't call a psychiatrist, you called a surgeon.
The dominant theory on how to treat children with intermediate-type genitalia was proposed by Dr. John Manny of Johns Hopkins University, who believed that gender is easy to change.
He coined the term “gender identity” and argued that environmental signals, including social signals — how parents raise a child — interact with the child’s genes and hormones, determining whether a person will consider himself a man or a woman.
But in one 1966 case, known as John/John, his theories were questioned.
He advised the parents of the boy, whose penis was damaged during a careless circumcision, to fully castrate the child, also remove his testicles, and raise him as a girl.
“Mani presented the case as a successful example of a transition, but that was not the case,” Drescher said.
When the boy was about 15 years old, he became a boy again and married a woman.
At the age of 38, he committed suicide.
Drescher said that some doctors are still “applying this model.”
But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, people who survived these sex-change operations declared themselves “dissatisfied with the result.”
This was the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with male XY chromosomes but intermediate-type genitalia.
Doctors could not determine exactly whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis, and were convinced that he would never be able to live a "full life" of a man.
Therefore, shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce's external genitals and ovaries were surgically removed, and he was raised as a girl.
He was given female hormones at the age of 12.
“I knew I wasn’t a girl,” he told ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was very difficult to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he was assigned to vaginoplasty.
But being depressed and realizing that something was wrong, he demanded medical documentation.
What he found out was terrible.
I was sterilized at birth, and no one ever told me about it.
Bruce was born with a sexual developmental disorder that did not allow his body to produce enough testosterone for normal genital development.
Upon learning the truth, he again became a man, getting injections of testosterone and removing his breast.
The operation made him infertile.
Today, he is advocating for others in an organization called the Interface Project, trying to normalize the perception of people with intersexuality.
But Ann Thamar-Mattis, the executive director of the California law association Advocates for Informed Choice, is concerned that German law “inspires labeling and stigma.”
“Many activists are concerned that German law will prompt parents to make an urgent decision and give the child ‘uncertain sex,’” she said.
We are afraid that it will facilitate the intervention.
We believe that it is better to assign the male or female sex and then wait.
But we have not yet seen how this law will manifest itself, so all we can do is make assumptions.
Tamar-Mattis said her organization supports Australian law as it “enables adults to make a choice in favor of a third gender.”
“Adults should be able to make their own decisions about formal sexuality,” she says.
German law entails its assignment at birth.
This is a battle that young children should not enter at this stage.
When they grow up, they will be able to make decisions about their own body.
But Dr. Arlin Baratz, a Pittsburgh-based mammologist who has a daughter with impaired sexual development and who helps hundreds of other people in the support group, said German law “supports” both parents and children.
Baratz's daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but she has a sexual developmental disorder called "full androgen insensitivity syndrome."
Since her androgen receptors are incorrectly working, Katie has developed feminine signs.
She has a vagina, but no uterus and ovaries.
Now, at the age of 29, Katie is married and is attending an Ordinary of Children’s Psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although she is infertile, she hopes to become a parent through adoption or gestational surrogate motherhood.
“The law gives parents time not to make hasty decisions on their own,” Barats said.
It gives them time to do some analysis and figure out the situation, as well as the amount of time before they write “male” or “female”.
In this case, you are okay — raise a child, love a child.
You have a wonderful child, and you feel joy.
We don't have to rush an operation that's irreversible.
“This allows children to participate in the decision and eliminates the excitement that drives parents because they don’t feel they’re doing the right thing,” she said.
In the end, the child will decide with which sex he or she is more comfortable, and it is wonderful.
This gives children the opportunity to make their own decisions.
Chicago goalkeeper Nikolai Habibulin stressed: he understands that he has to play better.
According to the 40-year-old Russian, he will continue to work hard on training.
In the last two matches of the Jastrebov Habibulin first missed six wasps from Tampa Bay, then four from Ottawa, and in the second game he was replaced after the fourth missed wasps.
We have to play well, and in the last two games I didn't manage to do that," CSNChicago said.
“I have to find confidence in training, I think I should approach them as a game, and try to achieve a better result.
You have to study your past games and work on those shortcomings that have been.
There are a few small components that I need to improve, but I feel pretty good on my workouts.
But for some reason after a few heads everything turns into some kind of snow coma.
Maybe I need to relax a little.
The goalkeepers – I don’t think I’m alone – are always trying to make the perfect game.
If I miss four, five, six, I'm not excited.
It doesn’t matter what happens in front of my door.
I'm still working on myself so I don't miss so many washes.
It’s good that my buddies support it, but in principle it’s simple: I have to play better.
“Two games are not the whole season, but I wanted to have them a lot better.
But it happened that it happened.
I have to put it aside.
I’m just going to try to play the next game better.

Medvedev expects SSJ-100 aircraft to be delivered to Europe
Russia expects that after the fixation in the markets of Latin America and Asia, the Superjet 100 aircraft will also be delivered to Europe.
"We expect that in total we will receive such agreements for more than 170 copies of aircraft of this type," Interfax quoted Prime Minister of Russia Dmitry Medvedev as saying at a press conference with France.
The head of the Russian government noted that serious cooperation with French colleagues has been established, as it is a joint project.
We discussed some financial issues related to insurance today, but we hope that once this aircraft is strengthened in the markets of Latin America and the Asia-Pacific region, it will also be delivered to our partners in Europe.
"I hope that one day it will be delivered to France," the Russian prime minister said.
SSJ-100 is an aircraft built by the company "Civil Aircraft Dry" in partnership with Alenia Aermacchi.
The liner is developed on the basis of modern technology and offers high standards of quality and comfort in the 100-passenger segment.
Energy engineers of Dnepropetrovsk started a unique program of rescue...
In the olden days, to lead to the yard of the donkeys, the peasants mounted a wheel from the cart on a high pillar, and the heavy nest was well held on it.
Such special supports have not been put for a long time, so the Aists loved columns of power lines - interwoven branches rely on wires, thanks to which a real house stands reliably.
Grandmother Anja, near whose house a real family has lived in the village of Ivanovka Petrikovsky district for twenty years, began to notice how the nest settles, despite all the efforts of its inhabitants.
Birds lay new branches on top, and the lower layer has already passed between the wires, here it will collapse.
Of course, sadly, the seven donkeys, who each year nested at the yard, brought out and fed for the summer three or four chicks, but even without the light do not want to stay.
As soon as the birds flew to the warm edges, Grandmother Anja called the Tsarichansky power plant, which owns the support.
I didn’t expect them to react so quickly.
When our specialists arrived in Ivanovka, they were surprised that the nest is still standing at all, - said the technical director of the DTEK "Dneprooblanergo" Sergey Berezovsky.
On the wires, which were, in fact, already inside the socket, weighing 150-200 kilograms, began corrosion.
At any moment, the birds could be killed by an electric shock.
The locals also risked being left without light due to damage to the wires.
Therefore, the liners began the operation to save the nest, and not for the first time in our practice.
Scientists-ornithologists from the Dnepropetrovsk National University helped to develop a scheme for the transfer of the nest.
They also conducted trainings for employees of district networks.
The famous Dnepropetrovsk ornithologist Alexander Ponomarenko consulted energy scientists at all stages of the reconstruction of the nests.
To begin with, it was calculated that there are more than 50 real "apartments" in the area in a state of emergency.
For their reconstruction were welded special metal platforms, resembling a funnel.
The base was woven with ivory branches, and then moved an old nest there.
According to experts, it is enough to lay old branches as a basis for the birds to recognize the nest and return to it.
After that, the aristocrats will build their own homes.
A month ago, the first nest was reconstructed in the village of Peschanka of Novomoskovsky district.
Next to the electric pole was placed a new concrete pillar and placed on it a platform with an old, already enclosed nest.
The whole operation cost the energy workers nine thousand hryvnias.
And in the days the same new settlement took place in the village of Ivanovka Petrikovsky district in the yard of grandmother Ani.
Here the platform was fixed in the previous place, only raised above the wires.
Ornithologists are sure that cautious, conservative birds will not even notice in the spring that their "apartment" was subject to capital repair.
By the end of the year, the same reconstruction awaits four more nests in Pokrovsky and Tsarichansky districts of Dnepropetrovsk.
By the way, while some save rare birds, others relentlessly kill them.
In the days, the whole area was covered with sad news - in the village of Ust-Kamenka Apostolovsky district, on the day of the discovery of the hunt for fazans, cockroaches for entertainment shot a swan family living on a local pond.
Noble birds were not afraid of humans at all - the locals fed them and did not hurt them.
When the villagers heard the shots, they ran to the pond, and the four beautiful swamps were already lying dead on the water.
Now the employees of the Apostolic District Department of the police find out who shot at the birds included in the Red Book.
"Russian March" is becoming more popular
On November 4, on the Day of People's Unity, a concerted "Russian March" will take place in Moscow.
According to the survey of the Levada Center, the support of the Russian marches is growing - already 40% of citizens to varying degrees approve the idea of their holding.
According to the Levada Center, 40% of citizens to varying degrees approve of the holding of "Russian marches": of these, 11% are definitely positive and 29% - "rather positive".
The popularity of the idea of "Russian marches" is gradually growing - in 2006, these actions were welcomed by only 14% of Russians, and in December 2010, the holding of such events was already supported by double the number of citizens (28%).
“Definitely negative” to “Russian marches” are only 7% of Russians, “rather negative” – 19%.
A further 35% were unable to formulate their attitude to this stock.
This year, the mayor of Moscow agreed to hold a "Russian March" of up to 15,000 people in Lublin, the head of the security department of the capital, Alexei Majorov, said today.
This campaign of nationalists has been held every year on the Day of National Unity since 2005.
On the question of sociologists “Did you hear about the “Russian marches” being held in Russia on November 4 under slogans of protection of Russian rights in Russia?” three-quarters (75%) of citizens answered negative.
Currently, only one in five Russians (20%) know about this stock.
It is noteworthy that in December 2010, almost a third of citizens (31%) heard about "Russian marches".
Recall that three years ago on December 11 in Manezhnaya Square there was a natural rally of nationalists, which turned into mass unrest.
“Levada Center” also asked the Russians about what holiday is celebrated on November 4.
In two years, the number of people who know the right answer (People’s Unity Day) has increased from 41% to 49%.
However, only 15% of citizens are going to celebrate this holiday.
Approximately as many (17%) intend to celebrate the 7th of November Day of the October Revolution.
Most citizens (62%) are not going to celebrate any of these holidays.
How the mayor of Moscow agreed on the "Russian March" in Lublin
On October 28, the capital authorities agreed to hold the "Russian March" on November 4 in Ljubljana.
This was reported by the leader of the association "Russian", organizer of the march Dmitry Demushkin.
In addition to the march in Ljubljana on the Day of People's Unity will be held a rally and rock concert of the group "Colour", also agreed with the authorities.
How did the "Russian March-2012" go?
On the Day of National Unity in 2012, the nationalists marched from the Yakimanska promenade to the Artist’s Central House, where the rally took place.
The organizers estimated the number of participants at 20,000 people, the Ministry of Interior called the figure 6,000.
Report: Obama’s Electoral Headquarters Considered Biden’s Exemption in favour of Hillary Clinton
According to The New York Times, President Barack Obama’s closest advisers secretly considered replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton’s 2012 nomination in the ballot box.
This discovery is the brightest sensation from all-expected book by Mark Galperin and John Hailemann about the 2012 campaign "Bets Doubled: The Game Changed 2012".
The Times received a copy of the forthcoming book and reported on Thursday evening that the president’s closest aides had conducted “scale studies in focus groups and public opinion polls at the end of 2011” to assess whether Biden’s exception could help.
According to The Times political critic Jonathan Martin, the book gives a detailed description of the attempts of high-ranking election officials and the White House, namely the former head of the White House administration, Bill Daley, to assess the effect of the Gothenburg administration.
The possible replacement was a secret, carefully guarded in the Chicago election headquarters and in the Oval Office.
Only six of the president’s closest advisers — including Daley, former head of Obama’s election headquarters Jim Messin and former White House senior advisers David Axelrod and David Pluff — knew the replacement was under consideration.
The book "Double Bets" claims that Daley was the initiator of an attempt to replace Biden despite their "close personal relationship", but ultimately gave up this step when their data was better shown that Clinton's addition to the "non-election list."
In an interview with Martin Daley, he confirmed that the administration was indeed considering replacing Biden Clinton.
“I was actively in favor of considering a lot of things, and that was one of them,” Daley told the paper.
You have to remember that the president was in terrible shape at the time, so we thought, “Oh my God, what should we do?”
Although Daley described the study as a “necessary check,” Martin told CNN representative Anderson Cooper that the election headquarters had invested quite a bit in the study of whether this step would bring dividends to the vote.
“Election staff don’t spend such amounts of money on polls and focus groups unless they take something seriously,” Martin said in the AK 360 program.
It is unclear, however, whether Obama knew that his team was studying the possibility of a replacement.
Martin told CNN that he had asked Daley if his then boss knew about a possible move.
Although Daley said he did not think the president “was aware” of a possible replacement, the former head of the administration admitted that “maybe” Obama knew.
Martin added that “Double stakes” does not provide a clear answer to the question of whether the results of the political probe reached the Obama desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he was serious about Obama’s lack of knowledge about the possibility of banning Biden from the electoral roll.
“Maybe,” Martin replied.
Do you want to shine in the dark of ice cream?
A British entrepreneur created the world’s first dark-lighted ice cream with the help of a jellyfish.
Charlie Francis used the fluorescent properties of a sea animal to develop luminous food.
He came up with this idea after reading a scientific article about jellyfish, and convinced scientists in China to chemically recreate the glowing protein.
Ice cream reacts with the tongue of the person who eats it, increasing the pH level in the protein and causing it to shine.
Chris says that as the ice cream starts to glow when it reacts to the heat of the mouth, it means that the more you lick, the brighter it becomes.
Charlie, the founder of the ice cream production company “Lisney me, I’m delicious,” says, “It’s an amazing thing, but it’s still in the very early stages of production, so for <0xC2><0xA3>200 you’ll get about 2 grams of the substance.”
The protein we use in ice cream reacts with your tongue at a neutral pH.
Therefore, when your mouth heats up the protein, it will increase the pH level and the ice cream will start to glow.
We’ve been testing it for the last few months, and it seemed like it would be perfect to introduce it to Halloween because it creates such an amazing glowing effect.
It’s probably the most expensive ice cream I’ve ever made, because the luminescence of the jellyfish is four times more expensive than gold.
So each ball costs me about <0xC2><0xA3>140.
But it's pretty nice to taste.
Charlie’s experimental company, located in Bristol, is famous for its unusual flavors, including beer, cheese, beef, and the taste of sour gold.
But his next creation must prove to be even more ambitious.
He said, “I really want to make invisible ice cream.”
This is by definition impossible because of the breakage caused by ice crystals, which are made up of ice, but I think we'll find a way to do it.
Ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of jellyfish synthesized by Chinese scientists
Coach "Avangarde" Vladimir Chebaturkin, speaking about the preparation of his team for the regular KHL championship match against "Salavata", noted that the omics carried out a thorough analysis of the defeat from the magnetogorsk "Metallurga".
The specialist emphasized that "Avant-garde" should pay increased attention to the game in defense.
We watched the video of the match against Magnitogorsk "Metallurg", - according to the official website "Avangarde" of Chebaturkin.
- We missed a lot of showers, not a very pleasant moment.
They missed because of their mistakes, because of the failure of the game task.
We knew the competitor had performers.
According to the statistics, they had five attacks on the move - three wasps shot us.
A very good implementation.
Were these mistakes taken into account when preparing for today’s game?
We and the boys understand every game carefully, we talk after the game, we prepare for a new competitor.
The main thing is that the installation is done.
Everyone saw the first period of the match against the Metallurge.
The game was played and the score was 2-0.
They missed the goal "in the dressing room" - and in the third period began to be wrong.
Given the difficulty of the game, it did not make sense to connect the defenders.
We have to defend the whole team.
Now the Avant-garde has a long home series, the matches go through the day - the team has accumulated fatigue?
All teams are in the same condition.
The main thing now is to realize your moments and perform the game task.
Hockey is an emotional game, if you do the installation - everything is not so difficult to solve.
Due to the new rules introduced by Russian customs, hundreds of furs have been in line on the border with Russia for almost a week.
Today, Donetsk officials promised to provide drivers with drinking water and to install bio-toilets
Hundreds of fur have accumulated at the border points when entering Russia.
This situation arose due to a change in the rules of customs clearance of goods.
Ukrainian border guards and customs officers confirm: the turn is created by the Russian side, which did not warn about the innovations in advance.
From October 28, the customs authorities of Russia began to apply additional measures to guarantee the delivery of goods, - said Deputy Head of the Eastern Customs Vladimir Denisov.
The new model document is applicable to countries that have acceded to the Convention on International Carriage.
The pass points are working in an enhanced mode.
The correspondent "FACTOV" visited the border and spoke with the long-distance fighters who were hostages of the situation.
Prices in the street coffee shop at the crossing point "Novoazovsk" are increasing every day, as is the turn from the fur.
The trucks stand in several rows, stretching for about two kilometers.
The Novoazovsk-Veznesenka Customs Terminal provides one of the most important transport routes from the south of Ukraine on the international highway.
From here, the goods are sent to the Stavropol region of Russia, Kazakhstan, Georgia, Armenia.
On Sunday before midnight, they were still allowed, and after introducing these rules, - complains long-distance fighter Alexey Golovanev (pictured), who carries cargo from Turkey to Kazakhstan by transit through Russia and has been sleeping in his car for almost a week.
Under the new rules, in order to cross the border, I need an additional package of documents and payment of freight insurance.
The amount depends on the cost of the cargo and the distance to which it is carried.
Minimum insurance - 4.5<0xE2><0x88><0x92>5 thousand rubles (about 1100<0xE2><0x88><0x92>1300 hryvnias).
Those who go near (say, to Georgia, Armenia) with cargo worth up to $ 50,000, pay somewhere 15 thousand rubles (3800 hryvnias) and travel.
And the others are stuck - because no one has such big money with them!
Imagine, if the driver carries a cargo of only four thousand dollars, but as far as Moscow, he needs 90 thousand rubles (almost 23 thousand hryvnias) to pay for the transit!
The conditions for survival at the border - no, - saturates the long-distance fighters, who arranged to eat near their cars.
In border shops and cafes and so always expensive, but such prices as here, we have never met anywhere!
The sellers sorted out and quickly pushed them: 15 hryvnias is worth a bar, seven hryvnias - a cup of coffee, 25 hryvnias - a plate of soup.
And the coffee alone.
And there's no toilet.
We sleep in the steppe and go to the toilet.
No washing, no shaving...
I can't get out of the car for a week, my wife prepared everything for me on the road.
For a week, - comforts another long-distance fighter Viktor Skotarenko.
Is it only going to come to my car in a week?
Why do you have one and a half liters of water? - we are interested in the only border shop.
There are 11 and 15 hryvnias.
What, a crystal bottle or water infused on silver?
We have a cafe, not a shop.
Take it while there's something else," the salesman says.
After the situation began to be clarified in the media, the disastrous situation of Ukrainian drivers was brought to the attention of the authorities of the region.
The leadership of the Amvrosiev and Novoazov regional administrations have been instructed to provide all those who proselytize in the queue on the Ukrainian-Russian border with drinking water, - said the acting chairman of the Donetsk regional administration.
At the crossing points, ambulance brigades are now in service.
Bio-toilets will also be installed for the convenience of people.
According to the official, the problem related to the queues will be solved in the coming days.
According to the press service of the Donetsk Regional Administration, as of October 31, 32 and 68 cars were parked at the international crossing points of Uspenka and Novoazovsk, respectively.
"Facts" will monitor the development of the situation.
Vilnius Suspects Moscow in Trying to Blame the Lithuanian President
Russia intends to carry out information provocations against high-ranking Lithuanians and Eastern Partnership countries, a statement made to the BNS agency in the Department of State Security of the Republic (DGB).
Information about this is published on the Delfi portal.
According to the report, in particular, Moscow is going to “talk” to Lithuanian President Daliu Gribauskaite and publish falsified documents allegedly found in the Russian Gosarhiv, which relate to facts from the biography of the Lithuanian leader.
According to the intelligence service, the preparation of the information attack is carried out by the department of analysis of the social processes of the administration of the President of Russia on interregional and cultural relations with foreign countries.
The structure is headed by Evgeny Umerenkov, who visited Lithuania several times and participated in the Congress of the Lithuanian People’s Party.
Also the participant of the operation is allegedly the employee of the department V. Smirnov.
According to the intelligence service, Smirnov under the cover of scientific work until the end of 2012 regularly came to Lithuania and contacted local politicians, political scientists and media representatives.
Smirnov is now banned from entering the territory of the country.
The President of Lithuania Gribauskaite said on the eve that he knew about the information tack that was being prepared for it.
In her opinion, the main reason is Lithuania’s successful Presidency of the Council of the European Union and “the country’s aspiration for energy independence”.
The Lithuanian leader has previously repeatedly criticized the actions of the Russian authorities.
Thus, she stated that in the Kremlin, Lithuania is treated "not respectfully enough".
In addition, Gribauskaite accused the head of Russia Vladimir Putin of proposing to Lithuania "only one requirement".
In September, Rospotrebnadzor suspended the import of Lithuanian "milk" to Russia.
It was reported that the quality of the products does not meet the sanitary and epidemiological standards.
At the time, the Lithuanian leader said that if Russia does not lift the ban, the country’s government should prepare for a WTO appeal.
In the United States, the school principal shot at teenagers.
The director of one of America’s high schools has literally brought the teenagers to despair.
The man, he said, was forced to take a gun and start shooting.
The incident occurred in the state of Tennessee.
As the New York Post writes, juvenile hooligans dumped a man’s house with toilet paper.
Because of this, the school's director opened a shootout on teenagers, which resulted in several injuries to the leg and arm of a 15-year-old boy.
Since the hooligans were not in the director ' s property, he was charged with assault under aggravating circumstances.
The man was released from prison for $125,000.
The shooting of civilians in the United States is becoming a terrifying pattern.
A man literally opened fire in the center of the city of Ridgecross in the U.S. state of California just across the street.
After that, the perpetrator took two random passers-by hostages, hid them in the trunk of the car and tried to hide.
Previously, a shooting was opened at Newtown Elementary School, Connecticut.
Adam's mother worked at the school, she was an educator.
U.S. school shooting: 14-year-old girl injured
Another shooting incident occurred on January 31 at an American school, this time in Annante (Georgia).
Two people were injured: a 14-year-old student and a teacher.

Halloween in the year 2013.
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, not to go to bed and arrange a masquerade for our area.
Now I look more like a squirrel.
I haven’t been challenged in the last two years to distribute candy in my apartment, and I probably won’t be there this year.
However, statistics show that I'm a white crane when it comes to Halloween.
According to the National Retail Federation, the majority of Americans — 158 million — will celebrate Halloween this year and spend a total of $6.9 billion on candy, costumes and jewelry.
The only thing I'm waiting for every Halloween is trends.
The National Retail Federation predicts that the costumes will cost $1.2 billion out of the $6.9 billion spent.
This year at the top of the fashion sexy uninspired items.
Women no longer have to be representatives of sex professions; they can also be sexual food, such as pizza, hamburgers or carrots.
As for men, I think we’ll see a lot of zombies thanks to Walking Dead, and I’m sure Daft Punk-style astronauts will be on our Instagram ribbons this year.
According to Google, the costumes they are looking for most often are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
There's probably nothing wrong with the traditional approach.
We dressed our dogs last year and, to my surprise, we were not the only ones.
What’s more, according to the National Retail Federation, Americans will spend $330 million this year on pet costumes.
That means a lot of funny dogs-hotdogs.
When it comes to confectionery, we don’t get too small.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion on them this year, according to Nielsen.
It’s about 600 million pounds of Hershey chocolates, candies, Milk Duds candy, Twizzlers chewable candy and Clark Bar sticks.
According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, this is great news for the 41 million confectioners who are preparing to conquer our areas.
What’s more, we buy and — let’s not fool ourselves — eat 90 million pounds of chocolate during Halloween.
The only thing we don’t want to use is candy in the form of corn grains; and yet, according to the National Conditors Association, almost <0xC2><0xA3>35m is sold under Halloween.
That’s about 9 billion separate grains of corn.
It's a mystery I still have to solve.
Nothing expresses the essence of Halloween like a house with ghosts.
They have astonishing titles such as “The Horror Behind the Walls” (which, by the way, is in the real prison), “Woo and Cry” and “Home of Shock”.
What’s more, according to America Haunts, there are 1,200 officially recognized haunted homes in America that generate about $500 million in revenue, as well as those amazing photos where you almost described a picture of a couple that your friend posted on Facebook, and you can’t remove, you can’t take away, you can take away.
Finally, let’s talk about pumpkins.
Charlie Brown introduced us to the Big Pumpkin when we were kids, and cutting out Jack’s lamp is like decorating a Christmas tree, what we’ve been doing since we were kids.
Luckily for us, the pumpkin baby fashion only started last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up cutting out these pumpkins and not sitting in them.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins this year.
Jack’s lantern, slowly drying on your wing, probably came from the state of Illinois, which has grown 542 million pounds of pumpkin this year.
If you want more complicated tasks, visit Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California, and try to cut out any of their pumpkin weighing in 2032 pounds.
Estonian Defense Ministry Restores Site After Attack of Ukrainian Hackers
The website of the Estonian Ministry of Defense has been restored after the morning cyber attack, the ministry's press service reports.
According to the Deputy Chancellor of the Ministry of Defense on Information and Administrative Affairs, Tymar Petrokop, it was a primitive attack, the site simply overloaded with a large number of requests.
Our specialists quickly set everything up, by now the site has been restored.
“The damage done to the ministry is minimal,” Peterkop told Postimees.
According to Peterkop, it is too early to talk about who organized the attacks.
"We will certainly analyze the causes of the incident and make our conclusions from it, but it is completely impossible to prevent such incidents," he admitted.
On November 1, the group Anonymous Ukraine posted a message on the network confirming the hacking attack on the website of the Ministry of Defence of Estonia and spoke out against the partnership of Ukraine and NATO.
We want the leadership of NATO to hear our voice, the voice of the Ukrainian people.
We should not be NATO’s servants.
Ukrainians do not want to die for the interests of NATO member states.
Ukraine does not need a NATO bloc.
Ukraine does not need the European Union.
Ukraine does not need Russia.
Ukraine should not be a slave to anyone.
We are in favour of an independent Ukraine.
“Hands away from Ukraine,” Anonymous said in a statement.
Earlier, the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine reported that the Marine Corps of the Teodosian Separate Battalion of the Ukrainian Marine Corps will participate in the command and staff exercises of NATO’s Steadfast Jazz-2013 response forces.
Due to the turmoil of the unclean force had to close several schools and hospitals
Four schools in the Zimbabwean province of South Matabeleland had to be closed due to the fact that the students were being attacked... by goblins.
As the local elder told me, the children panicked, and it was impossible to continue the classes.
The story of the goblins may sound like a child’s invention to a European, but in Africa it’s a pretty serious argument for closing the school.
Adults are also afraid of dirty power.
In the summer, for example, in Zimbabwe, the hospital was closed due to the fact that the medical personnel were also attacked by goblins.
Announced the launch of the Land Rover racing series
Inside are racing seats and six-point seat belts, as well as an internal link system.
In addition, you can get upgraded brakes, a package of services providing access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistics support and car storage between events.
Drew Bauler, Managing Director of Bowler Motorsport, said: “The participants of the rally who turn to Bowler have changed.”
Some of them are not experienced racers, but people looking for excitement, adventure and access to world-class events.
We are pleased to offer this path in partnership with Land Rover and MSA and believe that this format offers a new way to try out different disciplines of the rally in the UK and abroad, as well as to prepare participants for the difficult conditions and realities of the rally.
“We were very pleased to have developed the Defender Challenge – it will be a really exciting championship.
In addition, the Defender Challenge provides one day in February for training and testing, as well as the opportunity to participate in desert events in North Africa and the Middle East.
Russian security forces do not know anything about the group "Brotherhood" - Novye Izvestia
About this writes INTERFAX.RU with reference to an informed source in the law enforcement authorities of the Russian Federation.
"After the media reported that the U.S. Department of Finance had placed Leps on checklists on suspicion of belonging to the Eurasian criminal syndicate 'Brother Circle', we looked at all the databases, but did not find such a grouping," the official said.
In his opinion, the dissemination of this information contributes to the maintenance of the myth of the so-called Russian mafia, which allegedly operates abroad.
As previously written “WE”, yesterday the U.S. Treasury Department published on its website a list of alleged members of the criminal group “Brother Circle”.
Among them was the Russian singer Gregory Leps.
He appears on the list as Grisha, posted the day before.
They coincide with the data of the popular Russian performer.
The exact name - Grigory Lepsevridze, creative pseudonym, place and date of birth.
In addition to Leps, there are five other people mentioned there.
Two Russians, a citizen of Israel, a citizen of Uzbekistan and another one from the former USSR, whose nationality is not indicated.
In the United States, it is certain that Gregory Leps, who lives on the island of Phuket, transported money for the bandits on their order.
The photo of the singer is attached to this message and all of his data that corresponds to the reality is indicated.
Moreover, Leps really recently bought a house in Phuket.
The ministry said it intends to impose sanctions on Leps.
The blacklisting of a person by the U.S. Treasury means blocking his assets in the U.S. and banning him from doing business with individuals living in the United States.
Leps assistant Maya Serikova said that no notifications were received to the singer: "It is difficult to answer the question whether it is Gregory, whom everyone is talking about now in connection with the scandal in the United States."
All Leps knows is the news media.
Officially, there were no notifications to him personally, although I do not know if they are in such cases.
"And, of course, that's all, on the one hand, funny, and on the other hand, surprising and unexpected," she told RIA Novosti.
According to her, on Phuket, Gregory Leps does not live, but, according to the US Ministry of Finance, he does have a house on the Thai island.
She stated that Leps is now on a long tour of the Far East and Siberia, and that news stopped him during the flight to the city of Blagoveshchensk.
Escape to the field in the match "Shinnik"
Some details about the personality of the fan who escaped on the field during the 1/16 final of the Cup of Russia between Yaroslavl "Shinnik" and Moscow "Spartak" became known.
As stated by the head of the Central Committee of the Russian Federation, Arthur Grigoryants, referring to the data of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, this fan is a Moscow.
He is currently detained.
In addition, Grigoryants told about how the fan managed to break into the field: "It was clear that this, we call it the spectator, went to the ambulance accompanied by two spectators, referring to problems with the heart.
He went to the ambulance - this was confirmed by the ambulance doctor.
And then he pushed out two escorts and ran to the field.
He fled from the corner of the Eastern and Southern Tribune to the corner of the Eastern and Northern Tribune.
He ran all over the field.
This is the responsibility of the stewards.
Until the entry into force of the law on sports is the zone of action of the stewards - the police cannot interfere in what is on the field.
He reached the tribune, passing through the Eastern tribune.
And at this time, riots began on the Eastern Tribune and on the runways," - said the head of the KDC.
We will remind that the decision of the KDC, Moscow "Spartak" will hold without spectators the upcoming matches of the 15th round of the Russian championship against "Lokomotive" and "Zenita", and will also pay a fine of 600,000 rubles.
Fire crews were called up to rescue a lost puppy who was stuck at an altitude of 50 feet above the ground on a dangerous career recession.
Cocker Spaniel Ruby fled after getting into a small accident.
Three days later, she got stuck in a career, noticed a man walking the dog
Firefighters descend on a rope on a steep slope to save the dog from inevitable death
The puppy was lucky enough to be rescued after fire crews were called to lift him up and deliver him to a safe place, after he somehow stuck at a height of 50 feet on a dangerous slope slope.
Ruby, a nine-month-old spaniel, fled after she got into a car accident on Sunday and spent three days alone before being rescued from a career on Wednesday.
Her owners, 25-year-old Scott Alderson and his 20-year-old girlfriend Becky Hall, were at Flappy's career in Denholm, West Yorkshire to reunite with Ruby, and thanked the West York Fire Department.
They were feverishly looking for their missing dog and posted on social media sites after she ran into a career after a small accident.
At about 14:15 on Wednesday, the stardog spotted Ruby, stuck at a height of 50 feet on a career retreat.
The technical rescue team from Clekhiton's fire station rushed to the scene of the incident, went down on the ropes to rescue Ruby, and used a lift to lift her up the slope.
Andy Clayton, an emergency response officer, said: “She was in a dangerous position.”
It was right in the middle of the steep slope — 50 feet to the top and to the ground.
She didn't move a muscle during the rescue, she's completely frozen.
But now she's fine.
Then she ate the biscuits.
It was a very unusual challenge.
The fact that the dog was spotted is incredible.
Rescue Specialist Officer Peter Lau said: “Ruby is very lucky to have been rescued.”
There was a chance she could have gotten a very serious injury or worse.
Ruby was taken to the veterinarian for inspection, and it was found that she was okay, except for exhaustion and dehydration.
Ms. Hall of Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: “Watching the rescue was scary.”
I couldn't believe she was there at all.
It was amazing when she was in our hands again.
The veterinarian said that if she were to faint and lose consciousness, she would most likely fall.
The firefighters were great.
It was very brave, what they did.
We are so grateful, and each of them was absolutely amazing.
Mr. Alderson of Kitley added: “We were afraid that she might fall, but she stayed there.”
The firefighters were amazing.
I just can't believe she was there.
Mick Jagger Says He Didn't Play With Katie Perry When She Was 18
During an interview on the Australian radio show this week, the pop star stated that she was a backing vocalist for Jagger's 2004 song Old Habits Die Hard.
Perry said she had dinner with a veteran rocker and noted, “He played with me when I was 18.
She added: “It was a very long time ago, and he was very good.”
In a statement on Thursday, the representative of the 70-year-old Jagger said that he "categorically denies that he has ever beaten for Katie Perry."
The spokesperson added: “Maybe she’s confusing him with someone else.”
Perry was among the performers who appeared as guests on the Rolling Stones tour this year.
Her new album Prism debuted at number one this week.
George Kerevan: Breaking up with Europe gives Scots a choice
Another day, another scarecrow about independence.
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland will have to join the pan-European free movement zone as a condition of EU membership.
There are a number of stories about passport control in Bervik and the border with the pin wire along the Adrian's shaft.
However, the Strathclyde newspaper pointed to the possible economic benefits of more free movement across the rest of Europe, although – predictably – this did not appear in the headlines.
No one has also pointed out that EU member states spend a lot of time turning their formal rules the way they feel comfortable.
Since Scotland is not now part of the Schengen area, the continuation of non-compliance will be a cheap concession for Brussels in exchange for what it really wanted from the Scots.
So this is not a worthy story.
And it’s so old that it’s turned into a quarry: for the first time I heard a “duck” about what “independence means passport control,” at least 40 years ago.
And yet there is an interesting moment lost in the retelling of an ancient fairy tale.
Why does an independent Scotland have to obey the orders of Europe at all?
Why change the London Stock Exchange to the Brussels Stock Exchange, especially now?
Here’s the real European news: the great post-war plan to unite Europe has finally stalled.
With the euro crisis, the project “Europe” is officially dead.
Throughout the European Union, parties opposed to the EU or to the abolition of the euro as a single currency are gaining momentum.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic party "Alternative for Germany" - founded only this year - emerged from nowhere and received almost five million votes in the September federal elections, thus essentially expelling the "Free Democrats" (an analogue to the Liberal Democrats).
There has always been an internal opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis has become a turning point.
The tough austerity measures introduced by Berlin and the European Central Bank, and the bonds imposed on national economies through the preservation of a single currency, have led many people to think that the “Europe” project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with the fact that national governments are working with excessive budget deficits, which was fair only for Greece.
In fact, the Eurosystem has blocked its members at exchange rates that are beneficial to German exporters, which German politicians want to keep.
Without the possibility of devaluation of the national currency, southern Europe is in a pre-favoured position in terms of production capacity compared to Germany.
The only way to save money is to cut wages and government spending, which is actively supported by Berlin.
Behind the current problems of the budget and currency is a deeper problem of Europe’s productive capacities.
As a result of the complex of “green” energy measures implemented by Brussels, the cipher, which means subsidizing French and German energy companies at the expense of the consumer, European industry pays twice as much for electricity in the United States and four times more for gas.
This is paralysingly unfavourable price conditions, as we have already seen in Grangemouth.
No freezing of wages in the world will stop the crushing victory of cheap U.S. shale gas over the European petrochemical industry.
As a result, there is a rebellion, especially in France, once the fiercest supporter of the EU.
After the war, the French political elite saw the EU as a way to control Germany and put Paris on a level with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a means of obtaining political legitimacy, and has already imposed its own economic policy on Europe, leaving France’s ruined economy in a state of misery.
The result — the right-wing anti-EU party Marine Le Pen “National Front” has just won decisive additional elections, dropping the ruling party of the Socialists in third place.
The Front is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the vote — a timely warning to British workers that it cannot be assumed that the split among the right will automatically affect the left.
What does Le Pen do with its newfound popularity among the French white working class?
She wants to use the EU elections next year to create a bloc in the European Parliament against the EU and against the single currency.
If – and this is very likely – anti-EU parties will receive support in these elections, such a bloc will be able to take a dominant position in the European Parliament for the first time.
Here’s my opinion: soon-growing sentiments against the EU and against a single currency in Europe are coming together to destroy the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will again become a sort of floating “Europe of (sovereign) nations” that General de Gaulle liked.
Germany and several dependent economies may retain the euro, but France and southern Europe will recover their own currencies.
I suggest that the UK distances itself from this project in hopes of getting closer to the United States.
However, Washington’s growing interest in the Pacific Ocean points to the likelihood that Britain will remain unattended in the cold Atlantic.
What position does this leave Scotland in?
We can choose to be a region (in essence) of Little England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests, which means, among other things, sending Berlin and Brussels to hell.
I suspect that Scotland will be able to thrive under a more free European agreement, provided that we preserve our currency.
Cooperation with other non-federal countries would be easier in a non-federal Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should consider the possibility of repeating Norway's experience and preserving our economic independence.
The Government of the Scottish National Party in Scotland is, strangely enough, the most successful political movement in Europe, directed against the measures of the hard economy, which received an impressive majority of the votes of the Daoists in 2011 and of the Lieutian voters thanks to the objections against the cuts of the costs proposed (and real).
Scotland would now be foolish to vote for independence only in order to take the tough austerity measures imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Premature puberty: aging earlier
African-American and Latino-American girls tend to reach sexual maturity earlier than their white peers, studies show.
Physical changes do not mean that sexual maturation is close
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are to blame.
Experts believe that the obesity epidemic may be one of the launch mechanisms of early puberty
The tendency to early puberty is not so pronounced in boys
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etherige is a journalist who specializes in child health and family issues.
Should a mother be afraid if her daughter begins to form the conceptions of the mammary gland and grows the frontal hair at 7 or 8 years?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplovitz explained that these early physical changes are quite common among American girls and represent the norm.
“I spend a lot of time reassuring my parents — usually that doesn’t mean a rapid onset of full sexual maturity,” Kaplovitz said.
Evident signs of development, such as growing breasts, forehead and armpit hair and body odor, appear earlier in girls.
But there has been only a small shift in the age of menarche (the first menstruation) over the past four decades.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, down from 12.75 in 1970.
“After the breast begins to develop, it takes at least two or three years before the menarche,” said Kaplovitz, who is also the author of the book Early Puberty in Girls: How to Cope with This Common Problem.
Time is the most accurate test of how sexual maturation will progress.
There is discussion about what constitutes the actual onset of sexual maturity, but it is considered “premature” when breast enlargement is accompanied by a sharp increase in growth up to 8 years.
In most cases, the process will slow down or stop – this is something that the pediatrician can follow closely.
Faster progression can serve as a basis for tests by an endocrinologist to rule out serious problems such as tumors or cysts.
There are procedures to delay early menstruation and prevent another consequence: premature aging of the bones, which can ultimately lead to slowing growth and low growth in adulthood.
Recommendations for medication or hormone therapy are based on the child’s age, level of development, growth rate, and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplovitz is wary of the drugs, but admits that “the suppression of sexual maturation can alleviate the behavioral problems and feelings of girls that they are different from peers.”
Another big problem is clear: parents just don’t want their very young daughters to have menstruation.
“They’re worried about the risk of pregnancy or even how they’re dealing with hygiene issues,” Kaplovitz said.
“It was a shock,” recalls one woman whose daughter started menstruating at the age of 10.
Although there were signs and we talked about menstruation, it was not emotionally ready.
She came home from school scared and upset that she was the first of her friends.
There are many advertised theories about the causes of early puberty.
However, there is no consistent evidence that the hormones in milk or other food products, chemicals in the environment, or sexual messages in the media are to blame.
In boys - as in girls - sexual maturation occurs earlier.
Kaplovitz claims that the prerequisite that has the most weight is an obesity epidemic.
In 2001, he helped conduct a study of girls between the ages of 6 and 9, which linked the amount of fat in the body to periods of puberty.
Other data confirm this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.
In this country, African-American and Latin American girls tend to reach sexual maturity earlier than their white peers.
There are different explanations.
All over the world, early sexual maturity seems to be affected by everything from economic conditions and climate to genes.
Another mystery: although hair on the face and forehead of boys appears at a younger age, the tendency to complete early sexual maturation is not as pronounced as in girls.
Other doctors attending the AAP conference confirmed the complexity of the topic.
The appearance of acne and scalp hair occurs even in infants and children of childbearing age.
“We need to be careful about how we determine the true onset of sexual maturity,” said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at Gorieb Children’s Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not be shy to receive instructions from a pediatrician on how to talk to their child.
“This may mean an earlier than expected conversation,” Kaplovitz explained.
If you keep calm, your child will usually respond well.
Girls who blossom early need confirmation that even when this happens earlier than the one placed, this process is a normal part of life.
The American Boeing stuck in Chita is preparing to take off
Under the Treaty on the Open Sky, an American plane carrying out observation flights over Russia’s territory and making an unplanned landing in Chite on Wednesday, November 1, at 8:30 p.m. Moscow time, will leave the city’s air port.
The management of the airport allowed the flight on board, receiving money for fuel.
As reported at the airport, the plane will take off to Ulaanbaatar.
According to other data, he will go to the United States.
It was reported that the plane flying in Ulan-Ude landed in the Zabaikal region due to fog.
Due to unpaid bills, he was not released from Chita Airport.
There are 30 people on board the plane, including the crew, two nights they spent at the airport, reports ITAR-TASS.
According to the Russian Foreign Ministry, under the terms of the Open Sky Treaty, people on board the aircraft are not allowed to go outside the airport of Chita, they can pass border control only at two airports of Russia - in Kubink and in Ulaanbaatar.
The Open Skies Treaty was signed in 1992, involving 34 states.
Observation flights are carried out over the territories of Russia, the United States, Canada, the countries of Europe.
The main objectives of the Treaty are to develop transparency, to facilitate the monitoring of the implementation of arms control agreements, to expand the capacity to prevent crises and to resolve crisis situations within the framework of the OSCE and other international organizations.
How Much Do Dead Celebrities Earn - MK in USA MK
The rating of living celebrities with the highest income in 2013 was led by Madonna, who earned $125 million.
But it was "reflected" by the late Michael Jackson, whose post-mortem income from October 2012 to October 2013 amounted to 160 million.
Significantly, there are other celebrities left out of his life, who “earned” several times less last year.
The second in the list of the most "essential" gone celebrities, compiled by Forbes magazine by the end of the year was Elvis Presley - 55 million a year, and the bottom line is the author of the Peanuts comics Charles Schulz with 37 million.
In addition to them, the top five included Elizabeth Taylor, who was the leader last year (25 million), and musician Bob Marley (18 million).
The list also includes Marilyn Monroe, John Lennon and Albert Einstein.

It was with these words that Igor cut the red ribbon and invited all those who wanted... to sample the looking models!
Manufacturers of jet planes are angry about the width of the seat, when on the cone large orders
Between the top aircraft manufacturers a fierce dispute over the width of the tourist class seats on long-haul flights, setting the tone for the fierce confrontation at the Dubai Air Show this month.
The dispute revolves around the width of seats provided on long-haul flights to economy-class passengers, whose interests are not always at the center of attention of the airlines, with the volume of the available space for them, and the volume of the airbuses offered to them, as well as the airbuses, playing a key role in the approvals.
Airbus this week called for the introduction of an industry standard that would provide seat widths of at least 18 inches (46 cm) in economy-class salons, but its main U.S. competitor Boeing says it should be decided by the airline.
The dispute comes at a time when aircraft manufacturers are competing in the sales of increasingly larger versions of their two-engine long-haul aircraft, and at the event on November 17-21, potentially record orders are expected.
The component of the rear of the aircraft — especially whether 9 or 10 people sit in a row — occupies a central place in statements about the economic efficiency of new mini-aerobus projects.
Boeing claims that its updated 777X will accommodate 406 people, based on seats in the economy class more than 17 inches wide, placed 10 in each row.
Airbus says a competing version of its A350 will transport 350 people in economy class seats with a width of 18 inches, located at 9 in a row.
Aircraft giants are often exchanged for blows on technical issues with the help of advertising in the professional press.
Airbus is now addressing the public directly before the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X is expected to become the leader with more than 100 orders.
She recently demonstrated what the start of a new advertising war could be by showing financiers a slide depicting three people in a restaurant squeezing each other, titled “Would you agree to this?”
“Boeing offers long-haul flights on narrower seats than on regional turboprop aircraft,” said John Lihi, chief sales officer of Airbus.
With the change in diet, people gain weight, but airplane seats have not changed dramatically.
Between the early 1970s, when the wide-body Boeing 747 set the standards for modern long-distance travel, and abroad, the weight of the average American man aged 40 to 49 increased by 10 percent, according to the U.S. Department of Health.
The waist circumference of the average 21st-century American man is 39.7 inches, according to statistics from the U.S. Health Service.
Airbus claims that its competitor adheres to the 1950s concept of seating, when the average waist circumference of those recently called “reactive audiences” was already there.
Airbus says it has ordered a study that shows that an extra inch in width of the seat improves sleep quality by 53 percent.
Boeing is contesting Airbus seat-size figures and says manufacturers should not interfere in decisions on how airlines can find a balance between tariffs and conveniences.
According to her, studies show that the comfort of the salon depends not only on the width of the seat.
“It’s really all about giving airlines the choice and the ability to do what they think they should do to achieve success,” Boeing Salon Specialist Kent Craver said in a statement.
They do not want us to decide for them what profits they will make.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For passengers, the issue lies in increasing the space on the sides, but for suppliers this is increasingly becoming a factor that can affect profit.
Behind the dispute is a race for aircraft orders estimated at at least $700 billion at catalog prices over the next few decades — enough to change the ratio of U.S. and European exports.
As the Reuters reported for the first time in July, the location of the seats is precisely what warms up the rivalry in the battle between the latest jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing have announced a 20 percent increase in profitability in one place in their latest two-engine long-haul models compared to the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 777-300ER.
The Boeing specifications are based in part on the comparison of the 10-seat 777X series with the original 9-seat design of the 777 series.
Winnings at special cost are reduced when compared to the 10-seat layout that is currently in use.
“The reason Boeing is doing this is to squeeze more seats and make its aircraft more competitive compared to our developments,” said Kevin Keniston, head of Airbus’ passenger comfort department in Europe.
On the other hand, analysts say salons with full 10-seat rows for the existing 777s indicate that many passengers prefer a dense landing that can go hand-in-hand with lower fares.
“The eighteen inch wide seats would be ideal for passengers, but the reality is that from a commercial point of view, the Airbus offer is due to the threat from the 777 model,” said interior specialist Mary Kirby, founder and editor of Gi Runway Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not supply seats, but offer a list of suppliers from which airlines can choose.
Traveling around the world, jet sellers even take roulette with them to check competing plans.
Complimenting the comfort, all manufacturers also offer aircraft with a very dense layout of the cabin for budget airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers an A350 with 10-seat rows, but says it has not yet sold it.
Until recently, Airbus has emphasized the need for additional modifications to salons, offering wider passageways on some of its aircraft.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern aircraft, experts say, its call for a new industry standard is unlikely to "fly", but could divert attention from the wave of sales of the 777X.
New Anti-Nicotine Vaccine May Deprive the Process of Smoking Pleasure
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could deprive the process of smoking cigarettes of pleasure.
One dose of the vaccine was able to protect mice from nicotine dependence for a lifetime.
Further tests are needed before human trials begin, which will take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of the Welle Cornell Medical College in New York said the first results are hopeful.
“We very much hope that such a vaccine strategy can finally help millions of smokers who have tried to quit by testing all the methods available on the market today, but have found that their nicotine dependence is strong enough to overcome these proxies.”
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that was designed to carry genetic information for the production of anti-nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects liver cells, which then begin to produce a stable flow of antibodies.
Antibodies track any nicotine molecules in the blood, neutralizing them before they reach the brain, preventing a smoker from getting a nicotine impact.
In the tests, vaccinated mice, who were subsequently given nicotine, continued their normal activities.
And mice who weren’t given the vaccine “relaxed,” and this is a sign that nicotine reached their brains, the researchers say.
These experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines have failed because they contained antibodies to the vaccines.
In order to maintain high levels of antibodies, injections had to be done so often that they proved expensive and impractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be much lower because it turns liver cells into antibodies factories.
Professor Crystal said that if the future human vaccine was completely safe, it could be given to children before they have a desire to try a cigarette, preventing nicotine dependence.
But it is more likely that it will be used by smokers to quit smoking.
“They’ll know that if they start smoking again, they won’t get pleasure from that because of the nicotine vaccine, and that could help them get rid of this habit,” he said.
The British scientists said the results were interesting, but warned that further research was needed.
Oleinikov: a third of the rural settlements of Podmoskovya fully subsidized
Deputy Governor of the Sub-Moscow Yuri Oleinikov said that almost a third of the rural settlements of the Moscow region are fully subsidized.
A total of 187 out of 288 settlements receive grants from the region’s budget.
In 2013, 187 of the 288 settlements received grants from the regional budget.
The specific weight of subsidies in the amount of income of the budget of 122 rural settlements exceeds 50%, and 83 percent of subsidies.
Within the framework of budget security from the regional budget, about 25 billion rubles are allocated," - said Oleinikov.
The Deputy Governor also noted that for only three urban settlements - Mytysh, Odintsovo and Pushkino - the volume of budget revenues is more than 1 billion rubles for 2013.
Income of rural settlements of many districts is less than 3 million rubles, "this is not enough".
Expenses for the maintenance of the local administrative apparatus in 88 settlements of Podmoskovya is more than 70%, "there is a decrease in the quality of services," Oleinikov noted.
Previously, he instructed the heads of the municipal units of Podmoskovy until the end of November to think about which settlements need to be enlarged, merged into urban districts or change the system of administrative governance.
These proposals will be finalized by the end of January.
Before that, the governor of the Moscow region said that as part of the administrative reform in Podmoskovy is planned to reduce the number of subsidy rural settlements.
Also in Mozhaysk, Kashirsk, Solnechnogorsk, Kolomensk districts, Lubertz and Kotelnik there is a request for the expansion of municipalities.
Discussion of this issue in the cities and regions of the region will begin in November.
The President of Mosoblduma Igor Brinzalov also said that all to unite within the upcoming adrenaline reform are planned about 30 rural settlements in 12 districts of Podmoscova.
This is due to the fact that less than a third of the 178 rural settlements in Podmoskovy have an "acceptable" financial base and 100 have grants.
Diana Arbenina Celebrates Halloween with Her Children
Diana Arbenin does not hide the great pleasure she gets from raising her children.
Despite the fact that Arbenina now devotes a lot of time to creativity and social activity, she still finds the opportunity to get along with Marta and Artem, and not only spends time learning them, but also entertains as much as she can.
Over the past week, Diana has twice reported to her fans about her pedagogical talents.
She first posted a photo on Facebook that shows how she teaches children to read.
And yesterday, I was cheering fans, showing her how she dressed Artemis and Martha up for Halloween.
Our first halloween is ready for the races on the jerseys" - this is what Diana called a photo of her children dressed in festive costumes.
Which is not wise, because they, like no other Russian boys and girls, are related to this holiday, because they were born in America.
Germany first in Europe to introduce ‘uncertain gender’ when registering children
Germany will be the first country in Europe to allow children born with hermaphrodites to indicate "uncertain" instead of the male or female sex.
Parents of the child will have the right for a time to leave the graph "sex" in the birth certificate unfilled.
Instead of "F" (female) or "M" (male) parents can temporarily record "X" (undefined).
This decision is aimed at not pushing parents to rush with the operation to "clarify" the gender.
According to statistics, one in 2,000 newborns in the world is born with hermaphroditis.
Tripodi denies that he is susceptible to Obama's influence
Former New South Wales Labour Minister Joe Tripodi will be a figurehead of the state’s anti-corruption supervisory body’s investigation.
Former New South Wales Minister Joe Tripodi has denied making changes to the lease order of offshore properties at the request of his political mentor, Eddie Obeid, who secretly owned shares in three properties on state land.
The Independent Anti-Corruption Commission (ICAC) on Friday expanded its investigation into whether Mr. Obeid had lobbyed several state ministers to extend the lease agreement to Sercular Kee, where the Obeid family owned two restaurants and a café in 2005, without a tender after a while.
She is now investigating allegations that Mr. Tripodi was aware of Mr. Obeid’s clandestine involvement in the properties, following testimony given to Mr. Tripodi’s former deputy head of administration Lynn Ashpool on Thursday.
Over the course of several years of discussions that began in 2005, the government insisted that the lease be put on an open competition.
The tenants were opposed to this, and also wanted longer leases.
In 2009, the company's leases to Sercular Ki, which brought the Obeid family about $2.5 million a year, were extended without being presented to an open competition.
Mr. Tripodi, who served as Minister of Infrastructure and Transport from February 2006 to November 2009, initially advocated open competitions.
But he denied that the changes had been made at the request of Mr. Obeid, who, as Mr. Tripodi acknowledged, strongly advised the Government to make changes to its rental policy.
The proposed ICAC decryption of telephone conversations included conversations in August and September 2007 between Mr. Obeid, Mr. Tripodi, and Steve Dunn, a senior official who came to the Ministry of Ports after working under Mr. Obeid in the Fisheries Department.
“Was the issue discussed during these telephone conversations a matter of developing a commercial lease policy?” asked Assistant Commissioner Anthony Willie, Mr. Tripodi.
"No," replied Mr. Tripodi.
I can't remember what was discussed, but it certainly wasn't.
Definitely not between me and Mr. Obeid.
According to a senior official, Israeli military planes are attacking targets inside Syria
A senior administration official in an interview with Fox News confirmed that Israeli military planes struck a target in the Syrian port city of Latakia on Thursday evening.
The official did not specify that it was for the purpose, but said that at least one.
The Associated Press reports that the target was missiles of Russian production SA-125.
At least twice earlier this year, Israel carried out airstrikes on cargoes with missiles inside Syria.
Foreign workers on subclass 457 visas may be tested for “authenticity”
The test of “authenticity” for foreign workers on class 457 visas is under consideration by the government, as it envisages an extension of repressive measures.
This test, if adopted, will be applied according to criteria aimed at preventing the use of Class 457 visas to fill unqualified positions or as a lattice for family and friends to move to Australia.
The government-submitted document for discussion was released today, while former Labour MP Maxine McCuy criticized the government’s rhetoric about foreign workers, saying it could offend Australia’s neighbors.
“Large statements such as ‘foreigns at the end of the line’ and ‘work for Australians first’ represent a very unpleasant departure from the times when trade unions demanded a protected labour market,” she told the Australia-India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that it was white labor that had to be defended — and if some in the region saw the echoes of this historic artifact, I would not be surprised.
The document presented for discussion outlines 12 measures that were previously considered by former immigration minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday, where he is meeting with officials about smuggling people, has already made five of the recommended changes, and the rest are under consideration.
If the criteria of “authenticity” are accepted, the applicant for a visa will be able to examine the subject of “whether the application is genuine in conditions where the candidate is a relative or close acquaintance of the owner or a person relevant to the financing of the enterprise”.
Enterprises may also be required to report on the number of holders of subclass 457 visas, as previously enterprises that intended to sponsor a small number of employees, then hired hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker allegedly died of a heart attack after arriving on a boat with refugees on Christmas Island this week.
The sadly killed nine-year-old son of the man accompanied him on his way to Australia, and since his father’s death on Wednesday he has been supported by a cousin who was also on board the ship.
The Australian authorities urgently sent the man to the hospital on Christmas Island, where he died.
Friend Semen Varlamova says hockey player suffers from alcoholism
Friend of hockey player Semen Varlamov Evgeny Vavrinyuk said that he suffers from alcoholism, reports the Russian News Service.
“He has no idea how to stop drinking,” the woman said.
We will remind that Vavrinyuk sued for beating Russian goalkeeper Semen Varlamov, who is also a member of the club "Colorado".
According to her, the hockey player dragged her over her hair, and also beat - after the attack, her arms, chest, abdomen and neck were damaged.
Varlamov himself came to the Denver police with the perpetrator and confessed to the beating, describing in detail what had happened.
He was arrested, but later released on bail of $5,000.
The court did not restrict the athlete in the movement of the country, but banned the approach to Vavrinyuk.
He is also threatened with imprisonment for up to 6 years for domestic violence.
The UK government has announced a study aimed at enhancing the economic impact for Scotland of the HS2 railroad project.
The HS2 project proposes the opening of high-speed communication with Scotland and the north of England, with the start of the First Stage in 2026
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer noted that the project “will unite the UK”.
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was "excited" by the prospect of working on a plan with the UK government.
The first phase will be the construction of a new high-speed railway line between London and the West Midlands.
When Stage Two is completed, the lines will be moved to Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government revised the estimated cost of building a high-speed line between London and northern England from <0xC2><0xA3>32.7 billion to <0xC2><0xA3>42.6 billion.
The UK government, which is negotiating with Transport Scotland, has instructed HS2 Ltd to consider further improvements in railway capacity and a reduction in travel duration for Northern England and Scotland.
This should include the possibility of crossing the route from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London in three hours or less.
Baroness Kramer said: “Our goal with HS2 is to create a truly national network that will bring the UK and its cities closer to each other.”
We are developing HS2 because the benefits it will bring are huge.
Without it, we will face a capacity crisis in our rail network.
But it’s also about connecting cities with each other; across the UK, 18 cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, will get better communication thanks to HS2.
Scottish Secretary of State Alistair Carmichael added: “Today’s announcement is good news for Scotland.”
On behalf of the Scottish government, Keith Brown called on Mr. Carmichael to “unambiguously” support Scotland’s inclusion in the HS2 network.
Mr. Brown said: “High-speed rail has every chance of bringing huge economic benefits to Scotland, but it also adds Scotland’s economic weight to the overall argument for high-speed rail across the UK.”
We are therefore pleased to work in partnership with the UK Government to consider options for building a high-speed railway in Scotland, creating benefits for all, and continuing the Glasgow-Edinburgh railway line, which the Scottish Government is already planning.
I look forward to reviewing the results of the study with the British ministers next year and to making a joint decision on the next steps.
Is Torium a New Hope for Nuclear Energy?
Governments in countries around the world continue to think about how to provide energy needs.
The burning of hydrocarbons (where they exist) negatively affects the climate.
Renewable energy sources require large areas of land for generation.
Atomic energy costs both, but leaves behind a lot of expensive waste in the recycling of waste.
Recently, scientists have drawn attention to thorium - another radioactive element of the Mendeleev system.
It is found all over the world, and, as experts claim, its fragmentation does not leave waste that needs to be stored for centuries.
The rules for the use of electronic devices on aircraft in Australia will remain in force for the time being.
Passengers of Australian airlines will still need to turn off their tablets and smartphones during take-off and landing, despite measures in the U.S. to mitigate the rules regarding these devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has allowed U.S. carriers to change their procedures in such a way that passengers can read e-books, watch videos, or play games on their devices during take-off and landing, provided that they will remain at Reggio Emilia.
Passengers can already do this during the bulk of the flight, but it irritates many that they do not have access to their e-books during take-off and landing.
Australian carriers are considering this decision, which required U.S. airlines to do a huge amount of work to comply with the new requirements, but indicated that they do not plan to change their procedures in the near future.
The Civil Aviation Safety Administration also noted that they are considering the statement, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical phases of the flight are still in effect in Australia.
“Civil aviation safety management does not currently have special rules regulating the use of electronic devices in aircraft,” it said.
This issue is regulated by rules that require air carriers to ensure safety at all times, and passengers to comply with the safety rules that are communicated to them by crew members.
Virgin, which had already discussed with the Civil Aviation Safety Administration the expansion of use on board its Wi-Fi entertainment system, was not against the changes, but said it would follow the regulator’s instructions.
“We would welcome the Civil Aviation Safety Administration’s consideration of the issue of permitting the use of electronic devices, because we really think it will improve the quality of customer service now that it (the on-board wireless entertainment system) is on our planes,” Press said.
Qantas said it would abide by the current rules.
“Our current policy is that electronic devices cannot be used during take-off and landing, and we do not plan to change it in the near future,” she said.
The FAU regulation applies to U.S. airlines.
However, we are always interested in regulatory changes that could benefit passengers, and we will certainly carefully study the FAU’s solution and the reasons for it.
For U.S. carriers, the impact of the ruling will vary from airline to airline and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Carriers will have to prove that their aircraft are resistant to radio equipment from mobile devices, as well as review manuals, training materials, rules for carrying manuals and instructions for passengers.
“After the airline has checked and confirmed the impediment of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use portable, lightweight electronic devices, such as tablets, e-books and smartphones, at any height,” the FAU said.
In rare cases of poor visibility, the crew will instruct passengers to turn off their devices during landing.
In addition, according to the recommendations of the group, heavier devices should be placed under the seats or in the upper luggage compartments during take-off and landing.
The head of Dagestan is heard in the hymn of Cuban notes of extremism
The football match between "Anji" and "Kubanyu" spilled into a political clash between the authorities of Krasnodar Region and Dagestan after the fans burned the Dagestan flag, and the Kubani anthem sounded different.
The head of Dagestan Ramazan Abdulatipov on Thursday invited Republican parliamentarians to go to court, because the anthem of Krasnodar region allegedly calls for international disparity, in particular, calls for war with the "Bashurans".
Take the anthem of Krasnodar region, it is in our time in 1995 approved this anthem.
This is a shame, and no one is doing it.
"Remembering you here, as a mother of a mother, to the enemy, to the bashurman, we go to the mortal battle" - why such words to write in the hymn, to devour some believers on other believers," - expressed solidarity with the President of Parliament Hizri Shiksaidov.
Putin has achieved impunity for his friend Assad
And now - news because of the ocean, namely - from Syria, where, as we know today, Israel launched a strike on missiles of Russian production, which were reportedly intended for Hezbollah.
Today, Syria has fulfilled an important condition - to destroy by November 1st its production of chemical weapons.
This was done within the framework of an agreement reached through Russia and which allowed the United States not to carry out a military operation, which they came close to this summer.
More about the weapons and what all this means for the Syrian president, our chief international correspondent, Richard Engel, will tell you.
Washington has said that the Assad regime will be punished for this.
More than 1,400 civilians, including hundreds of children, died in August from poisoning gas.
And the punishment came.
But not in the form of U.S. bombings, but in the form of a deal arranged by Assad’s friend Vladimir Putin.
Syria will give up its chemical weapons by the middle of next year.
Today is an important milestone.
The group of international experts reported that Syria had shut down the declared chemical weapons factories.
A more long-term and difficult task is the destruction of tons of chemical weapons and components to it.
As we know, it's about a thousand tons.
Earlier, Washington had said that Assad’s days were numbered.
I think Assad should leave.
The question is not whether this will happen, but when it will happen.
He is no longer legitimate and needs to leave.
But Assad remains.
And he feels even more confident.
His troops are still using artillery, rockets and napalm.
His opponents are disorganized and badly armed.
His people are forced to leave their homes, many are starving.
Some have to feed on leaves and cats.
Many believe that Bashar al-Assad escaped punishment for mass murder.
The agreement on chemical weapons is called the success of diplomacy, inspectors have been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, and Assad himself made the impression of a person ready to cooperate.
Today in Washington, the U.S. ambassador to Syria had to answer difficult questions.
When a child dies of starvation, his mother is unlikely to be easier than not being killed by chemical weapons.
Assad is still there.
And he's switching weapons to power.
The President of the Russian Federation has created a separate Ministry of Construction and Industrial Development
Russian President Vladimir Putin has set up a new ministry curating construction and construction issues and has proposed to lead it to the former governor of the Ivanov region Mikhail Menu in the process of a personal meeting.
The president met with Mikhail Mene at the residence in Novo-Ogarevo, and Mene did not refuse to head the new department.
The press secretary of the President of Russia Dmitry Peskov explained that all functions related to construction and plumbing are transferred to the new ministry from the Minsk region.
Mikhail Meni is the son of the famous Orthodox priest, Alexander Meni, who graduated from the Moscow Institute of Petrochemistry named after Gubkin.
Since 1995, his political career began - he was elected to the Moscow Regional Duma from the Sergeyev-Posadsky District, was a deputy of the State Duma, the first deputy prime minister of the government of the Moscow region, the deputy prime minister of the government of Moscow.
From 2005 to October 16, 2013, Mikhail Men was the governor of the Ivanov region.
Farmers in Singapore are doing well, while the middle class is having a hard time.
In a bar at the Bendemir mall in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga puts on a gold bracelet, ring and earrings to pay for her daughter’s schooling.
“My husband and I just bought a house, so all my money is put in there,” says Ms. Amirthalinga.
Although she earns S$3,000 ($2400) a month as an administrator and her husband also works, the family’s monthly income isn’t enough, she says.
Indeed, demand in different parts of Southeast Asia — where household debt is growing — is such that ValueMax, where it is conducting its transaction, this week became the third barber registered on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
A jewellery deposit loan is not just a quick way to get money (S$1300 in Ms. Amirthaling’s case), but it’s almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
Typically, bartenders in Singapore charge an effective annual interest rate of 17% – just above 15.4% offered by United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch in the same mall.
However, bartenders have the advantage that they do not require credit checks or proof of salary and can issue loans faster than banks.
That’s why millions of people across the region are turning to barbershops, as families feel pressure because of the increased cost of living and the rapid growth of household debt and consumer debt.
After five years of sustained growth following the global financial crisis, and cheap loans fueled by a free monetary policy in developed economies, families with low and middle-income earnings are turned over to the clowns to make a profit.
This week, Standard & Poor's, the rating agency, indicated an increase in the family credit shoulder, mainly due to the rise in mortgages, as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
It said Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest ratio of household debt to gross domestic product in Asia, according to the report.
Malaysia led this list with 80 per cent of GDP compared to 60 per cent in 2008.
Economists are also concerned about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which has barely come out of the technical recession this week.
On Thursday, the data showed a continuing decline in exports and a weakening of consumer demand.
“The point is that as prices rise, people in the middle and lower [income scales] will look for ways to replenish their income where they can,” says Song Sung Won, an economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
The record high gold prices over the past two years have intensified the rush with which people lay their personal belongings as they take advantage of the opportunity to make money for their family decorations.
In Singapore, about 70 per cent of the items deposited at the city-state’s 200 pubs are gold goods.
People say, “The price of gold looks good, let’s put on Grandma’s gold chain and get it back next month.”
In Thailand, the largest bartender operator EasyMoney has seen the number of customers using its offices up to 20 percent in recent months.
Growth in the confectionery business is such that ValueMax, the operator of the branch in Bendemir and 15 others of the same in Singapore, plans to expand not only in neighboring Malaysia, where it has four stores, but also outside of Asia, says Yeh Li Ching, executive director of ValMax.
The company will fund the expansion using 60 percent of the S$66 million raised this week as a result of placing shares on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some creditors have sparked a fire of criticism over high interest rates, Ms. Yeah says the bartender not only offers cheaper rates than other creditors, it also does not increase the debt directly.
“Customers are laying down items they already own, and monetizing personal assets doesn’t increase household debt,” she says.
The institution is gaining ever wider public recognition as a means of obtaining short-term, secured funding.
And at the same time, bartenders are not only used by those categories of people who are in a difficult financial situation.
Wealthy people in Singapore also use ValueMax offices, placing gold bars or Rolex watches, which can give up to 60 percent of their purchase price in cash.
We see customers from all walks of life.
“They include wealthy individuals who need to borrow money for short-term commercial projects or investments, or small business enterprises who need to overcome temporary monetary difficulties,” says Ms. Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
Today, it is not the number and status of existing medical institutions that are important for the population, but the quality of medical care provided.
Implementation of the program "Modernization of health care of the Tulsa region for 2011 - 2013", reorganization of medical institutions of our city will allow to create the optimal structure of medical care to the population, including gynecological patients, pregnant women and midwives.
Thus, after the merger with the hospice, there was an even greater opportunity to attract narrow specialists from the GUZ "NGCB" for consultations of pregnant women with various pathologies, to carry out additional examinations on the basis of the hospital.
During the implementation of the modernization program, the material and technical base of the maternity home was significantly improved, modern equipment conforming to world standards appeared.
During these years, about 8 million rubles were allocated for the capital repair of the premises, 112 units of equipment in the amount of 42 million rubles were purchased.
The most modern equipment is equipped with an intensive posture for newborns.
In the operating room during the caesarean section, the device "Sell-Severe" is used, which allows to collect blood from the surgical wound and, after special treatment, return its birthplace, avoiding transfusion of foreign blood.
Modern equipment is also equipped with the department of clinical and laboratory diagnostics.
In the women’s consultation, electronic registration works, in the near future it is planned to introduce electronic maps and histories of patients’ disease.
Thanks to the development of telemedicine, it was possible to consult gynecological patients, pregnant women, newborns and newborns with regional specialists.
Chechens beat and rob 60 prostitutes in Strasbourg
Chechnya natives were arrested by French police on suspicion of serial assaults on prostitutes.
The investigation has been ongoing since March of this year.
About 60 women complained about the actions of the Caucasians.
The bandits reportedly ordered a prostitute to one of the Strasbourg hotels, and then beat and robbed them.
The leader of the gang was a 27-year-old previously tried Chechnya native.
Bavaria defender David Alaba became the best athlete in Austria in 2013, according to the official website of the Bundesliga.
In this dispute, he preceded representatives of winter sports, which traditionally become the best in the country.
The second place was taken by the skier Marcel Hirscher, and the third - ski jumping from the trampoline Gregor Schlirenzauer.
Last season, a 21-year-old Austrian of Philippine-Nigerian origin helped his team win the Champions League, the Championship and the German Cup, as well as the UEFA Super Cup.
Ex-wife Arshavina rests with actor Andrei Chadov
The ex-civilian wife of the footballer Andrei "Zenita" Arshavin Yulia Baranovska is on vacation with the actor Andrei Chadov.
Yulia rests in Italy in the company of actress Anastasia Zadorozhna, her fiancé - figure maker Sergei Slavnov, and actor Andrei Chadov.
Photos from joint walks of couples are published on Instagram by Anastasia Zadrozhnoya.
This is not the first photo of Andrea and Julia.
On October 5, Zadrozhnaya published a photo on which the couple stands hugging on the shore of the Gulf of Finland in Komarovo.
In mid-October, Andrei Arshavin admitted that he lives separately from his civilian wife Julia.
Yulia Baranovska and Andrei Arshavin have been together since 2003, they have three children.
Recently it became known that Arshavin is dating ex-model Alisa Kazmina.
Arshavin's new girlfriend was married to the company's top manager.
A $325 million bailout package for the health of Tasmania
The federal government insists that a $325 million bailout package for Tasmania’s weakened health care system will be supplemented by harsh conditions that ensure the state government will not spend money in vain.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek announced that the Commonwealth is taking “immediate measures” to prevent the crisis caused by the aging population of the island state, higher levels of chronic diseases and system restrictions.
The decision to finance for four years was made after the government consulted with Tasmania’s independent MP Andrew Wilkes.
“The government has proposed a package of emergency rescue measures, which we believe will solve the specific problems facing the state,” Plibersek said in a statement.
The $325 million package includes $31 million for a flash campaign for planned operations.
Another 2,600 surgeries, including orthopaedic and cataract removal operations, will help overcome the lag.
There is also money for clinics accepting patients without prior registration, in Hobart and Lonsington, to improve the quality of post-hospital care, training medical professionals, mental health care services, and the introduction of personal electronic medical card systems in local hospitals.
“These investments will go to the advanced doctors’ realization of ideas on how best to help the Tasmanian health system,” said Ms. Plibersek.
The Minister insisted that the Government of Tasmania would work in a manner of strict accountability and accountability.
The State will need to maintain the current levels of funding in order to receive Community funds, and to report on a monthly basis on where it spends those additional funds.
A three-person commission will be set up to ensure that the state provides services as efficiently and effectively as possible.
Mr. Wilkes said today that $325 million will not resolve anything unless they are followed by a genuine reform that will put Tasmania’s health care system on a more sustainable basis.
However, he praised the government for responding to his request for urgent assistance, with which he first addressed the Prime Minister in early May.
“I hope that the federal aid package will greatly contribute to the removal of this state’s health care system from a critical condition,” Wilkes said.
According to the Government of the State, these additional selection procedures significantly offset recent cuts.
But the federal opposition health representative Peter Dutton believes that today’s statement is “a solution similar to a leukoplasty.”
“The reason we’re here is because the labor government of the state has ripped $430 million out of the healthcare system,” he told ABC TV.
When the state government wastes nearly half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth invests $300 million, you can’t pretend it’s good news.
Mr. Dutton asked Ms. Plibersek to ensure that no dollar in the rescue package would be spent on additional bureaucracy.
Deni Diderot’s screenplay by Guillaume Nickle may boast exceptional performance and historical details, but it is also more difficult to perceive than it should be.
The film, which takes place in France in the 1760s, tells the dark story of Suzanne, a young aristocrat sent to the monastery by her family.
When she begins to rebel, she experiences extreme cruelty from the hands of the sadistic boss and becomes the object of erotic fantasies for others.
The film never lets you down to madness or sensation – and that’s the whole problem.
Because of its serious ceremoniality, the storyline risks becoming a test like a whistleblower and for the audience.
Syria Has Destroyed Its Chemical Weapons, Observer Group Says
Syria has destroyed the main equipment for the production of chemical weapons and ammunition with toxic gas, the international observer group said on Thursday, while fierce clashes were raging in the north of the country, near a site where it is believed to be a refugee.
Also on Thursday, a Syrian activist group said that more than 120,000 people have been killed since the start of the civil war in the country almost three years ago.
The statement of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons was made one day before
The deadline of 1 November, set by this Hague-based organization, for Damascus to destroy or “incapacitate” all means of production of chemical weapons and mechanisms for the mixing of chemicals with the production of poison gas and filling.
The completion of what is essentially the initial stage of destruction is an important milestone in an ambitious schedule that aims to destroy all of Damascus’s chemical weapons by mid-2014.
The destruction of the equipment means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
Nevertheless, Damascus is yet to begin the destruction of existing weapons and stockpiles.
The country is believed to have about 1,000 metric tons of chemicals and weapons, including mustard gas and neuro-paralytic sarin gas.
The statement was made during fierce fighting on Thursday in the city of Safira, which experts say is a chemical weapons production facility, as well as the place of its storage, the UK-based Syrian Center for the Protection of Human Rights reported.
A group of activists who tracked the losses through a network of activists in Syria said on Thursday that 120,296 people were killed.
Of these, 61,067 are said to be civilians, including 6365 children.
The group said 29,954 people were members of President Bashar al-Assad's armed forces, 18,678 were pro-government fighters and 187 Lebanese Hezbollah fighters.
Also among the dead, the statement said, were 2202 army fugitives and about 5375 opposition fighters, many of them foreigners.
According to the UN’s July 25 estimate, 100,000 have died in the conflict since March 2011.
Since then, this figure has not been updated.
The conflict forced about 2 million people to flee the country.
Assad’s forces fought in Safir for several weeks with rebels, many of whom are linked to al-Qaeda groups.
The center said there were casualties on both sides on Thursday, but did not provide specific data.
The fighting underscored the danger faced by chemical weapons inspectors, adapted by the short-term of their mission to rid Syria of the toxic arsenal at the height of the ongoing civil war.
The statement, which works in close cooperation with the United Nations, said that its team was “now satisfied that it had checked and seen all the critical production and mixing/fuel equipment declared by Syria destroyed.”
She added that “no additional inspection activities are currently being planned for the time being.”
Earlier this week, the inspectors said they had completed the first round of verification work by visiting 21 of the 23 sites declared by Damascus.
They were unable to visit two places for security reasons, the inspectors said.
On Thursday, the OPCW said that both sites were, according to Syria’s statement, “discarded and ... the chemical weapons program items contained in them were moved to other declared sites that have been checked.”
It was not immediately possible to find out whether the facility in Safir was one of two places that the OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has submitted a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which is due to be approved by the UN Executive Committee next month.
“I welcome the courage and courage that you have all demonstrated in carrying out the most complex mission that this organization has ever undertaken,” said Director-General of the Observation Group, Ahmet Uzumjiu, in a commentary published by the OPCW.
For the third year, the civil war has confronted rebels, mostly Sunni Muslims, with the Assad government and its security forces, which consist of members of its sect of the Alawites, the detachment of Shia Islam.
Regarding other events, Rami Abdurrahman, the head of the center, said there was a strong explosion on Wednesday at an air facility in the coastal province of Syria, Latakia.
The cause of the explosion is unknown, he said.
Angry at the verdict of the organizers of the terrorist attack in Bali
The survivors and relatives of 202 people killed in the 2002 Bali bombings reacted furiously to the verdict handed down to the last of the conspirators who appeared in court and said Umar Patek should be shot.
Patek, who spent nearly 10 years on the run as one of the most wanted people in Southeast Asia, was sentenced yesterday to 20 years in prison for his role in creating the explosive devices used during the attack.
He may be released for 15 years if he receives a probationary release.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murders as a result of the attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist area of Kuta, in which 202 people were killed, including 88 Australians, and dozens more were injured.
He was also found guilty of a number of other terrorism-related charges, including a wave of church explosions across Indonesia on the eve of Christmas in 2000.
Prosecutors have demanded a lifespan, though they could insist that a person who is called a “breaker” for his reputation as a master craftsman of explosive devices should be sentenced to death.
The decision exacerbated the painful memories of Perth’s mother, June Cortin, who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters Jane and Jenny in a terrorist attack carried out by Patek and his accomplices nearly a decade ago.
Hardly holding back her tears, she said Patek should be sentenced to death.
“I really think he should follow in the footsteps of other guys.
He has to face the shooting team,” said Ms. Cortin AAP.
“I have to live every day knowing I won’t have grandchildren anymore and I won’t see my daughters.”
The Sarai Club was destroyed when a massive explosive device was put into operation in a parked outside the van, just after 11 p.m. on October 12, 2002.
Peter Hughes was at the Paddy Bar, where a suicide bomber exploded a backpack filled with explosives just 20 seconds earlier.
After this attack, he fell into a coma for a month and “died” three times, being connected to the life insurance system.
Mr. Hughes said Patek should share the involvement of three other members of the Jemaa Islamia terrorist cell responsible for the bloody massacre, Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imama Samudra, who were executed four years ago.
Indeed, this guy deserves the death penalty most of all.
To save his life, well, there's no reason to save his life.
Getting 20 years after killing 202 people and wounding hundreds is not that much.
Patek is the last of the terrorists in Bali to appear before the court.
He had been hiding for nearly a decade, but was eventually detained in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad in January 2011, where U.S. troops killed former al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden less than four months later.
In the course of the trial, the FBI agent showed that the intelligence evidence showed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden in an attempt to restore ties between terrorist groups in Southeast Asia and Al Qaeda.
“He didn’t give up,” said Mrs. Cortin.
Until recently, he had no regrets about how much grief he caused to other people.
The verdict comes ahead of the 10th anniversary of the terrorist attack, which will take place later this year in Bali and Australia.
“There will be a lot of tears this year,” says Ms. Cortin.
Patek can still appeal his sentence.
FAU: “Air passengers can now use gadgets on airplanes (but don’t call from a mobile phone)”
Air passengers will be able to use their electronic devices throughout the flight to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music, but not speak on mobile phones, — according to the long-awaited new guidelines, published in the magazine.
However, passengers should not expect the changes to occur immediately.
How quickly such a change is implemented will vary depending on the airline, said FAU administrator Michael Wart at a press conference.
Airlines will have to show the FAU how their aircraft meet the new guidelines and that they are updating their training manuals for flight crew members and device layout rules to comply with the new guidelines.
The FAU said it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue were among the airlines that had already submitted plans.
"Depending on the state of the plan, we could approve the expansion of the use of electronic devices very soon," the FAU said.
Passengers are currently required to disable their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the aircraft’s door closes.
They should not restart them until the plane reaches a height of 10,000 feet and the captain does not “good.”
Passengers must turn off their devices again when the plane is down for landing, and do not turn them on until the plane is on the ground.
In accordance with the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are adequately protected from electronic interference may allow passengers to use these devices during take-off, landing and steering, the FAU said.
Most of the new airliners and other aircraft modified in such a way that passengers could use Wi-Fi at high altitudes are expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Boarding Leaders, welcomed these changes.
“Once the new policy is implemented safely (and we are going to work closely with the carrier to achieve this), it will be a win-win option,” Gliding said.
We are frankly tired of feeling “working in school” when it comes to this issue.
But Internet connectivity for surfing, emailing, texting or downloading data will still be banned at a height of less than 10,000 feet, the agency said.
Passengers will be asked to switch their smartphones, tablets and other devices to aircraft mode.
Thus, there was still no “Words with Friends” – an intellectual online game in which actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011, when there was a disturbing incident: the actor was taken off the plane when he was on a flight with American Airlines for refusing to turn off the shutdown.
And heavier devices, such as laptops, will still need to be placed in the luggage compartment, as they can hurt someone if they fly all over the salon.
Calls from a mobile phone on the flight will also continue to be banned.
The regulatory powers over telephone calls belong to the Federal Communications Commission, not the FAU.
The FAU may remove the ban on some electronic devices during take-off and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Council, a national transport safety expert at CBS News, said cell phones are still considered a risk.
“Cell phones are really a problem, not only because they could potentially create interference for navigation devices, but we know thanks to the FCC that they can create interference for cell towers when the plane is in the air,” Rosenker said.
The industry advisory committee set up by the FAU to study the issue recommended last month that the government allow the wider use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, there has been an increase in pressure on FAUs to mitigate restrictions on their use.
Critics, such as Missouri Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill, argue that there are no compelling security-related reasons for the ban.
Compliance with restrictions is also becoming increasingly difficult to ensure, as the use of devices has become widespread.
Some studies show that up to a third of passengers forget or ignore instructions to turn off their devices.
The FAU began restricting the use of electronic devices by passengers in 1966 in response to reports of disruptions to navigation and communication equipment, when passengers began to carry FM radio receivers — high-tech gadgets of the time.
The new airliners are much more reliant on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also being developed and approved by the FAU as resistant to electronic interference.
Airlines have been offering passengers Wi-Fi at cruise altitude for several years now.
Planes modified for the Wi-Fi system are also more resistant to interference.
The vast majority of liners have been adapted for a wider use of electronic devices according to the new guidelines, Wart said.
Today’s electronic devices typically radiate radio signals of much lower power than the previous generations of devices.
Devices for reading e-books, for example, emit only minimal signals when scrolling pages.
But the signals become more powerful when the devices load or send the data.
Among those who sought to ease restrictions on the use of electronic devices by passengers was Amazon.com.
In 2011, representatives of the company loaded an entire airliner with their devices for reading Kindle e-books and flew on it to check for problems, but never detected them.
The members of the FAU Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings about whether the use of the devices posed any risk.
Douglas Kidd, of the National Air Passenger Association, said in a statement that he considered interference from the devices to be real, even if the risk was minimal.
Other members of the committee said that there are only separate reports from pilots confirming that the devices can create interferences for aviation systems, and most of these reports are very old.
However, the Committee recommended that the FAU allow pilots to require passengers to disable the devices while landing on the devices in conditions of limited visibility.
A group of representatives of the tourism industry welcomed these changes, calling them a thoughtful step towards meeting passengers who are now using a wide range of technological devices.
“We are pleased that the FAU recognizes that passenger comfort is not incompatible with safety and protection,” said Roger Doe, director-general of the U.S. Tourism Association.
Schools will be able to take exams for driver's licenses
The driver’s license exams will be able to be taken by private companies that have their own computerized driveway.
This is reported by Kommersant with reference to the draft government decree “On the permission to drive vehicles”.
According to the newspaper, there are currently only about 30 such motorways in Russia.
It is assumed that students of such "privileged" motor schools will count the results of internal testing.
At the same time, the State Autoinspection will monitor the examinations every six months.
If it turns out that more than 30% of the theoretical exams and more than 20% of the site students do not give up from the first time, such a school will be deprived of privileges for six months.
The technical requirements for motorways contained in the draft government resolution will enter into force on November 5, 2014.
The project also contains requirements for driving a two-wheeler.
As of January 1, 2015, motorcycle owners will be required to pass the test in urban traffic for category A rights.
In addition, from May 5, 2014, companies will not be able to hire foreign drivers with foreign rights.
Such workers will have to receive Russian rights after passing the exam.
The bird, airborne to a safe place from a drilling plant in the North Sea, released back into the wild
The bird, airborne to shore after being found depleted on an oil turret in the North Sea, was released back into the wild.
This water shepherd was placed in a helicopter heading for Aberdeen last month, and was then taken out by the Scottish branch of the Society for the Prevention of Animal Abuse (SPCA) at a rescue center in Alloa.
Colin Seddon, the centre’s manager, said: “This waterfall is most likely a winter migrant from Northern Europe who has fallen into the area of strong winds over the North Sea.”
It seems that the bird has destabilized and has been able to find shelter on the oil turret.
He added: “She was unable to take off again, so they turned to us for help.”
The watermelon was healthy and in good condition by the time it was released.
Is Europe’s elite ready to do business with England?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with a commitment to gather business representatives and determine what changes the UK’s well-being and jobs creators want to see in their relationship with the EU.
To this end, we have commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey of British business leaders, asking them to express their thoughts about the UK, business and the EU.
YouGov surveyed more than 1,000 business leaders representing a wide range of businesses in the UK by size, sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will be a surprise for many.
We have found that the vast majority of enterprises are currently looking for export opportunities outside of Europe, paying particular attention to countries that are modernising and growing, while EU countries are stagnant.
They want the government to prioritise new trade ties with countries such as China, India and Brazil, rather than waste time on the long and difficult process of reforming the EU’s complicated institutions.
When asked about their views on specific policy issues, from anti-monopoly regulation to product laws, most business leaders believed that control of these key areas of competence should be returned to Westminster.
There was a general dissatisfaction with the single market, and business representatives said that the costs of regulation from Brussels now outweighed the benefits of being in the trade zone of Europe, — even 40 percent of companies in the majority of large enterprises traditionally agreed with this.
Last but not least, our survey of business leaders revealed that a clear majority wants the UK to take a course to change the treaty and to deal with the EU based on trade, not on politics.
This result, which has been seen among enterprises of all sizes and the largest business groups, shows that the business is insisting on a “significant change” that will return authority back to the UK.
High rates – achieving changes to the treaty and more favourable terms for the UK will ensure a 16 percent shift in the vote to stay in the EU.
The prime minister should have no doubt: this survey shows that the British business supports his plan to revise the terms of Britain’s membership in the EU.
It also shows that the business expects that the review will lead to a significant shift in the current balance of forces back towards the UK.
The best conditions for British business are possible and are becoming increasingly necessary as the eurozone embarks on the path of closer economic and financial unification.
Priority should be given to jobs and economic growth in the UK, and, as the results of our survey show, for business this means an increased focus on trade and fundamental changes in the regulatory activities of Brussels.
U.S. intelligence agencies are listening to Pope’s personal phone
The activities of the Vatican are under the watchful control of the U.S. intelligence services.
New documents from Edward Snowden’s collection indicate that U.S. intelligence has been listening to all the negotiations of the previous Pope Benedict, and is now closely looking after Pope Francis.
His phone started listening before he became the head of the Vatican.
The process of electing a new pope was also under scrutiny.
What was given special importance in the United States.
The special services connected to the cell phones of the cardinals, who gathered in Rome to choose another pope.
Phones of the residence, where the members of the conclave lived, were also heard.
American spies have listened to all the major claimants for the papal throne to prevent the appearance of an undesirable figure on it for Washington.
The magazine Panorama writes that the “big ear of the United States” continued to intercept the talks of the prelates until the very conclusion of the March 12 conclave.
It is claimed that in the United States since 2005, the Argentine archbishop Bergolio has been designated as the future Pope of Rome.
U.S. intelligence has also stalled negotiations related to the election of the new Vatican Bank president.
The Italian magazine writes that a secret group of CIA and NSA operatives working at the U.S. Embassy in Rome continue to obtain information about policies and financial flows.
The Vatican, in turn, has announced in a conciliatory manner that it does not care about the American “interview,” even if it does.
From the leadership of the United States, the holy fathers have no secrets.
The snowboarder for the Olympic bill was specially photographed
The Bank of Russia on Wednesday issued a commemorative banknote dedicated to the city of Sochi, where the Olympic Games will be held this winter.
The denomination of the banknote is 100 rubles.
But on the network, bloggers are already actively ironizing about the commemorative banknote.
After the presentation of the Olympic bill on October 30, they noticed that the image of the snowboarder with the banknote can be found in the photo banks.
In particular, in the free StockExchange photo repository, where this photo is dated 2005.
The same photo is used in a tutorial on Photoshop, published on the Russian website "Megaobzor" on January 18, 2011.
In addition, it has already been used in the advertising of RugGear smartphones.
The Olympic banknote is made in blue-blue gamma.
On one side is depicted a snowboarder flying over Sochi, on the other - a view of the Olympic stadium and the Zhar Bird.
The author of the design of the banknote is Pavel Bushuev, who won the competition among students of the St. Petersburg Academy of Arts named Repin.
At the presentation, it was noted that several sports were considered - skiing, freestyle and jumping from the trampoline, but in the end they chose snowboard, as it is a relatively young sport.
According to the source “Izvestii”, close to the Central Bank, the regulator does not indifferent public opinion regarding the wide distribution of the image of the snowboarder with the Olympic banknote and is now studying the situation.
But in Goznak not too worried about the noise around the Olympic banknote.
The head of the press service of the State Badge Natalia Nikiforova told "The News" that all the arguments regarding the plagiarism are ridiculous.
Snowboarder on the banknote turned right, in the photos on the net - left, - Nikiforova said.
The person in the photo session to create the banknote was taken from different points, then the final image was selected, on it - a characteristic position of the snowboarder.
She also noted that copyright laws do not apply to the Olympic banknote, as the artist received a salary for his work.
According to experts, the discussion around the image on the Olympic bill is quite positive.
Recognition of the image on the bill is a plus for its promotion, - believes the executive director of NP "RusBrand" Alexey Popovichev.
Proving the 100% similarity of the images on the bill and in the photo banks is quite difficult, so claims for intellectual property dispute on this image are unlikely to be received.
For the first time an Olympic banknote appeared in China - at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, a commemorative 10-yuan banknote was issued.
Russia has decided to support this tradition.
Legislation bans forced Russians to drink less beer
Russian beers are in a bad mood.
According to their estimates, beer consumption in the country next year will remain at the same level, and this at best.
At first, businessmen were looking forward to growth.
After all, this year is not good for them: sales have fallen by 7 percent.
All this was told by the head of one of the largest brewing companies of the country, the Chairman of the Council of the Union of Russian Brewers Isaac Sheps at the 3rd annual conference of the Adam Smith Institute “Daily Demand goods in Russia”, which has just ended in Moscow.
It discussed the state regulation of the market.
From 2008 to 2012, the Russian beer market has already decreased by 18 percent, as in recent years the country has seen a significant increase in the regulation of the beer industry in terms of beer production and turnover - a drink with a low alcohol content, - told listeners.
No country in the world has such a severe restriction on the beer market, an unpredictable introduction of all new and new illogical prohibitions that are supposedly justified in combating alcohol abuse.
Brewery said that many legislative bans, aimed at reducing the level of alcohol abuse, do not have a particular impact, however, new initiatives are constantly emerging.
The sickest of all beer producers hit the ban imposed since this year to sell alcohol in kiosks.
“We immediately lost 35,000 consumers,” Isaac Sheps said.
There are two forecasts for next year’s breweries.
The optimist is the one Sheps said: the sales of the foam drink will remain at the same level.
Pessimistic - will fall by another 2-3 percent.
To keep their profits, businessmen are forced to step away from the varieties intended for mass consumers into the “premium” class: beer will be less, but it will cost more.
Meanwhile, the radical consequences of falling sales with a small amount of alcohol are not yet visible.
“According to my observations, the level of alcoholism remains at about the same level,” said doctor-narcologist Alexey Sotnikov.
True, the proportion of patients consuming substituents of strong drinks, as well as those who “subjected” to alcohol-containing tonic drinks like “Jaguar” increased, whereas ten years ago, it was “beer” alcoholism that prevailed.
In September, 600 people were fired from the Ford car factory in Vsevologsk.
As they say in the unions, all the dismissed have received compensation.
However, far more acute than the problems of workers, there is a question of the reduction of production in the region.
ZacSa regional deputy Alexey Etmanov said at the meeting that at the Ford company’s plant in Vsevologsk about 600 people were reduced.
According to him, it happened back in September: at that time, about 600 people left the plant under a voluntary dismissal program, which was developed together with the trade union of the organization.
Workers who decided to resign on their own, were offered "golden parachutes" in the amount of several salaries.
Because of this, the vast majority have left the jobs at their own will.
However, according to Etmanov, this number of people is an entire night shift.
I don't think this is going to be limited.
However, in the next two years, the authorities do not plan to adopt any programs to support regional enterprises in a difficult situation," he explained, adding that when adopting the budget, the government does not take into account the stagnation of production in the region and the large reduction of jobs.
In the "Ford" this information is not refuted or confirmed.
We are waiting for a response from the company, and as soon as it appears, we will definitely publish it.
Talks about the reduction of workers at the Ford plant in Vsevologsk have been going on for a long time.
For example, the company’s plans to fire 600 people were announced in September.
The company has previously announced a suspension of the production of cars.
As the reason for the plant was called the drop in demand for cars "Ford" in Russia.
According to Petrostat, after nine months of 2013, the volume of industrial production in Lenoblast decreased by 5.4%.
Production of vehicles and equipment decreased by 11.5%.
In the United States will be able to use mobiles during take-off and landing of the aircraft
New rules for the safe use of mobile devices during take-off and landing of the aircraft have been approved in the United States, the BBC reported.
It is expected that U.S. airlines will allow passengers to use smartphones and tablets throughout the flight, the new rules will come into effect by the end of 2013.
However, Internet communication for receiving and sending e-mail will be prohibited during flights at an altitude of less than 3 kilometers.
Due to the danger of disruption of the radio equipment of aircraft, cellular voice communication will still be banned.
Thus, airline passengers will be allowed to read e-books, play games on tablets and other gadgets, and watch videos on domestic and international flights.
Before the rules are adopted, airlines will be required to check the safety of using electronic devices during the flight.
In addition, airlines will have to convince the U.S. Federal Civil Aviation Administration that they will be able to cope with the supposed impact of mobile aircraft technology and aircraft control devices.
According to the source, the U.S., for example, will also be able to revise the current standards of use of electronic devices in flights in the UK.
After the "Russian Mafia" in the United States finally established a new name - "Brotherhood"
This week, the blacklist of the “Russian Mafia” in America was filled with new names and four companies.
The U.S. Ministry of Finance has introduced three representatives of Russia, two citizens of Uzbekistan and an Israeli.
One of the Russians turned out to be the famous singer Grigory Leps, whom the US suspects in the transportation of money for members of the group.
In total, the US blacklisted 22 people involved in the Brotherhood and six affiliated organizations.
However, many experts have expressed doubts as to whether such an organization really exists.
"The statement on 'The Brotherhood' is more like an attempt to unite disparate criminal groups," said Mark Galeotti, an expert on organized crime and a professor at the University of New York.
According to him, the “Brotherhood” reflects the popular perception of the “Russian Mafia”.
“I have not met anyone in the Russian law enforcement authorities or anywhere else who would confirm the existence of such a criminal organization,” Galeotti said in a statement to the US Center for the Study of Corruption and Organized Crime.
Mr. Galeotti also agrees with George Mason University professor Liz Shelley.
“If they act together, it’s more like a criminal network, but not an organization,” she said, according to the Center for the Study of Corruption and Organized Crime.
In the middle of last year, Mark Galeotti suggested that the “Brotherhood” unites the most close Russian thief in the law of Aslan Usoyan, known as Grandfather Hassan.
The criminal authority was killed in January of this year.
Thus, the activities of Lashi Shushanashvili and Zakhariya Kalashova, who completed the list in 2012, were closely related to Grandfather Hassan, and another participant of the list, Temuri Mirzoev, became Grandfather Hassan’s nephew.
However, Mr. Galeotti noted that some personalities had nothing to do with Usoyan.
In his view, all of them were rather united by common financial and criminal interests, such as the supply of drugs from Afghanistan.
Meanwhile, the scandal surrounding the inclusion in the "Brotherhood" of Gregory Leps - the favorite singer of Russian President Vladimir Putin - attracted the attention of the Kremlin.
Naturally, we expect to receive more detailed information from our American counterparts, in connection with which such a decision was made, why it was included in such lists, - said the press secretary of the head of state Dmitry Peskov.
In any case, he (Leps) is a citizen of the Russian Federation.
As well as the interests of all Russian citizens, his interests will be protected.
Head of Gazprom Alexey Miller says the pipeline in Bulgaria marks a new era in the gas sector
The start of construction of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of the largest energy projects in Europe, said the head of Gazprom.
“Today a significant event occurred: the construction of the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, has begun,” Gazprom chairman Alexei Miller said in a statement on Thursday.
This project is a key element of the energy security of the entire European continent.
“South Stream” is designed to diversify Russia’s export routes through Europe.
The dispute over the contract between Gazprom and its partners in Ukraine, which contains most of Russia’s gas destined for Europe, raises the level of risk for conventional routes, officials say.
Miller said that a direct connection with Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are eliminated "forever."
Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from the South Stream at a reduced price as soon as the entire project starts to work in 2015.
Gazprom said construction should begin in other countries located further along the gas pipeline by the end of the year.
The annual design capacity of the pipeline is 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.
This morning in the Saratsk region, the driver of the car "Peugeot" left on the runway on the 115 km of the route Odessa-Rene, and collided with a bus, which was six people.

Two YMCA employees are charged with sexual offences before charges against Jonathan Lord, as the Royal Commission has learned
Two YMCA NSW employees were charged with sexual offences against children before being charged in 2011 with child-care worker Jonathan Lord in Caringbach, the Royal Commission on Sexual Violence against Children reported.
But the commission’s introductory statement said it had “never dealt with cases of sexual violence against children within its organization.”
Chief Executive Officer Philip Hayra was questioned about one case when a YMCA employee was charged with crimes related to child pornography, and another case when a gym instructor at YMCA Caringbah Hall was convicted of sex crimes against children in 1991.
Mr. Hare told Gayle Ferness, a lawyer assisting the commission, that he knew about the first case but did not know about the second.
He acknowledged that the YMCA in its introductory speech to the commission also allowed inaccuracies, stating that “there were external YMCA checks that recognized that the YMCA is in the forefront of ensuring children’s safety.”
The evidence presented by the commissions indicates that the YMCA was notified that it had received the second from the end of the four possible quality audit results carried out by the Department of Education and Communities in August of this year.
Mr. Heir, who joined the YMCA when he was 21, admitted that he and the lower management had failed by hiring Lord and were unable to provide a clear understanding of his commitments to reporting violations of children's security policies.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sex crimes against 12 boys during his two-year career at the YMCA.
He was jailed for at least six years.
But Mr. Hare rejected the suggestion that YMCA’s corporate ethics prevented employees from reporting Lord’s violations in the area of child safety.
Employees testified that they observed violations, including that the Lord was alone with the children, personally cared for them, put them on his knees, said he loved one of them and allowed them to play with his mobile phone.
Daniel Oxwell, who was under the leadership of Lord and asked to teach her to protect children because she was concerned about his behavior, testified that she had found Jackie Barnatt, a caregiver and caregiver for the children of the YMCA branch in Caringbach, who was the trusteee.
The Executive Director said that he did not accept the staff ' s explanation that it was inconvenient for them to report the situation to their senior managers.
Rather, according to him, their friendship with Lord distracted them from the idea of the need to report him.
Mr. Hearr said he had presented his opinion to the YMCA Council of New South Wales that the lesson for organizing the “Jonathan Lord incident” was not “to provide information” on the part of the staff, and the Council agreed with him.
Mr. Hare said that the decision to force staff to sign confidentiality agreements shortly after the charges were made was made by the YMCA Director General for Child Care Liam Whitley.
He said it was meant to prevent the evidence from deteriorating, but at the same time it was “experienced” and the decision was poorly implemented.
The YMCA of New South Wales was not a safe organization for children during Jonathan Lord’s work in it between 2009 and 2011, said Stephen Smolboun, a professor at Griffith University.
He said there were “serious problems” in recruiting, selecting, instructing, training and controlling staff.
The hearings are postponed until December 20.
Fashion Week in S<0xC3><0xA3>o Paulo.
She is considered not just a model in her homeland, but a real star.
Despite the fact that Gisele Bündshen left her job for a while, having gone to maternity leave, in these days and this week she came to the parade specially.
Her long absence did not prevent her from retaining her place on the podium and on the pedestal.
Giselle remains the world’s highest-paid supermodel.
This time she participated in the show of the brand "Kolchchi".
The final of the fashion week is usually the most interesting shows.
It was designed by the stylist Lino Villaventura.
For more than 30 years, in parallel with the production of a luxury pret-a-port, the designer has been actively working in theatre and cinema, designing performances and designing costumes for many famous paintings.
In total, more than 30,000 firms and companies related to the textile industry and the fashion world took part in the closing fashion week in S<0xC3><0xA3>o Paulo.
It is one of the most dynamically developing sectors of production, it employs more than 2 million Brazilians, and annual turnover reaches $50 billion.
Tony Blair said he would take the chance to return as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, but admits that his return is unlikely.
On the eve of an interview on the fifth anniversary of his resignation, the 59-year-old politician expressed his views on various aspects of domestic policy.
Since resigning in June 2007, after ten years as a leader, Blair has largely avoided discussing British politics, limiting most of his comments to foreign affairs and his role as ambassador in the Middle East’s four peacekeepers.
Answering the question of whether he would return to the post of Prime Minister, Blair, according to the London Evening Standard, said: “Yes, of course, but it’s unlikely to happen, so...”
Milan's head coach Massimiliano Allegri expressed regret about the null result in the match of the 10th round of the Italian championship with Lazio.
The specialist also noted that the failures at the start were caused by a series of injuries of leading players.
"I'm very sorry we didn't win," Tmw said.
The team played a good match, creating 3-4 good opportunities.
In the first half, we didn't allow anything for Lazio.
In the second the Romans added, but in general I cannot say that we have lost our concentration.
We had to win.
Last season, we did the task of getting into the Champions League.
We are now lagging behind the schedule, but this is due to a whole series of injuries to key players.
Rami and Honda?
They are very good players with character.
But our team is still good.
Take a look at Kaka, who held the meeting at a high level.
Experts in equestrian events coming to Cardiff to fight for the Horse of the Year award knew the competition would be very high.
But no one was ready for the appearance of three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Not even a schoolboy, just a few months before taking his first steps, this little boy with his pet Shetland pony Toffi rolled through three laps to easily take the main prize, leaving 30 adult rivals far behind.
This inseparable couple – of the same growth – received high ratings for appearance, behavior and style at the annual competition held by the Sunnybenk equestrian center in the city of Radry near Cardiff.
Having come to the general public against the background of men and women in elegant hats, he shifted his hat and proudly walked around the circle of a two-year-old Toffy.
Judges praised Fenton for his not at all developed innate ability to deal with horses over the years.
And Toffy got the highest rating for appearance and character.
Fenton was given Toffy on his third birthday in March last year, and since then he has been dealing with Shetland pony every day.
His 30-year-old mother, Donna, said: “Fenton and Toffee are a great duet.”
They had a lot of rivals, but these two left with a gold cup and a break.
It was only his second performance with Toffy, and we were all thrilled when he won.
Completely unfamiliar people in the arena considered it so phenomenal that they wanted to take pictures with it.
This boy from the village of Nantillo, near Abbeville, South Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been exhibiting horses for more than 10 years.
Ms. Howells said: “The whole audience was impressed, and everyone shouted applause and yelled.”
He ran through the sand along the length of the arena, and although he looked so tiny, he did his job perfectly.
Fenton is crazy about animals – he loves horses, tractors and farms, and he has two chickens he cares about.
Judging from how he started, he will soon be taking part in Horses of the Year — and I’m sure he’ll do well.
A spokesperson for the annual horse show said: “Fenton is only three years old, but he knows how to deal with his pony.”
Together they are a great team.
The judges noted Fenton and Toffee for their appearance and how they presented themselves in the show ring.
They assess the harmony of the pony and breeder performance – Fenton and Toffy were the best in the ring.
I’m sure Fenton helped his attractive outfit, he really looked good in his role.
Chinese newspaper's most publicized call "will be subject to reorganization"
The Chinese newspaper, which published on the first strip a call for the release of the reporter accused of fraud, must be reorganized, according to the regulator.
The Guangzhou-based newspaper New Express made an unexpected public statement with a request for the release of journalist Chen Yunzhou.
But Mr. Chen later admitted on television that he had taken bribes for writing fake articles about a company with a state-owned stake.
Now the “New Express” has to go through the “full error correction process”, as the regulator reports.
The order to “fix errors” came from the Guangdong government in the field of press and publications, radio, film and television.
A preliminary investigation revealed that the Yangcheng Evening News Group’s New Express newspaper published several false reports about Zoomlion, a company registered on the stock exchange, between September 2012 and August 2013.
“The editorial board of the New Express was disorientated,” the regulator said in a statement.
He reported that it was decided to “impose an administrative requisition on Chen Yunzhou in the form of a revocation of his reporter license.”
He also instructed Yangcheng Evening News Group to carry out a full correction of errors in the New Express and recommended that it conduct an investigation into the newspaper’s situation-related officials and immediately make changes to the leadership of the New Express.
Mr. Chen wrote several articles for the New Express, in which he declared financial violations in the construction equipment of the company called Zoomlion.
After he was arrested, his newspaper published two calls for his release on the first strip, stating that it supports his journalistic activities.
But Mr. Chen later appeared on state television with the admission that he had published fake articles for money.
“In this case, I have harmed Zoomlion, as well as the entire news media industry and its ability to earn public trust,” he told state broadcaster CCTV.
I did it mainly because I was thirsty for money and fame.
I realized my guilt.
Following Mr. Chen’s admission, the New Express published an apology on the first strip, saying the newspaper had failed to properly check his reports.
Recently, several high-ranking suspects made confessions on television.
Experts say that the practice of evictions in China is still widespread, despite recent amendments to the laws prohibiting the authorities from forcing anyone to self-determination.
U.S.-Mexico Tunnel Discovered for Drug Transfer Equipped with Own Railroad
One of the most complex tunnels for drug smuggling between the U.S. and Mexico has been found, equipped with its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail system.
U.S. authorities have described the four-by-three-foot-wide tunnel as one of the most complex secret passages they have ever discovered.
This tunnel, whose zigzags make up the length of almost six football fields, connects warehouses near the city of Tijuana (Mexico) and San Diego (USA).
This area is filled with imperceptible warehouses, which facilitates the hidden loading of drugs in trucks.
The tunnel was closed before any drugs were inadvertently transported through it, authorities said.
According to court documents, law enforcement officers confiscated eight and a half tons of marijuana and 327 pounds of cocaine when the tunnel was discovered.
Three men, who, according to law enforcement officials, worked as drivers, were charged with storing marijuana and cocaine for the purpose of distribution.
In the event of their conviction, they are threatened with imprisonment of 10 years until life imprisonment.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers use vast underground drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth major passageway discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Several of the largest tunnels were discovered in central Mexico after harvesting marijuana in October, which put drug cartels ahead of a complex task of delivering their product to consumers quickly.
In 2010, authorities found a passage of about 700 yards long, equipped with railroad tracks that ran from the kitchen of one of the houses in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
Pensions have been increasing in Belarus since November.
In Belarus, pensions have been increasing since November of this year, reported the correspondent of BELTA in the main department of pension provision of the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection.
As of 1 November of this year, the adjustment of the average salary of workers in the republic, applied in the previous recalculation of pensions, with an increase of its amount by 5.4% will be carried out, and the corresponding recalculation of pensions of the year 78.
As a result of the recalculation from November, the working pensions by age will increase, on average, by 5.3%.
The average pension by age will be Br2 million. 295,000.
The increase in pensions will affect 2.4 million residents of the republic.
Expenditure of the Social Protection Fund of the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection of Belarus for the payment of pensions in increased amounts from November of this year will increase by Br274.3 billion per month.
At the same time as the recalculation of working pensions in November of this year, the minimum and social pensions, allowances, increases and supplements to pensions will be recalculated due to the increase in the budget of the minimum living average per capita population.
BPM for the period from 1 November 2013 to 31 January 2014 was approved by the Government in the amount of Br1 million 47 thousand 530 - by 2.1 per cent higher than the period from 1 August to 31 October.
With effect from 1 November, the minimum working pensions, social pensions and allowances, increases and allowances to pensions will be increased by 2.1%, respectively.
In Belarus for the payment of pensions, taking into account the increases in 2013, more than Br53 trillion.-0-
British police hand over extradition notice to Assange
British police today filed a notice of extradition of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who took refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London and sought asylum.
In Scotland Yard, they said they had handed over to the 40-year-old Australian an “official demand to surrender” with a requirement to appear at the police station, adding that if this requirement is not met, he will continue to be subject to arrest.
Assange is threatened with extradition to Sweden on charges of sexual crimes after he exhausted his capabilities under British law when the Supreme Court rejected his appeal for extradition earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm would hand him over to the United States, he took refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London on June 19, asking the South American country for political asylum.
“Scotland Yard has handed over to a 40-year-old man an official demand to surrender, requiring him to arrive at the police station on the day and time of our choice,” he said.
He is still in breach of the terms of bail.
The embassy declined to comment on the submission of the notification to the police.
Assange fears he will be extradited from Sweden to the U.S. to face possible espionage charges after more than 250,000 U.S. diplomatic depots were posted on the WikiLeaks website.
A driver who drove 130 miles an hour with a hot drink between his legs was fined <0xC2><0xA3>1,000.
The driver was fined <0xC2><0xA3>1,000 for driving at speeds up to 130 miles per hour (210 km/h) with a hot drink held between his legs.
The 35-year-old Andrew Howie of Tiptree, Essex, was spotted behind the wheel of his Mercedes Benz on the A120 road in Braintree on May 27.
When the police stopped him, they found a drink to carry him between his legs.
In the World Court, Colchester Howie admitted the charge of driving without proper scrutiny and attention.
The addition to his driver's license of seven fine points led to them being banned for six months from driving.
Howie was also required to pay a fee of <0xC2><0xA3>90 and an additional fee to help victims of crime of <0xC2><0xA3>100.
The tax for foreign property owners will lead to the bursting of the London bubble
The Treasury has carried out a preliminary assessment of the capital gains tax measure, but is awaiting a final decision from Mr. Osborne, who in the 2012 budget introduced a state tax rate of 7% for houses that are not fictitious in the value of more than <0xC2><0xA3>2 million, and annual payments for rents.
At present, the tax on residential real estate in the districts of Westminster, Kensington and Chelsea, amounting to <0xC2><0xA3>708 million in the 2012/13 financial year, already exceeds the total amount in Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, North-East, North-East, North-East.
Mr. Cook said: “After the increase in the state tax on expensive houses and the introduction of the legislation related to evasion, it is very difficult to assert that the taxation of expensive real estate is degraded regardless of the influence of the outdated municipal system.”
“But this move could lead to some foreign investors being reluctant to buy a property in London or its current owners not wanting to sell it,” he added.
The cost of first-class real estate — the top 5-10% of the housing market at a price — in the rich south-western London belt, which stretches from Fulham to Wimbledon, has risen by a record 11.8% over the past year.
According to the Savills study, prices in central London continued to show steady growth of 5.6% year-on-year, but were overshadowed by an actively developing “domestic market” with a rise in prices in the south-west, in the north (6.4%) and in the north.
Scientists have shed some light on how a dog’s tail movements are related to her mood.
Earlier studies have shown that happy dogs tilt their tail to the right (from the dog's point of view), while anxious dogs tilt their tail to the left.
But now scientists say that other representatives of the family of dogs can notice these subtle differences in the tail swing and react to them.
Professor Giorgio Vallortigar, a neuroscientist at the University of Trento, says: “It is well known that people have different left and right sides of the brain that are involved in the formation of stimulants that cause positive or negative emotions.”
Here we tried to look at this and other species.
He added that just like humans, dogs’ right brains control the left side of the body and vice versa, and the two hemispheres play different roles in emotions.
To find out more about how dogs react to the various pulls of other dogs’ tails, the researchers watched the animals when they watched movies about other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of the animals and analyzed their behavior.
It’s likely that we’ll soon understand why their tails sometimes turn in one direction and sometimes in the other.
Professor Vallortigar said: “We showed dogs videos with dogs — either naturalistic versions, or silhouettes to get rid of any other distorting factors, and we could manipulate the tail movement and direct the tail more to the left or right.”
When the animals saw that in the rest the dog was not expressing anything moved his tail to the right (from the dog’s point of view), they remained completely relaxed.
But when they noticed that the tail was leaning mostly to the left (again from the dog’s point of view), their heartbeat increased and they looked anxious.
Professor Vallortigar said he didn’t think the dogs intentionally communicated with each other using these movements.
In fact, he believes that dogs have learned from their experience, which movements they should worry about, and which ones they do not.
He observes: “If there are several encounters with other dogs and often throwing their tail to one side is associated with more friendly behavior, and the right side gives less friendly behavior, then the dog will react based on that experience.”
Researchers say these results can give owners, veterinarians, and trainers a deeper understanding of their pet’s emotions.
Dog behavior expert John Bradshaw, a guest researcher at the University of Bristol’s Veterinary School, said it wasn’t the first study to check whether the left and right sides of dogs matter.
Last year, a team of scientists at Lincoln University found that dogs turn their heads to the left if they look at an aggressive dog, and to the right if they look at a happy dog.
In another scientific paper from the University of Victoria in Canada, he reported: “Dogs were more likely to approach a robot dog when their tail was tilted to the left rather than to the right, rather than becoming anxious,” researching the opposite behavior toward Italians.
He said the differences could be due to the fact that dogs in different studies did not fully perceive animals in movies or robot dogs as dogs.
It could be a useful study of how dogs react to real dogs, he explained.
“While there is enough evidence for different mammals that two hemispheres of the brain are used for different purposes, many details still need to be clarified, and dogs are no exception,” he said.
However, given the ease with which their behavior can be recorded, it is likely that we will soon understand why their tails are sometimes directed in one direction and sometimes in the other.
Arctic Monkeys postpone concert in Glasgow due to Alex Turner's illness
Rock band Arctic Monkeys postponed the concert in Glasgow after her vocalist was diagnosed with laryngitis.
This Sheffield band was due to perform at the city’s Hydro concert venue on Friday.
However, the disease of vocalist Alex Turner forced them to postpone the show.
The group's statement came after it was forced to postpone the concert at LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on their official website, Arctic Monkeys said: “After deciding to transfer the show at the Birmingham LG Arena tonight and after seeking medical help, Arctic Monkeys are also scheduled to postpone the show at the Hydro site in Glasgow on Friday, November 1.
“Alex Turner was diagnosed with ‘laringitis,’ and, unfortunately, he is unable to speak.”

Pope Francis to appoint first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will inaugurate the new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time during his tenure on February 22, the Vatican announced on Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest clergy in the Catholic Church after the pope, and it is they who elect the pope, so that Francis will appoint his first group of people who will ultimately participate in the election of his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, after reaching the age of 80, he can no longer participate in the election of the pope - it is the prerogative of the group of 120 "electoral cardinals".
In announcing this news, Vatican Press Secretary Father Federico Lombardi said that before the ceremony of construction in San would be held a meeting of all the current cardinals, known as the Consistory.
“Pope Francis has decided to announce in advance his decision to convene a Consistory in February in order to facilitate the planning of other meetings with the participation of cardinals from different parts of the world,” Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Votes said the number of electorate cardinals is likely to decline by February.
He said that the pope usually calls as many cardinals as he needs to bring the number of electorate cardinals back to 120, as well as as as many cardinals over the age of 80 as he wishes.
Consistory next year will be of great importance, because it will be the first since Francis was elected in March this year, Valero said.
At the moment, there is a kind of bias in favour of Europe and especially in favour of Italy.
“It will be interesting to see if a new pope will appoint cardinals from other regions of the world to restore balance,” he said.
In South America, forty percent of Catholics live, but they are represented by a small number of cardinals.
They will also be the first cardinals to be elected since Francis formed the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world who are tasked with finding ways to reform the church.
In the past, the father decided everything on his own.
“Now Francis has chosen eight cardinals to help him,” Valero said.
He said it was "completely possible" that Francis would turn to the cardinals for advice.
But we haven’t been in a situation like this before – it’s all for us for the first time.
Valero said the popes were usually appointed cardinal bishops from major parishes, but Francis was "full of surprises - so we don't know who he'll call."
GM recalls a number of new pickup trucks in the U.S. to refine seat backs
General Motors Co is recalling nearly 19,000 all-new 2014 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickups to address the problem of manually adjusting the seat backrests, according to a notice from U.S. transportation safety regulators on Friday.
On some of the pick-up trucks, the front seats may have a defect in the tilt mechanism of the backs.
As a result, the backs of the seats do not comply with the federal safety standards of the head restraints.
“When a car hits the back of the headphones, it may not adequately protect the driver and passengers, increasing the risk of injury,” said a notice posted on the website of the National Road Traffic Safety Administration.
The recalled models were manufactured in the period from 1 August to 10 September.
The production of GM pickup trucks began in June and represents the most important launch of the car into serial production for the leading American car manufacturer since its restructuring due to bankruptcy in 2009.
GM informed the owners of pick-up trucks about the defect in the first half of October.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration was unable to consider a notice to owners in connection with the government’s 16-day shutdown, which slowed car sales in October.
Sales of the Silverado and Sierra pickup trucks, which were upgraded for the 2014 model range, increased by about 20 percent over the first 10 months of this year, GM said on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado pickups and 16,503 Sierra pickups.
GM shares on the New York Stock Exchange rose 1.4 percent on Friday afternoon to a mark of $37.47.
The Desperation of Obama's Voter
I voted for President Obama twice, sharing the hope of change.
He says Obama has allowed the obstructionism of the Republicans to reduce to no commendable efforts.
Obstructionism cannot serve as an excuse for problems with the website of the Obama-reformed healthcare system, drone attacks
Obama’s 2008 campaign memoirs are a sad reminder of what could have happened.
Nathaniel P. Morris is a student of the second year of the Faculty of Medicine at Harvard University.
I'm reading a very sad book these days.
I thought this book would excite me in times of sadness in the second year of medical school and rekindle a sense of hope in me.
It’s called “Crazy to Win,” and it’s a memoir of Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign.
When I finish writing reports on my patients in the evening and lie down in bed, this book brings me back to a time when politics inspired millions of people and speeches could be breathtaking.
The victory in the election was impressive, and the leading news programs paused to understand this historic moment.
My classmates were crying with joy, and my parents kept all the newspapers they could find.
A young team of strategists had to come to the White House, and the people were ready for change.
At the time of Obama’s inauguration in 2008, his support rate was 82 per cent.
Then I close the book.
Returning to the present is a rude awakening, like pulling out of a dream.
It is difficult to remember those days of optimism – they seem to be a distant memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
Over the years that have passed since I dropped my first ballot, the changes have really happened.
It was something I couldn't even imagine.
I pay tribute to Obama for his great and diverse achievements, from the adoption of the law on affordable medical care to the withdrawal of our military from Iraq, the abolition of the “Don’t ask, don’t say” rule, the assassination of Osama bin Laden.
Moreover, I believe that party obstructionism has blocked too many attempts to advance our country: immigration reform, the possibility of choosing public health and closing the base in Guantanamo, among others.
But after countless times, when I was on the side of the Obama administration, protecting it from colleagues and peers, I ran out of explanations that I can provide.
I have reached the point of political desperation.
The obstructionism of the Republicans cannot explain the permission to interrogate foreign leaders or to strike unmanned children in other countries.
It cannot explain the collection of data on the privacy of Americans by the National Security Agency or the prosecution of detainees revealing the government’s wrongful actions.
He cannot explain the murder of American citizen Anwar al-Awlaki without trial and investigation or non-compliance with the limits of state funding and spending during presidential campaigns.
He cannot justify the findings of the report, which states that the White House’s efforts to silence the media are “the most aggressive ... since the Nixon administration.”
And lately, he can’t justify failing to develop a simple website for more than three years after the signing of the Accessible Healthcare Act.
I don't know if I should have expected that.
Did I have to understand at the age of 18 that the leadership could contradict the political campaigns that preceded it?
It is obvious that the work in the election is not a predictable program of action, since our social dialogue will be formed by an opposition political party and by random events such as the Newtown massacre.
However, from all the examples I have listed above, it can be seen that they were largely the administration's own choice.
And that's what's bothering me the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney represented an incomprehensible and crude alternative, it seemed that he was unable to make decisions on his own policies or views.
I thought that in his second term, Obama, freeing himself from the pressure of future elections, justified the hopes of which we have heard for such a long time.
However, when Obama’s rating fell below 45 percent this week, it became much harder to get back to 2008 through this book.
It makes me yearn for the many promises that have flown.
This week I read that part of the book that describes how Clinton inflicted a dazzling defeat on Obama in the Pennsylvania primary.
At an analysis of the causes of the failure, he told his staff that they should return to normal and remain true to their goal.
“I want us to bring back our attractiveness,” he said.
We have to remember who we are.”
It's been five years, Mr. President, and I totally agree with you.

Clive Palmer argues that MP Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest in the issue of child care leave.
Billionaire MP Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest in the issue of child care leave because his daughters can get pregnant and benefit from it.
This mining tycoon, who has an unresolved dispute over the $6 million carbon tax, made this statement at a time when he tried to shy away from the question of whether he had a conflict.
Palmer’s combined party can control up to four votes in the Senate, which may be crucial in deciding on the abolition of carbon taxes and mining activities.
But Mr. Palmer argued that the conflict of interest could only have been with the ministers, and said that Mr. Abbott's daughters would personally benefit from political measures.
“He has a big conflict of interest when it comes to paid childcare leave, because if any of these daughters get pregnant, he’ll have a direct interest in whether they get a vacation or not,” Palmer said.
Two months after the election, the Electoral Commission formally declared Mr. Palmer the winner in the contest for the seat from the Sunshine Coast of the constituency of Farfax with an excess of 53 votes after counting the votes.
Mr. Palmer called for a revision of the electoral counting procedure to speed up the process.
Tony Abbott's daughters are Francis and Bridget.
Should a decision on these elections be made two months after we have voted?
“We need to have a better system,” he said.
Why shouldn't we have such a system so that we can come in, enter our data into the computer, vote right away, and get the result at 6:30 p.m. that night?
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of pencils for bulletins.
Is it because they can erase the result if someone doesn’t like it?
Using a pencil in our time seems strange.
The Electoral Commission is exploring opportunities for e-voting and has recently published a joint discussion paper with New Zealand.
Mr Palmer, 59, said his program included an international airport for Sunshine Coast and he would be “very serious” about his new job.
The state office assumes service to the society.
“We’re not getting any rewards other than the gratitude of history for being able to serve this district at a critical time,” he said.
RBS removes two foreign exchange traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland has temporarily removed two traders from its foreign exchange operations unit, according to the information of two people familiar with the situation, which is another confirmation that global scrutiny by regulators of alleged manipulations in the foreign exchange market.
Some of the world’s largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are cooperating with regulators in investigations related to the world’s largest financial market, with a daily turnover of $5.3 trillion.
These two traders will be the first RBS employees to be removed in the course of an ongoing investigation, which is echoed by a scandal related to the interbank rate manipulation of LIBOR.
Refusing to comment on the removals, the bank confirmed that it received requests for information from regulators this month.
“Our ongoing investigation into this issue is ongoing, and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and other regulators,” the bank said two weeks ago.
Last month, the officials said RBS had forwarded the records of emails and instant messages it received and sent to the UK’s regulatory body, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).
This trader, Richard Asher, left RBS in 2010 and, as far as he is aware, was granted leave for his current position as head of European spot currency trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of European spot trading at Citi, went on vacation this week, while Matt Gardiner, a former senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was removed from the job by Standard Chartered Bank this week.
None of these traders have been charged with any violations.
Mr. Asher ' s instant messaging contact group included bankers from Barclays and Citigroup, according to informed individuals.
UBS reported this week that it has taken action against some of its employees after Swiss regulator Finma said it was investigating alleged currency market manipulations at a number of Swiss banks.
At least six regulators around the world — the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss antitrust authority Weko, FCA, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority — are considering allegations that bankers have conspired to influence the currency market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also started internal audits or received requests for information from regulators, individuals familiar with the situation said.
Banks are looking at instant messaging and e-mails for several years in search of cases of crimes.
The news of the checks has skewed traders in the field of activity, which in recent years has been one of the largest sources of income of trading units of investment banks, which, however, this year, faced difficulties due to the fact that low volatility of currencies will reduce the benefits.
Some bankers have tried to reduce the seriousness of the situation by saying that it is almost impossible to manipulate an extensive and high-liquid currency market, but senior traders say this is not always true.
According to the senior trader, despite the huge volume of day-to-day trades in the foreign exchange market, the fragmentation of liquidity between different trading platforms and the wider use by banks of their domestic platforms means that “you can start to influence the market for non-commercial goods”.
The news came on the same day as Credit Suisse announced it had fired one of its London Stock Exchange traders this week after it caused nearly $6 million in losses at the end of last year.
The Bank shall immediately notify the relevant authorities and shall cooperate with its regulators.
“We are confident that the trader acted alone and that this issue was localized,” Credit Suisse said.
Supreme Court Approves Obama's Health Law
The U.S. Supreme Court ruled today that Barack Obama’s flagship health care law is constitutional, which is a major victory for the Obama administration.
Voting 5 to 4, the judges ruled that separate provisions under the Patient Protection and Affordable Health Act requiring citizens to acquire health insurance by 2014 or to pay a fine are constitutional in accordance with the government’s tax authority.
Supreme Court President John Roberts joined four more liberal members of the court, while judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito, and Kennedy were against.
The court also left the remaining sections of this 2,700-page law in force and further ruled that the health law’s requirement for states to increase compliance with the Medicaid program’s requirements, otherwise they would lose all federal funding for the Medicaid program, is not unconstitutional.
A request for blocking the bill was made by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The law was strongly opposed by each of the major Republican presidential candidates during the 2012 primary season, including the alleged candidate Mitt Romney.
Football is the reason for the difference?
In the State Duma, within the framework of the “Open Tribune”, politicians and experts talked about how to preserve the national peace in Russia.
Among the proposals was the following: to ban football in the North Caucasus, because from this game - one scandal and difference.
Speaker Sergei Narishkin recalled recent events in Biryuleve and said that in order to reduce the “degree of tension in society” politics and the media should be correct in their statements.
Probably, he meant a recent scandal with Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who in one of the TV shows threatened to surround the Caucasus with sticking wires, if there are not want to limit the birth rate...
All the speakers also spoke about measures to regulate migration from CIS countries, and about measures to harmonize relations between peoples living in Russia, which gave the discussion a sense of humour.
Maxim Grigoriev said that the events in Biryulev - "model conflict that could be predicted", but "for these questions we have too many people and instances", and seven nannies have a child without an eye.
The concept of multiculturalism, which Europe has long practiced in relation to migrants, in the opinion of the public, has failed, and it is necessary to find its way.
Historian Yuri Petrov placed great hopes for a new unified history textbook.
“We still need to create a handbook on the history of the culture of the peoples of the country so that the students in Tatarstan know what kind of people live in Dagestan and vice versa,” he said.
Gennady Zhuganov proposed to impose criminal responsibility for "calls to dismember Russia": "If the United States says on the radio that it is necessary to give Alaska to Russia, you will be arrested and given 20 years in prison!"
Vladimir Zhirinovsky tried very hard "not to light up".
As usual, he accused journalists of bringing sick and acute national problems to a public debate: “In the dust of controversy there is little to say!”
The leader of the faction "United Russia" Vladimir Vasilyev immediately advised journalists to close the "paper" and agree to conduct talks on this topic carefully, and then the same obligations can be assumed by the politicians.
We have adopted about 30 laws that regulate migration, and the order as a whole is established, Mr. Vasilyev said.
As an example, he introduced a law that places responsibility on regional and municipal authorities for the inter-national peace in their territory.
But Lyudmila Andrichenko did not share her enthusiasm about this law: it does not have "clear ideas about what adaptation of migrants is, about its mechanisms and limits.
So, the subjects will treat the scope of these powers in a different way.
In addition, municipalities do not have the personnel necessary to solve such complex issues, do not have the means, and the methodological recommendations that they could use, the center does not give them.
The head of the Duma Committee on Nationalities, Hajimet Safaraliyev, proposed the creation of a special department called the "Ministry of National Security", which would deal with national policy issues.
But Valery Tishkov, who in the 1990s headed a similar agency, later abolished, opposed it.
It is enough to have at the federal level a special person, a "minister without a portfolio", to whom you could turn, if anything.
“We are walking along the edges, the shells are breaking apart, it is very important for representatives of different ethnicities and religions to stand together against provocations, and this work should receive worthy informational support,” said the representative of the RPC on relations with society Vsevolod Chaplin.
No neutrality of the state with regard to dangerous ideologies, including religious ones, should, therefore, be allowed.
Here Oleg Nilov started the discussion in an unexpected direction: "More talented people than in Chechnya or Dagestan, you still need to look, but they are pushed not on that road, not that road," - he said.
"Not that way" is the development of football: "The footballer beats the whole crowd, then the flags burn, then the comrades stone each other...
Maybe we don't need that kind of football?
There is another type of sport - rugby is called...
"There will be no equals in the world in this kind of sport!" said Davoross hotly.
No one will be playing rugby in the Caucasus! - Mr. Zhirinovsky immediately intervened.
You will offer them more curling!
You need to know the national features, it is still like Georgian "Zaporozhets" to offer"...
In Yaroslavl, representatives of the Moscow club distinguished themselves by wild behavior on the stands - during a game with the local club.
Football will have to be banned all over the country.
The head of the control and disciplinary committee of the Russian Federation, Arthur Grigoryants, said that "Kuban" was fined 500,000 rubles, transferring from the House of Football correspondent "SE" Philippe PAPENKOV.
Such sanctions against the Krasnodar club were applied for the burning of the flag of Dagestan by fans on the stands during the 14th home game against Ange.
At the meeting were representatives of both clubs, a man from the RFPL.
We looked at all the available materials.
For the misconduct of spectators "Kuban" is fined 500,000 rubles.
Google, Samsung, Huawei have filed patent lawsuits against Nortel
The group, which owns thousands of former Nortel patents, filed a series of patent lawsuits against mobile phone makers on Thursday, including Google, whose price it broke at the Nortel bankruptcy auction.
The Rockstar consortium, which bought Nortel for $4.5 billion, filed a patent infringement lawsuit in the U.S. District Court in Texas against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of infringing seven patents.
These patents cover technologies that help match online search keywords with relevant advertising, the lawsuit says, which is the basis of Google’s search business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were unavailable and did not comment.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC are making phones running on Google’s Android operating system, which is fiercely competing with mobile products from Apple and Microsoft.
In 2011, Google offered Nortel patents at an initial price of $900 million.
Google has raised the price several times, eventually offering as much as $4.4 billion.
After losing the Nortel patents case to the Rockstar consortium, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a determining factor in this deal was in part Motorola’s patent library.
“Despite the unsuccessful attempt to acquire the patents that are the subject of the lawsuit at the auction, Google has infringed and continues to infringe them,” the lawsuit said.
Rockstar is demanding increased damages from Google, as it claims that Google’s patent infringement is deliberate, according to the claim.
Egypt's first freely elected president takes oath
Mohammad Mursi takes an oath, but the day of his celebration is unlikely to mark the end of the political struggle in Egypt.
Mohammad Mursi promised a "new Egypt" when he took an oath to become the country's first freely elected president, replacing Hosni Mubarak, who was overthrown 16 months ago.
At his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Mursi also became the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world and the fifth head of state in Egypt after the overthrow of the monarchy some 60 years ago.
He took an oath before 18 judges in black robes in the courthouse on the bank of the Nile, built in the style of an ancient Egyptian temple.
“We are striving for a better future, for a new Egypt and a second republic,” Mursi said during a ceremony shown live on state television.
“Today, the Egyptian people laid the foundations of a new life – absolute freedom, genuine democracy and stability,” said Mursi, a 60-year-old engineer with an American background from the Muslim Brotherhood, a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a friend of the Muslim Brotherhood, a member of a fundamentalist group that is the majority of its 84-year-old life.
The building was guarded by hundreds of soldiers and police when Mursi arrived with a small mansion shortly after 11 a.m. local time.
Only a few hundred supporters gathered at the courthouse to welcome the new president, and, unlike Mubarak’s presidential pump, the movement was stopped only for a short time to miss his native carousel along the normally bustling road connecting the city center.
Although Mursi was ridiculed as a non-charismatic “back-up wheel” of the Brothers, his personal prestige has grown sharply since his victory and a Friday speech in which he tried to present himself as a candidate not only against the 2011 autocracy of Islamists, but also all those who want to bring the child to an end.
“Today, Egypt is a civil, national, constitutional and modern state,” Mursi, dressed in a blue business suit with a red collar, told judges in the wooden paneled hall where he took the oath.
Mursi later went to Cairo University, where he was to give his inaugural speech.
He was given an official reception with an army orchestra, performing a national anthem, during which he stood on the stand "peacefully".
In attendance was Field Marshal Hussein Tantavi.
His arrival was met with the slogan "Army and the People - One Hand", which was chanted by hundreds of people gathered in the main lecture hall of the university.
Founded in 1908 as a siege of secular education, Cairo University in the 1970s became a siege of Islamist student groups.
Mursi took a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahrir Square, where a rebellion broke out that ended Mubarak’s authoritarian rule last year, and promised to reclaim the powers of the president, whose post was stripped of by the military council, which took all cases.
But having agreed to take an official oath before the court, and not before the parliament, as was agreed, he is doing the will of the military, and this is a sign that the struggle for power will continue.
Mursi’s speech in Tahrir Square was filled with theatrical populist gestures.
The next meeting of the Association of Engineers of the Tyumen Region was held on the basis of the Yalutorov Automotive Plant.
As part of the event, a new line for the production of electric welded steel pipes was presented.
As told the commercial director of the company Denis Gribanov, in 2011 with the appearance of a new owner, a marketing study on the market of sales of steel structures in the Tyumen region was conducted.
It turned out that the region consumes more than 50,000 tons of electrically welded pipes per month.
After that, it was decided to change the profile of the plant and install on it equipment for their production.
This year, more than 7,000 tons of products have been shipped.
Investments in the plant amounted to more than 120 million rubles, - said Dennis Gribanov.
In October, a new status was launched, which allows to increase the range.
The plant produces both a small profile of the pipe, which is used for the private household, small forms of construction and in the furniture industry, and a large one - for the construction industry.
We plan to go to the level of production of 50,000 tons of products per year, which will account for about 10 percent of its consumption in the Tyumen region.
Despite the transition to another type of activity, the number of employees in the enterprise has not decreased - now it is 157 people, in the plans for the purchase of new equipment - the increase of the staff by even more than 50 employees.
The company is undergoing retraining of personnel, and the necessary specialists are selected from existing ones.
Next year, it is planned to introduce a new unit of longitudinal cutting steel thickness up to five millimeters, which will reduce the cost of the product, as well as another condition, with the production speed of the pipe up to 47 meters per minute.
By the end of 2014, the company is going to master the production of pipes, which are used in residential and communal households.
The management of the company is tasked with closing up to 70 percent of the Tyumen region’s needs for this product.
Deputy Director of the Department of Investment Policy Leonid Ostrumov, addressing the heads of production, advised to pay more attention to the modernization of machine-building enterprises.
There are also forms of state support for the industry, which include the reimbursement of interest rates on loans for the purchase of new equipment and the cost of its leasing.
This year, it is planned to allocate 150 million rubles for these purposes, two thirds of this amount has already been spent.
The last commission, which will consider the subsidy agreements, will accept documents from enterprises by November 15.
In addition, the budget reimburses costs for the participation of local producers in international fairs.
For the next year, the budget provides for funds in the amount of 150 million rubles, which can be used to compensate for leasing payments and loans for the purchase of new equipment.
5 million will be allocated for participation in fairs, 3 million for energy-saving programs.
Reduced to 72 million rubles for the reimbursement of ordered and paid equipment, which is produced in the south of the Tyumen region for the oil and gas complex.
According to Leonid Ostroumov, in the future this form of support will cease, as the reason for its introduction was the compensation of the tax on the extraction of minerals, which oil companies paid in the regional budget.
At present, they are not doing so, and subsidies are becoming direct expenditure obligations of the region.
In view of this, the Government of the region considers the direct support of industrial enterprises rather than the financing through them of the oil industry to be a priority.
The budget assistance will be related to investment projects that will be implemented in the production.
Many of the company’s managers expressed concern about the current situation in their relations with the oil companies.
The subsidy for equipment purchased by them is a competitive advantage of the industry of the southern Tyumen region, and in its cancellation it will be difficult to compete at a price with the average band of Russia, where the cheaper labor force.
In addition, the question of the continuity of the new owner of TNK-VR - the company Rosneft, which has not yet placed its orders on the enterprises of Tumen.
The agreement on the implementation of the project expires in 2013, and no request for its extension has been received.
Currently, companies in the south of the region, which specialize in equipment for the oil and gas sector, are unable to form a portfolio of orders for next year.
The question remains whether taxes on oil extracted in the Uvatsky region will come to the region’s budget or will be paid at the place of registration of the new owner of the mines.
Tomic to work 240 hours for an extremist video on social media
The Leninsky District Court of Tomsk sentenced to 240 hours of mandatory work of the city's residents, who posted on the social network a video of extremist orientation, RIA Novosti said on Friday a representative of the press service of the regional court.
According to the court, in March 2013, the man posted a video on his page on the popular social network, which was included in the federal list of extremist material.
In relation to him, a criminal case was initiated under the article of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation "Actions aimed at incitement of hatred and hostility, as well as at degradation of human dignity committed in public".
“The Leninsky District Court examined the case in a special way and found the man guilty of committing the above-mentioned crime, appointing a punishment in the form of 240 hours of compulsory work,” the agency’s interlocutor said.
She added that the man had fully confessed his guilt.
Azarov promised Ukrainians a collapse in the prices of goods after the signing of the association with the European Union
Ukrainian Prime Minister Nikolai Azarov is convinced that prices in the country will fall significantly after the country signs an association agreement with the European Union.
He said this during a conversation with the readers of his Facebook page.
I can definitely say that prices are determined by a large number of factors, among which there are, including, customs payments.
Thus, after the signing of the agreement and the entry into force of the Free Trade Area, the level of customs duties on imports of goods from the EU will be significantly reduced.
This will mean that prices will have to go down too.
"This is about goods that come from EU countries," Azarov wrote.
As for other goods, the effect of the agreement on the price will not be so direct, it will be indirect.
However, there should be no price increase either.
Therefore, the messages on billboards, which have recently appeared quite a lot in our country, that the association with the EU is an increase in prices, it is not at all so, or more precisely - it is not at all so", - summed up Azarov.
Investigators check information on child abuse in Biysk
On October 29, the media published a report that the nursery of one of the kindergartens of the city of Biisk locked the child in the basement for educational purposes.
At present, investigators are finding out all the circumstances, as well as giving a legal assessment of the actions of kindergarten employees.
After the accusation of misconduct, Evgeny Vasilyeva spoke
Yevgeny Vasilyev, a person who has been attached to the attention of the media for almost a year, has not commented on numerous publications in the press, both about thefts in the Ministry of Defense and about her personal affairs - about relations with the former Minister of Defense, Anatoly Sekovy.
However, on November 1, the figure in the case of "Defense Service" broke the silence.
In an interview with Life News, Vasilyeva said: "The task was, of course, exactly the same: to extract any negative information about the former defense minister from me."
There was blackmail about me having to testify, or I'd be put in jail.
To this day, these threats have ceased.
We'll go to court and prove our innocence.
We are 100 per cent confident of the victory.
At the same time, it can be concluded from the interview that, perhaps, Vasilyev was given the most words about what she does not care about with taste.
It is likely that the statement of the official representative of the SC of the Russian Federation Vladimir Markin that in the collection of paintings, which was collected by the figure of the case "Defense Service", were found counterfeits.
Among the arrested property are a number of paintings, which the hostess, being confident in her deep knowledge of art, acquired as masterpieces of world painting.
However, the art-scientific expertise appointed by investigators after the arrest of these paintings has established that they have no artistic value and, simply put, are cheap counterfeits,” Markin said in early October.
Some of the paintings stolen from the Ministry of Defense...
Then they admitted that they were not stolen from the Ministry of Defense, but said that I had a bad taste.
Who has the right to discuss my taste, to discuss some personal moments?
I think it's just a disbelief," Vasilyeva said.
Asked if she admits her guilt in at least one of the 12 criminal episodes, Vasilyeva said: "Of course, no.
To admit nothing at all.
Moreover, there is no harm to the Russian Federation, which we are talking about.
They just mislead people, that's all.
In addition, in response to today's statement of the SC of the Russian Federation that Vasilyeva avoids studying the materials of the criminal case, the lawyer of the figure said that he and his client "does not allow the investigator to get acquainted with the materials of the case".
What was the reason for the revelations of Vasilyeva, who is under house arrest, who has not yet communicated with the press?
Is it possible that the woman couldn't not answer the indictment in bad taste?
Or are the journalists of Komsomolka, who claimed a couple of days ago that she “falled into an even bigger trance under house arrest” because of the news of the reconciliation of Anatoli Serdyukov with his wife and his return to the family’s bosom?
Famous military observer Viktor Baranets wrote in his article "Did Serdyukov return to his wife?": "The investigators do not rule out that after such a shock she may become more conversational at interrogations."
Earlier, Vasilyev some accusations of the illegal sale of real estate of the Ministry of Defense took over.
Pre-winter trouble.

Do you think travel agents have gone into the past thanks to the Internet?
In the Flight Centre, there seems to be a reverse trend.
The company has updated its earnings forecast for the full year and expects record revenues from vacationers in Australia and the UK.
This travel company now expects its main full-year pre-tax profit to be from $325 to $340 million, compared to the previous forecast in the range of $305 to $315 million.
If the current benchmarks are reached, this will be a 12-17 percent increase compared to the record-breaking profit of $290.4 million in 2011/2012.
Graham Turner, CEO of Flight Centre, said the company had made 8 percent of profits in the first half of the year and started the second half with good performance, especially on weekend trips to Australia and the UK.
“For the period since the beginning of the year, we are working with profits in our 10 countries, and for some of them for the full year, a record high profit is expected before deducting interest and tax contributions,” he said.
“This includes Australia and the United Kingdom, which usually bring us the biggest profits.”
In Australia, the leisure business recovered in the second half of the year, compensating for the somewhat weaker domestic travel market.
Similarly, in the UK, the leisure business of Flight Centre went well, while corporate customers spent less.
Her U.S. business has compensated for losses incurred during the seasonally weak first half of the year, and is expected to make a profit for the third full year in a row.
Yesterday, Flight Centre shares increased by 3 cents to $38.20.
On October 31, the Barnaul police discovered two games halls.
The first worked in the Industrial District on the street of Vsletna.
At the time of inspection, the game was played.

In Yekaterinburg, a criminal killed two sisters and burned their bodies.
In Yekaterinburg, the police are searching for a criminal who had a violent quarrel with two sisters.
After the murder, their bodies were burned.
As reported to the "New Region" in the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation in the Sverdlovsk region, the day before in the Kirovsk district of the Ural capital after the fire in a three-room apartment located in a residential house on Uralskaya street, the bodies of two women were found.
The identities of the dead were soon established.
It turned out that they are sisters, one of them is a resident of Yekaterinburg for 44 years, the second - a 33-year-old resident of the Orenburg region.
The burnt apartment was taken away a few days ago.
His investigation was taken under the personal control of the chief police officer of the region, Mikhail Borodin.
The internal affairs authorities process various versions of the murder, check the alibis of previously convicted citizens and persons prone to such acts.
In addition, it is established for what purpose the women removed the apartment, and where they lived before, what they were doing, with whom they maintained relations.
Schools called for more attention to mathematics, spelling and grammar
School English Literature courses will require students to study at least one Shakespearean play, a 19th-century novel, romantic poetry, and contemporary British art literature from 1914 onwards.
The exam will also present “non-programmed texts” to encourage more extensive reading.
The combined course of English literature and language will be cancelled.
As of 2015, students will be required to pass a separate graduate exam in language, with persistent recommendations for choosing English literature as a separate exam.
The Department of Education is due to release new English and Mathematics curricula tomorrow — the first subjects subject to radical revision.
It will make changes to other core topics next year.
A separate regulatory body in the field of OFQUAL exams will present a revised structure of secondary school graduation exams, with a new system of assessments and a smaller volume of coursework.
Speaking in the summer, Education Minister Michael Gove said that “a broad consensus has been reached that we need to reform our exam system in order to restore public trust,” insisting that school graduation exams will be “more complex, more ambitious and more rigorous.”
Studies show that English schools devote less time to mathematics (116 hours a year, or three hours a week for a quarter) than in most countries.
For comparison, Australian schools give an average of 143 hours a year, and in Singapore, students take about 138 hours.
While there will be no formal requirement to allocate more time in the math schedule, sources in the coalition said that large-scale math school graduation exams combined with an increased coefficient in the rankings table, the presumption will most likely serve as a stimulus to provide school supplements.
In the curriculum, more attention will be paid to “real-life tasks,” including financial mathematics.
Tickets to Heihe will cost tourists 2,200 rubles
From tomorrow, from Blagoveshchensk to Heihe, tourists will start to ride the ships on an air cushion.
For those who want to travel to China, this means extra expenses.
A ticket for a puma is traditionally much more expensive than for a heat ride.
As reported in the reference service of the company "AmurASSO", the cost of a regular ticket will be 2,200 rubles.
Driving through the hall of increased comfort will cost 2,800 rubles.
By the way, this season tickets did not travel: at the same price puma drove tourists and last spring, and a year ago - autumn.
Dmitry Medvedev: the growth rate of GDP of the Russian Federation is insufficient for the development of the state
Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev considers the pace of growth of its GDP to be insufficient for Russia and is confident that the situation can be improved by simplifying the conditions of business lending and changing the structure of the Russian economy, focusing on innovation, Reuters reports.
This year, we had planned a GDP growth of 3%, maybe even a little more.
It will actually be less than 2%.
Against the background of the recession in a number of countries of Europe as a whole, it would not seem very bad, but for us it is little, because the economic base is not as strong as in a number of countries in general, and in general, in order to develop, there must be higher rates.
It is now very important that Russian companies and Russian businesses receive normal loans at a normal price – this is the first thing that must be done,” the head of government stressed.

A trip through the mud, rivers and jungles to provide free medical care
Dr. George Bwelle provides free medical care in the rural areas of Cameroon
Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend receiving hundreds of patients
In this West African country, there are not so many doctors — only one in 5,000 people.
Vote here or through your mobile device.
Dr. George Bwelle is one of the top 10 protagonists of CNN in 2013.
You can vote for him or any of the other 10 protagonists to make him the CNN Hero of the Year.
This man will receive $250,000 to continue his outstanding work.
For 21 years, George Bwelle saw his father come back to life and fall into a state of unconsciousness again, wandering through hospitals that were not properly equipped to help him.
James Bwelle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
At first, he only had a broken arm, but the infection spread to the brain and caused hematoma, which resembled himself for the rest of his life.
“There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon,” said George Bwelle.
If we had the money, we'd get him out of Cameroon.
Instead, Bwelle accompanied his father for years to overcrowded clinics and hospitals, receiving any treatment they could get.
“It’s not easy,” Bwelle said.
“You can leave home at 5 a.m., go to the hospital to be the first, but you’re not the first.
There are a lot of patients.
Some people may die because of what they have to wait for.
The situation hasn't changed much since Bwelle's father died in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one doctor per 5,000 people in Cameroon.
For comparison, the ratio in the United States is one doctor per 413 people.
And even if the Cameroonians could go to the doctor, many of them would not have it in their pockets.
Two out of five people in the country live on the poverty line, and nearly three-quarters of healthcare expenditures in the country are private.
“Their only problem is poverty,” Bwelle said.
“Because of poverty, they can’t enjoy their lives.”
Seeing the suffering of his father and many of his compatriots, Bwelle was determined to do something about it.
Last year, Dr. George Bwelle and his team of volunteers conducted 700 free surgeries.
He himself became a doctor and works as a vascular surgeon at Yaoundé Central Hospital.
He also founded the non-profit organization ASCOVIME, which organizes weekend trips to rural areas to provide free medical care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have assisted nearly 32,000 people.
Nearly every Friday, he and up to 30 other people are loaded into vans, tied to the roofs of medical supplies and going across the intersection to visit the village in need.
They are not always accompanied by luck.
Many times they had to push cars through rivers and dirt.
But when they arrive, they meet them as real heroes: it’s a holiday with songs and dances and the best venues that the locals have to offer.
Free medical care in these villages is really the reason for the holiday, and Bwelle with its wide smile and unlimited energy more than happily join the fun.
The next morning, the brigade begins to receive hundreds of patients.
“We accept 500 people on each trip,” Bwelle said.
They come from all over the district within a radius of 60 kilometers from the village, and they come on foot.
Each of these weekend clinics provides a variety of medical services.
Many people receive treatment for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may get crisps, donated glasses, or free birth certificates—documents needed for school that many poor families simply can’t afford.
In the evening, the brigade performs simple operations under local anesthesia.
Surgery is usually performed in a school building, a municipality, or at home; after the procedure, patients get up and go to the postoperative area to free up space for the next person.
Using a generator to illuminate the operational and sanitary treatment equipment, Bwelle and his volunteers work until early Sunday morning.
This is an unrelenting pace, but the brigade’s determination is usually helped to support the village musicians.
“They’re hitting the drums all night so we wake up and keep working,” Bwelle said.
On Sunday, members of the brigade are sent back to the city, tired but proud of their work.
This group, made up of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students, conducted 700 free surgeries over the past year, and they know that their help can be of great importance to those they help.
One person explained that the free operation he received to treat hernia will allow him to work again.
“It will change the future for me and my family,” the man said.
In addition to these clinical practices on weekends and hospital work, surgeon Bwelle also works at night in private medical clinics around Yaoundé.
It is this second job, he said, that provides 60 per cent of the financing of his non-profit organization; the rest is covered by private donations.
“I don’t even know when he’s sleeping,” said Katie O’Malley, a second-year medical student at Drexel University in Philadelphia, who volunteers with the Bwelle group.
He is always either in the hospital or trying to make money for the organization so that he can continue these campaigns.
For future doctors and nurses, such as O’Malley, who come from the U.S. and Europe to join Bwelle in realizing his tasks, this is an opportunity for practice that they would never get at home.
“We were given the opportunity to assist with surgeries where we helped remove blood stains or hold tools for Dr. Bwelle,” O’Malley said.
As a second-year student, you would never get such an opportunity in America.
Voluntary students usually pay for their own trip to Cameroon, often arriving with donated medications.
But upon arrival in Yaoundé, their food, transport and training pays Bwelle.
“He’s a hero, no doubt,” O’Malley said.
He gives his life to this organization, and his desire to help the people of Cameroon endlessly.
For Bwelle, the almost constant workload is not a difficult test.
Helping others live a happy life, fulfilling their father’s promise is something that brings him great joy.
“I’m so happy when I do this job,” Bwelle said.
And I think of my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
I do this to make people laugh to reduce their pain.
Go to the ASCOVIME website and see what you can help.
Snowden agrees to give testimony about Merkel's hearing
The deputy of the Bundestag Hans-Christian Strebele met in Moscow with Edward Snowden.
During the conversation, the question was whether Snowden could be questioned as a witness by the German Attorney General’s Office in the case of a possible wiretapping of the German Chancellor’s phone by the US special services.
Snowden expressed his willingness to give the necessary testimony.
The meeting could take place either in Moscow or in Germany.
He made it clear, said Hans-Christian Strebele, that he knows a lot.
And despite the fact that the National Security Agency, led by Keith Alexander, has blocked all of his moves, Snowden is ready to come to Germany.
However, first you need to clearly define all the conditions of his arrival. .
Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers are starting to take action in response to the scandal surrounding U.S. spy programs.
The Senate Intelligence Committee yesterday approved a bill introducing additional restrictions on the activities of the U.S. Department of Electronic Intelligence.
Belarus and Turkey are interested in the development and deepening of relations in all spheres and areas.
This was stated to journalists by the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Belarus Vladimir Makey at a press conference after the meeting with the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Turkey Ahmet Davutoglu, reports the correspondent of BELTA.
We are very pleased that our Turkish colleagues and partners at all levels are interested in the development and deepening of Belarusian-Turkish relations in all spheres and areas.
Belarus, for its part, is also interested in this, so we have agreed that the authorities of the state administration of the two countries will provide ubiquitous assistance and support to entrepreneurs, who establish direct trade and economic contacts with each other," said Vladimir Makey.
He stressed that the Government of Belarus would create all the necessary conditions for this and provide maximum assistance.
The Minister also said that another 8th meeting of the Belarusian-Turkish Joint Intergovernmental Economic Commission was held in Ankara, the outcome of which was the signing of the protocol.
The parties have developed a roadmap of Belarusian-Turkish cooperation, which, according to the head of the Belarusian foreign policy ministry, aims to deepen bilateral cooperation in the fields of trade, economic and investment cooperation, in the spheres of industrial cooperation.
“The protocol of the last meeting has been fully implemented, and I am convinced that the current protocol will also be implemented, because Belarus and Turkey regard each other as reliable partners,” he said.
Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, in turn, said that during the negotiations, the heads of foreign policy ministries of the two countries decided to further develop mutually beneficial cooperation and implement various projects.
The trade turnover between Belarus and Turkey, according to the minister, should be increased and brought to the figure of $1 billion.
Turkey is also an important partner in the area of investment cooperation, which needs to be further developed, as there is untapped potential in this area, he believes.
There has always been a very warm relationship between our countries, and we hope that in the future they will further strengthen and expand.
It will also create all the necessary conditions for trade and economic relations and for the successful operation of Turkish companies on the territory of Belarus and Belarusian enterprises and organizations in Turkey," said Ahmet Davutoglu.
Obama Refuses to Talk About Health Care
Among the storms of criticism, President Obama yesterday went on a Saturday afternoon about his often repeated, unequivocal promise that “if you like your health insurance plan, you can keep it.”
Seeing that hundreds of thousands of people are receiving notices of cessation of services from their providers, Republicans in recent days have criticized the president for misleading American society.
Yesterday, Mr. Obama made his initial public promise a little bit falsified.
“Most people who have health insurance that works can keep it,” he said in a speech in Boston.
Referring to what he called a "news revival" about the cessation of services, Obama called on recipients of these notifications to look for other options in the market.
Most people will be able to get better, comprehensive health insurance plans at the same price or even cheaper than predicted.
“You will get more favorable conditions,” he said.
The administration said no one should be surprised that 5 per cent of the population who buy insurance on their own may be forced to change plans because their coverage does not meet the new standards required under the Accessible Medical Care Act.
“Let me tell these Americans directly: you deserve the best,” Sibelius said in a speech to the House of Representatives’ Energy and Trade Committee in Washington.
Sibelius, who oversees the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said the launch of the Internet sales platform has been “terrifyingly bad” since October.
“I’m upset and angry just like everyone else,” she said.
I really want to get your trust back.”
Irritated Sibelius slammed this phrase, which was captured by a microphone on, sitting behind her assistant at yesterday's hearings in the chamber after a hot debate with a member of the House of Representatives' House of Representatives, O'Connor Billy Long, a Republican from the state of Missoula.
After more than three hours of hearings, Long once again urged Sibelius to say why the “architect” of the Affordable Care Act did not voluntarily give up government-sponsored insurance to acquire the plan through HealthCare.gov, which she now imposes on millions of people.
Rosbalt Agency deprived of media status for uncensored defense
On October 31, the Mosgorsud decided to recognize the invalid license for the registration of the agency "Rosbalt", - writes "Lenta".
Roskomnadzor insisted on depriving the agency of media status - for systematic and gross violations of the law on the media.
An unpleasant precedent was created in the process: the court considered it possible to shut down the media, effectively refusing publication in the right to make counterarguments.
What is "Rosbalt"
ZAO "Rosbalt Information Agency" was established in St. Petersburg in 2000.
In the following years, the agency opened a second head office in Moscow and a number of regional units.
The agency also has representations in the countries of the former USSR.
Since 2001, Rosbalt has developed and functioned as a federal information-analytical agency.
By the mid-2000s, the agency was on the list of the most recognizable private Internet media in Russia.
At the same time, "Rosbalt" has always occupied a rather specific niche: the core of the agency's exclusive publications were (and are still making) notes with reference to sources in law enforcement authorities.
Discussions about the proximity of the publication to the power structures continued throughout the agency's existence.
In addition to the fact that Rosbalt had an extensive base of sources in various departments, in favor of such assumptions was also said that Natalia Chaplin, wife of Victor Cherkesov, was at the head of the project.
At the same time, Chaplin's role in the management of "Rosbalt" is not completely clear: it is often called "project manager".
The general director of the agency is Larissa Afonina, the editor-in-chief - Nikolai Ulyanov.
Recently, Rosbalt did not appear in the ratings of the federal media – neither by citation nor by audience.
In October, the agency took the 25th place in the ranking of visits of Russian media sites according to the version of LiveInternet.
According to LiveInternet, the average daily audience of the site rosbalt.ru is about 150,000 unique visitors (and up to 500,000 views), monthly - about three million unique visitors.
Among the most popular materials in the last five months - remarks about the helplessness of the Kremlin in relations with Ukraine, the death of the soloist of the group "King and the Joke", pogroms in the capital Biryuleve.
The conflict between Rosbalta and Roskomnadzor began in July 2013, when an amendment to the media law that banned journalists from using uncensored weapons came into force.
The agency found a banned vocabulary in two videos published on the agency’s website (“Jigit of Krasnodar” and “Pussy Riot polluted the oil turrets”).
The following pages describe it in a different way.
Roskomnadzor on the basis of the detected video materials accused Rosbalt of gross and systematic violation of the media law and appealed to the court with a demand to withdraw the license from the agency.
In "Rosbalt" stated that the claims of the agency are wrong: first, the videos were not editorial materials, secondly, the parent words in them were masked, and, thirdly, immediately after the warning the video was removed from the site.
Representatives of the agency appealed Roskomnadzor’s claims in the world court – and when on October 22, 2013, Mosgorsud accepted Roskomnadzor’s lawsuit, the examination of these complaints was still ongoing.
However, on the 25th, the world judge decided not in favor of "Rosbalt": the editor-in-chief Nikolai Ulyanov was found guilty of violating the Code on Administrative Offences and fined 20 thousand rubles - 10 thousand for each roll.
Obviously, this predetermined the outcome of the hearing in Mosgorsud - if we give up the idea that the outcome could have been predetermined even earlier.
On October 31, the court decided to declare the certificate of registration of “Rosbalt” invalid, effectively depriving the agency of the status of the media.
It cannot be said that “Rosbalt” during this confrontation remained alone.
The agency was supported by the deputies of the State Duma (the statement in the name of the head of Roskomnadzor Alexander Zharov on October 10 was signed by 26 deputies; the document itself was submitted on the initiative of the CPRF).
The head of the Union of Journalists of Russia Vsevolod Bogdanov, the chairman of the Moscow Union of Journalists Pavel Gusev and the head of the Presidential Council on Human Rights Mikhail Fedotov declared the illegal closure of the publication.
Moreover, according to Bogdanov, the management of Roskomnadzor even gave him some guarantees that the case will not come until the license is revoked.
The court over "Rosbalt" showed: under whose jurisdiction it is safer to be the media in Russia today - a big question.
Syria Destroyed Chemical Weapons Equipment
Syria has destroyed all claimed chemical weapons production facilities, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons acknowledged.
This first phase of disarmament was completed one day before the deadline set by Damascus.
By November 1, Syria had to destroy production facilities and other auxiliary facilities designed to prepare combat toxins for use, according to the BBC.
The destruction of the stockpiles of toxic substances or their chemical components should be completed by mid-2014.
According to the representative of the OPCW, the toxic substances are currently in sealed warehouses.
International inspectors went to Syria after more than 1,400 people were killed in a chemical attack on the outskirts of Damascus on August 21.
The main task of the inspectors was not to waste time – to prevent the Syrian authorities from producing more chemical weapons – and to destroy the infrastructure for mixing chemicals and ammunition.
These production capacities will now be closely monitored to prevent them from being repaired.
The next milestone is mid-November: By this time, the OPCW and the Syrians must agree on a detailed plan to destroy existing stockpiles of toxic substances.
There's a lot of questions here.
Where will they be destroyed?
Who will provide the equipment for this?
All Syrian statements will be carefully checked by the Western intelligence services.
They will be prepared to advise inspectors of new facilities for inspection if there are grounds to suspect that Damascus has not been fully disclosed.
The United States believes that the bombing was carried out by regular troops.
Syria and Russia insist that this is a matter of the hands of the Syrian rebels.
The world community has demanded from the Syrian leadership, in accordance with the agreement reached through Russia, to destroy or bring into disrepair all capacity for the production of ammunition, poisoning gases and liquids and for the filling of ammunition.
Now that this phase has passed, the next step should be the destruction of the chemical weapons already in the Syrian army.
It is estimated that there may be more than 1,000 tons of neuro-paralytic toxins, skin-repellent mustard gas and other prohibited chemicals stored in several dozen different locations.
To destroy it, it is necessary for the OSCE and the Syrian authorities to agree on a timetable of action to begin with, which takes two weeks.
OPCW Field Operations Chief Jerry Smith told the BBC that his inspectors had “personally monitored the destruction of the equipment.”
“They are no longer able to carry out further production or mixing of chemical weapons,” he said.
The OPCW said inspectors visited 21 of the 23 sites in Syria and made sure that the factories for the production of ammunition and toxins were either destroyed or invalidated.
The remaining two facilities are too dangerous to carry out an inspection there, the document says, but the equipment from there was transported and checked by OPCW specialists.
According to Smith, the process of destroying the chemical weapons infrastructure was “particularly difficult” as it had to work in the face of ongoing conflict.
In early October, the OPCW received the Nobel Peace Prize, but, according to Smith, the inspectors did not yet have time to celebrate it – they were too busy with work.
John Kerry says in his unprecedented admission that U.S. espionage "has gone awry far"
John Kerry has demonstrated a softening of the tactics of protecting U.S. surveillance programs, making an unprecedented admission that in some cases U.S. espionage “has gone awry far.”
The secretary of state also admitted that he was guilty, along with Barack Obama, of being “on autopilot” at the time of Edward Snowden’s loud revelations about the NSA’s espionage activities.
These leaks put the U.S. government at the center of a diplomatic scandal with its allies.
Speaking on video at an open government conference in London, Mr. Kerry said: “There is no doubt that the president and I, as well as other members of the government, have actually perceived some of the things that are happening on autopilot.”
He then became the first high-ranking member of the U.S. government to admit that U.S. espionage had gone too far, but stressed that nobody’s rights had been violated.
He said: “In some cases, it has gone awry far.
And the president is determined to shed light on the issue and explain himself to the people, and is now conducting a thorough analysis so that no one has a feeling of abuse.
I assure you, there is no abuse of innocent people in this process.”
Mr. Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA acted on good grounds and that his surveillance operations had saved many lives.
He added: “We are working in a new world where people are ready to blow themselves up.
There is radical extremism in the world, reckless and determined to kill people, explode people and attack governments.
And if you were able to intercept it, stop it before it happens?
“We actually prevented plane crashes, building explosions, and killing people because we were able to find out about these plans in advance.”
Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers will go to Europe to help resolve issues related to alleged U.S. espionage abroad and convince Europeans of the need to continue joint anti-terrorism measures with the U.S., the chairman of the Senate subcommittee on Europe said.
Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy said he had spoken to members of the European Parliament and others this week and was concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti-terrorist organizations over the disappointment with the National Security Agency's monitoring.
“For the national security interests of the United States, it is really important that Europeans remain our supporters in our common counter-terrorism efforts,” said Murphy, a first-time Democrat who chairs the Senate’s subcommittee on international affairs and European affairs.
“And I am going to Europe to let them know that we must continue to cooperate in the fight against terrorism, despite their anger over these NSA programs.”
The news that the NSA has collected millions of phone records in Europe has worsened relations with some of the U.S. allies, although the head of the agency said this week that they were inaccurate and reflected the misunderstanding of the metadata that the U.S. gathered by NATO and Co.
Other revelations have included documents released by Snowden, which indicate that the NSA monitored the mobile phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel, as well as the phones of approximately 34 other world leaders.
National Intelligence Director James Clapper defended espionage against the Allies as necessary and said it was a common practice on both sides.
Against the background of this noise, Murphy said his office is organizing a congressional trip, which is expected to take place this year, and that he hopes that members of both parties and both chambers will join the delegation.
The names of the other participating legislators should be announced in the coming days.
According to him, the program of the trip is still in the development stage.
Although Murphy said the purpose of the trip was to help improve relationships, he said that some degree of “hardness from the best incentives” would also be manifested.
He said European leaders should be honest with their people about what spying programs they have used for many years.
“While we can change our surveillance programs to better protect the rights of Europeans, they must also agree that we are not the only ones engaged in intelligence activities,” Murphy said.
Meanwhile, Mr. Kerry should head to the Middle East and Poland this weekend to address the issues of hostility towards the US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as U.S. intelligence.
In the new compositions of the public observation commissions will increase the influence of prisoners
Today, the Council of the Public Chamber (OP) can approve new compositions of public observation commissions (ONCs) in 43 regions of Russia.
If the put-to-vote option is adopted, the lobbyists of the security forces will increase their influence.
ONK is the social structures that control the conditions of detention in places of deprivation of liberty.
The cases of Sergei Magnitsky and Leonid Razvozzhaev, riots in the Copian colony - it is through ONK that most resonant incidents are made public behind the grid.
For control of the ONK is a struggle between human rights defenders and lobbyists of the militias.
At the meeting of the OP Working Group on the formation of the UNC, I proposed to make the criterion for the selection of human rights activities.
"It was not accepted, and formed lists, without developing criteria," - says Valery Borshchev.
Borshchev - the current chairman of the Moscow Observation Commission and the Association of Independent Observers - the all-Russian structure of human rights defenders dealing with prison problems.
As a deputy of the State Duma from the "Apple" he developed a law regulating the activities of the ONK.
The OP Council should vote for the ONK in 43 regions of the country.
In 1800 vacancies are claimed by fewer than a thousand applicants, and in Ingushetia and Kabardino-Balkaria competitions could not be organized due to the absence of candidates.
OP promises to organize a donation to vacant places.
The ONK of Moscow is one of the few commissions with the competition, despite the fact that in the new composition instead of 20 will be 40 participants.
According to Borshchev, in the current composition of the capital commission 11 human rights defenders and 9 security guards, and in the version, which is on the vote in the OP, the ratio changes by 17 to 23.
At the same time, 30 human rights defenders wanted to enter the capital commission.
But the new composition can be re-entered by the representative of the "Boy Brotherhood" Vyacheslav Kalinin.
He was a member of the ONC for three years, but never visited prisoners.
Borshchev believes that the security forces will be able to make the work of human rights defenders intolerable by appointing their chairman, so human rights defenders do not rule out collective withdrawal from the commission.
According to them, the promotion of the security forces is coordinated by the member of the ONK Anton Tsvetkov, who heads the "Officers of Russia" - an organization that defends the interests of the military agencies.
"I don't eat babies on the road," RBC daily Anton Tsvetkov said.
He denies lobbying for the promotion of any lists and says that he does not intend to prevent human rights defenders from visiting detained opposition members.
According to Tsvetkov, he did not even care what list is currently voted on in the OP.
Disclosure of information by Borshchev he considers a form of pressure.
The possible success of human rights defenders is the planned change of leadership of the Chelyabinsk ONK.
Its former leaders will be removed due to last year's copious unrest.
In the Public Chamber, it was concluded that the leadership of the local commission ignored the problems of the prisoners.
But ONK Rostov-on-Don can move from human rights defenders to security forces.
From the new lists, the human rights defender-chairman of the local commission "disappeared", but turned out to be one of his opponents, despite the fact that in May 2013 the Federal Public Chamber excluded him for unethical behavior.
Lists of Moscow and Rostov Commission Borshchev considers "a place for Copeysk".
The revelations of Nadezhda Tolokonnikova did not affect ONK Mordoviya, which is considered "force": only one human rights defender wanted to enter the new composition, and she did not even accept documents for the competition.
The member of the OP council Nikolai Swanidze told the RBC daily that he voted against the proposed list, as he is upset by the situation in Moscow and Rostov-on-Don.
He forwarded his position to the other members of the Council.
His OP colleague Pavel Gusev says he voted in favor, as he likes the proposed Moscow list.
Vladislav Grib, Deputy Secretary of OP, who is also an employee of the Scientific and Research Institute of FSIN, coordinated the drawing up of the lists of ONK.
Mushroom told the RBC daily that it does not consider it right to divide candidates into human rights defenders and security guards and does not agree that the chairmen of the commissions have enough powers to impede the work of its members.
The mushroom is not allowed to predict the results of the vote of the OP council.
If the proposed list is rejected today, a modified version will be put to the vote in the coming days.
Australian woman appeals against jail term in Thailand <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney, who was sentenced to 15 days in prison on the island of Phuket for falsely claiming that she had been attacked by a taxi driver, filed an appeal for a conviction and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially convicted on June 15 by the Phuket Provincial Court of filing a false suit after Thai police reported that a local taxi driver carried out the attack on the night of Sunday, June 10, while two other men were detained.
However, video surveillance footage later revealed that she had safely returned to her hotel after a break-up with her Australian boyfriend.
The Phuket police interrogated Bamford for two days before she admitted to fabricating the story.
Before the trial, she was held in the local police chambers.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days in prison at a general-regime detention centre on the outskirts of Phuket, not in a women’s adult prison.
She is the daughter of former Australian League player Peter Tanks, who turned to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canberra for help for his daughter.
Tanks told the Sunday Telegraph in Sydney that the whole family was “extremely concerned” about her daughter’s well-being and was waiting for her to return to Australia.
“Obviously it was an alarming time, but we hope she will come home safely as soon as possible,” Tanks said.
Bamford filed an appeal for her conviction and was released on bail of 50,000 baht.
According to reports in Australia, she is currently spending her vacation in the resort area of Krabi in southern Thailand.
Thailand’s legal sources said Bamford is currently representing a local lawyer in Phuket, but warned that the appeal could lead to a court order increasing her sentence to two years and causing her to spend a term in prison for bribery.
However, after the recent murder of Australian travel agent Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand may also seek to restore its shattered tourist image, which will lead to an acquittal.
Now Roman Senchin is in Paris at the presentation of his novel "Eltyshevy", translated into French.
It is this novel that has become the finalist of four awards: "The Clear Field", "Russian Booker", "National Bestseller" and "Big Book".
And last year, the writer for this book was awarded the prize of the Government of the Russian Federation in the field of culture.
Roman Senchin is an undeniable leader in the current generation of thirty- and forty-year-old prose writers.
Practically every publication of his harsh, built on modern life storytelling and storytelling causes heated controversy among critics of various directions.
It can be argued that gathered together articles on the prose and publicity of Senchin, reviews on his books and journal publications create an interesting and unexpected landscape of Russian literature from the late 1990s until the early 2010s.
In the discussions about the works of "one of the most controversial modern writers", according to the critic Sergei Chuprinin, it is mostly about the fact that its participants understand the word "literature", as they see the present and the future not only of our vocabulary, but also of life.
Unfortunately, the volume of the book did not allow to include in it the majority of articles and reviews from regional media and blogosphere.
Analytical and review articles are usually given in abbreviations in the "Paragraphs..." sections.
