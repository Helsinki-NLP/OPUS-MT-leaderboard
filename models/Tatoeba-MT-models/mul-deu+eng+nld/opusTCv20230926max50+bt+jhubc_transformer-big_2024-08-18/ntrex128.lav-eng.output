Members of the Assembly of Wales (Assembly Members — AM) are concerned about the possibility of "being perceived as meek"
Some Members of the Assembly have expressed concern about the proposal to change their name to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This is due to plans to change the name of the Assembly to "Welsh Parliament".
AM is concerned across the political spectrum that this could make them an object of ridicule.
One of the Labour Party’s AM explained that their group is concerned about “sounding with the words Twp and Pwp”.
For readers outside of Wales: In Welsh, "twp" means "unique", and "pwp" means "cookie".
Party Plaid AM pointed out that none of the group "was satisfied" and has recommended alternatives.
A representative of the Welsh Conservative Party acknowledged that their group was ready to consider a name change, but added that the MWP is very similar to the Muppet, which means "arm".
In this context, it should be noted that the Welsh letter "w" is pronounced similarly to the English dialect of Yorkshire "u".
The Assembly Commission, which is currently working on a change in the name of the bill, informed: "The final decision on what terms will be used to designate the members of the Assembly is, of course, to be taken by the members of the Assembly themselves."
The Government of Wales Act of 2017 gave the Assembly of Wales the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public consultation on the proposal, which provided broad support for the change of the Assembly's name to the Welsh Parliament.
When it came to the name of AM, the commission preferred the Welsh Parliament Member (WMP), but the MWP received the greatest support in the public consultation.
The AM strongly recommends alternative options, but the fight for an agreement could lead to a headache for Assembly Spokesman Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a bill on changes in the coming weeks.
The draft law on amendments will also include other changes to the work of the Assembly, including laws on the disqualification of AM and the structure of the committee system.
The final vote on what they will be called will take place when the legislative acts have been discussed.
Macedonians will go to vote in a referendum on the change of national name
Voters will vote on Sunday whether their country's name will be changed to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The referendum was organized to resolve decades-long disputes with neighbouring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia. The referendum was held to resolve the dispute.
Athens has long insisted that the name of the northern neighbor impresses on the claims made on its territory, and has repeatedly opposed Macedonia's request to be accepted by the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, one of the plebiscite's opponents of the name change, announced that he was ignoring the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, object to the fact that a name change is simply a matter that needs to be done in order to join the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin’s Goddess are heard, fighting for existence in the churches of Harlem.
“As told by the old people with whom I spoke, there was a bar and a bar on every corner,” says Mr. Adams.
"Now there is no one, no other."
He admits that the disappearance of bars is understandable.
"People today socialize in other ways," he said.
"The bars are no longer the neighborhood living rooms that people visit on a regular basis."
Speaking even to the gods, he worries that the money he receives from selling the property will end sooner than the leaders expect, "and sooner or later they will return to the starting point."
For God’s sake, he added, it would be possible to be replaced by multi-apartment buildings with apartment properties in which there will be people who will not help the rest of the shrines in the vicinity.
"Most of the people who buy apartment properties in these buildings will be white," he explained, "and with that coming the day when these deities will be closed forever, because it is unlikely that most of the people who will come into these houses will live in these houses."
The two gods were erected by the White Society, before Harlem became a black metropolis, the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martin 10 years later.
The original white Methodist Society abandoned buildings in the 1930s.
The building was taken over by a black congregation who had worshiped God nearby.
St. Martin's Goddess Black Society took over his blessing during John Howard Johnson's time. He led a boycott of laborers in Harlem on 125th Street, on the main shopping street, or a boycott of laborers in Harlem.
The fire in 1939 seriously damaged the building, but as Father Johnson’s congregation members planned to renovate the building, they ordered a call game.
His blessing David Johnson (David Johnson), the son of Johnson's father and successor in the St. Martin's Society, proudly called the game a "for the bells of the poor".
The expert, who played this call game in July, used other words: "the treasure of culture" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan added that it was the first call game in the world played by black musician Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to a larger call game at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather told me that St. Martin's friendship did not replace him.
The events of the last few months around the church of St. Martin reflected the interconnected relationships of architects and builders, some of whom had been attracted by the temporal power in the work, while others — the diocese of the episcopal church.
The Council of the Congregation, composed of temporal leaders, addressed the diocese in July in writing with concern that the diocese "will be willing to hand over the costs" to the council, although the council has not been involved in the dedicatory sent by the architect and contractor of the builder.
Some members of the congregation complained of a lack of transparency in the work of the diocese.
Haizivs offends 13-year-old teenager instead of lobster fishing
On Saturday in California, Haiziv attacked a 13-year-old boy who was not after the lockers, and injured him. It was the first day of the lockers season, according to the service.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m., near Beacon's Beach, Encinitas.
Chad Hammel informed KSWB-TV Sandjego that he and his friends had been in the nest for about half an hour when he heard that the boy was called for help, and then the group headed to him to help the boy get out of the water.
Hammels explained that at first he had thought that it was simply a feeling for the captivated closet, but then he "saved that the boy yells "Tell me!
"You can tell me!"
All of his key bones were torn," said Hammels, who immediately noticed it when he had reached the boy.
"I'm yelling for everyone to drop the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'" added Hammels.
The boy was transported by air to the Rady Children's Hospital in Sandjego, where his condition was considered critical.
The species of shark infested is unknown.
Rescue Captain Larry Giles told the media that a shark had been observed in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was recognized that it was not a dangerous species for humans.
Giles added that the victim was injured in the upper part of the thigh.
For 48 hours, for the purposes of investigation and security, officials blocked access to the beaches from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami's in Encinitas.
Jails pointed out that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous to humans.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK's beauty industry market
Sainsbury's is under attack by Boats, Superdrug and Debenhams with shelves of universal store-style beauty products and trained sellers.
As part of the considerable investment of <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion in the UK’s large beauty market, which continues to grow, although the sales of fashion goods and household items are declining, 11 stores in the country will be more extensively sold, more garments will be tested and more beauty products will be developed.
In the beauty industry, funds are invested when supermarkets are looking for ways to use shelves that were previously open to TVs, microwaves and household goods.
Sainsbury's said it would double its beauty offerings for up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and, for the first time, Dr. PawPaw.
Existing lines from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also receive more seats with branded zones similar to, for example, Boots stores.
The supermarket will also re-launch its Boutique line of decorative cosmetics, where most of the products will be vegan-friendly – which is increasingly demanded by younger buyers over the years.
In addition, Fragrance Shop will test the concessions at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which was opened last week in Croydon in the south of London, and the second will be opened later in Selly Gaming Oak in the south of London.
Shopping online and switching to small groceries in local stores every day means that supermarkets need to invest more to convince people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, executive director of Sainsbury's, has said that retail outlets will become more and more like a universal store, as the chain of stores is trying to fight off discount stores at Aldi and Lidl, offering a greater service without a doubt.
Sainsbury's has deployed Argos outlets in several hundred stores and has opened several Habitats since buying both chains two years ago, which is said to have improved the merchandise layout and made the purchases more profitable.
The supermarket’s previous attempt to improve its beauty and pharmaceutical departments ended in a defeat.
Sainsbury's joint venture with Boats was tried in the early 2000s, but the union broke up after a dispute over how to divide revenues from pharmacy grocery stores.
The new strategy is developed after Sainsbury's sold its 281 stores of large pharmaceutical business to the owner of the chain of Celesio, Lloyds Pharmacy, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
According to this plan, Lloyds will be tasked with supplementing the range with a wide range of exclusive skin care products, including Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sales Director at Sainsbury's, said: "To improve the customer environment, we have transformed the look of our beauty product shelves and the impression they make.
We have also invested funds in specially trained colleagues, who will always be ready to make a recommendation.
The range of our brands has been designed to suit all needs, but the attractive environment with convenient location means that we are now an overwhelming goal on the way to beauty, a goal that challenges the current shopping habits."
Peter Jones is "full of nudge" after Holly Willowby resigns from the <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
"Dragons Den" star Peter Jones "accepted the nimbleness" after TV broadcaster Holly Willoughby gave up the <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with Spencer's "Lifestyle" brand to "marry all the attention"
Willowboys do not have time to devote their home outfit and accessories to the brand "Truly".
The couple's business was compared to Guinea Paltrow's (Gwyneth Paltrow) brand "Goop".
This Morning, a 37-year-old broadcaster, used Instagram to announce that she was going away.
Holly Willowby has lost the "Dragons Den" star in the rage of Peter Jones, as at the last minute he broke out of his lucrative lifestyle brand business — to pay all the attention to his new TV and Spector's huge deals with &Marx.
Sources allege that Jones was "full of quirks" when a TV golden girl was tightened during a meeting on Tuesday at his business empire residence in Marlow, Buckinghamshire. In his brother-in-law, Buckinghamshire, he announced that he had "signed a wig for his new contracts, which is worth up to a mile."
The company was compared to the Guinean Platrov brand "Goop", and, according to the house, it will double the wealth of Villaubia, which is estimated to reach 11 million pounds.
When Willowby (37) used Instagram to announce that she was missing "Truly", Jones drove away from the UK to one of her holiday homes.
As the source of information says: "Truely" was the most important of Holland's priorities.
It was to become her long-term future, to which the next decades would be devoted.
Her decision to stand out surprised all the unprepared involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday: everything was so close to the start.
The center of Marlowe is a warehouse full of finished goods for sale."
Experts believe that the managers of "This Morning", which is one of the most financially profitable stars, going away can cost the company millions, because a lot of funds have been invested in a variety of products — from pillows and candles to more clothes and clothes.
And this can mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three children, Willowby, and her husband, Dens Boldwin (Dan Baldwin), have been in a close relationship for 10 years with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
Willoughby "Truly" together with Kepu was created in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined as president in March.
Both couples spend a holiday together, and Jones owns a 40% stake in Boldvina TV producers.
Willowby has to become a brand ambassador for M&S, and she will replace Ant McPartlin as the head of ITV's "I'm A Celebrity".
A source close to Jones announced yesterday: "We don't want to comment on his business deals!"
Serious conversation "and then we fell in love"
He complained about the criticism he would receive from companies about a comment some may consider "unpleasant to the president" and about his so positive attitude towards the North Korean leader.
Why does the president refuse so much?
Trump said in his picture in the voice of the "Knowledge Dictator".
"It doesn't come from anything!"
He pointed out that Kim had shown interest in meeting once again after Trump recognised his initial meeting in Singapore as a major step towards North Korea's denuclearisation.
But the denuclearisation negotiations have come to an end.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, one of the top North Korean diplomats, Ri Jongho (Ri Yong Ho) informed world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see a US "response" to North Korea.
Instead, he pointed out that the United States continues to impose sanctions aimed at maintaining the tension.
Trump was much more optimistic in his mythical speech.
“We have a great relationship with North Korea,” he said.
“We were going to fight North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
We now have this great relationship.’
He said that what he did to improve relations with Kim had yielded positive results — a halt to missile testing, aid in the release of the conquests, and the return of the remaining American soldiers to their homes.
And he defended his unusual approach by talking about his relationship with Kim.
“It’s easy to make the president’s impression, but instead of 10 000 people out there trying to get into this tightly populated area, we have 200, look here,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
Cunami and earthquake in Indonesia deport the island, killing hundreds of people
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organisations were told that their assistance was not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok was displaced, the state of national disaster was not declared, but it is necessary to propose foreign aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it very clear that they are not asking for international help, so it is a known problem," admitted Ms Sumbung.
While "Save the Children" collects groups for the ride to Palo, it is still not clear whether foreign workers will be able to work there.
The representative of the National Disaster Agency, Mr Sutopo, explained that Indonesian officials were appreciating the situation in Palu to see if the international agencies could make a contribution to its assistance.
Given that earthquakes are occurring in Indonesia on a regular basis, the country is still extremely adverse to natural inertia.
Although shelters have been established in Aceh (Aceh) for tsunami cases, they are rarely found along other coasts.
Most likely, the deaths were also caused by the fact that Paul did not reject the tsunami warning sirens, although the warning was in effect.
Even in the most favourable times, moving between the many islands of Indonesia is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
The ship-hospital, which had been in Lombok to treat the victims of the earthquake, is now going to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the victims of the new post office.
President Joko Widodo had made the improvement of Indonesia's destroyed infrastructure the focal point of his election campaign, and he has allocated large sums to roads and railways.
However, the lack of funds has plagued Mr. Joko's administration and he expects re-election next year.
In addition, Mr Joko has to deal with the protracted problem of sectarian tension in Indonesia, where a Muslim majority has adopted one of the conservative forms of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were evicted from their homes, while Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets using machetes, bows and arrows, and other primitive weapons.
Watch: Liverpool player Daniels Staridge with ambition to restore balance in the match against Chelsea
Daniel Starridge (Daniel Sturridge) saved Liverpool from a loss to Chelsea in the Premier League by scoring a goal in the 89th minute at Stamford Bridge Stadium in London on Saturday.
The star received a touchdown from Jordan Shaqiri (Xherdan Shaqiri), being about 25 metres (30 yards) from Chelsea's goal when his team lost 1-0.
He moved the ball a little to the left of him and then played the ball in the direction of the next door pole.
In this attempt, the ball flew high over the field, reaching the top right corner of the net.
In the end, the ball flew over the head of Kepa Arrizabalaga (Kepa Arrizabalaga) in flight and crashed into the net.
"I was just trying to get it in position to get to the ball, and players like Shaq are always playing as far ahead as possible, so I'm just trying to get myself as much time as possible," Starridge explained.
"I saw Kante approach, touch the ball, and, without thinking much, playing."
In the semi-finals, Chelsea were led by 1:0 after the 25th minute was won by Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The Blues attacker played the ball back to Mateo Kovacic, before cutting to the middle of the field and throwing Liverpool at the side of the field as fast as possible.
Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x8D> quickly played and got the ball back in the middle of the field.
Then he made a beautiful swing between the players, allowing Azardam to get into the zone.
Azards outperformed the speed defense and finished the combination with his left leg doing a sweep in the further pole net, missing Liverpool's Elison Becker.
In the Champions League group stage, at 3 p.m., Stadio San Paolo will play against Napoli in Naples (Italy).
Chelsea and Videoton will meet in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 15:00 in London.
Indonesia tsunami kills 832 people
The number of victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has reached 832 people, the state disaster agency announced early Sunday.
It was reported that many people have been detonated in building mines after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake, which visited the country on Friday and caused waves of up to 20 feet (<0x7E>6.0 m) high, the agency's representative Sutowo Nugro (Purvo Nugro) informed at the news conference.
The city of Palu, where more than 380,000 people live, was covered by collapsed buildings by miners.
Police suspect a 32-year-old man in police custody of rape of a woman
The murder investigation was initiated after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
A 44-year-old victim with stab wounds was found at 7:55 a.m. on Grayson Mews Street in John, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police have called for people in the area who have seen or heard something.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation has just begun, but I would like to invite everyone who was around John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard something suspicious to contact us.
I also invite every driver, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something in their car’s video recorder material, to contact us because they may have information that is important to our investigation."
A representative of the police confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a local resident of Birkenhead, and she was found in her property.
This afternoon, friends who think they know a woman have come to the crime scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation continues, and, as the police reported, they are engaged in informing the nearest relatives of the victim.
The taxi driver, who lives in Greisonmau, tried to return to his apartment, but the police replied to him that no one should enter or leave the building.
He couldn’t say a word when he found out what had happened.
People are informed that it will be hours before they are allowed to return.
It was heard that a policeman told a man that the whole area was perceived as a crime scene.
A woman appeared at the scene of the crime.
She keeps repeating, "That's so horrible!".
Two police vans were inside the cordon in the afternoon, and another one was placed just outside.
Several police officers were stationed inside the cordon and controlled the apartment building.
Anyone with information is asked to use DM <0x40>MerPolCC by 30 September, call 101 or contact "Crimestoppers anonymously" by phone 0800 555 111 at 247.
The statue of Kromwell in parliament becomes the latest "history rewrite" scandal
The renunciation would be ethically justified given the similar activities of the Taliban, as a result of which his fanatical Puritan followers buried so many monuments of English culture and religion.
However, the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as "insanity" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, Chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "In view of the current debate on the removal of statues, it was inevitable that the target would also be the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside the Castle of Westminster.
Cromwell himself neither ordered nor carried out the sacraments of the English Civil War.
It is possible that the wrong Cromwell will be uprooted because of the actions of his ancestor, a century earlier, Thomas.
The magnificent depiction of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft by Sir William Cromwell shows the view of the 19th century and is part of the historiography of a person who, as many believe, is still worthy of honour.
Mr. Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: "Many Cromwells — perhaps more than they were at the end of the 19th century — considered Parliament's advocate against external pressure, which, of course, was a monarchy in his case.
The historical debate continues as to whether or not this is really a fully-accurate depiction of the subject.
It is clear that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century determined the further development of our nation, and Cromwell as such is a recognizable personality, representing one of the sides of the long-distance divide.
What she has achieved as a Lord Protector is worthy of praise and mention."
Swine snail collapses to death of farmer in China
According to local media reports, a farmer was attacked and killed in the pig market in the southwestern part of China.
The man, whose only name is Yuan, was found dead with a translucent artery, all in one blood at a pig carcass market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
On 30 May 2005, the pig coop intends to inject the vaccine into a pig coop in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
It is reported that he and his cousin had returned from the neighbouring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his nephew found the man dead and discovered that the door of the pigs next door was standing open.
He told me that there was a big pig man with blood on his mouth in a pig’s crib.
According to the information, the medical investigation of the courts confirmed that 550 pounds (<0x7E>249 kg) of heavy weed had crushed the farmer.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and twisted," said the cousin — only his name is mentioned in Wu (Wu), in the article "Guiyang Evening News".
The security camera material showed how Juan enters the market on Thursday at around 4.40 p.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed John didn’t belong to either him or his cousin.
The market manager told Evening News that the wizard was turned on to prevent its attacks on others while the police collected evidence at the scene.
According to the information, John's family and market management are discussing compensation for his death.
Although such cases are rare, it is known for other swine attacks in humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and a man on their farm in Masochusets, resulting in a critical injury to the man.
Another 10 years ago, a 650-pound (<0x7E>295 kg) heavy pig in Wales was kept by farmers on a tractor until his wife scared the animal.
After farmers in Oregon ate his pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a "gun shot".
"They're just playful.
They like to sneak in, they’re very knowledgeable... they don’t want to hurt you.
You just have to show them a lot of respect," he said.
Hurricane Rose's conclusion will bring widespread and strong cases in the US Southwest
As predicted, Hurricane Roza will weaken as it crosses the coldest waters off the north coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, Roza will bring flood-producing rain gases to the north of Mexico and the southwest of the United States.
At five p.m. (after North American Eastern Time) the Rosa wind gusts reached 143 km/h (85 miles per hour), which corresponds to a Category 1 hurricane, and its point was located 620 km (385 miles) southwest of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
It is expected that Roza will move to the north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, above the Pacific Ocean, a low-pressure plateau forms, moving eastwards, towards the US east coast. As the tropical storm approaches the Southern California (Baja California) peninsula, on Monday it will begin to move the moisture masses from the tropics to the depths of the A-strip.
On Monday the pink part of Mexico will bring up to 10 inches (<0x7E>25.4 cm) of rain.
Then tropical humidity, interacting with the approaching low-pressure interior, will in the coming days in the South-West create a large strong rain gas zone.
1–4 inches (<0x7E>2.6–10.2 cm) of rain will cause dangerous sudden floods, dune currents and possibly landslides in the desert.
Humidity deep from the tropics will cause rain gases that will reach 2–3 inches (<0x7E>5.1–7.6 cm) per hour in some places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In some parts of the southwest, especially most of Arizona, it is expected to rain up to 24 inches (<0x7E>5.2–10.1 cm).
It is possible to suddenly flood with a rapid deterioration of the condition due to the dispersion of tropical rainforests.
It is highly undesirable to go on foot in the desert due to the threat of tropical rainfall.
Heavy rains can turn canyons into fast rivers, but will not bring local thunderstorms to the wind and sandstorms.
The low-pressure crater approaching will bring local heavy rain to a part of the Southern California coastline.
There are possible rain gases, which together will exceed half an inch (<0x7E>1.3 cm), and this can cause small inlets and slippery paths.
It will be the region's first rain gas in the wet season.
Some of the scattered tropical rain gases to Arizona will start approaching late Sunday and early Monday, before the rain will take over the wider territory late Monday and early Tuesday.
Heavy rains will spread to the Four Corners region on Tuesday (DR Colorado, DA J<0xC5><0xAB>ta, NA Arizona and DR New Mexico) and will last all Wednesday.
In October, there are possible intense temperature fluctuations throughout the United States, as the temperature in the Arctic decreases, but the tropics are still quite warm.
Sometimes it causes dramatic changes in the temperature at a small distance.
This is an example of dramatic temperature differences on Sundays in the central part of the United States.
The difference between the temperature in Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and Senegal and Demoine (Des Moines), Iowa, varies by almost 20 degrees.
In the coming days, the long-term summer heat will try to form and expand.
It is expected that in much of the central and eastern part of the United States, the beginning of October will be warm, reaching temperatures of 80 degrees or more (by Farenheit; <0x7E>27 degrees Celsius) in vast areas from the southern plains to part of the northeast.
The temperature in New York City on Tuesday could reach 80 degrees (per Fahrenheit; <0x7E>27 degrees per Celsius), which would be about 10 degrees above the average.
Our long-term climate forecasts indicate a high probability that in the first half of October temperatures in the eastern part of the United States will be above average.
More than 20 million people watched the Bret Kaveno case.
More than 20 million people on Thursday watched with enthusiasm on six television channels, as shown by Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Kaveno of sexual misconduct at the age of 80, in the case of Christine Blasey Ford.
In the meantime, political indistinctness continued, with broadcasters interrupting regular broadcasting to report on the latest developments in Friday’s events: Arizona Senator Jeff Flake’s agreement that the FIB will investigate charges for weeks.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was absolutely convinced that Kaveno had grabbed him in the drink and was trying to take off her clothes during a high school party.
Kaveno relentlessly testified that he was absolutely convinced that it did not happen.
According to Nielsen, it was all watched on Friday by 20.4 million people.
The companies CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC recorded the interest of average viewers.
Data on other broadcasting organisations, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, which demonstrated this was not immediately available.
And "Nielsen" usually causes problems, including people who are watching in offices.
For a better view, this number of viewers corresponds to the number of viewers of the exclusion games or the Oscar ceremony.
The Fox News Channel, whose commentators have strongly supported Kaveno's appointment, had the highest number of viewers, averaging 5.69 million during a full-day hearing, Nielsen reported.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS attracted 3.1 million, NBC — 2.94 million, MSNBC — 2.89 million, and CNN — 2.52 million, Nielsen reported.
The interest remained high even after the hearing.
Fleik was the central figure of Friday's drama.
After a moderate Republican team had issued a statement that he would vote for Kaveno's appointment, the senator was spotted by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning as he, accompanied by protesters' shocking calls, attempted to reach the hearings of the Judiciary Committee by elevator.
On live CNN he stood for several minutes with his eyes closed, as if dead.
"I'm standing here right in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the state?
He was told that "home belongs to power while so many women are powerless."
Fleik explained that his team had made a statement, and informed him before the elevator door closed that he had more to say during the committee hearing.
The cable networks and the broadcasting organisation were reflected live several hours later, when the Committee on Justice was preparing to vote on Kaveno's motion for a vote in the Senate.
However, Fleik claimed that he would only do so if he knew that the FIB would consider the accusations against the candidate next week, which was demanded by a minority of Democrats.
Fleik was partially convinced of the negotiations with his friends, the Democratic Senator Chris Coons (Chris Coons).
After negotiations with K<0xC5><0xAB>ns and several other senators, Fleiks made his decision.
Fleik's choice was important because it was clear that Republicans would not have a vote to approve Kaveno without an investigation.
President Trump has ordered the FIB to investigate the charges against Kavanaugh (Kavanaugh).
UK Prime Minister Meja accuses critics of political games over Brexit <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused people who criticised her plans to leave the European Union of "political games" with Britain's future and aggravation of national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May attends a Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview, right next to an interview with him on the front page of the newspaper, former Maya Foreign Minister Boris Johnson continues to attack her Brexit plan on Britain's future relationship with the European Union, the so-called "Chequers plan" for the other, underlining that the EU's proposal is "abridged".
This is the first time I’ve heard that I’ve been told that I’ve been told that I’ve been told that I’ve been told that I’m a good person.
Police have arrested the suspect in the shooting of 20-year-old LSU basketball player Wayde Sims.
The 20-year-old Diteon Simpson was arrested and arrested as a second-degree murder suspect, the Baton Rouge police station reported.
Officials broadcast a video showing Sims’s collision with Simpson, and police said that Sims had lost his glasses during a rubber bandage.
The CBS subsidiary WAFB reports that the police found the glasses at the crime scene and found Simpson's blood on them.
When Simpson was interrogated, the police informed him that he had confessed to Veida's shooting.
According to the lawyer, he was given $350,000 in large security funds.
A team of medical experts from the East Baton Rouge Parish court on Friday released a provisional statement stating that the death was caused by a gunshot to the head that hit the neck.
The Department thanked the Louisiana State Police Refugee Search Operations Team, the State Police Crime Laboratory, the Southern University Police and the residents of the territory for their assistance in the investigation, the result of which was arrest.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked the area's law enforcement officers for their "strength and work in the name of fairness".
Sims was 20 years old.
6-foot-long 6-inch (<0x7E>1.98 m) attacker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Veins also played basketball at LSU.
In the last season in one game, he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 dropped balls.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade announced that the team was "satisfied" and "shocked" by Veida's death.
"That's what a man always worries about," Veids said.
Volcano washes ashes across Mexico
The profits, rising from the Pocatepella volcano, have reached the southern outskirts of the Mexican capital.
After activity was observed in the crater and 183 gas and dust emissions were recorded within 24 hours, the National Disaster Prevention Center warned Mexicans on Saturday that they should not approach the volcano.
The center observed repeated swelling and shaking.
Images on social networks showed that car windmills in the Mexican region, such as Hochimilco (Xochimilco), are covered with a shallow layer of ash.
Geophysicists have observed 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital's current volcanic activity, since a 7.1-magnitude strong earthquake shook central Mexico in 2017.
The volcano, also known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police conflict with Catalan separatists ahead of the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after protesters clashed with public order police and when thousands joined opposition demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia’s polarizing vote on secession.
A group of masked separatists, who were delayed by the police of public order, smeared them with eggs and burned them with powdery paint, forming dark clouds of dust in the streets, which would normally be full of tourists.
The difference was also raised later today, and the police used steaks to remove the snails.
For several hours, pro-independence groups chanting: "Don't forget and don't forgive!" were engaged in a confrontation with unity-supporting protesters who chanted: "Long live Spain!"
According to local newspapers, 14 people were given medical assistance due to minor injuries received during the protests.
A year after the referendum on 1 October, which Madrid declared illegal but was praised by Catalans, the idea of independence in the occupied region remains high.
Voters confidently expressed their independence, although the voter activity was low, and those who were against the separation were boycotting the vote.
According to a Catalan official, almost 1,000 people were injured last year when police tried to stop voting at polling stations across the region, and there were brutal clashes.
Independence groups had marched on Friday night to prevent a demonstration in support of the state police.
The demonstration took place, but the demonstrators were forced to choose a different path.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who took part in a separatist protest with his wife, admitted that he no longer expects Catalonia to gain independence.
“In the past year, we experienced one of our best moments.
I saw my parents' eyes filled with joy at the fact that they were allowed to vote, but now everything has stopped," he said.
Although the parties that support Catalonia's independence won last year's regional elections with a small but significant majority, these parties have struggled to keep the trend this year, because several of the most famous leaders of Catalonia's history are not in the forefront of the organization and have either been emigrants, or have been directly emigrants.
A 42-year-old mechanic, Joan Puig, who filmed a protest on the phone in support of police, said the conflict had been fuelled by politicians on both sides.
"The tension is getting bigger and bigger," he said.
On Saturday, one of nine Catalan leaders, Oriol Junqueras, who has been in custody since last year before the court, announced that he will run for European Parliament elections next year.
"Candidating for the European elections is the best way to expose the regression and repression of democratic values that the Spanish government has directed against us," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after car crash in a building
Three men (aged 33, 34 and 39) were arrested after a car was hit several times by a building in Londonderry.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 7.30 p.m. BST.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings reported that the gate and the building itself were damaged.
It is possible that the machine was fired at the same time from the arcade.
Menga's hit allows Livingston to beat Rangers 1-0
Dolly Menga's first goal was a win for Livingston.
The Lifestons were shocked by the Rangers, providing Steven Gerrard with his second loss in 18 games as manager of Ibrox's club.
Dolly Meng's strike proved decisive as the team of Gary Holt balanced the situation with the Hibernian.
Gerard's team did not win the guests this season, and next Sunday they have to meet with the leaders of the Hearts, of which they are behind by eight points.
Before that, in the European League on Thursday, Rangers hosted Vienna's Rapid.
In the meantime, Livingston extended its series without losses in the division to six games, and head coach Holts has still not felt the taste of defeat, since last month he replaced Kenya Miller (Kenny Miller).
Livingston does not take advantage of the opportunity against deaf guests
Holt's team with its direct game, which in a variety of ways made it difficult for the Rangers, was to be in charge long before they got the words.
Scott Robinson broke out, but dragged his attempt in front of the gate, then Alan Lithgow's attempt after slipping on his feet to prevent Craig Halkett's side with a head in the door.
The owners allowed "Rangers" to play in front of them, knowing that they would be able to place guests in the planned places.
And that’s exactly how the decisive gates came.
The Rangers allowed the freeway, and Livingston used the corridor, Declan Gallagher and Robinsons joined forces to provide the opportunity for Meng, who sat and won the gates from the middle of the zone.
At this stage the Rangers managed the ball, but the defense of the guests proved imperceptible and goalkeeper Liam Kelly (Liam Kelly) did not bother anyone particularly.
This continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to save the gates.
Scott Pitman's attempt was interrupted by the performance of Rangers goalkeeper Alan McGregor, and Litgov throws past the gates in the combination of Livingston.
In the Livingston area, centralized balls continued to appear, but two appeals to sentence the penalty — after Halket fought for the ball with his replacement Glenn Middleton and for playing with his hand — were rejected.
"Phenomenal" "Livingston" performance — analysis
Scottish BBC Alsdair Lamont (Alasdair Lamont) at Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal "Livingston" performance and result.
Each of them was great, continuing to exceed the expectations, increasing the improvement in performance.
Their playing style and personality have practically not changed since their return to the highest echelon, but Holt has earned a lot of praise for how he has composed the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was a great keeper of the first-class organized defense, while Menga ensured that Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall would always remain alert.
However, the Rangers lack inspiration.
Although they were sometimes good at Gerard's exposure, they were far from these standards.
Their last ball was boring — only once they entered a part of the landlords’ field — and that’s essentially a call to revel in the Rangers, which are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan is waiting in Cologne with shared feelings
On Saturday (September 29th), when Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin, there was a lot of smiles and blue skies.
It is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which was aimed at restoring relations between NATO allies.
They have disagreements on various issues, including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
After that, Erdogan went to Cologne to open a new gigantic mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish community outside of Turkey.
Police blocked a crowd of 25,000 people as a reason to undermine security, not allowing them to gather in front of the mosque, but many of the supporters came nearby to see their president.
The protesters against Erdogan, many of whom were Kurds, also expressed their attitude, condemning both Erdogan’s policy and the German government’s decision to take him in.
The mutual protests between the two sides reflect the contradictions created by the guest, some of whom Germans consider the Turks a hero, while others destroy it as an autocrat.
Road traffic accident in Deptford: cyclist dies in collision with car
In London, a cyclist was killed in a collision with a car.
The collision took place at the intersection of Bestwood Street with Evelyn Street, at a traffic-intensive stage in Deptford, southeast of the city, around 10.15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and was assisted by a doctor, but the man died at the scene.
The collision took place several months after another cyclist died in Childers Street, about a mile from the Sunday crash site, at which time the driver abandoned the crash site.
The police department of the capital city said that the police are engaged in identifying the man and informing his relatives.
There are closed roads and diverted buses at the event site, but drivers are advised to avoid this area.
Long Lartin prison: six workers injured in riots
The Prison Office reports that six prison workers have been injured in riots in a male-style prison in the strictest regime.
The riots erupted in the HMP Long Lartin prison in Vorchestershire around 09.30 BST on Sunday and are still continuing.
In order to prevent riots involving eight inmates who are confined in one wing, staff of the Tornado Special Service were involved.
Workers were treated for mild facial injuries at the site of the event.
A representative of the prison service said: "In order to resolve the incident in HMP Long Lartin prison, specially trained prison staff were involved.
Six staff members were provided with medical assistance due to the injury.
We will not be satisfied with the violence in our prisons and make it clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and possibly spend more time behind the scenes."
HMP Long Lartin prison has more than 500 inmates, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the head of the prison was in a medical hospital after the prisoner's attack.
And in October of last year, workers in charge of dump control were sent to prison to resolve serious mishaps in which staff had been attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Roza Phoenix, Las Vegas and Solteixitia at risk of sudden flooding (possibly to benefit from the situation in dry areas)
Arizona is rare from the tropical depression, but this is likely to happen early next week, when Hurricane Roza, with the rest of the force, will move across the desert southwest, creating a sudden flood risk.
The National Weather Service has already issued a warning of sudden flooding on Monday and Tuesday for the western part of Arizona, the southwestern and eastern part of Nevada, the southeastern part of Las Vegas, and the southern part of California, the Sunshine Coast, the Sunshine Coast, and the Sunshine Coast.
It is expected that Roza will head straight across Phoenix on Tuesday, arriving late on Monday.
The National Meteorological Service of Phoenix said on Twitter that since 1950, only "ten tropical cyclones have retained tropical storm or depression status within a 200-mile (320 km) radius of Phoenix!
Catherine (1967) was a hurricane 40 miles (65 km) from the AZ border."
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 2-4 inches (<0x7E>5.08-10.2 cm) of rainfall, with some locations reaching up to 6 inches (15.24 cm).
Other desert areas in the southwest, including the central part of the Klin<0xC5><0xA1>e Mountains and the Great Basin, will likely receive 1-2 inches (<0x7E>2.54-5.08 cm), reaching up to 4 inches (<0x7E>10.2 cm) in some places.
For those who are not exposed to the risk of sudden flooding, the Rose rain can become a blessing because the region has been visited by drought.
While the possibility of flooding is of very serious concern, some of the rainfall is likely to benefit because the south-west is currently suffering from drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, just over 40 percent of Arizona suffers from at least extreme drought, which is the second highest category, according to weather.com.
First, the Hurricane Rose Road leads to the peninsula of Baja California in Mexico, where it will reach the coast.
Roza still with hurricane force on Sunday morning with a maximum wind speed of 85 miles (137 km) per hour, is located about 385 miles (<0x7E>620 km) south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and travels to the north with a speed of 19 hrs.
The wind meets the fresher waters of the Pacific Ocean and, therefore, becomes habitual.
Therefore, it is expected that a tropical storm hurricane will reach the coast of Mexico on Monday afternoon or in the morning.
In the rain gas part of Mexico can be strong, creating a significant risk of leakage.
"It is expected that the rainfall will reach 3–6 inches (7.62–15.24 cm) from within Southern California in the southwestern part of Sonora, with precipitation likely to reach 10 inches (25.4 cm)," reports weather.com.
Rosa will head north across Mexico as a tropical storm and then reach the Arizona border early on Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, which will then head across Arizona and arrive in the South of the senses late on Tuesday evening.
"The main threat to be expected from Rose or its residues is very strong rain gases in California, the northwestern part of Sonora, and the desert southwest of the United States," the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
It is expected that this rain will cause life-threatening sudden floods and dune floods in deserts and landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsummer Norton Attack: Four Arrested for Attempted Murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy with a stab wound was found in Somerset.
The injured teenager was found at Excelsior Terrace in Midsomer Norton on Saturday at around 4.00 BST.
He was taken to a hospital, where his condition remains "stable".
Police reported that 17-year-olds and two 18-year-olds, as well as a 20-year-old man, were arrested overnight in Redstock, Iowa and Somerset.
Police have called for the withdrawal of anyone who might have mobile phone material in their possession for what happened.
Trump claims that Kaveno is suffering from the "evil and anger" of the Democratic Party
"The vote for Judge Kaveno is a vote to reject the Democratic Party's cruel and violent tactics," Trump said at a meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump stressed that Kaveno has suffered from the "evil and anger" of the Democratic Party throughout his nomination process.
Kaveno testified in front of Congress, where he vigorously and emotionally denied any accusations of sexual harassment by Christiane Blasey Ford several decades ago when they were both teenagers.
Ford, too, testified during the hearing of his accusations.
The President announced on Saturday that on that day "the American people saw" Kaveno "excellence, ability and courage".
"The vote on the approval of Judge Kaveno is a vote to approve one of the most educated lawyers of our time with a bright history of serving the people," he said in a statement to the crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
President Kaveno's nomination was mentioned in the circumstances when talking about the importance of the Republican activity in the midterm elections.
“We’ve had weeks to one of the most important elections of our time.
I didn’t run, but I actually ran,” he said.
“That’s why I’m going everywhere to fight for great candidates.”
Trump argued that the Democrats have undertaken a mission to "protest and resist".
It is expected that the first of the important procedural votes in the Senate on Kaveno's nomination will take place no later than Friday, CNN informed the senior assistant of the Republican Party leadership.
The victims killed in the earthquake in Indonesia, and it is clear that the number of victims is increasing
Officials said on Saturday that at least 384 people were killed, many simply washed up when giant waves hit the coasts after a powerful earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
On Friday at the festival in the city of Palu hundreds of people had gathered for the holidays on the beach, when up to six meters (18 feet) high waves hit the shore in the chair, many rinsing to death and destroying everything that was in their way.
Cunami erupted after a 7.5-ball earthquake.
"When the tsunami threatened yesterday, people were still operating on the beach and were not immediately fleeing, and they became victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a representative of the Indian disaster mitigation agency BNPB, told a news conference in Jakarta.
"Cunami did not come alone, it brought cars, bars and buildings, it dragged everything that was on the ground," Nugoro said, adding that the tsunami had crossed the sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 mph) before crashing into the coast.
"A lot of people snatch coconuts to save themselves and survive," he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
The photographs taken in the flight of the disaster agency show many destroyed houses and shops, deformed and broken bridges, and a water-covered mosque.
In the afternoon, the coastal city continued to tremble on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in the territory of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technologies (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy emitted by Friday's massive earthquake was about 200 times higher than the energy from the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The location of the city was probably reinforced by a tsunami at the end of a long, narrow bay.
Nugroho's actions were described as "widespread" and reported that thousands of houses, hospitals, shops and hotels had collapsed.
He said that the bodies of some of the victims were found buried under the collapsed building miners, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho acknowledged that the number of casualties and casualties could be greater along the coastline 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, in an area called Dongala (Donggala), which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
"The communications "were completely broken, no information was received from Dongala," Nugroho said.
More than 300,000 people live there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers are going to the regions affected by the disaster.
"It's already a tragedy, but everything could have been even worse," the organization said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for not being informed that the tsunami had visited Palu, although officials claimed the waves were coming at the time of the warning.
The video circulated on social networks to hear that the man on the upper floor of the building is calling people indiscriminately at the bottom of the street that the tsunami is approaching.
Within a few minutes, the water wall hits the shore, rinsing buildings and machines.
The news agency "Reuters" was unable to immediately confirm whether the material was genuine.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a serious loss of electrical power, which disconnected communications to Palu, making it difficult for officials to coordinate rescue efforts.
Officials announced that the army has started sending cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuations are still in dire need of food and other essential goods.
The city’s airport is only open for relief and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo planned to visit the evacuation centres of Palu on Sunday.
The number of victims of the Indonesian tsunami exceeds 800.
It's very bad.
Mr. Doseba (Doseba) said that the World Vision employees, who had successfully reached the city of Palu from Dongal (Donggala) and now resided in the yard of the brigade in the office, were on their way past the bodies of the victims.
"They told us that they saw a lot of buildings that had been demolished," he explained.
It's very bad.
Even when aid groups were determined to organise aid for those affected by the disaster, some complained that foreign aid workers with extensive experience were not allowed to go to Pal.
In accordance with Indonesian legislation, funding, resources and staff from overseas organisations may only enter the postal territory if it is declared as a national disaster zone.
It hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a disaster at the provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, a representative of the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government announces, 'Well, it's a national disaster,' we will be able to accept international aid, but that status has not yet been determined."
When Paul arrived the second night after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, friends and family members of the people still unaccounted for continued to hope that their loved ones would become miracles that made life brighter in the midst of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of the gutter.
On Sunday, a woman who had been trapped under the mines for two days was rescued, next to her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian paraglider national team, had prepared two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games that took place earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others from the hotel "Roa Roa", including Mr. Mandagi (Mandagi), were their pupils.
"As an experienced paraglider," he said, "I'm learning the emotion of birth."
Mr Gendona recalled that after news of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel was circulated by the paragliding team, he sent messages to WhatsApp for hours to the participants of the Palu competition who participated in the beach festival.
However, the result of his reports was only one grey mark, not two blue marks.
"I think that means that the messages did not reach the addressee," he said.
Zag<0xC4><0xBC>i pays off $26,750 at the Newport on the Levee complex during the filling of the ATM
According to a statement from the Newport Police Department, the burglars stole $26,750 from a Brink's employee on Friday morning who filled the ATM at the Newport on the Levee complex.
"The driver of the car emptied the ATM of the entertainment complex and was preparing to fill it with more money," Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a press release.
While the driver was busy, another man "attacked the Brink's employee from behind" and stole a bag of cash for the ATM.
According to a press release, witnesses observed several suspects leaving the crime scene, but the police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information about their identities should contact the Newport Police 859-292-3680.
Kanje West: rapper changes his name to Je
The rapper Kanje West changes his name to Ye (Je).
In announcing the replacement on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The essence that previously known as the Kanji Vesta."
The 41-year-old West had been called Je for some time, and used the nickname as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June, ("Ye").
This change takes place before his appearance on the show "Saturday Night Live," in which he is expected to launch his new album "Yandhi".
The creators of the show say that he replaces singer Arian Grandi in the show, who discontinued work for "emotional reasons".
The West has said that it is not only an abbreviation of his current professional word, but it also has a religious meaning.
"I believe that 'Ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'You'," West explained earlier this year, discussing the name of his album with the radio host Big Boy (Big Boi).
"So I'm you, I'm us, that's us.
In the beginning there was Kanje, which means "only one, followed by "Ye", which is thought about good and bad in us, about our embarrassment, about everything.
The album is more about thinking about who we are."
He is one of several famous rappers who have changed their names.
Sean Combs, previously known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers the words Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who had previously collaborated with Vesta, also has, and has not used, a mind sign and capital letters.
President-elect of Mexico vows not to use the army against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has pledged never to use military force against civilians at a time when the 50th anniversary of the bloody return of students is approaching.
Lopez Obrador on Saturday promised the Tlatelolco Plaza "never use the army to oppress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, a peaceful demonstration by an army unit was shot, killing as many as 300 people during a time when left-wing student movements spread across Latin America.
Lopes Obrador has vowed to support young Mexicans in their years by granting grants to students each month and opening more public universities.
He said that unemployment and the lack of opportunities for education draw young people into criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double funding for artificial intelligence
As China is becoming increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount spent on research in this field, explains investor and artificial intelligence practitioner Kai Fu Lee (Kai-Fu Lee), who has worked at Google.
The comments were made after various U.S. government bodies have made statements about artificial intelligence, although the U.S. as a whole lacks a strategy in the field of artificial intelligence.
In the meantime, last year, China launched its plan: its goal is to become a major country in the field of artificial intelligence by 2030.
"A two-fold budget for artificial intelligence research will be a good start, given that all other countries are so far behind in the United States, and the next cardinal shift in the field of artificial intelligence is expected," Lee said.
In an interview with CNBC this week, Lee said that doubling the funding could double the chances that the next achievement in the field of artificial intelligence will take place in the United States.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" ("The Power of Artificial Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order") was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt <0x2B> for the first time in the series, is the CEO of "Sinovation Ventures".
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon (Carnegie-Mellon) University, he worked to create an artificial intelligence system that would outperform America's best "Othello" (Reversi) player, but later he was president of Microsoft Research.
Lee recognized the previous technology competitions organized by the U.S. government, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked if he could identify the humanities in the future, when the idea would be prepared.
“Scientists in the US often have to work very hard to get government grants,” Lee said.
"It's not China that's been seducing leading scientists, it's big companies," he said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have been lending university mirrors to work on artificial intelligence.
Leigh added that changes in immigration policy could also help the US to improve its achievements in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I believe that green cards should be automatically awarded to people with a Ph.D. degree in Artificial Intelligence," he said.
In July 2017, the State Council of China published its next-generation plan for the development of artificial intelligence.
Li explained that China’s National Science Fund provides funding to people in academic institutions, similar to the National Science Foundation and other government organizations donating money to U.S. researchers, but the academic quality of work in China is low.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a joint artificial intelligence centre, which is intended to bring together partners from industry and academic circles, and the White House announced the formation of a special committee in the House of Commons.
And this month, DARPA (the Central Research and Development Organization of the U.S. Department of Defense) announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called "AI Next".
The National Science Foundation, on the other hand, currently invests more than $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
In the meantime, the U.S. legislation, the task of which was to establish the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, has not been in place for several months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on the change of national name
Macedonians voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change the country's name to "the Republic of North Macedonia", taking a step that will eliminate decades of disputes with Greece, which has blocked Macedonia's requests for NATO membership in Europe.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, stresses that the name of its northern neighbour indicates claims to its territory, and has vetoed Macedonia's accession to NATO and the EU.
The two governments concluded an agreement in June, which was based on the proposed new name, but opposition nationalists insist that the changes will undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that he will not vote in the referendum, and the campaign calling for a boycott has raised concerns about whether the voter activity will reach at least 50%, which is necessary for the referendum to be declared valid.
The referendum bulletin asks the question: "Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership in concluding an agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying on the way to Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the collapse of Yugoslavia, becoming an organization, and the EU, such as NATO.
"I have come to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia so that they can live freely, under the protection of the European Union, because that means a safer life for all of us," said 79-year-old Olivera Georgievska.
While not legally binding, a sufficient number of MEPs have stated that they will take into account the outcome of the vote, which will become decisive.
You will need a two-thirds majority in Parliament to change the name.
The National Electoral Commission informed that no violations had been reported to anyone until 1 p.m.
However, the activity was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the previous parliamentary elections, in which 66 percent of the registered voters voted.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said 62-year-old Josie Tanevski, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zorans Zajevs, his wife Zorica (Zorica) and their son Dusko (Dushko) voted in a referendum in Macedonia on the change of country name, which will pave the way for NATO and the European Union, in Strumica (Strumica) in Macedonia.
In front of the Parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardakov (Vladimir Kavardarkov) prepared a small stage and placed chairs at the tents that had been laid by those who boycotted the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to stand up with our heads up, not through the door of the servants," Kavadarkov said.
We are a small country, but we have self-esteem.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China or Russia, and become part of the European-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zajevs says that NATO membership will start the necessary investments in Macedonia, where the unemployment rate exceeds 20 percent.
"I believe that the majority will vote in favour, because more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO," Zajevs said after the vote was handed over.
He said that the result "yes" "will confirm our future."
The survey published last Monday by the Macedonia's Institute for Policy Research shows that 30-43 per cent of voters will participate in the referendum – less than the required activity.
Another survey carried out by the Macedonian Telma TV found that 57 percent of voters are planning to participate in Sunday's vote.
70 percent of them said they would vote for it.
In order for the referendum to be successful, the voter activity must be 50 percent and one more vote.
The failure of the referendum will be the first serious blow to the Western-oriented government, which came to power in May last year.
See: Manchester City Serhio Agvero (Sergio Aguero) wins through the entire Brighton defense to get the gates
Serhio Agvero and Raheem Sterling added Brighton's defense to allow Manchester City Saturday's Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England to win 2–0.
Agvero made the impression that his goal win in the 65th minute was ridiculously light.
The Argentine striker got a play in the middle of the field at the start of the combo.
He sprinted between the three Brighton defenders, and shot inside the free field.
Then Agvero folded four green shirts.
He rounded the ball to one defender, then overpowered several more on the Brighton field in the run.
Then he played on the left, reaching Sterling.
The English centre forward used his first touch to play back Agvero, who threw in the case a good football boot to reach Brigton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan, hitting the ball on the right side of the net.
"Agvero is struggling with foot problems," City manager Peps Gardiola (Pep Guardiola) told reporters.
“We talked to him about playing for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he won the gates at the time.
However, it was Sterlings who provided the Sky Blues with an initial advantage in the Premier League.
The goal was scored in the 29th minute.
Agvero in the game got the ball deep in the territory of Brighton.
He sent the ball with a beautiful bolt along Leroy Sane's left leg to the jaws.
In the dream, several shots were made until Sterling was entrusted with delivering the ball to the next goalpost.
The attacker of the Sky Blues center easily entered the ball into the net just before crossing the border.
City will play against the Hoffenheim Champions League group on Tuesday at 12.55 p.m. at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Zinsheim, Germany.
Sherzer wants to provide problems to the Rockies
Since Nationals does not participate in the exclusion games, there was no reason to restart yet.
However, Scherzer, who is always ready to compete, hopes to take advantage of the opportunity against the Colorado "Rockies" on Sunday, but only if the "Rockies" will be the current shutdown games. And the "Rockies" of the National League of the West group.The "Dodges" are in the lead with one game against Los Angeles.
The Rockies have squeezed at least a white card Friday night with a 5:2 win over the Nationals, but still have not won their first title in the division.
"Although we play the same game, we will at least be able to have fun knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver, with the crowd and the other team, will probably be the worst I'm going to face this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to compete?”
The Nationals have not yet announced who will start the game on Sunday, but as a message, they are ready to let Cherry take the shot.
Schercer, who will be the 34th start, held a shooting session on Thursday in the outdoor part of the "bullpen", and on Sunday during normal rest will throw the ball.
The Washington Dock is 18<0xE2><0x88><0x92>7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 draws 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump is running a myth in West Virginia.
The President referred to the situation in which his elected Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kaveno, was included, while speaking about the importance of the activity of Republican voters in the midterm elections.
“In November, everything we’ve done is in jeopardy.
Five weeks to one of the most important elections of our time.
It’s really very, very serious — I didn’t run, but actually I ran, and that’s why I’m everywhere and fighting for great candidates,” he said.
Trump continued: “You see this horrible, horrible democrat radical group of people who are acting right now.
And they're committed to regaining power by using all possible means to achieve the goal. You see evil, repulsive action.
They have no matter what they're going to hurt, what they have to break in order to gain power and control, that's why they want to gain power and control, and we're not going to give it to them."
The Democrats, he said, have undertaken a mission to "protest and resist".
"And you've seen the same thing in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "nice, evil, innocent and unjust."
He named on behalf of the Senate Judiciary Committee Democratic Party Senators Diane Feinstein, to which viewers responded with loud appeals.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you read the document? <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Hmm, what's this about?
No, um, wait -- it was really a bad body language, the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer ready for diversity.
It is intolerant of the open
It was no wonder that Momentum activists in my local party wanted me to be censored.
After all, I am the last member of the Labour Party, who was informed that he is not desirable - all because we do not hide our opinion.
With my colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, the same thing happened because she was resolutely opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship movement criticized me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of an economically responsible policy, of national security, of Europe is ironic, but those were issues in which Jeremy disagreed with the previous leaders.
The announcement of the Labour meeting in the eastern part of Nottingham on Friday states that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
Most of the meetings that took place during the career of my eight local Labour MPs were exactly that.
Unfortunately, in many meetings today, the climate is different and the promises of a "better, safer" policy have long been forgotten, if they have ever been at all.
It has become increasingly clear that the Labour Party does not want to tolerate differing views, and any view is assessed depending on whether it is acceptable for party leadership.
It started soon after Jeremy became the leader: colleagues, who I think are similar in our political views, started to expect me to turn 180 degrees and accept the views that I would or would not, in other cases, think the EU would or would never, or would not, agree to.
When I speak publicly - and it doesn't really matter what I say - I follow the tyranny about using social media, calling for a ban on running for the next election, revealing the centre's politics, saying that I have no place in the Labour Party.
And that is not just my experience.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments against me are usually political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who face a stream of sexist and racist insults every day, but never try to avoid submissions.
One of the most unsatisfactory aspects of this political era is how normal use has become.
Jeremy Corbyn announced last week that the Labour Party must cultivate a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we are no longer an organisation that is ready for a diversity of views and with every expression of distrust or change of selection rules, the party will narrow down.
In the last two years, I have often been given advice, telling me not to read on the street, think about what I am talking about, and then "everything will be okay with me".
But that’s not why I decided to get involved in politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a schoolboy, in response to the neglect of the Techer government, which had literally led my integrated school class to the collapse, I set the task of fighting for the best public services in the local government, for those who have the most in common.
I have never concealed my political views, not even in the previous elections.
There was no reason for anyone in the East of Nottingham to doubt my position on policy issues and areas where I did not agree with the existing government.
To those who moved the proposal on Friday, I can only say that at a moment when the country is resolutely moving towards a Brexit that will hurt households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand such a desire to spend time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour Party.
But basically the only thing I want to announce is not Nottingham's "Momentum", but their constituents, regardless of whether they are members of the Labour Party: I am proud that I can serve you, and I promise you that I have no threat of sliding in my face, I will not have any recollections, I will not have any in politics.

"Ayr" 38 - 17 "Melrose": Unspecified "Ayr" reaches the top row in the table
The last two attempts are possible to some extent match the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr has deserved to triumph in this astonishingly exciting Scottish Championship match today.
Now they are at the top of the table, the only unbound team out of ten.
After all, it was both their great protection and the much better use of the opportunities that led to the owners, and coach Peter M<0xC4><0x93>rchie has all the reasons to be satisfied.
“We’ve been tested in all our games and we’re still not beaten, so I have to be happy,” he said.
"Melrose" Robin Christie: "With all due respect to Ayr, they used their chances better than us."
The attempt of Grant Anderson in the 14th minute, realized by Freisier Climo, raised "Ayr", but in the yellow card to the Scottish captain Rory Hughes, where the game was awarded "Warrior" (Warrior) and "Bellison" changed "Melro".
The climate increased the management of the "Ayr" with a penalty, right at the end of half-time, he scored points, then realized a solo attempt, with which the "Ayr" interrupted the doses by 17-5.
However, the Melrose half-time started with a good game, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, realized by Begots, reduced the retardation to 5 points.
Then there was a long pause, as Ruuridh Knott suffered a serious injury and was transported away from the pitch, but when the game resumed the "Ayr" quickly moved forward when the realisation was made by Stafford McDowall.
Former Ayr captain Blair Macpherson then received a yellow card, and once again, after intense pressure, Melrose used the excess player — with Bruce Colvine’s attempt, which was not realized.
However, the owners were in touch, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for having picked up Climate without a ball from the penalty corridor, Macferson made a tacked-up "Ayr" pier in the back.
Climate realized the ball, as before, almost from the very beginning, after Kyle Rowe captured David Armstrong's playoffs on the field and sent the flanged player Gregor Henry to the host of Gregor Henry's.
"Still Game" star seems to be planning a new career in the restaurant business
The star of the comedy series "Still Game" Ford Kieran, seems to be planning to get involved in the hospitality business, as it was revealed that he is named as the director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis on a popular BBC show he co-wrote and plays with his old partner in the comedies Greg Hemphill.
The Duets have announced that the next ninth season will be the last of the show, and Cyrnans apparently plans his life after Craiglang.
According to official information, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although a source from the "Scottish Sun" indicated that Kirnan planned to engage in Glasgow's "floating restaurant business".
"The sea belongs to us!": a landlocked Bolivia hopes that the court will pave the way to the Pacific Ocean
Sailors patrol around the taves dressed in the Fleet Staff Lapa.
Public buildings have raised the blue flags of the ocean.
Fleet-based ships from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are lined with the motto: "We have the right to the sea.
It is our duty to recover it."
In Bolivia, the memory of Chile in the bloody 19th-century conflict over resources lost coastline is still alive, just as it has been long since shipping back into the Pacific.
These expectations are likely to be the highest in several decades, as Bolivia awaits the judgment of the International Court of Justice on 1 October after a five-year review.
"Bolivia is developing, it is united and peaceful in its spirit, and, of course, with positive thoughts awaits the outcome," said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians are watching the judgment of the International Court of Justice on the big screens across the country, hoping that the tribunal in The Hague will decide in favour of Bolivia's demand that, after several decades of negotiations, Chile is obliged to negotiate the sovereignty of the sovereign.
Bolivia's charismatic local president Evo Morales, who is awaiting a controversial election fight next year, is also very interested in Monday's ruling.
"We are close to recovering the Pacific Ocean," he said at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the judgment of the court in favour of Bolivia is unlikely and, if it is to be adopted, no major change is expected.
The UN body based in the Netherlands does not have the power to assign Chilean territory and its representatives have stated that it will not determine the possible outcome of the negotiations.
The fact that the judgment of the International Court of Justice is passed six months after the final hearing shows that the case "was not complicated", explained Paza Zarate (Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate) from Chile.
And the last four years of the Bolivian case have not moved forward, but, on the contrary, have been delayed.
"The issue of access to the sea has been seized by the current Bolivian administration," Zarate said.
Morales's military rhetoric has written to have undermined the rest of the goodwill, she said.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the negotiations once in a while, but after this it will be very difficult to maintain the discussion.
The two countries have not exchanged envoys since 1962.
The representative of Bolivia in The Hague, former President Edvardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, did not agree that the court's decision was taken exceptionally quickly.
On Monday, Bolivia will have a "extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and a "point to 139 years of conflict from which both sides will get," he said.
Kalzadilla also denied that Moraless, still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents, used maritime problems as a political crusade.
"Bolivia will never waive its right to access the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"This decision is an opportunity to explore what needs to be done to overcome the past."
North Korea will only give up its nuclear weapons when it can trust the United States.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Jong Ho said his people would never be the first to dispose of their nuclear weapons if they could not trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to deliver on the promises made during the meeting of the leaders of the two countries in Singapore.
His comments were echoed at a time when it seems that U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is ready to restart the diplomatic measures that have come down the aisle to prevent nuclear war, more than three months after the Singapore meeting with North Korea.
Ri claims that they are "fantasies" to hope that the United States is still unrepeatable sanctions and unwillingness to declare the end of the Korean War, will ever make North Korea get in the way.
Washington is cautious with regard to the acceptance of the declaration before Phenyana will take significant disarmament measures.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second meeting.
However, many are skeptical about whether Phenjana really wants to give up arms, which the state will certainly consider the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for Kim’s next meeting with Trump.
Paris fashion show introduces the latest massive headlining line on the way to your nearest High Street
If you want to increase your hat collection or completely block the sun, then you are in the right place.
Designers Valentino and Tom Browne (Thom Browne) introduced viewers to a line of absurd, huge headwear in the spring/summer 2019 collection, which glittered against the set of styles of Paris Fashion Week.
Clearly impractical hats have flooded Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent out their stunning achievements for a fashion demonstration.
Valentine’s most outstanding work was a gorgeous sand-coloured hat decorated with a color-like wide edge that closed the head.
In the midst of massive accessories, there were gemstones covered with arbush, magic hat and even pineapples — but they weren’t designed to keep your head warm.
Tom Brown also showed a strange sample of the mask — just before Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had embroidered lips, and they were more likely to worship Hanibalam Lecter rather than high fashion.
One of the formations was reminiscent of breathing apparatus for snorkeling, with tubes and glasses, while the other resembled an exquisite ice cream cone.
And if you want to continue with the massive fashion, then the right time has come.
The style viewers believe that the huge rainbow is likely to be on its way to the nearest High Street.
Large hats immediately became popular after the appearance of "La Bomba" — straw hats with two feet (<0x7E>60 cm) wide edges seem to have worn everything, from Rianna to Emilia Ratajovski (Emily Ratajkowski).
The status of very impractical hats as a cult object in all social networks led to another great performance on the tongue — a straw beach bag, almost as big as a model wearing a swimsuit that carries it.
The red-yellow raffia bag, finished with raffia beards and equipped with a white leather handle, took a special place in the "Jacquemus' La Riviera" spring/summer 2019 collection of Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage explained to FEMAIL: "I expect that large hats and beach bags will appear in the central shopping street stores next summer, because the designer has left such a big impression after the show."
John Edwards: Language knowledge is essential for the citizens of the world
Scottish independent schools have a reputation for excellent educational institutions, and it has retained it in 2018, when the results of excellent exams were again obtained, further reinforced by individual and collective achievements in sport, art and music.
The aim of this school, which has a total of 30,000 students in Scotland and is represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), is to provide the best level for their students and their parents.
Independent schools have set the goal of preparing their pupils for further and higher education, for their chosen careers and for their lives as citizens of the world.
As an education sector that can develop and implement specific school programmes, we see that modern languages are still a popular and desirable subject in our schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to a person in a language he understands, it remains in his consciousness.
If you speak in his native language, it remains in his heart."
It is a compelling reminder that we cannot simply rely on the English language when we want to build relationships and get people to trust from other countries.
Based on the recent results of this year’s exams, we can see that languages are at the top of the league table with the highest number of exams passed in independent schools.
In total, 68 percent of the students who taught foreign languages achieved the highest grade of A.
Data from the Scottish Council of Independent Schools for 74 schools show that 72 percent of the pupils received the highest grade in Chinese A, and the same grade was also obtained by 72 percent who learned German, 69 percent who learned French, and 63 percent who were fluent in French.
This shows that the support of independent schools in Scotland for foreign languages as vital skills, which children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages, as a subject of choice, are now rated as high in independent school programmes as the subjects of science-technology-engineering and mathematics (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) groups.
A 2014 survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills found that 17 per cent of employers as a reason for failing to fill vacancies mentioned a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly becoming mandatory in order to prepare young people for their careers in the future.
In order to increase job opportunities where language skills will be required, these skills are vitally important in a globalised world.
Regardless of the chosen career, by learning a foreign language, they will gain a real advantage in the future, given by such long-term skills.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically improve the competitiveness of multilingual speakers.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK, 75 percent do not speak a foreign language well enough to maintain a conversation, but the French language was the only one that spoke a double-digit number, 15 percent.
That’s why investing in language learning is important for today’s children.
The ability to speak several languages, in particular in developing countries, will give children a better opportunity for meaningful work.
Schools in Scotland are different in terms of the languages they are taught.
Some schools will pay more attention to the most common modern languages, while others will teach languages such as Chinese and Japanese, which are considered to be the most important languages for the future of the UK, according to plans by 2020.
Regardless of what your child will be interested in, independent schools will always be able to choose from several languages, and teachers will be specialists in the field.
Scotland's independent schools are committed to providing a language environment that will prepare children and provide them with the skills needed to succeed, whatever the future may be.
At present, in the global business environment, it cannot be denied that languages are still vital for the future of the country, so this fact must be reflected in education.
Indeed, today's languages would be considered as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
It has to be done (it has to be done).
John Edwards is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
Lebron will debut in "Lakers" on Sunday Sandjego
Fans have finally been waiting for the moment when Lebron's first game in the Los Angeles Lakers will take place.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play a game on Sunday before the opening of the season against Denver's Nuggets Sandy.
However, it is still necessary to decide exactly how many minutes he will play.
"It will be more than one, but less than 48," Volton told Lakers on the official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell (Mike Trudell) said on Twitter that James would most likely play a limited number of minutes.
While continuing the practice started this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six pre-season game series.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need pre-season games to prepare,” he said.
The time of the trampoline myth in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is launching a series of myths in Vilnius, West Virginia, today.
This is the first of the five planned trampoline mines next week, including stops in friendly locations, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
As the vote on his choice to hold a seat in the Supreme Court has been suspended, Trump's goal is to gain support in the upcoming midterm elections, as there is a risk that Republicans will lose control of Congress after voting in November.
What time will the Trump myth take place in West Virginia today and how will you be able to watch it online?
The Tramp Myth in Vilnius, West Virginia is scheduled for seven o’clock in the evening, after ET today, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch the trampoline in West Virginia on the online channel YouTube.
It is believed that Trump is talking about this week's hearing in the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kaveno's case, which has been made a stringent charge of sex crimes, and the Senate is expected to vote to postpone approval for a week until the FIB wins.
However, the main purpose of this myth is to help improve the situation of Republicans, who are expected to vote in November.
As a result, President Trump's campaign shows that the task of this next week's five myths is to "activate volunteers and supporters while Republicans seek to protect and increase the majority that they own in the Senate and in the House of Representatives."
"Congress control is so important to his agenda that the president will visit the state as much as possible because we are starting an active campaign season," a Trump campaign representative, who did not want to reveal his name, told Reuters.
Tonight's myth, planned for the Wesbanco Arena in Willingdon, is likely to attract supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania, and it will be reflected in the Pittsburgh media," West Virginia Metro News reports.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump will visit West Virginia, a state in which he won by more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump tries to help West Virginia Senator candidate Patrick Morrisey (Patrick Morrisey), who is behind the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morise that the president needs to come in to help improve his results in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a professor of political science at the University of West Virginia.
Raider Cup 2018: The U.S. has demonstrated its determination to fight to maintain high hopes for Sunday singles
After three sessions of the "one word" Wednesday afternoon game in the format of the "foursome" was probably exactly what was needed for this Raider coffin.
Athletes love to talk about the fluctuations of luck, and really believe it, especially in competitions such as these.
So on which side do they think they're lucky now?
"They were in the lead with six points, but now with four, because I think that in its own way means that luck has turned to us," Jordan Spieth said as he walked in his footsteps.
Europe, of course, has an advantage, because it is in the lead with 4 points, but another 12 will be played.
The Spit explained that Americans believe that the wind blows in their spells and they have a reason for optimism, of course, also in the person of Spit and Justin Thomas (Justin Thomas), who played together all day, and each of them can be proud of three points out of the box.
The spear has been destructive from the site of the first battle to the field, and is an example of the winner.
These guttular victories became louder as his rounds continued, a decisive blow was made in the truce to achieve the same number of victories four times when he and Thomas were released by two victories after two.
His stroke in the truce, which achieved their victory 15 , was perceived with a similar cry, from them, for his conviction that the American team has not yet been expelled.
"You really have to go deep, and you have to worry about your game," Spike said.
That’s all that’s left for these players.
18 tricks to get lucky.
The only players who have scored more points in the last two days than Spit and Thomas are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, who will undoubtedly enter the history of this Raider Cup.
Europe's strange but attractive couple is behind by four points and will not be able to hurt.
Mollywood was the only couple to go without a bow on Saturday afternoons, but they also avoided bows on Saturday mornings, Friday afternoons and the last nine o'clock on Friday mornings.
This move and the way in which their energy flows into this crazy crowd and back convinces them that they are the players who must win on Sunday, and Flute David with Molinari will be the most popular players who can provide a potential European victory when the sun sets.
It is desirable for both at the same time in different trenches.
However, the talk of a European triumph was premature.
Babba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly coped with this morning's "fourballs" hero Sergio Garcia, who played with Alex Noren.
Bogie and two doubles in the front nine took the Spaniards and the Swedes in a chain, and they were not even close to getting out of it.
But on Sundays, there is no one to help you cope.
Games in the formats "fourball" and "foursome" are so exciting to watch close due to the interaction of couples, watching what tips they give and what they don't, and how the strategy can quickly change the situation.
Europe has played better as a team so far, and before the last few days it is in the distant control, but this competition in the format of the "foursome" showed that the US team is determined to fight what many, especially Stateside, have doubted.
European selection Raider Cup on the last day is in the lead 10-6
The European selection of the Raider Cup will start the final day in pleasant management after Saturday's "fourball" and "foursome" matches ended in a 10-6 lead against the United States.
The inspired pair, Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, led by two victories over hard-working Tiger Woods, who increased the score of Le Golf National to four.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, to save the trophies lost to Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the inaccurate American team's morning races in the format of fourballs, and the result of the series was 3-1.
The U.S. resisted more vigorously in the form of a "foursome" by winning two matches, but was unable to eliminate the deficit.
Jim Furyk's team needs 8 points for Sunday's 12 singles to save the trophy.
Fl<0xC3><0xAD>twood is the first European freshman to win four points in a row with the Mollinaires, named for Molliwood ("Molliwood") after a sensational week's sprint is just the second pair in Raider Cup history to win four points in the first four games.
Congrats to Woods and Patrick Reed in the format of the fourballs, they then easily defeated the tired Woods and American newcomer Bryson Dechambeau in a brilliant game with an even more sensational score of 5&4.
Woods, who won two games on Saturday, showed a great game for a moment, but he has lost 19 of 29 matches in the formats "fourballs" and "foursomes", plus seven in a row.
Justin Rose rested before the morning games "fourballs", returned to his partner Henrik Stenson "foursomes" to tie 2&1 with Dastin Johnson and Brooks Kepku (Brooks Koepka), who took second place.
Europe was not able to fully achieve its own, although the day in the south-west of Paris was a pleasant and windy light wind.
It is the third most prestigious golf competition winner, Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, who set the benchmark for Americans with two points on Saturday.
They squeezed 2&1 against Spain's John Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourballs format and later returned to ally Polter and Rory McIlroy with 4&3 foursomes after losing the game.
Only twice in the history of the Raider Cup has the team played a 4 point deficit in one game, but, as the owners, Farika (Furyk) team is only enough with an undisciplined result to save the trophy.
After being in the second place for two days, as it looks, Sunday counterattack will be problematic.
North Korea has announced that it will not disarm unilaterally, without trust, in any case.
North Korea's foreign minister informed the United Nations on Saturday that the continuation of sanctions has deepened its distrust of the United States, and in such a situation, North Korea will in no case unilaterally waive its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho informed the World Organization's annual General Assembly that North Korea has taken "significant steps of goodwill" in the past year, such as the cessation of nuclear weapons and missile tests, non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and non-nuclear weapons tests.
"However, we do not see a suitable response from the US," he said.
"If there is no trust in the United States, there will be no trust in the security of our country, and under such circumstances we will not be the first to unilaterally disarm."
While Ri reiterated well-known North Korean concerns about Washington's resistance to the "stage" approach to denuclearization, according to which Korea will be rewarded for the steps it has taken, his statement was, in part, a phariyaan, an impression, because it was not in the car.
Ri recalled a joint statement by Kim Chenun and Donald Trump at a meeting of the first in office of the US President and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim promised to work to achieve "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula", while Trump pledged to guarantee the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.
North Korea has tried to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has announced that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Also, Washington has not agreed to the call for a facilitation of serious international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
"The U.S. insists that 'denuclearization should come first,' and raises the level of sanctions pressure to achieve the goal with power, even opposing the 'declaration of an end to the war,'" Ri said.
"The idea that sanctions could push us on the road is empty fantasies that are cherished by people who don't know anything about us.
But the problem is that the continuation of sanctions only deepens our distrust."
Ri did not speak of any intentions regarding the second Kim meeting with Trump, which the US leader had specifically mentioned when speaking at the United Nations this week.
In his speech, the Minister specifically highlighted three meetings of Kim with South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the last five months, adding: "If the other side were South Korea, not the US, on this issue of denuclearization, then the Korean peninsula would not be denuclearized."
However, the tone of Ri's speech differed dramatically from last year's, when he announced at the UN General Assembly that the North Korean missile launch on the U.S. mainland was unavoidable after the "Southern President" Mr. Trump was on a mission.
This year, at the United Nations, Trump, who had threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea last year, praised Kim for his courage in taking steps towards disarmament, but stressed that there is still a lot to be done, and that sanctions must be lifted.
On Wednesday, Trump announced that he hadn't planned a specific time, stressing that "it doesn't matter whether it will take two years, three years or five months."
China and Russia stress that the UN Security Council should reward Phenyana for what he has done.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday, however, that "the implementation of the Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously, without making mistakes, until a definitive and convincing denuclearization is achieved."
The Security Council has unanimously intensified the sanctions since 2006 in an effort to achieve the depletion of funding for the nuclear and ballistic weapons programmes in Pyongyang.
Pompeo met with Ri outside the UN General Assembly, and then announced that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second meeting.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trips were unsuccessful.
He went away from Pyongyang in July, saying that progress had been made, but just a few hours later North Korea accused him of "gangster worthy demands".
North Korea agreed to dismantle this month's meeting with Munu in the event that the United States takes "appropriate measures".
According to him, Kim had informed him that the "appropriate measures" North Korea wants to see are security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and steps to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard University students will learn the subject of study on how to relax enough.
A new subject of study at Harvard University this year has made it possible for students to sleep more, and it’s an attempt to target an increasingly popular culture of brutality that includes caffeine-filled studying through the night.
One teacher discovered that in the world the students of the best universities often do not even have the basic knowledge of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School, as well as a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed a training subject, which he considers to be the first of its kind.
Inspired by the creation of a new learning object for him, the impact of sleep deprivation on learning was created after the intervention.
"At the end of the day, a girl came to me and asked, "Why are you telling me this only now that I'm in my last class?"
She discovered that no one had ever explained to her how important sleep is — which surprised me, he told the Telegraph.
This year, for the first time, I present the subject of study, providing students with basic information on how good sleep habits contribute to achievements in education and sport, as well as improve overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the executive director of the university’s health services, informed that the university decided to introduce a course of study after learning that students were suffering from a serious lack of sleep during the week of study.
The hour-long training process includes a series of interactive tasks.
One of the parts is the picture of the door of the commune, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, sports shoes and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how performance in sport affects sleep deprivation and how important gu is.
In another section, students are informed about how long-term lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
Then the student city map with interactive icons invites participants to rethink their daily routine.
"We know that this will not immediately change the behaviour of students.
But we believe that they have the right to know, just as you have the right to know how smoking cigarettes will affect your health,” added Professor <0xC4><0x8C>eislers.
He said that a culture that prides itself on the ability to learn all night still exists, and added that modern technology and the ever-growing pressure on students meant that lack of sleep became an increasingly serious problem.
He explained that enough quality sleep should be the student's "hidden weapon" to combat stress, overwork and anxiety, and even to prevent weight gain, because lack of sleep switches the brain to starving mode.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian studying chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Chaisler develop the subject of study after attending one of his lectures last year, Harvard's first course.
He said that the subject of the study was opened to his eyes and inspired to make the course accessible to the whole of the student city.
He hopes that the next step will be a request for students who obtain postgraduate education to learn a similar program before going to enjoy the competition.
Professor <0xC4><0x8C>eislers advises students to install a moderator not only for the time when they get up, but also when going to bed, as well as keep in mind how people are harmed by the "blue lights" emitted by the screens of electronic devices and LED lamps, as they can break the lights around the clock.
"Livingston" 1 - 0 "Rangers": Meng Gates by Jerry's Viruses
The Rangers visited another sad game in the guests when Dolly Menga hit Steven Gerrard (Steven Gerrard's awkward team decision 1-0 to a loss against Livingston).
The Ibrox team had hoped to win the first win in the run-up to the 4:1 victory of St Johnstone since February, but the team of Gary Holt gave Gerard his second loss in 18 games, since he has become the manager of the club in the team."
Menga put the ball in the gates seven minutes before the end of the half-hour, and the Rangers' lack of inspiration did not seem in any way after an attempt to equalize the result.
The Rangers fall to sixth place, while Livingston ranks third, and in terms of the gate difference it is surpassed only by the Hibernian.
And "Rangers" can be another problem, because the assistant judge Kalum Spence (Calum Spence) needed medical help due to the head injury, apparently caused by the far-flung object.
Gerald made eight changes to his team, which quickly left behind Ayr, reaching the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, used the same Livingston 11 players who took the Hearts one point last week, and he would be happy as his well-trained team suppresses opponents in each episode.
It is possible that Rangers managed the ball more often, but Livingston better used what was their action.
They were supposed to get the goal two minutes after the start when Meng's first game sent Scott Pittman towards the goal of Allan McGregor, but the center player misses his big chance.
At the time, the long-distance Keaghan Jacobs reached Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner Alan Lithgow was able to send the ball only to the far back pole.
The Rangers took control, but the impression was that the game was expected in the last third rather than the expectation that it would happen.
Alfredo Morelos (Alfredo Morelos) undoubtedly felt that he should have taken a penalty shootout in the 15th minute after he was upset by Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thompson (Steven Thomson) rejected the verdict.
The Rangers made only two touchdowns in the first half, but the former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was not particularly upset, neither Lasana Kulibali (Lassana Coulibaly) hit with the head, nor the southern Ovi Ejaria (Ovie Ejaria) attacked.
While the 34-minute start of Livingston may have changed the course of the game, no one can deny that they had already deserved it for their efforts.
The Rangers once again failed to cope with Jacobs' planned long-term combination.
Scott Arfield didn't respond when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his balance and chose Meng for a simple finish.
In the interruption, Kulibali was replaced by Ryan Kent, and this almost immediately affected the game, as the midfielder sent the ball to Morelos, but the impressive Kellie from his line immediately shots to block.
However, Livingston continued to let guests play as they liked, Litgov and Halket performing one long siege after another.
Holt's team would have been able to continue the lead in the final stage, but McGregor played well by stopping Jacobs before Litgovs had a head-to-head kick from the corner.
Rangers' replacement Glenn Middleton later in the game demanded another penalty shootout after being saddened by Jacobs, but Tomson's request was ignored again.
Almanahs: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our Sunday Morning almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today... some day in Germany was born Johannes Wilhelm "Hanss" Geigers, who grew up to be a physicist.
Geigers developed a method for radioactivity determination and measurement, as a result, in the end, there was a device known as a Geiger counter.
The Geiger counter, which has taken its place in science and has survived, has also taken its place in pop culture, such as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado" (Coronado Bells), in which the main roles were played by an outsider and a convincing cowboy.
The man: "What the fuck is this?"
Rogers: "This is a Geiger counter used to find radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you'll be able to hear how atoms that are emitted because of the radioactivity created by these minerals work."
Evans: "Really, it's really a bird!"
"Hanss" Geigers died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
However, the invention named after him continues to live on.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" evil cells.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" evil cells and kill them
Vaccine therapy teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells as part of therapy
With this method, immune cells are obtained from the patient, which are transformed in the laboratory
Then they would be able to "see" the protein, which is characteristic of many malignant tumors, and will be injected back into the body
The test vaccine shows promising results for patients with various types of malignant tumours.
One woman who was treated with a vaccine that taught the immune system to recognize malignant cells experienced that her ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method involves obtaining from the cells of the immune system of the patient, transforming them in the laboratory so that they can "see" the protein HER2 characteristic of several tumors, and then injecting these cells back into the body.
The U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, Professor Jay Berzofsky, informed: "Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "promotes the growth of several types of malignant tumors," including cancer of the breast, ovaries, lungs and rectum, explained Professor Berzovskis.
A similar approach, when the patient obtains the cells of the immune system, which he "started" to attack the cells of the malignant tumor, has been affected in the case of one type of leukemia.
Kanje West after visiting SNL, dressed in a MAGA hat, attacked critics of Trump.
It didn't end well
Kanje West was dragged out of the studio during the Saturday Night Live show after an independent performance in which he celebrated U.S. President Donald Trump and announced that he would run for president in 2020.
After finishing his third song last night, titled "Ghost Town", during which he wore a "Make America Great" hat, he began to barter loud phrases about Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"So many times when I talk to white people, they ask, "How do you like Trump? He's a racist!"
Well, if I was worried about racism, then I would have long abandoned America," he said.
"Saturday Night Live" began with a parody with Matt Damon in the lead role in which the Hollywood star made fun of the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh in the Senate Judiciary Committee on Christiane Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, material with Vest’s pitiful social networks was uploaded by comedian Chris Rock.
It is not clear whether Rox was trying to make the Vesta look like this.
And the West was also pitiful to the viewers for having behaved poorly against him in the backyard because of his headaches.
"They made me laugh in the backyard!
They said, "Don't go out there with that hat on your head!"
They made me laugh!
And they also said that I have lost connection to reality," West said, according to the Washington Examiner.
Vest continued, “Gribat see what happens when you lose your connection to reality?” and promised to pull on “your Superman siege” because that means you can’t tell me what to do. Want the world to move forward?
“Try to love!”
"Variety" reported that his comments caused the spectators' whispers at least twice, but the members of the show team looked confused, and at least one person told the press release: "The studio was in complete silence."
The bride had been invited at the last minute to replace singer Arianna Grande, who had died a few days ago, a friend of rapper Max Miller.
The Vest composed many with a song (I Love It), which he performed in a champagne bottle costume.
The vest was supported by the leader of the conservative TPUSA group, Kandace Turner, who wrote on Twitter: "To one of the strongest people in the spirit: Patience, who does not reach the heart!"
But the head of the talk show, Karen Hunter, wrote on Twitter that the West was simply "what he is, and that's wonderful."
"But I will choose not to reward a person (by buying his music or clothes, or by supporting his 'art'), who, I believe, supports and vilifies with an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
And so do we," she added.
Earlier on the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he has now become a "being previously known as Kanji Vestu".
He is not the first artist to change his name, and acts like Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper Snoop Dogg used to be Snoop Lion, and, of course, not the music legend Prince, changed his name to a symbol, but then to "the stage artist who was formerly known as Prince".
Accused in an assassination attempt for colliding in a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was found in a restaurant east of Belfast on Friday.
Police reported that the incident took place in Ballihackamory (Ballyhackamore).
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast Magistrate's Court on Monday.
The charges will be examined by the Public Prosecution Service.
"The Game of Dreams" star Kits Heringtons turns against toxic masculinity
Kitts Herington is known as the sword-drawing John Snovs in HBO's cruel medieval fantasy series "Game of Thrones".
However, the 31-year-old actor has turned against the stereotype of a brutal hero, saying that such characters on the screen often make young boys think that they need to be strong to be respected.
In a conversation with The Sunday Times Culture, Kits explained that he thought he had "made a problem" and asked how to deal with toxic masculinity in the <0x23>MeToo era.
Kitt, who recently married his "Game of Thrones" partner Rose Leslie, also 31 years old, acknowledged that this problem is important to him.
"I can't think about what mistakes we've made with masculinity right now," he said.
"What do we teach young men in terms of this problem when they grow up, given the existing problem?"
Kits believes that television with its very masculine characters may be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity.
He continued, "Who is born, but who is taught?
What is taught on TV and in the streets that makes young boys feel that they need to be the ones to be perceived as men?
I think this is one of the most important issues of our time: how can we change it?
Because there are clearly problems with the young men.’
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not participate in any sequel to "Game of Thrones" or gadget, after the series ends next summer, stressing that "the battlefields and horses have become dormant".
Starting in November, Kits will play the main role in the revamped Sam Shepard's "True West", which is the story of the film's producer and his brother the thief.
The actor recently admitted that he considers his meeting with his wife Rose to be the best thing that happened to him as a result of the "Game of Thrones".
"I met my wife at this show, as it in itself provided my last year's family and my life from that moment," he said.
Rose Emmy Award-winning fantasy series was played by the second character John Snow's beloved Igriti.
The couple divorced in June 2018 on the property of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has reported that the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS has risen by 14%.
Health officials report that more than 820,000 people have been affected in the country.
About 40 000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the new cases were the result of sexual intercourse, suggesting changes.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of transfusion of infected blood.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has fallen to almost zero, Chinese health officials told a conference in the Yunnan province.
However, from year to year, the number of people living in China with HIV and AIDS has increased to 100,000.
HIV transmission as a result of sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality in China was decriminalised in 1997, but it is said that discrimination against LGBT people is common.
Taking into account the conservative values of the state, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have had sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the cases of transmission of sexually transmitted diseases are the result of insufficiently protected sex in this relationship.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged universal availability of HIV medicines as part of measures to address the problem.
Maxine Voters denies that the employee leaked the data of Republican senators, axioms aimed at "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
U.S. House of Representatives Maxine Waters on Saturday denied allegations that a staff member of her staff had published the personal information of three U.S. Republican senators on Wikipedia's lawmakers' websites.
The Los Angeles Democrats argued that the claims were spread by the "ultra-right" wing press and websites.
"Lies, lies, and even more vicious lies," Voters said in a statement on Twitter.
It is reported that the leaked information includes residence addresses and telephone numbers belonging to U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, as well as Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch from J<0xC5><0xAB>ta.
The information appeared online on Thursday, published by an unidentified person from Congress, during a Senate group hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct by Supreme Court-appointed Breta Kaveno.
The leak occurred some time after the three senators had exhausted Kaveno.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the origin of the records was linked to the Voters’ Cabinet, and disclosed information about Voters’ staff, Hills said.
"This unjustified claim is absolutely false and completely false!" said Votersa.
"My staff member whose identity, personal information and security has been compromised due to this fraudulent and inaccurate claim is in no way responsible for the leakage of information.
This unfounded claim is absolutely false and completely untrue!"
Voters’ statement soon sparked criticism online, including the criticism of the former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This is an angry denial," Fleisher wrote.
"This leads to the conclusion that her temperament does not match a member of Congress.
When a person is accused of what he has not done, that person must not be angry.
He mustn't be a soldier.
He may not make a statement on the grounds of the defendant.
He has to be calm and framed."
Fleisher's task was to compare Voters' reaction to the Democratic fall of Judge Kaveno, who was accused of overreaction at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is running to get Voters to lose the midterm elections, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Great, if it's true," he wrote.
In its statement, Votersa informed that her cabinet had warned the responsible officials and law enforcement bodies of these fraudulent allegations.
"We will make sure that the culprits are discovered," she continued, "and that they will be held legally responsible for all their work, which is destructive and dangerous to any of my staff."
"Johnny Anglis 3" review — Rovan Atkinson's parody of spy movies left in the half
It has become a habit to search for associations with Brexit in every new film with a British accent, and this also seems to apply to the one who has revived, Johnny English's show-stopping adventure. "The 2011 comedy rebooted with the Anglo-D.
Is the toothbrush on itself, on how obviously hopeless we are, a new export opportunity for our nation?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny Anglim, with his handsome eyes and his unusually moving face, has the right to create a nest after a second revival—his name more than any other signifies that he is in the realm of a wide spectrum of comics, which is a character that comes out.
He is, of course, the stupid secret agent who, despite his strange claims of intriguing sophistication, is a little quiet, a little Mr. Bean, and a salt-smelling guy in the cast of the ceremonies of the one who plays the notes of the 2012 "Chariots of the Olimpia" in London.
He is also based on a traveller and an international, incomprehensible character, which Atkinson once imagined in now-forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials, in which he left chaos in his way.
There are at least one or two nice moments in Johnny England’s newest adventure.
I liked the place where Johnny Anglis goes on a helicopter dressed in medieval weapons, and the propeller blades are flashing against his helmet for a moment.
Atkinson's ability to visually create a comical impression is well visible, but the humor is rather weak and strangely superficial, especially because "serious" movie brands such as "007" and "The Impossible Mission" themselves confidently use comedy as their own.
Humor creates the impression that it is dedicated to children rather than adults, and in my opinion Johnny England's absurd licks are not as creative and purposeful as Atkinson's meme film tricks in Bin's Eye.
As usual, it is all based on the fact that the UK has become a serious contingent.
The cyberhacker has hacked into the UK’s super-secret spy network, revealing the identities of all British agents in this area, as an unpleasant active agent – the unfortunate role of little Kevin Eldon.
This is the last straw for the prime minister, the pomposa and the person who has already lost all political popularity: Emma Tomsone is doing what she can, with Teresa Maya-like characters, but there is not much to work with in the scenario.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that, since all the active spies have been revealed, she will have to invite someone who has already retired.
And this man is the ruthless Johnny Anglis, who now works as a teacher in a fine educational institution, and is taught to obey the rules of working as a secret agent (another fun joke) because Anglis offers to learn the spy profession from the very foundations.
Anglis is taken back to an emergency meeting in Vaithol and is joined by his once-in-a-lifetime hard-hit assistant, Bo, who also plays Ben Miller (Ben Miller).
Bo is now a married man, married to an underwater commander, a funny character that only becomes important at the end of the film — a role in which Vicki Pepperdine is not fully exploited.
And it is now that Batman and Robin have returned to allow a huge mistake while serving in the secret service of Her Majesty and meet the beautiful fateful woman Ophelia Bulletova portrayed by Olga Kirilenko (Olga Kurylenko).
In the meantime, the prime ministers have been dangerously scuttled by the charismatic technology billionaire, the evil Jason Volt, portrayed by Jake Lacy, and he claims to be able to solve Britain's computer cage.
Anglis and Bo begin their forestry fun odyssey: disguised as officiants, they set fire to a fine French restaurant; they create a conflagration secretly entering a Volta luxury yacht; and Anglis causes absolute chaos in a voluptuous interlude, attempting to exploit the virtual reality in a finite way.
All possible endings are made, but no matter how attractive and crazy the film is, it has a lot of elements of children's television.
Lots of moderate elements.
As in the case of other Johnny English films, I can’t help but wonder if the British film industry could not give Rovan Atkinson a role that would take full advantage of his talent?
Labor Party denies plans that the UK will work four days a week, but will receive a salary in five days
Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour Party, is about to discuss a radical plan that would allow the British to work four days a week, while earning a salary of five.
It is reported that the party wants the managers of enterprises with the help of the artificial intelligence revolution to be granted to the workers saved by granting them another holiday.
In this case, employees will be able to enjoy a three-day week-long weekend while receiving the same pay as before.
Sources say that the idea will "response" the party's agenda in the economy, and plans to change the economy for the benefit of the workers.
The transition to a four-day working week has been supported by the Trades Union Congress, which believes that this is an opportunity for workers to benefit from changes in the economy.
One of the top representatives of the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: "It is expected that policy changes will be announced by the end of this year.
"This will not happen in one day, but the four-day working week is an idea that meets the party's goal of balancing the economy for the benefit of the working people, as well as the party's overall strategy in industry."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, because the Green Party promised to introduce a four-day working week already in the 2017 general election campaign.
However, the Labour Party as such does not currently support this hunger.
The Labour Party representative informed: "Four-day working weeks are not part of the party's policy, and the party does not consider it."
Cabinet Minister John McDonnell used a labor conference last week to give an opening to his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr Macdonella explained that he was committed to withdrawing power from the "mass of directors" and the "speculators" of the public service company.
The plan of the Cabinet of Ministers also means that the existing average shareholders in water companies may not be able to recover their entire package, as the Labour government could implement the "deduction" due to the injustice allowed.
He also approved plans to include working company boards and create exclusive Ownership Funds to allocate 10% of private-sector company capital to employees who would receive up to <0xC2><0xA3>500 in dividends each year.
Lindsey Grems and John Kennedy respond "60 Minutes" to whether the FIB investigation into Kaveno's case could change their mind
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Justice Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court by at least one week, and raises the question of whether the office's findings could leave a Republican behind.
In an interview on Sunday, the 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley interviewed Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham about whether the FIB could reveal something that would cost him a living.
Kennedy left a more open person's impression than his colleague from South Carolina, who was a member of the United States.
'Yes, of course, 'Kennedy replied.
"I said, referring to the hearing procedure, I said that I spoke with Judge Kaveno.
I called him after it happened, when the indictment became known, and I asked, "Did you do it?"
He was determined, direct and unequivocal."
However, Grema's vote is apparently smeared in stone.
"I have made a decision on Bret Kaveno, and a gruesome accusation will be needed," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know what: Brett resolutely denied it," Grems added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of her names were able to confirm it.
The event is 36 years old.
I don't think there's any change to be expected."
What is the World Citizens’ Festival and has it done anything to alleviate poverty?
This Saturday, in New York City, will be the World Citizens’ Festival, an annual music event attended by an impressive number of stars and with an equally impressive mission: to reduce poverty in the world.
This is the seventh year of the festival, tens of thousands of people will attend the World Citizens' Festival, who will gather in the Central Park Grand Canyon not only to enjoy the performances of the event, such as the events of the year of Janet Jackson, the events of the year of the Battersea, the references of the Cardi B (Cardi B) and the exhibition of the Sean Mendesa.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is an event set up by the international advocacy group Global Poverty Project, which hopes to end poverty by attracting more and more people who are actively fighting poverty.
In order to receive a free ticket for this event (unless there was a desire to pay for a VIP ticket), the concert visitors had to perform a series of tasks or "actions", such as doing a volunteer job, sending an e-mail to someone who understands, or sending an e-mail to the world leader, doing so.
But how successful has the "Global Citizen" movement been, whose goal has yet to be achieved for another 12 years?
Is the idea of awarding a free concert a good way to convince people to act, or is it just another case of so-called “clickism” when people really think they can influence what by signing an online petition or sending a Twitter message?
The Global Citizen movement claims that it has registered more than 19 million "activities" from its supporters since 2011, in an effort to achieve a variety of goals.
It informs that these actions have helped world leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion that will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group recalled 390 commitments and notifications resulting from its activities for which at least US$10 billion has already been paid out or financed.
The group estimates that the funds allocated so far have directly affected nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key commitments include "The Power of Nutrition" — a UK-based investor-implementer partnership committed to "helping children grow up fully" by vowing to provide Rwanda with $35 million to pay more than $00 on Twitter to help it end its underachievers in the country.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, governments of other countries and citizens of the world like you, we can leave behind the undervalued social injustices in the history of nutrition," it said at its April 2018 concert in London.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 measures were launched, calling on the UK government to provide mothers and children with better nutrition, the government announced funding for the Power of Nutrition project, which will provide nutrition for 5 million women and children.
Answering one of the most frequently asked questions on your website — “What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?”
"Global Citizen" commented: "It will be a long and long journey where we will fall short and fail for moments.
However, just as the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us have done so, we will also be successful because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are some of the artists who will perform at this year's event in New York, led by Deborah-Lee Farnese.
U.S. could use war fleet to "block" Russia's energy exports, says Interior Minister
“If necessary, Washington can use its war fleet to prevent the entry of Russian energy into the market, including in the Middle East,” said U.S. Interior Minister Ryan Zinke, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s activities in Syria, especially in places where it operates as part of a legitimate government call, were an opportunity to explore new energy markets.
"I think the reason it's in the Middle East is because it wants to supply energy in the same way that it does in Eastern Europe, in southern Europe," he said.
And, in the opinion of the official, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States, through its war fleet, can make sure that the seaways are open and, if necessary, block them so that Russia can not put its energy into the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the audience who had come to attend an event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that calls itself the "voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approach to resolving the situation between Russia and Iran, pointing out that they are actually the same.
"The economic potential of Iran and Russia is more or less the use and substitution of fuel," he said, while referring to Russia as a country whose economy depends mainly on fossil fuels.
It is further claimed that the Trump administration is promoting the export of liquefied natural gas to Europe, thus replacing Russia with the much cheaper options for consumers in Europe.
For this reason, Trump administration officials and US President Donald Trump himself are trying to convince Germany to stand out from the "unappropriate" Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which, according to Trump, would make Berlin "dependent" on Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the US$11 billion Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which would double the existing gas pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin believes that Washington's fierce resistance project is simply based on economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"In my opinion, we agree that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose a supplier," it said after a September meeting in Moscow with U.S. Energy Minister Riku Periu.
The United States has expressed its negative stance against Germany, which has reaffirmed its involvement in the project.
Germany’s leading industry organisation, the German Federation of Industry (BDI), has called on the United States to refrain from engaging in EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I would feel a big problem if a third country interferes with our energy supply," German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin said after a recent meeting with German Industry Federation (BDI) leader Dieters Kempfs.
Senator Elizabeth Voren of Massachusetts will seriously consider her candidacy for the 2020 presidential election
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Voren announced on Saturday that she is seriously considering running for president after the midterm elections.
During the House meeting in Holioka, Massachusetts, Vorena confirmed that she was considering running for president.
"It's time for Washington to have women who are "saved" by the incomplete government, which also means women-presidents," her words are reflected in The Hill newspaper.
"After November 6, I will carefully consider my candidacy for the U.S. presidential election."
During the House session, Voren referred to President Donald Trump, saying that he "led this country in the wrong direction".
“I’m deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Vorena has openly criticised Trump and his appointed Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kaveno.
In a Twitter post on Friday, Voren said: "Of course, before the election, FIB investigation is needed."
However, a poll published on Thursday revealed that a majority of Voren's supporters do not believe that she should run for the 2020 election.
According to the results of a poll by the Boston Globe’s Center for Political Studies at Sufolk University, fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts’ “possible” voters said the senator should not run for election.
Thirty-two percent supported such a decision.
The results of the survey revealed that more support had been received by former governor Devals Patrick, receiving 38 percent for the candidacy election and 48 percent against.
In connection with the possible candidacy for the 2020 election, the names of former Vice President Joe Baiden and former Vermont Senator Barney Sanders appear in the high-profile Democratic Party.
The Associated Press reported that Baidens is committed to making an official decision by January.
S<0xC4><0x81>ra Peilina quotes Trek Peilina PTSS Donald Trump
Treks Peilins (26) spent a year in Iraq after being called to the military in September.
On Monday evening, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
"What my own son goes through, what he goes through after his return, I can refer to other families who face the consequences of PTSD and a certain amount of vulnerability with which our soldiers return," she told the audience Donald Trump's Myth.
Peilina called his arrest a "obvious problem that everyone pretends to be invisible" and said to her son and other war veterans that "they're coming back a little bit differently, they're going to go to war, they're going to go to war, they're going to be arrested, they're going to go to jail, they're going to come back, they're going to jail."
According to Dean Benet, a representative of the Vasile police department, he was arrested on Monday in Vasile, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against women and possession of weapons while in a state of emergency.
18 states, District of Columbia met a challenge for a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support the legal challenge of a new U.S. policy that prevents asylum for victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives of these 18 states and the District of Columbia presented a brief statement to the court advisor in Washington on Friday to support an asylum seeker who will face the hurdles created by the policy, reports NBC News.
The full name of the applicant, Grace v. Sessions, which the American Civil Liberties Union launched in August against federal politics, is not disclosed.
She claimed that her partner "and the sons of her violent gang member" abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her request for asylum on July 20.
She has been arrested in Texas.
State attorneys who supported Greis described Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large proportion of U.S. asylum seekers come, as countries where the problem is spread by gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy changed the 2014 decision of the Immigrant Appeals Council, which allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to seek asylum.
On Friday, Colombian District Attorney General Karl Racin announced that the new policy "ignores the national, federal and international laws that have been put in place for decades".
"Federal law provides that all applications for asylum are dealt with on the basis of the facts and circumstances of the claim in question, and such an obstacle violates this principle," the court advisor said in a brief statement.
In addition, the lawyer said in his statement that a policy that prevents immigrants from entering the country is detrimental to the U.S. economy, as these immigrants are likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary workforce".
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions addressed immigration judges with a request to no longer grant asylum to victims of domestic violence fleeing and gang-rape misconduct who were fleeing the country.
"Refugee is available to persons who abandon their homeland due to persecution or fears related to their race, religion, nationality, belonging to a particular social group or political views," Sesson said in a June 11 policy statement.
Asylum has never been designed to solve all the problems, even all the serious problems, that people face every day all over the world.
Efforts to rescue Palu, doubling the number of survivors in the search process
For the survivors, the situation was getting worse.
"The situation is very tense," said 35-year-old Riza Kusuma, calming her feverish baby in the evacuation center of the outcast city of Palu.
"For a minute, the emergency medical service is bringing in new victims.
Clean water is deficient."
The inhabitants were visible as they returned to their destroyed homes and washed away their lost possessions in the water, trying to save all that was found.
In some cases, people were injured and hospitals that had suffered a magnitude 7.5 earthquake were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who had a broken spine and shoulder, were lying outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients were taken care of outside due to unrelenting strong post-mortems.
When she opened her eyes, she remembered how a powerful earthquake began to shake the hotel room on the fifth floor, where he was with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save.
I seem to have been pushed to the wall," Harry told the Associated Press news agency, noting that his family had come to the city for the wedding.
“I call my wife for help, but then there was silence.
I don’t know what happened to him or my child.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of Attempts to Intimidate China Using Propaganda Ads
A week after the official Chinese newspaper came up with a four-page advertisement every day, emphasizing the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to an annex paid for by the China Daily in the state's best-selling newspaper, the Des Moines Register, accusing China of trying to interfere in the November 6 U.S. Congressional elections, but China rejected it.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the US election marked what U.S. officials told Reuters, namely that it was a new stage in Washington's growing campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is perfectly normal for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently experiencing an increasing trade war, as a result of which they apply a series of tariffs to each other's imports.
At the start of the trade war, China's repressive tariffs were aimed at exporters in states such as Aiova, which supported the Trump Republican Party, Chinese and US experts said.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and former long-term governor of Aiova, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said that Beijing has hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote his opinion to the Sunday edition of the Des Moines Register, stating that China "is now doubling this intimidation by placing advertisements in our own free press."
“In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government uses for its benefit America’s so important freedom of speech and free press tradition by placing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, here in the usual news kiosk in Beijing you will find a limited number of different opinions and you will not see such a true reflection of the different opinions that the Chinese people may have in common with the Chinese people," the Chinese economic trajectory, the Chinese economic trajectory, was quoted as saying in the newspaper.
He argued that "one of China's most influential newspapers avoided publishing" his article, however, he did not mention which newspaper it was.
Analysts warn of Republicans who are discouraging women’s constituents from the midterm elections involving the Kaveno scandal
As many leading Republicans support and defend the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, against whom several allegations of sexual violence have been made, analysts have warned that in the upcoming midterm elections, they will experience a negative outcome, etc.
The emotions associated with it have been extremely high, and it can be seen that the majority of Republicans have already been ready to give their voice back.
Such matters cannot be reversed, "proclaimed by Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the University of Syracuse, Maxwell School of Science, in a Saturday article in The Hill.
Rieher doubts that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s last-minute call to conduct an FIB investigation will be a good enough reason to reassure angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday. They will not forget it tomorrow or November, too," according to the newspaper "Washington, D.C." on Friday said Karine Jean-Pierre — a senior adviser to the progressive movement "MoveOn".
On Friday morning, protesters in the Senate hall chanted "November is coming!" when Republicans, headed by the Judicial Committee, chose to continue with Kaveno's candidacy in spite of Dr. Christine Blaseja Fords.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be at a very high level," independent political analyst Stu Rothenberg told the news portal.
"People say it's already at a high level, that's right.
But it could be even higher, especially among suburban volatile voters and younger voters (aged 18 to 29), who often don't go to the election even if the president doesn't like it."
Even before Ford's public testimony, in which she made allegations of sexual violence on the part of a Supreme Court candidate, analysts mentioned the potential failure if Republicans continued to run for office.
"It has become a vicious chaos for the Republican Party," Michael Steele, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News earlier this week.
"It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote, or whether Kaveno will be convicted, it's also about how the Republicans have dealt with this situation and how they have dealt with him," Guy Cecil told the news channel, according to a reporter.
However, it seems that the Americans have been a little bit divided in terms of who to believe after Ford and Kaveno's testimony, a little more inclined to believe the latter.
A new YouGov survey shows that 41 percent of respondents are certain or mostly inclined to believe in Ford's testimony, while 35 percent say they are certain or mostly inclined to believe in Kaveno's testimony.
In addition, 38 per cent claimed that Kaveno may or may not have been a liar about his testimony, while only 30 per cent said the same about Ford.
The Guardian reported that, following Fleik’s encouragement, the FIB is currently investigating Ford’s allegations and at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez.
Last week, Ford testified to the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kaveno had committed a sexual assault at the age of 17.
Ramireza claims that the candidate for the post of Supreme Court judge during his studies in Jail in the 1980s at a party has shown her her genitalia.
Global Web Inventor Plans to Launch a New Internet to Take Over Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, a global web inventor, is launching a project that could compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend "Inrupt" is a company based on the open-source platform "Solid".
"Solid" allows users to choose where to store their data and what people are allowed to access some information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Kinders-Lee joked that Inrupt's hidden intention was to "dominate the world".
"We have to do it now," he said of the startup.
"This is a historic moment."
The application uses "Solid" technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data storage" or PTD.
It may include contact lists, work lists, a calendar, a music library, as well as other personal and professional tools.
It’s as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available simultaneously in one browser.
The storage of personal online data is unique in that only the user determines who and what type of information can access.
This is known as the "Personal Permissions to Use Data".
According to company manager John Bruce, the idea of "Inrupt" is to provide the company with the resources, processes and appropriate skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently operates a security platform acquired by IBM, a number of outsourcing developers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer encoders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to build their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Björners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether to implement a complete change, completely overturning all of their business models in one night.
"We didn't get his permission."
The platform's "Medium" article, published Saturday by Kinders-Lee, said that "Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on a solid basis".
In 1994, Beerners-Lee transformed the Internet by establishing a Global Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Bärnersam-Lee has had an influential view in the discussions on net neutrality.
Even after the launch of "Inrupt" B<0xC4><0x93>rnerss-L<0xC4><0xAB> will remain the founder and director of the Global Web Consortium, the Global Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm really optimistic about this new era of the web," Bärners-Lee said.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of the Cross of Victoria awarded to the clergy during World War I
For 100 years in its hometown, an event has been celebrated when the only clergyman of the Church of England has received the Victoria Cross during World War I as a fighter.
The Honourable Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vens received this award on 29 September 1918 in connection with the attack on Bellenglis and Lehaukort.
However, four days later he was killed by a sniper, so he also did not know about the highest British military award he had won.
At a Saturday show in Raschden, Northamptonshire, she discovered a gemstone dedicated to him.
One of his nobility, Michael Vann, mentioned that it was "extremely symbolic" that such a stone was discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather had received a significant award.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Vens led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through the great fires caused by very thick fog and large-scale and bulkhead fires."
Later he rushed to the firing line and with the utmost certainty led this line forward before the takeover of the bulky zone, where three groups were brought in.
Captain Venus was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 —just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vens (72) said that his grandfather's actions were "something I would never be able to do, and which at the same time is also a very humble act".
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also left the stage after the show with the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vens said he felt "glorified by participating in this show" and argued that "the true value of the hero is demonstrated by the support of many people".
MMA fans waited for Bellator 206 all night, but instead waited for C<0xC5><0xAB>cinu Pepu
Imagine that you spent up all night to see the Bellator 206, but at the end you are denied viewing this main event.
In San Jose, 13 matches were included, including six on the main map, which were broadcast live throughout the night on Channel 5 in the United Kingdom.
At 6:00 a.m., when Gegard Musasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to stand up against each other, the UK audience was unsatisfactoryly surprised by the switch to C<0xC5><0xAB>cinu Pepu.
Some were in real misunderstanding when they had stayed awake all night until the early morning, waiting for a fight.
One fan on Twitter described the switch to a children's cartoon as a "failing joke".
"The government has determined that after 6.00 p.m., such content is not acceptable, so there was a switch to the broadcast to the children's program," explained Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communication.
"Cut Pepa," "yes."
Bellator President Scott Coker said he would be working on scheduling so that future viewers in the UK could see these broadcasts.
“When we think about rebroadcasting, I think we’ll be able to sort it out,” Cocker said.
"But it's six o'clock there on Sunday morning, and we won't be able to solve this problem until Sunday after our time and Monday after their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, a lot of texts appeared after the switchover, and they were not positive.
We tried to fix it because we thought it was a technical mistake.
But it wasn't. It was controlled by the government.
I can promise you that next time there will be no such problem.
We will stick to five fights instead of six (as it has been so far). We tried to please the fans, but we made a percentage.
It’s a failed situation.”
"Desert Island Discs": Tom Daley didn't feel good enough for his sexuality
Olympic nigger Tom Daley claims that he has grown up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality, but that motivates him to succeed.
The 24-year-old man did not realize that "not everyone is like me" until he started attending high school.
While attending the first Radio 4 program "Desert Island Discs" directed by Lauren Laverne, he mentioned that he began talking about gay rights in order to give "hope" to others.
He also mentioned that becoming a parent made him less concerned about winning at the Olympic Games.
The permanent head of the long-term programme, Kirsty Young, has been on leave for several months due to illness.
While appearing to be excluded from society in Laverne's first program, Daley said that growing to feel "less valuable" than others because "it is not accepted in society that girls and boys can be liked".
He said: "Until today the feeling that I'm not as good as others or that I'm different has been the main engine that gave me the strength and stamina to succeed."
He said that we wanted to prove that there was "something" to keep people from hoping when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The double winner of the Olympic bronze medal has become the leader of the high-level LGBT campaign and used his appearance at this year’s Friendship Games in Australia, calling for even more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he decided to talk to the public because he felt happy that he was able to live openly and without complications, and wanted to give "hope" to others.
The three-time world champion said that falling in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, "surprisingly unprepared".
Dale was married to 20-year-old Oscar winners last year, and claimed that the age difference was never an obstacle.
"When you went through so much at such a young age" (his first Olympic Games was at the age of 14, and his father died of cancer three years later), it is difficult to find someone at your age who would have experienced similar peaks and falls.
The couple became parents to their son, Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley claimed that his "whole outlook" had changed.
"Before the year, all that was important to me was getting a gold medal," he said.
"You know what? There are more important things in life than the Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son Robert has the same name as his father, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Dale said his father didn't want to accept that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked Dale about was whether they had tickets to the 2012 London Olympics, where he wanted to be in the first row.
"I couldn't tell him that she would no longer be found in the first line," he said.
"I held his hand until he stopped breathing, and only when he actually stopped breathing and was dead, I finally recognized that he wasn't invincible," he said.
In the following year, Daley participated in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
"I just knew that's what I've been dreaming of all my life - getting in front of the hosts at the Olympics. There was no better feeling about it," he said.
It also inspired the choice of his first song — Heather Small's "Proud", which resonated with him on his way to the Olympic Games achievements and still snarled in the zosad.
The program "Desert Island Discs" on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11.15am British summer time.
What is the best way to get rid of this disease?
American Phil Mickelson will set a record by playing his 47th Raider Cup match on Sunday, but he will need to change his strategy to avoid a failed turn of events.
In addition to being a member of the National Football League (NFL) and the National Football League (NFL) and the National Football League (NFL), the National Football League (NFL) is a national football team (NFL) and the National Football League (NFL).
Instead of being in the center of action, as it has so often been associated with U.S. teams, the fifth-round winner divided his day, acting both as a supporter and participating in his game with the hope of fixing what impedes him.
Since a 48-year-old golfer has never been the most accurate player even at the top of his career, he is not the most suitable candidate for a tight fight at Le Golf National on an uneven field, where inaccurate strikes are regularly punished.
And if the game itself is not scary enough, Michaelson will fight in Sunday's ninth match with the exact British open championship winner Francesco Molinari, who has joined forces in this match against young Tommy Flettwood (Tommy).
If the Americans who are behind by four points, starting 12 one-game matches, successfully take the lead, then Michaelson's matches could prove to be crucial.
The furiks without exaggerating expressed confidence about his team member.
"He was fully aware of his role today, spread his hand over my back, applied his hand to me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furiks said.
"He's very confident about himself.
He is an excellent athlete who has given so much to these teams in the past and also this week.
I don't think I could have imagined him playing in two games.
I imagined more, but everything changed the way it changed, and we're going to be counting on it.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else."
Mikelson will break the record for Nick Faldo in connection with the most played matches in the Raider Cup match on Sunday.
This could mark the end of Raider’s cup wrestling career, which has never really come across his individual record heights.
Mikelson has won 18 victories, 20 losses and seven indistinguishable games, although Furiks claimed that his presence gave the team certain intangible benefits.
"He's funny, sarcastic and astute, he likes to have fun with people, and he's a great teammate," he explained.
"In my opinion, the youngest players liked to kick their ass this week, which was fun to watch.
He gives a lot more than just a game."
European select captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a significant rise in leadership can quickly be elucidated.
The captain of the European team, Thomas Bjorns, knows from experience that a significant lead in the fight for the Raider Cup in the last few days can easily turn into an unpleasant situation.
Denmark debuted in the 1997 games in Valderrama, where the team of opponents, captain of Seve Ballesteros (Seve Ballesteros) won five points over the Americans, but only now came to the finish line with a very small 1<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 point lead, i.e. a 2–1 victory with 14 points.
"You keep reminding yourself that we were significantly out of control in Valderrama; we were out of control in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but only with a little extra weight," said Bjorns, "golfing in the golf course with a little excess."
In this way, history will show both to me and to every member of its team that nothing has ended.
Tomorrow you will give everything back to yourself.
Go to the field and show your best performance!
It will not stop until the points obtained on the screen are visible.
Our goal is to win this trophy and we will also focus on it.
I've always said that I'm focused on the 12 players that are on our side, but we're very well aware of what the other side is up against us - the best players in the world."
When he was relieved by the performance of his players on the golf course, Bjorn said: “I was never happy about the early days.
Tomorrow there are new challenges ahead.
Tomorrow is intended for individual games, and it is a completely different matter.
It’s great to have a partner next to you when everything goes well, but your golfer’s skills are fully tested in individual games.
This message you have to pass on to your players, that is, that they in the next days in the game give themselves back everything.
Now you're leaving your partner, and he should go and show his best performance."
Unlike Bjorn's opponents, captain Jim Furiks will try to show his players their best performance in the individual games, not in the partner games. The exception is only Jordan Spieth (Jordan Spieth) and Justin Thomas from the Point (Thomas Justin).
Furiks himself has won both of these important last-day tournaments – both as part of the winning team in Brooklyn and later in a fierce defeat when the European teams achieved sensational success, later known as the Miracle at Medinah in the golf world.
"I remember every damned word," he said in response to how Ben Crenshaw, captain of the 1999 team, put his players together for the final day's fight.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you would like to get to the quick start you experienced in Brooklyn, the one you experienced in Medina right away.
When such a pulse is transmitted in one direction, it causes a great deal of pressure in relation to mid-stage games.
We created our own composition and sarinded the guys in the way we wanted them to. Let's try to do some magic tomorrow."
Tomas had been given the task of trying to lead the attack, and he included Rory McIlroy for the main game and Europeans Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Fletcher Ram (Jon Rahm), Pomwood Rahm.
"I've snarled the guys in this order because I think it's the best fit for the tournament," Bjorns said of the selected single-player players.
Re-delaying of the German new fleet into service
The German fleet's newest frigate was due to be put into service in 2014, thus replacing the aging Cold War-era fleets, but it will not happen until at least next year due to faulty systems and rising costs, it reported.
Baden-Württemberg frigate-class main vessel "Rheinland-Pfalz" has now been put into service until the first half of 2019, it is reported in the newspaper "Die Zeit", citing a representative of the military field.
The ship was supposed to join the car fleet in 2014, but unpleasant post-delivery problems affected the fate of the ambitious project.
Four Baden-Württemberg-class ships ordered by the car fleet in 2007 will be replaced by outdated Bremen-class frigates.
They are expected to be equipped with a powerful bulkhead, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some covert technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signals.
Other essential features include longer maintenance periods – it should be possible to deploy new frigates up to two years away from the ports where they are registered.
However, a continuous delay means that the latest technology fleet, which would allow Germany to demonstrate its power in overseas countries, is already outdated by the time it comes into operation, Die Zeit notes.
The failed F125 frigate last year was visible in all headlines when the German fleet officially refused to put the ships into service and sent it back to the shipyard Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
This was the first time that the fleet returned it back to the shipyard after the ship was delivered.
Little was known about the reasons for this step, but the German media mentioned several significant "software and equipment defects" that would render the warship useless if it were used in combat missions.
Software deficiencies were a particularly significant factor, as Baden-Württemberg-class ships are operated by a large crew of about 120 sailors, which is only half of the senior Bremen-class frigate personnel.
It has also been shown that the ship is too heavy, which reduces its performance and limits the car fleet’s ability to make its improvements in the future.
It is believed that the 7000-ton Rhineland-Palatinate is twice as heavy as the same class of ships used by Germany during World War II.
In addition to faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project (including crew training) also became a significant problem.
Its costs are said to have reached <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion instead of the <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion originally planned.
The problems associated with the new frigates are becoming particularly important given the recent warnings that German naval forces are declining.
Earlier this year Hans-Peter Bartels, the chairman of the German Parliamentary Defence Committee, acknowledged that the car fleet was indeed "starting to run out of usable ships".
The official claimed that over time, this problem has been significantly hampered, as old ships are being taken out of operation, but no new ones are being delivered instead.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Württemberg-class frigates had joined the car fleet.
The National Trust listens to the life of the secret twins.
The new study, which is being conducted in some Scottish highlands property, is aimed at discovering how beetles use the landscape in the process of food search.
The findings are expected to introduce new clarification on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and to help protect them in the future.
Scientists of the Scottish National Trust in the Invereves Gardens in Westeros will study turkeys, pygmy turkey turkeys, as well as brown turkeys and water nocturnal turkeys.
In the main locations of the property, special recorders will be placed, which will track the activities of the biking during the whole season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
Sound experts will analyse all recordings to determine the frequency of bells and which species carry out specific activities.
After that, a biotope map and report will be developed to create a detailed view of the landscape, which reflects the behavior of ribbons.
NTS Nature Conservation Advisor Rob Dewar hopes that the results will reveal which biotope areas are most important to the beetle and how each species uses them.
This information will help to identify the benefits of biotope management, such as grassland development, and how forests can best be preserved for snails and other related species.
Over the last 100 years, the population of squirrels in Scotland and the United Kingdom has contracted significantly.
This land is endangered by construction and development works affecting the loss of the hideout and habitat of the skeletons.
Wind generators and lighting can also pose a risk, as can musk paper and chemical treatments for some building materials, as well as attacks on cats.
In fact, the belts are not blind.
However, due to the habits of their domestic hunting, their ears during hunting are more useful than the eyes.
They use a complex support-location method to find insects and obstacles in the trajectory of their flight.
The NTS, which is responsible for over 270 historic buildings, 38 significant gardens and 76,000 hectares of land maintenance across the country, takes the problem of sewage very seriously.
The organisation has at its disposal ten trained experts who regularly carry out surveys, inspections of the skeletons and sometimes even rescue work.
The organisation has even set up the first and only Threave reserve in Scotland, owned by Damfries and Galvey, where eight of the ten species of squirrels are found in Scotland.
Property manager David Thompson (David Thompson) claims that this area is ideally suited for squirrels.
"It's a great place for squirrels," he said.
"We have old buildings, many old trees and a suitable biotope in general.
However, there are still quite a few things that we don't know about squirrels, so the work we do here and in other specialties will help us better understand what they need to survive."
He stresses that before carrying out the maintenance work it is important to check whether the ribbons will not settle in the place concerned, because it may happen that as a result of the unintentional destruction of one of the maternal shelters, up to 400 populations are killed by the locals and their offspring, thus, possibly, all.
Squirrels are protected animals and must not be killed, tortured, disturbed or destroyed in their cages.
An employee of the Scottish Bat Conservation Trust, Elizabeth Ferrell, has called on the public to help out.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about ribbons, and for some of their species we just don't know how they fit."
Ronaldo denies extortion charges by ordering lawyers to sue German magazine in court
Cristiano Ronaldo has condemned the charges against him as "deceptive news" by claiming that people "want to pay attention" using his name, according to the BBC.
His lawyers have been ordered to sue the German news magazine "Der Spiegel", which published these claims in court.
The Portuguese and Turkish football star Juventus is accused of kidnapping American Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
It is alleged that he paid the woman $375,000 to silence her about the incident, it told Der Spiegel on Friday.
A few hours after the statement made by Ronaldo, 33, via Instagram, the online video turned to his 142 million followers, calling this information "deceptive news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they claimed today is fake news," the five-time Ballon d'Or award-winner announced on camera.
"They want to become famous by using my name.
That's normal.
They want to become famous at the expense of my name, it is part of my work.
I am a happy person, and everything is fine," the player added with a smile.
According to information provided by Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are about to sue Der Spiegel for the allegations they have described as "unacceptable reporting on grounds of privacy."
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for "moral damage to an extent consistent with the severity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of the rights of the person in recent years."
The incident occurred in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino suite in Las Vegas, California.
According to documents submitted to the Nevada District Court in Clark County, it is reported that after meeting at the nightclub Ronaldo and Majorga went back to the player's hotel room, where he raped a woman anal.
Majorga claims that after the incident, Ronaldo fell on the road and said that he was "99 per cent "good boy" but fell in the "one per cent" temptation.
According to the information contained in the documents, Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but this happened after a mutual agreement.
Majorga also claims that she went to the police and had been taken photographs of her injuries in the hospital, but later she agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she felt "fear of revenge" and worried about "public humiliation".
A 34-year-old woman claims that she no longer wants to agree to the terms of this agreement because the incident left her with a lasting injury.
At the time of the statements made, Ronaldo was planning to move from Manchester United to Real Madrid, but this summer for 100 million euros he moved to the Italian giant Juventus.
Brexit: UK's 'forever regrettable' loss of automakers
"The United Kingdom will 'forever regret' if it loses its position as the world's leader in automobile manufacturing after Brexit," said Greg Clark, the UK's business secretary.
He is "concerned" by the fact that Toyota UK has announced to the BBC that if the UK leaves the EU without a deal, it will temporarily suspend production at a plant near the Burnaston plant in Darfur.
"We need an agreement," said Mr. Clarke.
The Japanese manufacturer said that delays at the borders in the case of a Brexit without an agreement could put the game at work.
The Burnaston factory, which produces the Toyota models "Auris" and "Avensis", last year produced almost 150,000 cars, of which 90% were exported to other EU Member States.
"I think if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, production at our factory will be halted," said Marvin Cooke, Managing Director of Toyota, Burnaston.
Other UK automakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed concern about leaving the EU without a treaty and how cross-border trade will work.
For example, BMW claims that after Brexit, it will close its mini factory in Oxford for a month.
As the automakers claim, the main concerns are about the endangered supply chain if no agreement is reached after Brexit.
Toyota's production line operates on a time-testing basis, where parts of custom-made cars arrive from both the UK and EU suppliers every 37 minutes.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there could be disruptions at the border that could lead to some delays and shortcomings.
According to the company, Toyota would not be able to keep more than one day's worth of inventory at its factory in Derbyshire, so it would have to stop production.
Mr Klarka said that theresa May's exit plan (Chequers) for future relations with the EU was "precisely calculated to avoid such border checks".
"We need an agreement. We want to reach the best agreement that would allow, as I would say, to benefit not only at the present moment, but also to take advantage of this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4 on Today.
"The commitment to this not only from Toyota, but also from other manufacturers is that we must be able to fully pursue a very successful supply chain strategy."
Toyota was unable to say how long production could be halted, but warned that rising costs would in the long run reduce the competitiveness of the factory and end up jeopardising jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and has been working at the plant as the union's merger coordinator, said his colleagues were increasingly anxious: "From experience, I can say that as soon as a job disappears, it doesn't go away."
The representative of the government said: "We have submitted a precise and reliable plan for our future relations with the EU."
What is the best way to get people to know each other?
Donald Trump's important meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "delayed for another week" as the fight over Supreme Court Justice Bret Kaveno's candidacy continues, the White House reported on Sunday.
Rozenstein oversees special adviser Robert Miller (Robert Mueller), who investigates the interference in the Russian elections, the link between Trump's remedies and Russia, as well as possible non-compliance with the rule of law by the president.
For months, Washington has been worrying about whether Trump will fire the Deputy Attorney General and thus endanger Miller's independence.
At the beginning of this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the registration of negotiations with Trump and the possibility of leaving the president with the 25th amendment.
Rozenstein denied this information.
But last Monday he went to the White House, where there was talk of his resignation.
The meeting with Trump, who was at the UN General Assembly in New York at the time, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said that he "better" would not release Rosenstein, but the meeting was then postponed to avoid a hearing with the Senate Judiciary Committee, which testified both Kaveno and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FIB to conduct a week-long investigation into Kaveno’s allegations, continuing to delay the Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders was on a "Fox News Sunday" visit.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she replied: "The date of the meeting has not yet been postponed, it could be this week or postponed for another week, given all the cases taking place around the Supreme Court.
But we will see that, and I always want to inform the press about the news."
Some reporters dispute this claim: Sanders has not ordered a White House press briefing since 10 September.
When I was a kid, I asked Chris Wallace why.
Sanders said the lack of friction is not related to the dislike of the TV reporter's "fame card", although she added: "I do not deny the fact that they are celebrity cards."
After that, she proposed direct contact between Trump, resulting in increased press interest.
"The president will be involved in more questions and answers than any president before him," she said, adding, without giving any details, "We have been interested in the number."
Sanders claimed that the freezing will still take place, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask the President of the United States questions unreservedly, it is indisputably better than talking to me.
We are trying to do a lot of it, and you see that we have done a lot of it over the last few weeks, and it will happen instead of a press briefing when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions by leaving the White House or by participating in open sessions or press conferences attended by important people.
Individual press conferences are seldom held.
It is possible that the president demonstrated the reason for this in New York this week, casting an uncontrollable and sometimes bizarre expression on the crowd of reporters.
Health Minister writes to EU officials of the Scottish NHS on Brexit-related fears
The Minister of Health has signed a letter to EU officials working at the Scottish National Health Service (NHS) to express their gratitude and wish for resilience after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman's MSP sent the letter less than six months before the United Kingdom's exit from the EU.
The Scottish Government is already committed to covering the costs of permanent status applications for EU citizens who work in its decentralised public services.
In his letter, Framen wrote: "During the summer, negotiations continued between the United Kingdom and the EU on withdrawal, which led to the decisions to be taken this autumn.
However, the UK Government is also preparing for a possible scenario if no agreement is reached.
I know this is a very restless time for you.
Therefore, I would like to stress once again how much I appreciate the involvement of every employee regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from both the EU and beyond provide valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the healthcare service and benefit our cared patients and communities.
Scotland is definitely your home, and we really want you to stay here."
After a head injury, Kristjen Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery
In Tennessee, the defender of the state "Tigers" Kristien Abercrombie (Christion Abercrombie) was performed an emergency surgery after the head injury, which he gained in the Saturday game, with a result of 31-27 in the post "Vanderbilt Commodores".
In the state, head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury was sustained shortly before half-time.
"He came to the side of the line and it said collapsed," said Ridds.
While Abercrombie was on the sidelines, the trainer and medical staff gave him oxygen, then put on the mattresses and transported him for further investigation.
A Tennessee state official told WSMV reporter Chris Harris in Nesville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had been isolated at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center.
Haris added that there is "no information on the type/smell of the injury at the moment", and the Tennessee State team is trying to figure out at what point the injury was sustained.
Abercrombie, a representative of the red shirt, is in his first season after replacing Ilionis for the Tennessee national team.
Before Saturday's game was dropped, he had made a total of five blocks, which in this season made a total of 18.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher state fee when buying property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher state fee when buying property in the United Kingdom, and the additional funds obtained will be used to help homeless people in accordance with the new Tory plan.
Such a step will neutralise Korbin's efforts to attract new voters.
The increased state tax will apply to persons who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
The State Treasury estimates that up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year can be collected to allocate aid to the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher state tax by purchasing property in the United Kingdom and diverting the additional resources obtained to provide assistance to homeless people, the Teresa Meja will announce today.
This step is seen as an attempt to neutralise the efforts of Jeremy Corbyn to attract new voters with pledges to provide housing at more affordable prices and to address the wealthiest part of society.
The increased state tax will be applied to persons and businesses who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, in addition to allocating money earned to the government’s efforts to combat the problem of homeless people.
The premium included in the current state tax, including the application of a higher level of charge introduced two years ago for the purchase of a second home and for the purpose of leasing, could be as high as three per cent.
The State Treasury predicts that such a step can supplement its budget up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of newly built London properties are purchased by non-residents, thus imposing prices and making it difficult for first-time buyers to get to their home.
Many of the rich territory of the country, especially in the capital, have become "spicy cities" due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy was introduced only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a cut in the state fee so that more young people could afford to buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining high real estate prices by digging up the land, but not using it, and urged Ms. Meja to waive the quotas for affordable housing in order to deal with the UK's pro-British home.
Mr Korbina has proposed a number of attractive housing reforms, including a reform of rental control and removal from housing for no reason.
He also wants to give more power to councils for the construction of new housing.
Ms Maya said: "Last year I mentioned that I would use my position as prime minister to restore the UK's dream - that is, every new generation should have a better quality of life.
And that means the ordering of our preferred housing market.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and set up their lives here.
However, it is not true that housing can be purchased just as easily as foreign companies and people who do not live in the United Kingdom, its hard-working UK citizens.
For many, the dream of their home has become too far away, and the harsh homeless problem is still topical."
Jack Ross: "My biggest goal is to lead Scotland"
Sunderland CEO Jack Ross claims that his biggest goal is to become the leader of Scotland at some point in time.
Scott, 42, has taken on the challenge of restoring the Northeastern Club, which currently ranks third in the first league with three points from the top.
This summer he moved to the Stadium of Light after directing St Mirren back to Scotland's premiere last season.
"As a player, I wanted to play for my country.
I got a B cup, and that's all," Ross told the Scottish BBC's Sportsound.
"But I grew up with my father watching Scotland games in Hampden Park, and it has always invited me to come back.
However, such an opportunity would only be shown if I was successful in managing the club."
Rosa's predecessors in charge of the Sunderland Club are Dick Advocaat, David Moijes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Dis Paulo Poijets.
The former chairman of Alloa Athletic claims that there is no feeling of anxiety following in the footsteps of such a large club's recognized leaders, previously rejecting the offers made by Barnsley and Ipswich.
"My successes will now be assessed according to whether I will be able to return this club to the Premiership.
In addition, the company has a large number of companies, including the United States and the United States, which have a large number of companies.
"It will not be an easy task to return to the Premier League, but I will probably believe that I will be here to succeed only when this task is completed."
Ross is only in the third year of his managerial career, having previously worked as a deputy director at Dumbarton and serving a 15-month period as a Hearts coach.
After that he helped the club "Alloa" recover from falling to the third level and in the same season helped "St Mirren" to gain the title of champion.
Ross claims that he feels much more comfortable right now than during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"They were probably true crosses," he recalls, taking responsibility for the Alloa.
“I really believed that leadership was my real calling — a lot more appropriate than playing.
It sounds strange, because I had good success, I was able to live from it and also enjoy certain heights.
However, playing can be difficult.
You have to go through a lot of things every week.
I still feel it due to work-related stress and pressure, but management is my field.
I've always wanted to drive, and now I'm doing it. I feel like I'm in the right place, I haven't felt so good in my whole life."

The survey found that the best time to enjoy the pineapple is at 5.30 p.m. on Saturday evenings
The summer heat wave has caused Britain’s less popular curls to crumble, but it has increased the pressure on the restaurant chains.
The combined data revealed that in July sales of bars and bars had increased by 2.7 per cent, but in restaurants they had decreased by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin, who represents the CGA Business Consulting Agency, which collected the data, said: "Continuous sunshine and England's long-term participation in the World Cup match meant that in July there was a similar trend for the rest of the year, while in July there was a drop in percentage, in July, in June, in June.
Restaurants, whose sales decreased by 1.8 percent in June, experienced an even worse situation in July.
The situation in pubs and bars was the most favorable because they experienced a much larger upside than restaurants experienced a downside.
Food-based bars also suffered from the sun, but not as dramatic as restaurant staff felt.
It seemed that people just wanted to go out for a drink.
The market for liquor in bars and bars increased by 6.6 per cent per month, while the market for food declined by 3 per cent."
RSM leisure and hospitality analyst Paul Newman said: "These results continue the trend seen at the end of April.
Weather conditions and the impact of wide-ranging social or sporting events are the major factors that determine turnover outside the home market.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to struggle, although a drop in sales by 4.8 per cent compared to the corresponding period of the previous year will be particularly painful to the additional constant cost pressure.
With regard to food suppliers in the long and hot summers, it could not have come at the most unsuitable time, and the weather will show whether the more moderate temperature we usually experience in August will provide the much-needed atmosphere."
The total increase in sales among bars and restaurants, including new businesses, reached 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting a decrease in brand sales volume.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, the UK sales supervisor for bars, bars and restaurants, collects and analyses data from the 47 operating groups with a total turnover of more than <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion and is an industry criterion.
Every fifth child has a secret social media account, which it hides from its parents.
The survey reveals that one in five children, some of whom are only 11 years old, has a secret social media account, which they hide from their parents and teachers.
In a survey of 20,000 high school students, a fake Instagram page growth was discovered.
This news has raised concerns about the publication of content of a sexual nature.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a "main" account to show parents.
One in five children, some of whom are only 11 years old, form social media accounts that they hide from adults.
In a survey of 20,000 high school students, it was found that the number of fake profiles on Instagram is rapidly increasing.
This news has raised concerns about the publication of content of a sexual nature.
Twenty percent of the students mentioned that they have a "clean main" account, which is shown to parents, and also private accounts are provided.
A mother who harassed the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter discovered a teenager who encouraged others to snatch her.
A study by Digital Awareness UK and the Independent School Managers’ Conference (HMC) found that 40 percent of 11- to 18-year-old students had two profiles, and only half of them admitted to maintaining private accounts.
HMC head Mike Buchanan said: "It's scary that so many teenagers form online profiles where parents and teachers can't find them."
Eilida Doila will be a "light voice" on the Scottish Board of Athletics
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Board of Athletics as Director without executive powers at the Annual General Meeting of the Board of Directors.
Doila is Scotland's most award-winning indoor and outdoor lightweight, and President Ian Beattie has described this step as a great opportunity for those driven by sport to take advantage of her extensive experience at the international level during her tenure.
"Eilides are given tremendous respect across the Scottish, UK, and global athletic community, and we are confident that Scottish athletics will gain an enormous amount by engaging in their board," he said.
Doyle said: "I want to act as a 'easy voice' and hope that I can really get involved and help drive this sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, thus earning a total of four Olympic gold medals, and is currently a regular BBC pandit, is unable to walk after a transient ischemic shock.
He tweeted: "On this day a month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't go.
Doctors claimed that only time will show if and to what extent I will recover.
It was a terrible job, but I was completely healed, I learned to walk again, and I can already do my workouts today!
Thank you for your inspiring words!”
Views share about breast milk pump advertising that compares mothers to cows
Breast milk pump production company has taken care of shared opinions online in connection with advertising, in which nursing mothers are compared to breastfeeding cows.
In order to mark the release of the so-called "World's First Silent Wearable Breast Pump", consumer technology company "Elvie" releases a sticky message advertisement to demonstrate the freedom that the breastfeeding mother gives.
Four real mothers dance in a wall-filled cow's lap at a song whose words sound like, "Yes, I'm barking myself, but you don't see any tail" and "If you hadn't noticed, they're not barking, they're my breasts."
The message continues: "Submit, send, I am feeding the babies, send, send, I am calling my ladies."
However, the advertisement, published on the company's Facebook page, has called for a wide resonance on the internet.
A video viewed 77,000 times and commented hundreds of times has received shared viewer feedback, and many claim that it highlights the light of the milk industry's "shots".
"Very wrong decision to use cows for product advertising.
Just like us, they have to get pregnant and die in order to produce milk, but their babies are taken away from them a few days after they are born," he wrote.
"Elvie" breast milk pump does not fit into the breast for breastfeeding women (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment states: "I understand that it is traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
But why not use them to advertise breast milk pumps to mothers who can keep their babies?"
There was also the opinion: "The advertisers didn't know what they were doing."
Others defended the advertisement, and some woman admitted that, in her opinion, the song was "fun".
“I think it’s a great idea.
I would buy one if I were still breastfeeding.
The milk sucking made me feel just like a cow.
The advertisement is a little crazy, but I understood its idea.
This is a brilliant product," he wrote.
Another comment states: "It is a fun advertisement, intended for mothers who skim milk (not often in the workplace or in the toilet) and feel like a "goat".
It is not an advertisement that praises or condemns the dairy industry."
At the end of the advertisement, a group of women discovers that they were all dancing with unclad pumps placed in their breasts.
The concept of the campaign is based on the observation that many women who skimp on milk claim to feel like cows.
However, the "Elvie Pump" pump is completely quiet, has no wires and pipes, and it does not fit in the breasts of nursing women, allowing them to move freely, keep babies and even participate in events outside the house.
Anna Balarina (Ana Balarin) partner and creative director of Mother, commented: The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it has deserved a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing parallels between the women who shed milk and the cows, we wanted to pay attention to the shed milk, while demonstrating in an entertaining and understandable way the thrilling sense of freedom that the new pump will carry."
It is not the first time that the "Elvie pump" has entered the center of attention.
In London Fashion Week, the mother of two children appeared on the tongue of Martha Jakubowski watching using this product.
Simtiem migrant children quietly moved to a tent town near the Texas border
The number of children detained by migrants has increased rapidly, although as many people pass through the border every month as before, and in part the harsh rhetoric and policies implemented by the Trump administration have made it difficult for children to be accommodated with sponsors.
Generally, most of the sponsors were also immigrants themselves without documents, fearing that, openly committing to take in a child, it would endanger their ability to stay in the country.
The risk increased in June, when federal officials announced that potential sponsors and other members of their household would have to be allowed to remove fingerprints, and this data would also be passed on to other immigration-related authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs law enforcement official, testified before the congress that the agency has arrested dozens of people who have applied for sponsorship of unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of the arrested persons had not been previously punished.
“Almost 80 percent of the persons who are either sponsors or members of the sponsor household are staying here illegally, and a large proportion of these persons are criminal foreigners.
That’s why we continue to hunt down such people,” Mr Albensa said.
According to the asylum staff, in an effort to speed up the examination of children's cases, officials have introduced new rules that provide that some of them will have to appear in court within a month of detention rather than after 60 days, as the standard had previously envisaged.
Many will use the opportunity of videoconferencing rather than coming in person to defend their legal status before the immigration judge.
Persons who will be considered unsuitable for obtaining release will be quickly expelled.
The longer children are held in detention, the more likely they will become uneasy or depressed, which can lead to violent attacks or attempts to escape, reported in accordance with the information and evidence provided by the asylum workers during the past months.
Lawyers claimed that these concerns will be heightened in larger objects, such as Tornillo, where signs of a child suffering are more often overlooked due to their breadth.
They added that moving children to a tent town, not spending enough time emotionally preparing them or allowing them to say goodbye to friends, could lead to the trauma that many are already struggling with.
Syria urges US, French and Turkish "occupation armies" to immediately withdraw their forces
While attending the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the country’s war has been going on for the eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as the Deputy Prime Minister, claimed that foreign forces were illegally located in Syria in defence of counter-terrorism, and "it will be dealt with accordingly".
"They must resign immediately and without any conditions," he told the Assembly. . . .
Moualems insisted that in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have been forced to leave their homes, "the war on terrorism is almost over".
He announced that Damascus will continue to "fight in the holy war until all Syrian territories are cleared", purged of both terrorist groups and "any foreign military presence".
The United States has deployed some 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs, who are opponents of President Bashar al-Assad.
France has sent more than 1,000 men to this war-torn country.
With regard to the refugee issue, Mr Mualems said conditions were excellent for them to return, and blamed "several Western countries" for the "irrational spread of fears" as a result of which the refugees did not want to return.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate this return," he said.
"These people are politicizing what should only be a humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not receive assistance to restore the country before an agreement on the end of the war is reached between Assad and the opposition.
U.N. diplomats explain that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in Idlib, the last of the dummies, has created an opportunity to step up political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on a province of three million people.
Moualems, however, stressed that the agreement "is set deadlines" and expressed hope that military action will be directed against the jihadists, including fighters from the al-Qaeda-linked group "Jabhat al Nusrah", which "will be destroyed".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura looks forward to convening new committees, which will include government and opposition representatives, the first meetings to draft the post-war Syrian constitution and pave the way for elections.
Moualems set out the conditions for the Syrian state's participation in the committee, stressing that the group's work would be limited to "reviewing the articles of the existing constitution", and warned of interference.
Why Trump will be elected for a second term
From this point of view, Mr Trump will be re-elected in the 2020 election, unless, and for this, many liberal observers may hope, the imposition and scandal will not prejudge his presidency.
And in that case, "it will be the most dramatic end of the presidency ever!"
At the moment, there is no evidence of the viewer’s relaxation.
Since 2014, ratings for CNN's most profitable broadcast have more than doubled, reaching 1.05 million viewers, but MSNBC has nearly tripled, reaching 1.6 million viewers.
Fox News sees 2.4 million viewers in the most profitable broadcasting time, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, Nielsen reports, while MSNBC "The Rachel Maddow Show" (The Rachel Maddow Show) is in the top spot of the final 5 cable channels.
"It's a fire that attracts many people because it's an incomprehensible thing for us," explained Neal Baer, a supporter of ABC's Designated Survivor drama. This drama tells about the secretary of the cabinet who will become the secretary of the cabinet who will become the president after the attack.
Nell Scovell, a comedy writer-veteran and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club, has his own theory.
She remembers a cab ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The leader told her that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
She wanted to know why.
"He said, 'Because he's smearing me,'" said Ms. Scowell.
Chaos is, to some extent, entertaining.
Of course, unlike everything else on TV, news from Washington could determine what will happen with the Rou v. Way's verdict, whether immigrant families will be able to unite, and the state of the global economy.
Ignorance is a glitter that can only be afforded by the most privileged viewers.
And yet it's more than just to be an informed citizen of the post, when at six o'clock watch a panel of experts discuss how Bob Woodward (Bob Woodward) has used unnamed sources of information for his book "Fear", the story of Paul Manafort (Paul Manafort) and the story of a thousand dollars.

When I met Mr. Fleiss a week ago, the weather on the north coast of Kauai was sunny, 80 degrees (<0x7E>27 degrees Celsius), but he was sitting in the rooms, where, without losing sight of the eye, he was watching the MSNBC broadcast, at the same time.
He could not resist, not even when Brett Kavanaugh had to stand before the Senate Judiciary Committee and his future in the Supreme Court threatened to turn around.
"I remember the days when we made all those crazy shows and when people said, 'It's the end of Western civilization,'" Mr Fleis told me.
"I think it's such a joke, but it turns out they were right."

Money from the outside flows into the toughest parliamentary interim election campaigns
It is no wonder that the Pennsylvania 17th Congressional constituency tends to make money thanks to the transformation of the congressional districts, which will result in two existing MEPs fighting for one seat.
This newly reformed nomadic district of Pittsburgh is linked to the Democratic representative Conor Lamb, who won his place in another area in the special election last spring.
Lembs will fight another existing MP, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former Pennsylvania 12th District, which largely overlaps with the new 17th District.
After the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old areas were unconstitutionally divided for the benefit of Republicans, the maps were revised.
Competition in the new 17th district has led to a struggle between the main financial groups of the parties: the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (Democratic Campaign Committee) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (National Republican Campaign Committee).
Lembs became famous in Pennsylvania when, with a slight predominance, the widely-watched March elections to the 18th Congressional District of Pennsylvania were won.
The Republicans had held the seat for more than 10 years, and President Donald Trump won the area by 20 points.
Politicians expect Democrats to have a small surplus.
The U.S. considered the punishment of Salvador for supporting China, but then reconsidered
Diplomats acknowledged that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing without much pressure from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a friendly meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017, and he stayed at a hotel in Panama until the partners came out of the door of the Trump organization’s management team.
Officials of the State Department have decided to withdraw the Heads of United States Diplomatic Mission from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the basis of a "recent decision to no longer recognise Taiwan", its representative, Heather Nauerte, said in a statement in her statement.
However, the sanctions were considered to apply only to El Salvador, which in 2017 received about 140 million dollars from the United States, including drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which would include a reduction in financial assistance and a targeted visa restriction, would be painful for a Central American country where unemployment and homicide levels have reached the highest level.
In the course of internal meetings, North and Central American officials deferred a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity, which would have followed a similar meeting in the past year, which was recognized as a non-immigration effort by the United States.
In mid-September, the country’s top officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, essentially ending the remarks to punish Salvador.
Diplomats informed that Vice President Mike Pence has now decided to attend the conference scheduled in mid-October to show how seriously the administration emphasizes the meeting.
And the three American ambassadors quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new and serious announcements or penalties from Washington.
The White House spokesperson, speaking on behalf of Mr Bolton, refused to provide further information on the debates described by three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to consult in internal negotiations if their anonymity is maintained.
They were confirmed by an external analyst close to the administration, who also spoke on the condition that his anonymity would be preserved.
Studying history <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Another stone in the garden could be the report by Special Prosecutor Robert Miller (Robert Mueller) that Mr Trump may have delayed justice, which has a lot of evidence at its disposal.
It is claimed that Mr Miller will also investigate whether the Trump campaign has secretly cooperated with Russia in its attack on our elections.
If a second party wins Congress, Trump will have to respond to this structure, and possibly also to the jury of his associates, right at the moment when he is already threatening to meet the voters again.
There is a lot of 'but', and I do not claim that the fall of Trump is inevitable or that it will happen with his fellow Europeans.
There are choices that will have to be made for all of us on both sides of the Atlantic, and these choices will show the duration of the fight.
In 1938, the German rulers were ready to revolt against Hitler, if the West had resisted him and supported the Czechs in Munich.
We are exhausted and miss the opportunity to avoid years of prolonged blood suffocation.
History revolves around such turning points, and the unstoppable march of democracy is accelerated or slowed down.
Americans now have to face a number of such turning points.
What will we do if Mr. Trump fires Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, a man who controls the fate of Mr. Miller's investigation?
Rozenstein has had a hard time since it was reported that last year he had proposed secretly to record talks with the president and thought of his ineligibility for office.
Mr Rosenstein argues that the story of The Times is not accurate.
"How can we respond if the FIB's investigation into Bret Kaveno, which has just been requested, is not complete or fair, or if he is confirmed to be a Supreme Court judge despite his dishonest testimony and credible allegations of sexual assault?"
And, most importantly, are we going to vote in the midterm elections of the Congress that will call Trump in charge?
If we do not withstand all these tests, democracy will have a long winter.
However, I believe that everything will work out for us based on what I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew who was sent to Auschwitz by exactly the same Nazi regime as I once had in my embassy.
She survived, emigrated to America and 60 years later sent me to light Sabbath candles on the table with a swastika.
How can I not be optimistic about our future if I have such a legacy?"

Rangers star Graham Dorrans feels optimistic about the fight with Viennese Rapid.
The Rangers will take on Vienna's Rapid on Thursday, knowing that a victory over the Austrians after an impressive undefeated game in Spain with Villarreal earlier this month will allow them to take a stable position to qualify from the European League Group G.
The road injury did not allow centre forward Grem Doransam to re-enter the games of the season until an undisclosed result with 2:2 with "Villarreal", but he believes that "Rangers" can use this result as a trampline to achieve even more.
"We can be happy about it because Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old footballer.
"We went to the game in the hope that we could make good progress, and we got this point.
Perhaps we could have achieved them in the end, but overall there is an honest result.
They were probably better in the first half, but we were better off in the second half and we were a better team.
And Thursday will be another important night for Europe.
Hopefully, we will get three points, but it will not be an easy game, because they got a good result in the previous game, but I am sure that with the help of our supporters we will be able to continue to fight and get good results.
Last year, with all my injuries and changes in the club itself, it was obviously hard, but now I can see new news, which I feel good about.
The team is great and the guys enjoy it; the training is good.
I hope that we will be able to continue the fight, leave last season behind and achieve success."
Women can’t sleep because they’re worried about their pension savings.
Although the survey participants clearly knew what kind of care they wanted to receive, there were few who had discussed this issue with family members.
About half of individuals in a nationwide study indicated that they do not talk to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they had talked about it with their children.
"People want to be taken care of by family members, but they don't do anything to pronounce it," says Holly Snyder, vice president of the State Life Insurance Agency.
Here's what we should start with.
Talk to a married friend and your children. You can not prepare your family for the fact that you will need care if you do not make your wishes known already well in advance.
Collaborate with your consultant and family to decide where and how to get care, as these choices can be an important factor in determining costs.
Involve your financial advisor. Your consultant can also help you figure out how to cover these costs.
Your options to provide long-term care funding may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid insurance policy with the amount of money to cover these costs, or insurance through your estate — the main thing to have money.
Develop your own legal documents. Prevent legal battles even before they start.
Discuss the health issues of the authorized person so that you are a reliable person who will monitor your health care and ensure the actions of the specialists according to your wishes, if you are unable to express them in your own strength.
Consider also the possibility of granting powers in respect of finances.
Choose a reliable person to make financial decisions on your behalf, who will take care of the payment of your bills if you are unable to do so on your own.
And don't forget the seemingly detailed details! Imagine that one of your experienced parents is being taken to the hospital to get immediate help.
Will you practice answering questions about medicines and allergies?
Indicate these facts in a written plan so that such a situation does not surpass you.
"It's not just about the finances, it's also about who's the doctor," said Martina.
"What are the medicines used?
Who will take care of the dog?
Take care that such a plan is drawn up."

Earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia
According to government information, a powerful earthquake and tsunami that visited the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday has killed at least 384 people. The number of casualties is expected to increase.
Due to devastated communications, the rescuers were unable to obtain any information from the Dongal (Donggala) area, which is located north of Palu and is close to the 7.5-magnitude strong earthquake epicenter.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu after a devastating natural disaster.
Here is the basic information about Palu and Dongal, located on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi and is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi. It is estimated that in 2017 there lived 379 800 people.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when an earthquake and tsunami erupted.
Dongal is an area that stretches about 300 km (180 miles) along the northwest coast of the island of Sulawesi.
It is estimated that 299,200 people lived in the area, which is part of the province’s administrative region, in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the economic backbone of the Central Sulawesi Province, especially in the coastal area of Dongal.
Nickel mining also plays an important role in the province, but it is mainly concentrated in Morowali (Morowali), on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Prevention Agency, Palu and Dongala have suffered several tsunamis over the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of buildings in the Dongal.
Cunami also gassed across the western part of the Dongal in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the seismically active Pacific fire ring, in which earthquakes occur regularly.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A powerful earthquake off the west coast of Aceh province in northern Sumatra on 26 December caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coastline, more than half of whom were in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Some people died on the island of Nia, on the shores of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude strong earthquake erupted in Java, Indonesia’s most populous southern island, resulting in a tsunami that hit the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake erupted near the city of Padang, the capital of the western province of Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake hit one of the Mentawai Islands off the coast of Sumatra, causing tsunami waves up to 10 meters high, which swept out dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: An Earthquake neared the surface visited the Pidie Jaya area of Aceh, causing distress and panic, as it reminded of the destruction brought with it by the devastating 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time the tsunami did not occur, but more than 100 people were killed in the collapsed buildings.
2018: Severe earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mainly in the north of the island.
Earthquakes buried thousands of buildings, and temporarily prevented hundreds of tourists from returning home.
Sarah Peilina’s eldest son arrested after being charged with domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice-presidential candidate Sara Peilin, has been arrested for being charged with the attack.
According to a report issued by the Alaska State Troopers on Saturday, a 29-year-old Peilin, who lives in Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence and resistance to arrest.
According to a police report, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police to report on what she claimed to be the crimes that took place, he took her the phone.
Peilin has been detained by Mat-Su in the pre-trial detention facility and has been given $500 in large security funds, KTUU reports.
He stood before the court on Saturday, where, when asked whether he pleaded guilty, he declared that he was "certainly not guilty".
Peilin has been charged with three Class A offences, for which he can be sentenced to a year in prison and a fine of $250,000.
He is also charged with a Class B violation, which can be penalized for a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
It is not the first time that charges have been brought against Peilin in criminal offences.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father Todd Peilin.
His mother Sarah Peilina called the police and reported that the attack had occurred.
This case is currently being examined in the Alaska Veterans Court.
In 2016, she was accused of domestic violence, the deterrence of the report on domestic violence and the use of weapons in the context of the incident.
His girlfriend claims that he got into it with a sneeze on his face.
In 2016, veterans groups criticized S<0xC3><0xA1>ra Peilina for her son’s violent behavior in connection with post-traumatic stress syndrome after returning from service in Iraq.
Tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds of people killed
At least 384 people have died after the earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
A magnitude 7.5 earthquake caused the tsunami and has displaced thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been eroded and the number of victims is expected to increase in the coming days.
The quake erupted near the central part of Sulawesi, southeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
In social networks, videos are distributed showing the moment of the collision.
When a tsunami hit the shores, a gentleman had gathered at the beach festival in Palu.
Federal prosecutors want to demand the rarely used death penalty for a person suspected of a terrorist act in the city of New York
Federal prosecutors want to demand the execution of Saijfullo Saifov (Sayfullo Saipov), who is being held in custody on suspicion of an act of terror in New York City when eight people were killed. This is a rare form of punishment in the state.
It is alleged that the 30-year-old Saipov used Home Depot rental cars to attack a motorway along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, where he killed pedestrians in his way.
In order to justify the execution of the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious injury, as it is mentioned in the statement of intent to request the death penalty.
According to the court document, it is possible to sentence the death penalty in both cases.
Within weeks of the attack, the Federal Grand Jury accepted an indictment on Saipov's charge in 22 indictments, which included eight charges of murder for the purpose of extortion, which federal prosecutors usually use for transportation and do not use for motoring in organized crime cases, as well.
The attack required "considerable planning and prior intent", prosecutors explained, alleging that Saipova's attack was "horrendous, ruthless and inhumane".

Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been ten years since prosecutors of the Southern District Court of New York have carried out an indictment in a case where the death penalty can be imposed.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was tried for the murder of two drug suppliers, but was sentenced to life imprisonment in the end of 2009, when he was sentenced to life in prison.
The death penalty was last executed in the New York federal case in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were sentenced to death on charges of involvement in espionage for the Soviet Union's first war effort.
Rozenberg's death sentence in an electric chair was executed on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, in the course of days and months, the Uzbekistan-born Saipov did not regret the attack.
As reported by the police, he informed investigators that he felt good about what he had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov told officials that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS video on his phone.
Police said he had also asked for permission to place the ISIS flag in his chamber.
He has rejected 22 indictments in the article.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders who represents Saipova, said he was "still naturally dissatisfied" with the indictment's decision.
"We believe that the intention to demand the death penalty rather than to accept guilt in exchange for life imprisonment without the right to release will only prolong the ongoing injury caused to all parties involved," Patons said.
A team of Saipova defenders has previously called on prosecutors not to ask for the death penalty.
Conservative MP declares that the lead of Brexit negotiations should be entrusted to NAID<0xC5><0xBD>EL FAR<0xC4><0x81><0xC5><0xBE>
During the protest, Najeel Faraz promised at a conservative conference today to "mobilize the People's Army".
The former leader of the UK Independent Party said that politicians should feel the anger of Eurosceptics when one of Teresa Maya's MEPs suggested that negotiations with the EU should be entrusted to him.
Peter Bone, a member of the Conservative Party, told the Birmingham march that Britain would have long since been Brexit minister if Farage had been a minister.
However, the challenge that Ms. Meja will face in trying to reconcile her contradictory party was demonstrated by conservatives who support the EU's withdrawal and joined a separate city protest against Brexit.
The Prime Minister is struggling to maintain his compromise plan for the future of UK-EU relations (the Chequers compromise) and to feel the attacks of those who want to leave the EU, of those who want to stay in the EU, and also of the EU itself.
She insisted that she would be determined to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the negative reaction, and would make Eurosceptics and liberals choose between her offer and "chaos".
Mr Bouna's "Leave Means Leave" in the Solihull myth, announced that he wanted to throw Mea's plan in the manure (to chuck Checkers).
He proposed to make Mr Farage an ally and to entrust him with the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been at the saying, we'd have already run out," Bouns said.
A Member of Parliament from Velingboro (Wellingborough) added: "I will support Brexit, but we must throw the Maya plan into the fertiliser!"
In justifying his opposition to the EU, he said: "We didn't fight to be cockroaches!
We want to adopt our laws in our own country!”
Mr Bouna ignored the assumption that public opinion could have changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their mind and want to stay in the EU is absolutely untrue."
Andrea Jenkyns, a supporter of Brexit, also attended the march and told reporters: "I'm just saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The Chequers plan is not a public favorite, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular with our party and our supporters, who actually do all the work and choose us.
Please give up the Chequers and start listening."
In a message addressed to May, she added: "Prime Ministers remain in their place when they fulfill their promises."
Mr Farage said the politicians in the myth should feel pressure if they threaten to fail to comply with the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
“Now it’s a question of trust between us — the people — and our politicians,” he said.
"They're trying to hand over Brexit and we're here today to tell them we won't let them do it."
In his message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to let our politicians, who are planning to hand over Brexit, feel the pressure.
"We will call on the people of this country, who have allowed us to win the fight for Brexit, and we will never let go until we achieve that we are an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom."
In the meantime, the Palices travelled through Birmingham before a two-hour myth took place in the city centre.
Unknown activists welcomed the Conservatives with Brexit banners after the group's meeting at the end of this week.
The representative of the Workers' Party, Lord Adonis, made fun of the Conservatives about the security issues they experienced with the party's applications at the start of the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they are able to maintain the order of the IT system and all of their technology for Canada and yet, and yet, at an undivided border, for free trade without borders with Ireland," he added.
“This is an absolute farce.
There is no such thing as a successful Brexit," he added.
Warren plans to carefully consider running for president of the United States
Senator Elizabeth Voren says she is "carefully considering" her candidacy for the US presidential election after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that on Saturday, the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future in the town hall of the West Massacre.
Vorena, who frequently criticizes President Donald Trump, is taking part in re-election in November and running against GOP state Republican Geof Dil, who was Trump’s 2016 Massachusetts campaign vice president.
It is speculated that it will be she who will be the main one to run against Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event of Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters using the city hall since Trump took office.
A visitor asked her if she was planning to run for president in the election.
What Voren responded to was that it was time for "women in Washington to 'save' an incomplete government, which also means a woman-president."
In the case of the shooting of LSU basketball player Sims is arrested
Police in Baton Rouge, Los Angeles, on Saturday announced that a suspect was arrested on suspicion of a Friday shooting of LSU basketball player Veida Sims in the case.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced that Daiteons Simpsons, 20 years old, was arrested at 11 a.m. ET press conference.
On Friday, they broadcast the video of the shooting, calling for help in identifying the man in the video.
Sims (20) was shot and killed near the Southern University student town on Friday morning.
"Weid Sims was shot in the head as a result of his immediate death," Police Chief Murphy J. Pols told the press on Saturday, via 247 Sports.
Way to shoot to defend his friend and the Simpsons shot him.
The Simpsons was questioned and he admitted to being at the scene of the accident, with a gun, and also admitted to having shot Way Sims.
Simpson was arrested without resistance and he is in the East Baton Rouge village police station.
A 6-foot junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, the Sims played 32 games with 10 starts last season and playing an average of 17.4 minutes, scoring 5.6 points and winning 2.9 shots in the game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world championship title after the team allows him to beat Sebastian Fetelu.
From the moment Valteri Botas qualified on Saturday before Lewis Hamilton, it became clear that the work of the Mercedes team would play an important role in the races.
From the start, Boots started well and almost left Hamilton in the dry, defending his place in the first two trips and inviting Fetella to attack his teammate.
Fetel was the first to enter the garage and left Hamilton at the engines to cope with the others, which was most likely decisive.
The Mercedes driver filled the circle later and left Fetella, but Hamilton continued to take the lead after a force shift that saw the Ferrari driver incessantly leave the inside free, risking to be left behind after a double-maneuver to defend third.
Max Verstapens started from the back row and at the end of the first round was seventh on his 21st birthday.
After that he was in charge of a large part of the race because he focused on the tires to quickly reach the finish and beat Kimi Raikonen in fourth.
In the end, he arrived in the garage in the 44th round, but was unable to increase the speed in the remaining eight rounds, as Raikonens was fourth.
This is a difficult day, because Valteri did a fantastic job all week long and was a real gentleman.
The team has done an extremely important job to get one to two," Hamilton said.
It was a very bad body language.
President Donald Trump on Saturday slammed Senator Diane Feinstein for not expressing a letter from Christiane Bleusie Ford in which she accused Supreme Court candidate Bret Kaven of sexual misconduct.
While speaking in a myth in West Virginia, the president did not directly speak of Ford's testimony to the Senate Legal Commission, but commented that what happened in the Senate shows that the people there are "evil, awkward and unreliable."
"One that can happen and something beautiful that is already happening in the last days in the Senate, when there is anger, when you see angry, evil, nasty and unreliable people," he said.
"When you read the press releases and leaked information and then they say, 'Oh, no, I didn't.
I didn't do it."
You remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you get the information?
Remember her answer to the question... did you leak the document? — "Ah, ah, what did I do?"
Oh, no.
I didn't do it."
All right, wait a minute.
We did it...No, we didn't do it," he added, in the senator's intonation.
Feinstein received a letter in July explaining in detail what Ford is accusing Kaveno of, and in early September the contents of the letter were revealed, but Feinstein denies that it had happened in her office.
"I don't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I don't "disclosure" her story," Feinstein told the commission, reports The Hill.
"She asked me to keep it confidential and I did, too."
But her rejection did not please the president, who commented on the situation on Saturday night: "I will tell you that it was a very poor body language.
She probably didn't do it, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend a candidate of the Supreme Court, whose three women are accused of sexual misconduct, the president proposed that Democrats use the accusations for their own good.
"They are purposefully aligned,to regain power by any means."
Whether you see evil, chance, they don't care what they hurt, what they have to destroy to gain power and control," the president said.
Elite League: "Dundee Stars" 5:3 "Belfast Giants"
Patrick Dwayne throws two goals for Giant in a game against Dundee
The Dundee Stars played for Friday's loss in the Elites league against the Belfast Giants to win the Saturday's response in a 5:3 Dundee game.
The Giant gained an early predominance when the gates were won by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Bovilliers.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cowney led the landlords before Dwayne re-established the Giant supremacy.

Dwayner made sure that "Giant" regained control at the first opportunity when he won his otros goals in the game tonight in the first period.
The hosts regrouped and Buhards again achieved a matching result with the goal of the force method achieved in the games in 27:37 minutes.

The Giant, who lost four of the five games, will play the next game on Friday, where he will meet at home with the Milton Keynes.
Air traffic controller dies, allowing hundreds of people on the plane to escape during an earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is hailed as a hero after he stabbed himself so that a plane with hundreds of passengers would safely get off the land.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a powerful earthquake rocked the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
In the territory, strong after-growths continue and many are scattered in the dunes of the city of Palu.
However, despite his colleagues saving his life, 21-year-old Antonius Ganav<0xC4><0x81>ns Agungs refused to leave his workplace in the control tower of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu, which was whispering loudly.
He remained in his position to make sure that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, would safely take off in the air.
After that, he pulled out of the traffic control tower, thinking that it might collapse.
He later died in the hospital.
Indonesia’s air navigation representative, Johannes Siraits, said his decision could be to save hundreds of lives, Australian ABC news reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan, Kalimantan, to take it to the largest hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Paula.
"I'm heartbroken to hear it," he added.
Meanwhile, state authorities have been concerned that the number of deaths could reach thousands, the state disaster prevention agency says that access to Dongala, Sigi and Boutangao (Boutong) is limited.
"It's seen to be a beautiful growth, as many more people's bodies are under the mines, and many are not accessible," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the agency's representative.
The waves, which reach a height of 6 meters, eroded Palu, where a mass funeral will take place on Sunday.
Military and commercial aeroplanes continue to provide assistance and necessary goods.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old young mother, told Sky News: "The emergency medical service introduces new victims for one minute.
Clean water is deficient.
Small shops are all over the place."
Jans Gelfands, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is in a hurry to help the survivors, but we don't know what we'll find there.
"It's already a tragedy, but it can all get worse."
On Sunday, Indonesian President Joko Widodo came to Paula and the country's military envoy and said: "I ask you to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
This year, Indonesia was shaken by the earthquake in Lombok, in which more than 550 people died.
Aircraft disaster in Micronesia: Now "Air News" says that one of the people is missing after the plane disaster in the lagoon
The airline carried out a flight during which the plane crashed in the Pacific lagoon of Micronesia and now claims that one of the people has been missing, although previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the crashing plane.
Air News reported in a press release on Saturday afternoon, when they could not be held accountable for one of the passengers — the man.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals, and investigators to find the missing man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests to provide more detailed information about the passenger, such as his age and nationality.
Locals helped rescue other passengers and crew by boat after the plane crashed into the water, trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been hospitalized.
The airline announced that six people remained in the hospital until Saturday, and all of them are in a stable condition.
The reasons for the accident and the sequence of events are still unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy report that the aircraft landed in the lagoon shortly after taking off the runway.
Some eyewitnesses thought that the length of the runway was overestimated on the plane.
The American passenger Bill Jaines said the plane was in a very low position.
"It was really good," said Jaines.
Janet says that he and other passengers were able to get out of the crashing plane by using emergency exits because the water was only to the middle.
He said that the soldiers panicked and yelled, as well as that he had a slight head injury.
U.S. Navy sailors who worked nearby to improve the ship’s port also assisted in rescue operations by using an inflatable boat to transport people to shore before the plane landed about 30 meters (100 ft) underwater.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network show that 111 people have died in PNG-registered airlines over the last twenty years, none associated with Air News.
A psychoanalysis commentator explains the events during the night in which a woman was burned alive
The indictment on Saturday provided evidence rebuffed in the case, where a man is accused of burning a living woman in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice’s psychoanalysis commentator, Paul Rovlets, testified for several hours as an expert in intelligence analysis.
He explained how he used the information obtained from the phone to put together how the 29-year-old accused Quinton Telis and the 19-year-old inmate Jessica Chambers acted the night she died.
Rovlets said he received location data from several phones, indicating that Telis was with Chambers the night of her death, contesting his previous testimony, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his phone was at the time of Chambers, when he claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to interrogate Sanford.
Sanford testified in the courtroom on Saturday that he was not in town that day.
When the indictment asked if Telis was telling the truth, claiming that he was in a Sanford car that night, Sanford said that he " lied because my car was in Nesville."
Another inconsistency was that Telis said that he knew Chambers only about two weeks after his death.
The phone records show that they only know each other for a week.
Rovlet said that shortly after Chambers' death, Telis deleted messages, calls and contact information received from Chambers from his phone.
"He wiped her out of his life," said Heils.
It is envisaged that the defenses will make their closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said that he expected the trial to be handed over to the sworn ones later on the same day.
Group "The High Breed": Who Is Aware of Hip-Hop?
The hip-hop trio wants to challenge negative views on this genre of music, with their music giving a positive message.
"The High Breed," from Bristol, claims that hip-hop has shifted from its beginnings to messages of a political nature and those when addressing problems of a social nature.
The group wants to return to the roots of the genre and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
Artists such as "The Fugees" and "Common" have experienced the recent revival of the UK with such artists as Akala and Lowkey.
It's black again?!
In New York, a granddaughter sued couple for resignation after receiving "racist" news
In New York, a granddaughter sued a couple for discriminatory dismissal after she received a mistaken message from a mother who complained that the granddaughter "is black again."
The couple denies being racist by comparing the court's trial to "compression".
Lindsey Plasko-Flaksman, a mother of two, expressed her disapproval when she learned that the new babysitter, Jezele Mauris, was black when she came to work on the first day of 2016.
"I'm not going to eat, I'm going to eat," Plasko-Flaksman wrote to her husband in a text message.
However, she sent a message not to her husband, but to Maurice, in addition, twice.
Questioning her inaction, the "samulus" of Plasko-Flaksman's resignation to Maurice, indicating that her previous mistress, who was an African-American, had done a bad job and that she had been waiting for the Filipinos, referring to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for her one working day and sent home with Uber.
Now Mauris has filed a lawsuit against the court demanding compensation for his dismissal and wants to receive $350 a day for six months for a job with a secure living, which she initially applied for, and without a contract of employment.
"I want to show them that they don't do such things," she told the Post on Friday, adding "I know it's discrimination."
The pair rejected the allegations that they were racist, claiming that the termination of Maurice's employment was a reasonable decision because they feared that she would not be able to be trusted after she was insulted.
"My wife sent her what she didn't want to say.
She's not racist.
We're not racists," Joel Plasco, the man, said "Post".
"But would you entrust your children to someone you were rude to, even if it was just a mistake?
Your new baby?
Think about it."
The court's hearing compared to "repression", Plasko said that his wife had given birth to a baby just two months ago and was in a very "complicated situation".
"You're really going against someone in this way?
This is not an acceptable action," added the investment banker.
While the trial is still going on, the public's views quickly sued over social networks, denying them of their behavior and logical thinking.
A new letter reveals that Paddington’s book publishers were concerned that readers would not be able to associate with a talking bear
Bond's daughter Karen Jenkel, who was born shortly before the book was confirmed, said of the letter: "It's hard to "put yourself in a shoe" who reads the book for the first time before it's published.
It’s amazing to know now what we know about Paddington’s great achievements.”
When she said that her father, who worked for the BBC before feeling the inspiration to write a book for children about a small toy bear, was optimistic that his work would be rejected. She added that at the wedding ceremony of the publication of the book was the 60th anniversary of "sweet rice"
When talking about Paddington, whom she calls a "very important member of the family", her father quietly prided himself on his possible successes.
"He was a quiet, quiet man and not great," she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was like if you have a child who achieves something: you're proud even if you haven't done it yourself.
I think he looked at Paddington's success in a similar way.
Although it was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, he always allotted all the merits to Paddington himself."
I had to get away from my dying daughter on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was quickly taken to the hospital of Nice Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors constantly struggled for her life.
"Neds called regularly and said it was very bad and she is expected not to survive," said Ednana-Laperuza.
"Then I got a call from Ned saying that she died within the next two minutes and I have to get away from her.
And that's what I did.
I said, "That's it, I love you very much, darling.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs, which doctors gave her to maintain the heartbeat, slowly ceased and left her body.
She would have died even faster, and it's all over now.
I had to sit and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I could not wake up or scream because I would be in a situation where there are families and people around.
I needed a lot of strength to master it."
After all, then already grieving the loss of her daughter, Ednana-Laperuza boarded the plane along with other passengers, who had no idea what she was going through.
"Nobody knew," she said.
"I'm shaking my head down and the tears were flowing all the time.
It's hard to explain, but right on the flight I felt deep compassion for Ned.
That he needs my love and my understanding.
I knew how much he loved him.’
Sitting women attach cards to bridges in order to prevent suicides
Two women, whose loved ones have committed suicide, act to help others not to take their own lives away from them.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Hamfrey reinforce the cards at the Welsh Bridge with inspiring message and phone numbers so that people can call and receive support.
Davis' son Taylor was 13 years old when he started slimming with depression, but he committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parent to have to experience what I do every day,” she said.
Davisa, 45, who lives in Lidnia, said her son was a promising cook with an addictive smile.
"Everybody recognizes him with a smile.
Everyone has always said that his smile "lighted up" always and everywhere."
However, he refused to work before he died, because he was "in a very, very dark place."
In 2014, Taylor's brother, who was 11 years old at the time, was the one who found him after Taylor committed suicide.
Davis said, "I'm constantly worried it'll have consequences."
Davis created the cards, "to make known that there are people you can talk to and talk to, even if it's a friend.
You don’t have to sit quietly — you have to talk.”
Hamfria, who has been a friend of Davis for years, lost Mark, her life partner for 15 years, shortly after his mother’s death.
“He didn’t say that I would feel sad or be depressed or feel any citation,” she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed that his attitude has changed, and he's got a different attitude.
He reached his lowest point on Christmas morning—when the children opened the gifts, he didn’t make eye contact with them or anything like that.”
His death was a great trauma to children, but they have to deal with it: "It's devastating the whole family.
It separates us.
But we all have to continue and fight.”

Breta Kaveno's future hangs in the air as the FBI launches an investigation
"I think if we could really get what he wants — in a time-limited and volume-limited investigation — we might be able to reach a small consensus," Fleiks said on Saturday, adding that he was "apologising" for the party and saying that he was "apologising for the commission."
Why don't Kaveno and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is just a coincidence.
The midterm elections are five weeks away, on November 6 — if, as expected, the Republicans fail, then their attempts will be much weaker to elect a man from among themselves in the Supreme Court.
George W. Bush called the senators, lobbying them to support Kaveno, who worked at the White House during Bush's time, and thanks to him met his wife Ashley, who was President Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI prepares its report?
The vote will take place in the Senate, where 51 seats currently belong to Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kaveno can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Maikam Pensam to cast the vote and approve him in the Supreme Court.
Kim's leadership has "decreased" the number of North Korean political asylum seekers
The number of North Korean political asylum seekers in South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, quoting data from the South Korean merger ministry, said that last year there were 1,127 political asylum seekers, compared to 2011, when their number was 2,706.
The Park said tighter border controls between North Korea and China and high rates of human smugglers are key factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
The majority of political asylum seekers from North Korea are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of it goes through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily guarded Demilitarization Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China's political asylum seekers are considered illegal immigrants and are deported by force.
Relations between North Korea and South Korea, which are still technically at war, have improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss the delayed denuclearisation negotiations.
This happened after a historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when, on large trains, they agreed to cooperate to free the Korean peninsula from nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korea’s Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress in these negotiations.
"If there is no trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our country's security, and under such circumstances we will not be the first to unilaterally disarm," Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Breta Kaveno "hysterical" and claims that he is unsuitable for work in the Supreme Court.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court candidate Bret Kaveno "hysterical" and claimed that he was unsuitable for work at the Supreme Court due to his temperament.
Pelosi made comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't stop thinking that if a woman had behaved like this, they would call her "hysterical," Pelosi said of his reaction to Kaveno's testimony to the Senate Judiciary Commission on Thursday.
Kaveno emotionally denied allegations of sexual harassment to Dr. Kristin Blaise Ford when they were both teenagers.
In his early argument, Kaveno was very emotional, sometimes almost screaming and smoking, talking about his family and high school years.
He, in particular, condemned the Democrats in the commission, calling the accusations against him of the "catastrophic and harmonious destruction" organized by liberals, who are outraged that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that she believes that Kaveno's testimony is the reason that he cannot work for the Supreme Court, because it shows that he has a bilateral attitude towards the Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with such statements and the attitude he has toward Clinton and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi objected when asked if she would try to question Kaveno if he was approved and if the Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I’ll say this — if he doesn’t tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he’s not only fit for office in the Supreme Court, but also to work in the existing workplace,” Pelosi said.
Kaveno is currently a judge in the Washington County Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, he has been concerned about the possibility that Kaveno makes decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Ways, because he is considered a conservative judge.
In his approval negotiations, Kaveno raised questions about whether he would reject the decisions of the Supreme Court.
"It's not a good time for a hysterical and bizarre person to work in court, but we would expect us to happily say, 'Isn't that wonderful?'" said Pelosi.
But women have to hold their hands.
It is a denunciation, for months and years everything has accumulated "over the edges", but she is not allowed to get it all out of herself crying.
"We hear when we're angry," Ms. Steinema told me after 45 years.
"I don't think it's something unusual, what do you think?"
She continued, "Once I was greatly helped by a woman who herself was the manager of a company, who said that she too was crying when she was angry, but developed a technique — when she became angry and began to cry, " I gave it to the person I was talking to.
I'm angry."
And then she kept going.
And I think it's great."
Azaras are only partially recognized as a way of discharging anger, because they are misunderstood on their own grounds.
One of my brightest memories is from the older work, where the male share was expressed, when I once cried out because of inexpressible anger, when I was behind a painfully sneezing older woman — a relentless driver (woman) who I was always afraid of.
"Never let them see that you're rotten!" she told me.
"They don't know you're moving.
They think you're a match, and they're just gonna be glad you managed to "get under your skin."
Patrick Schröder, then the U.S. Democratic Congressman from Colorado, worked with Gerry Hart on his election to the campaign president.
In 1987, when Hart, who was caught in extramarital affairs, dropped the ship, also called "doing the fool" and withdrew from the election, Schröder was deeply disappointed, considering that there is no reason why she could not run for president.
"It wasn't a carefully thought-out decision," she told me smiling 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the election and the last one they wanted was one more.
There were those who called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
She was late in the campaign, she postponed the fundraising and promised that she would not participate in the election unless $2 million was raised.
It was a lost battle.
She revealed that many of her supporters, who donated $1000 to the men's rank representatives, donated only $250 to her.
"Do they think I'm getting discounts?" she wondered.
When she announced in her speech that she would not start a formal campaign, she was very emotional — grateful to the people who supported her, disappointed in the system, which made it very difficult for her to collect money and to "make it very difficult for her to have sex" — to have sex rather than to have sex with her two delegates.
"You'd think I had a nervous breakdown," recalled Schreddere as the press reacted to him.
"You'd think Kleenex was my corporate sponsor."
I remember thinking about what they were going to write on my grave.
"She was crying."
Why the U.S.-China trade war can be beneficial to Beijing
The main concerns about how the U.S.-China trade war began are being hidden and until the fight is over, disagreements between countries can be beneficial to Beijing in the long run, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued a first warning earlier this year by imposing tariffs on key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation began this week with new rates affecting the value of $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion) per unit, immediately charging half of the goods exported to the US from China.
Beijing also responds "welcome" every time, the newest is at a rate of five to ten percent of $60 billion worth of American goods.
China has announced its commitment to respond to the United States one by one, and it is doubtful that in the near future, the world's second-largest economy could go wrong.
In order for Washington to resign, certain demands should be met, but publicly bowing down to the US would be too humiliating for Chinese President Xi Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards correctly, U.S. trade war pressure can positively affect China in the long run, reducing the mutual dependence of the economies of the two countries.
"The fact that a quick political decision was made either in Washington or in Beijing could create uncontrollable economic conditions in any of the countries that are really more dangerous than previously recognized by the observers," said Abigail Greis, a focus on the "New American Security" issue.
Syria is a “gateway” for the repatriation of refugees, the foreign minister said.
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary repatriation of refugees and calls for help in the reconstruction of a country that has been fighting for more than seven years.
Speaking at the United Nations Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid Almualems said that the conditions in the country are improving.
"The situation on the ground is much more stable and safer at the moment, thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to restore the territories destroyed by terrorists to their normal state.
There are all conditions for refugees to return voluntarily to a country that they were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and their earnings.
The United Nations estimates that 5.5 million Syrians have been displaced by the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Six million more people are still living in the country, and they need humanitarian assistance.
Almualems said that the Syrian regime would accept assistance in the reconstruction of the displaced country.
But he stressed that the state would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that helped sponsor the riots.
European golf selection sensationally wins the Raider Cup in Paris
The European golf team won the 2018 Raider Cup, beating the USA with a score of 16.5:10.5 "Le Golf National" outside Paris, France.
The United States has lost six times in a row in Europe and has not won the Raider Cup since 1993.
Europe regained the cup when the team led by the Danish national team, Thomas Bjorn, scored 14.5 points, which was necessary to outperform the US national team.
US star Phil Michaelson, who struggled the whole tournament, got his T-shirt into the water at PAR 3 16th hole while playing Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari played brilliantly in all his stages, becoming one of four players who have ever managed to achieve a 5-0-0 result since 1979, when the tournament is played in its current format.
The American Jordan Spit with 5 to 4 sensationally lost the European teams, according to the rating, the lowest player Torbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The best player in the world, Dastin Johnson, lost 2 against 1 Ian Polter from England, who was probably the last Raider bowl.
Eight Raider Cup veteran, Spanish Serhio Garcia, became the tournament's best player of all time from Europe with 25.5 career points.
"Normally I don't run, but today I can't run the races."
This was a tough year.
I am deeply grateful to Thomas that he raised me up and trusted me.
I am very, very happy that we have regained the cup.
This is a team’s merit and I am happy to be able to help,” Garcia said emotionally after the European selection victory.
He then gives his name to his nationality, John Rama, who on Sunday won the US golf legend Taigeru Woods by 2 against 1 in one game.
"The pride that I would feel in defeating Tiger Woods, I grew up following in the footsteps of this player," said the 23-year-old Rams.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now he has a career record with 13-21-3 in the Raider Cup.
Unusual statistics for one of the best players of all time, who has won 14 top-level golf tournaments, being second behind Jack Niklaus.
The U.S. team struggled all week to find their chances, except for Patrick Ride, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. team captain Jim Furrick, after his team's unsatisfactory performance, said: "I'm proud of the guys they fought.
This morning there was a time when we were able to put a little pressure on the European team.
We're fighting.
All due respect to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All of his 12 players played a very good game.
We will restructure, I will work with the American PGA and US Raider Cup Committee and we will move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I am proud to be their captain.
You have to put on your hats.
We've been defeated."
The latest news about the Red Passion: Concentration decreases in Pinella (Pinella), Manatee (Manatee) and Sarasota (Sarasota)
The latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Committee (FWC) points to a general reduction in the concentration of red fox in the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, flowering plants have been reported in Pine, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier, indicating a decrease in concentration.
The flowering of the red poplar stretches about 130 miles from the North Pine to the coastline of the Southern District.
The plateau is located about 10 miles from the coastal zone of the Hillsborough area, but in some places it takes about a week.
The red flag is also prized in the Pasko area.
Last week reported average concentrations in the area of Pinelas or its coastal zone, low to high concentrations in the coastal zone of the Hilsboro area, small to high concentrations in the vicinity of the area of Manati, low to high concentrations in the area of the area of the sea, low to high concentrations in the area of the sea, low to high concentrations in the area of the Sarasota area, low to high concentrations in the area of the area of the sea.
Irritation of the respiratory system is still reported in the Pinelas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collie areas.
There were no reports of respiratory irritation in Northwest Florida last week.
