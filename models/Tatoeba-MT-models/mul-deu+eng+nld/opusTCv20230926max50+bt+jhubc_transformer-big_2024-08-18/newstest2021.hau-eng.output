That's why I'm out of PDP.
Former President of the Federal Parliament, Yakubu Dogara explained some reasons why he withdrew from the PDP to the APC.
If the former President of the Federal Assembly is not forgotten, Yakubu Dogara is a member of the PDP, he will join the APC this week.
Congara said he was standing in contempt of PDP governor Bala in Bauchi state who helped the party to win the 2019 election, despite his resignation from the party and returned to the APC.
The main reason for this is because the PDP is in power in the state of Bauchi.
Everyone knows the kind of role I played in the state's election to which former Abuja minister Bala Mohammed played the winning governor, Mohammed Abubakar.
And now there is a lot of misunderstanding in the government of Bala.
Instead of staying in the PDP, I was given the option of avoiding a place, going back to where I left off.
Dogara wrote a letter of resignation from the PDP which he sent to the president of his electoral party, Bogoro C, in the state of Bauchi.
Finally, he said that he had to show the other governors where they fought and where they would be repaired in the past, and Bala was not breathed by a stranger.
I'm going to make it possible for them

The incident was reported to have taken place at 10 o'clock in the evening, which took about two hours to eat, despite the fact that the authorities of the Kano State Killing Authority and the security authorities and the city's community had reached the scene.
At the time of Freedom Radio's visit to the site, it was released to the public in a variety of concerns and security departments at either location, being the location of a connection to the major airport known as Kuka Airport, which is the tourist destination from Kano to other states and countries as well.

Freedom Radio has cited other eyewitnesses and eyewitnesses, who say that the rise of the mob has led to the movement of life and life among the public.
A car bomber at the Kofar Wawa port said they had teamed up with the security officials to disperse the suspects who had entered the airport.
The Kano State Fire Department confirmed the incident, saying that by the time we included this report it was continuing to gather information to identify the victims and the loss of the fire caused, as stated by the head of the State Department Muhammad Ibrahim.

QUESTION: We have not yet completed a clinical trial of the drugs included in Nigeria.
While European countries continue to conduct tests on the effectiveness of their Coronavirus treatments, Nigeria is also not left behind when it comes to the prevention and testing of coronaviruses.
The NAFDAC (Nafdac) said it was conducting tests on Coronavirus vaccines until a total of 40 vaccines were administered.
The president of the Mojisola Adeyeye government announced this on Tuesday in Abuja.
Moses said that it is necessary to test the accuracy of the material so that it is not sought in the field.
Since the onset of the coronavirus outbreak, drug addicts have investigated to see more of the disease in the background than to see the combination of the disease.
Many of them gave their medicine to the authorities to test and assess its benefits.
The NAFDAC also outlined some of the requirements and regulations to be followed in the field of medicine.
The quality of the vaccines will be tested in the laboratory for the first time.
Moses warned the physicians not to stop testing a drug without the authority giving it the opportunity.
In May, the NAFDAC announced that social media and newspapers are the only ones seeing reports of terrorists who have detected a vaccine that will cure the Coronavirus.
Adeyeyeye said that even one person had already questioned the NAFDAC's request for a review of the quality of the drug he claimed to have included the vaccine, which he said could cure the coronavirus.
He was a patient, but he didn't know what the cure was.
That he had identified the symptoms of ill health that were seen as signs of infection.
And since then, there have been a number of people who have taken part in the process.
Ramaphosa's face-to-face interrogation of councillors.

Ramaphosa undertook a thorough investigation and also brought about a correction in the area of responsibility for the purchase of COVID-19 war goods.
South Africa has become the fifth-largest country in the world by the coronavirus pandemic, but the president has said the prevention and destruction of the virus plays an important role in the fight against the disease in the country.
On Saturday, the Nigerian Air Force will be deployed.
Authorities in Nigeria have said they will open airports for flights to and from the country, from Saturday to the next, for the first time after five months of shutdown.
Since March 23, the country's government has halted the entry of aircraft, due to the widespread spread of the coronavirus.
The government said the first four aircraft to enter from the country would begin to land in the federal city of Abuja.
Then the city of Lagos, but it is not yet clear where these planes are coming from.
According to the minister of aviation for Syria, the opening step is to see how no crosses have been found since the opening of domestic flights on 8 July.
Sirika, added that it would be ensured that all the principles that should be followed in view of the success of the return of the aircraft were observed.

Marseille also said, Tuni informed the midfielders in preparation for the League 1 tournament, as a result of the three people who suffered from the disease after the first five people died, to get the most out of the case.
APC accuses the government of bringing Tarzoma to the party - Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
In a statement released by the APC, Talatar accused the Neja State Governor, Alhaji Abubakar Sani Bello, of attempting to bring the party to justice.
The letter, signed by the President of the Engineering Party Muhammad Jibrin Imam and the Secretary of the Barista Party Muhammad Liman, stated that, in the six-year period of the state's ruling party, Naira had received only 512 million.
The letter went on to say that a meeting called by the governor of the country's central government, which was held on Sunday night last night, would help to continue to bring the party's roots into the country, where they said they had written to the party's secretary of state what was going on in the hearing.
According to the Imam, "We understand that the Governor of Neja State has tried to divide the party's constituencies by preparing a water-based and middle-level conference, which is not according to the law, for any action being taken against the party's presidents, on a written note to the party's secretary, they follow suit, to withdraw.
He went on to say that in the six years since the establishment of the party, <0xC2><0xA3>512 million is in the party's accounts.
He said what he understood as being the governor of the state's state committee that was set up on July 25, 2020, which the president directed to lead the organization of the problems between the party's leaders and the smuggling of corruption between the parties.
What is the amount of money we receive to pay the salaries of the employees of the party, and other activities that are affected by the party, the election of the party, and the equalization of other problems of the party such as the promotion of health care on the part of the community because of the lack of access to the support of the government, not others?
As I have explained, the last election of the small state government, is the most important election in the country that we have conducted with the former commissioners and commissioners who are now in charge of the executive branch in all of the twenty-fifth and fifth-century government offices in the state.
Therefore, it is wrong for anyone to know which party funds are being killed incorrectly, this is almost unfair and the attempt to protect the poor is an attempt to kill him, which is not a committee to establish an inquiry into how the party's funds are killed and set up.
Of the amount of money that the accused has been deprived of, the money that the party's secretary has given, there is no such money as this one so I challenge everyone on this issue who has brought his testimony to the accused in any way.
What position do we hold on the protection of the APC party from any attempt or group from the party's leadership, adding that any arbitrator on the party or any party president from the state level will be written down by the governing committee of the party (the party's 21) as the party's (party's) system states.
Therefore, the party's watermen and midfielders do not have a playing field, especially if they have attempted to remove the committee's power so that the decision has no effect.
For this reason, they are the privileges of the party presidents to be accredited in the state, pursuant to Article 21 of the Sixth Amendment on page 87 of the party's constitution, whatever happens even this will not be enforced.
You've made a mistake in the decision to choose the president and the president.
He said, those who were presented with the approval of the court in a non-improved meeting, by Alhaji Abubakar Magaji, General Muhammad Garba, and Hon. Ahmed Dogonkoli, even Alhaji Ibrahim Balarabe and all the commissioners, were not members of the party's non-party release committee.
The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination and Inter-party President Mohammed Imam is the only one who will lead him, not the governor who will lead the heads of the state party.
The letter added that Governor Abubakar Sani Bello recalled that the issue of the fulfilment of the contract that you will have with the state nation at the time of the election, and the trip with the parents of the parties in the government as everyone will benefit in the state and all constituents by giving political office, which is the problem of the state and the state.
A letter of congratulations to the members of the federal legislature who are invited to attend the meeting and pay attention to solving all the problems that lie between the members of the party, this is not surprising to the members of the legislature who are aware of their own illness, who are willing to accept it as a violation of the law.
Therefore, there is a need for the chairman of the National Reconnaissance Committee to draw the attention of Governor Abubakar Sani Bello on the role he should play in attempting to undermine state politics.

Experts have made this warning after a study conducted on the quality of the food consumed in the country.

Olasumbu explains that Sindarin Calcium Carbide is the most commonly used chemical in the market in the manufacture of plant products, i.e. fertilizers.
The study showed that the patience and dedication of the market participants in making use of this compound for a single day's supply of wood products.
Olasumbo explained that one of the things that marketers didn't realize was the use of this technology to deliver the vaccine to the health of people who are ill.
For this reason, you have diseases that include diarrhea, eye cancer, intestinal cancer, rabies, kidneys, kidneys, etc.

The U.S. said it was due to investigate Adesina's misdemeanor on the charge, following a wrangling by the AfDB's governing body, a case that led to the establishment of a qualified committee to conduct an investigation into the crime.

It's not the only way to get to the top of the world - Newspapers.
It is the spirit of the life of all creatures, and it is not possible to live without food.
This is the reason why China's sanctions are increasing in order to ensure the richness of the country's food society.
In the 71 years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the country has achieved major successes in terms of food enrichment, giving the world a surprising look at the population of the country which is estimated to have reached 1.4 billion.
This effort has helped to address the particular situation in China that has led to a major global outbreak of famine, such as the fact that Chinese President Zhang Wufeng has never stated that, since 1949, China has been in the process of rising to the present, ever since China has been in the process.
But in recent days, some people and other Western news outlets have again "speak up" on the question of whether China can reclaim its own society in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic around the world?
We are grateful to them for their continued support of the Chinese people in the world.
Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the country achieved the success of producing enough food according to the man's efforts.
The issue of supplying sufficient food to the Sinai is one of the major contributors to the ruling JKS party on a regular basis.
At the end of the previous meeting, the secretary-general of the JKS college, you Chinese president, Xi Jinping gave an important order to stop food preparations, where he stated that, everyone knows that any food shortages and labor difficulties are being encountered.
Although this year's impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has also contributed to China's economy, China can provide enough food for its population.
China's exports of agricultural commodities, especially the amount of commodities that the country will receive this year in 2020, show that, the amount of commodities obtained in the country in the first half of 2020, reached 27.29 million tonnes of coal where it grew to 1.08 million tonnes in 2019, up by 3.9%.
Ke Bingsheng, the former head of China's agricultural industry, said China had achieved great success in the face of the country's richness and food compared to the first time when implementing the intention of making changes at home and opening a cup of tea.
Huang Jikun, China's center for the study of agricultural policy at the University of Beijing, said during a meeting with the China Science Daily's representative, that the severity of the challenge facing China is now in the next two or three years.
Now the number of calories that each person gains exceeds 474 kilograms instead of 400 kilograms that every person in the world should gain every year.
And now China is on the verge of importing millions of tonnes of other agricultural products for domestic animal husbandry only.
Therefore, those who show concern should place their hands on the table, have them go to sleep, or have their hands on the table in their home.
The Chinese are able to feed themselves with the food they produce.
The reason for Ganduje's arrest in court - Abba K. Yusuf - Freedom Radio Nigeria.
Kano Governor's election at PDP Abba Kabir Yusuf explained why Kano Governor Dr. Umar Ganduje and other market participants were re-elected before the state's supreme court.
Abba Kabir said it was, his lawyer, Bashir Tudun, who said it was a decision, on the charge of the owners of other state-owned buildings and the Kano State community benefiting them.
In addition to the governor of Kano and businessmen, Abba Kabir Yusuf also ruled the Department of Services and Housing and Public Schools and the Kano Judicial Commission and the State District Authority.
Abba Kabir Yusuf has accused the Kano State government and the owners of some of the same people as the former Daula hotel which is now under the supervision of the Wudil University of Chemistry and Technology and Shahuci Airport, saying it violated the country's legal system.
Only eligible, on the basis of the delivery system in 2023.
Dan Uwa and the chief trustee of Kasa Muhammadu Buhari, Mamman Daura explained that the reception-reception hall in Nigeria has become the old one now.
Mumman Daura said Nigeria has already made a deal that is now pushing for a more favourable election in 2023.
BBC Hausa has published an interview with Mother Daura, who has made it clear on the inside.
This system of admission to the presidential election in Nigeria did not result in a blind child that was started in 1999.
Instead, Daura said he was very careful about the status quo that he was not entitled to until this acceptance process was followed.
In addition to the Igbo tribes, that is, the Inyamirai gave Daura the answer to his words.
They said that he and his brother-in-law Buhari had withdrawn the roman government by means of bribes and that he would now come out with a recommendation not to do so in 2023.
Buharin himself is not more than all the Nigerians he has been elected.
The same is true of the large security zones in the country that have been living in the past several years without being removed, some of which are less than the others that can work.
Martanin Inyamirai.
A Nigerian presidential political turmoil that did not occur on Wednesday, while the Igbo Zalla, Ndigbo's tribal leader, accused Mamman Daura of violating the Nigerian presidential election for the Inyamurai tribe.
In an interview with Daura, who is the father of President Muhammadu Buhari, he said that the ouster of the presidential election will be held in 2023.
Since the words did not end with the social media, Ningbo was shocked by the release of a message to Mother Daura, which she called for a severe conflict.
In a statement released by Ningbo on Wednesday, the Igbo tribal group will play a role in the South Region, and in the South-Eastern region they will be allowed to run for president in the 2023 election, i.e. the Igbo tribal.
Emeka Attamah, the father of Igbo Zalla, said Mother Daura's words as the words of Nigeria's 2023 presidency to the Igbo tribe.
In addition to human rights, why is Mother Daura not allowed to speak to coal in 2019?
They said they have fired Jonathan, and now Daura is in charge of the southern constituency that will lead Nigeria in the 2023 election.
He has completed his assessment of what has arisen from his brother's current presidency, and will also bring us something we don't know of to receive in 2023.
The truth of the matter is that it is the truth of the matter, and the truth is the truth.
It's not the 2023 presidential election, it's the 2023 presidential election, and it's the will to live.
VOA's discussion is just about to end.
The issue of evacuating women and young children by drowning them became a nightfall in northern Nigeria where reports were received showing how children's rights are being exercised.
People from several provinces attended the meeting on July 23 to discuss how the issue is getting worse in the country and how it should be dealt with.
Her marital status has been linked to issues such as childbearing and other parental concerns.
One of the parents who attended the Hajiya Fathi'a Sha'ibu, the sister of the former governor of Filato and Neja in the time of the tyrannical rule of Sani Abacha, described poverty as one of the factors that make parents vulnerable to their children.
Maryam Nasir, the mother of Nasir, the president of a group that is struggling to combat this disaster, said, "I should first try to educate our parents and women about the possibility of letting their children go for support, because then the child will also go out and be seen until he is injured."
We will also call on Teachers to begin preaching the voice of voices to parents and parents who are doing to their children and their children.
He was also a member of the federal legislature representing Maiyama, Koko and Besse of Kebbi Honourable Shehu Mohammad state, who expressed support for the issue and backing in view of a tough law that would convict all who were arrested for murder in the country.
From the end of Hajiya, Saints David and Nasiru El-hikaya, who led the meeting, expressed their gratitude to those who attended the meeting in exchange for the VOA authority who responded to their invitation.
The 'New Media Writers' Guide to the North Face.
Modern social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, Instagram, Bakandamiya and others, have always played a role in generating conversational moments, connecting with the interaction between different world communities, with the transmission of messages, news, and the spread of political agendas,
Young people in Nigeria have become involved in this new technology by using social media platforms, to travel to the modern world, and don't have the opportunity to share or share their experiences in the fields that affect their lives.
We can say that these initiatives have brought us a lot of benefits and benefits to the young people of the North in terms of business, economics, education and regional politics.
Some eat food by writing letters and sending messages on the web, have received the work done or have grown the work they are conducting.
However, it is a pity to see how some young people instead of using this right to make use of the acquired cigarettes, then others were found following the deportation of the southern children of the country who have fled the world for the sake of public outrage, including the fact that the country is not to be swayed, or to write, or to write.
This is a sign of the inability of young people to live in the country.
The Northern Media Writers' Association in the Country is a great asset, for providing the young people of the North with a good sense of excellence and refinement of the things that young people do in the Median Society, how they will be able to write meaningful scripts and spread the principles of the Northern community.
It has been our duty to give this group the necessary support, in order to achieve its positive goals, which will bring prosperity not only to our northern region, but also to Nigeria itself.
I would advise our young people, especially those who are interested in social media, to come and join us to protect the North and its environment, and to provide a system that will bring benefits to everyone.
Just as our Northern leaders who lay down right-handed like the Sardinians of Sakquato, the First Northern Firms of Sir Ahmadu Bello, and its neighbours aspired to create a Northern community.
It has been said that, Marigayi's bitter war with the tyrannical and poor Night Aminu Kano, has always said that, Nigeria is one country, but everyone knows his father's house!
Therefore, as we call for the development of national security and for the improvement of the interests of travel and government, at every stage, we call for greater unity on the North, without any religious or ethnic background, to bring our region forward.
If we look at the North, it's not the North.
We should, therefore, use God’s principles in providing guidance and counsel, in order to provide the North with a positive way of enriching its economy.
The North should provide financial means of access to the operation of its finances without waiting for the federal government to cut the money.
In addition to the fact that we still love the North, we attach importance to education, agriculture, open-mindedness, health care, and science and technology.
We don't have the money to spend, but there are a number of different ways to do it.
We see that the North will fulfill our hopes!
The North is our pride.
The government has raised $126 billion to repair the country's hospitals.
The federal government has raised <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>126 billion out of the country's economic improvement measures to repair hospitals in the country.
The hospitals to be rehabilitated include FMC hospitals, infectious disease testing sites, the care of emergency care workers, the area that is being identified by pharmacists and non-disabled people to Kamu, and teaching hospitals in 36 states in the country.
In recent years, some health experts have called on the government to mobilize enough funds to improve the health care sector in the country.
This call was made at a conference to ensure the safer health of the people in an easy and done in Abuja.
In response to the statement of the representative of the North Quartet under the auspices of the APC party, Sadiq Umar said the Nigerian government should take important steps to improve the health of the country.
The lack of this has led to the problem of lack of funds, which has led to a high level of trust and support from outside the country.
However, despite the lack of support, the government's role in the health care sector has led to the start of the withdrawal of the support they have received.

How the University of Technology (FUTA) has made efforts to promote the PREMIUM TIMES website on the Internet.
The University of Technology of Akure (FUTA) has taken the burden of a hacker's website entry-level, for the launch of the PREMIUM TIMES website, an online magazine publication based in Nigeria.
This hacker hacked the websites of the internet, made all sorts of messaging scammers on the websites of people following to access their websites, but failed to succeed.
He began attempting to enter the dead, which is "hacking" on February 28, where he hacked the power plant to dismantle the University, and he managed to reach the targets by using the university's "data."
On the one hand, if he tried to connect the PREMIUM TIMES network to his computer, he would also reconnect to a GSM device.
The five-day striker chose to join the Premier League's PREMIUM TIMES website, but failed to win, despite the fact that he used a variety of modern technology technologies.
She was not able to get the infection, because the university did not know that the PREMIUM TIMES newspaper had a program that she had, which built the toilet and the toilet fixtures that a man had not enough to press her.

In the morning he also made every effort to make it through the laptops of the computer to complete the PREMIUM TIMES page one by one.
Here's how to make a difference:
This hacker didn't know that PREMIUM TIMES did not make the claims of the medical body of four or more adults entering the farms of their modern social networking sites to cover the page or page of the hacker.
This lack of knowledge is the reason why all the drugs he used, along with one older drug that they couldn't give PREMIUM TIMES any disease or symptoms.
On that day he suffered the pain of being forced to follow the DDOS pathway in the NTP Valley, which is an ancient method that has been used since the ancient Kano.
On the 3rd of March he made every effort to reduce his mentality, but he didn't succeed.
This attempt to break the veil of the Prime Minister's Office PREMIUM TIMES came days after PREMIUM TIMES published the story of a series of battles between President Muhammadu Buhari's leadership in Fannin Szaro, Babagana Monguno and the former President of Staff of President Abadar Kahaban.

There is a female leader named Li Yaomei or Sadiya (a Muslim queen) who is famous for the kind of struggle she has had in her life and the success she has achieved in her attempt to get out of poverty.
Her story tells us that, trying to reach out and seek my own, is something that is in the heart.
At first it was Li Yaomei or Sadiya, who had never been taught the meaning of the lesson, an example that she could not read the scriptures.
God has given her wisdom, wisdom, and understanding, and she has set an example in the field of war and poverty.
About 20 years ago, Madame Li Yaomei suffered from intestinal cancer, where she was seen undergoing surgery up to 3 times.
After she was born again, she was faced with a terrible danger, now she is walking with the force placed in her foot.
These challenges that she faced were thrown into a healthier atmosphere, including the issue of medical deprivation, the reason why she received about 3 thousand yuan instalments, equivalent to more than 16 million Naira.
Surprisingly, this model that Master Sadiya faces would give her a way of procrastinating and smothering quickly to see her improve her life.
Then, with the support of the Chinese government, she increased her strength.
Art is the art of making different kinds of art depending on the use of artifacts.
Because of her hard work, the fire industry has developed very rapidly, where different employees do not offer Chinese service.
She also created a number of engineers who helped her to make the job easier.
For example, it took 15 minutes to add a single major, but now at this time, it will add up to 5.
In addition, it has provided some additional machines that clean up the process of reversing the cylinder.
Then there's another machine that cleans women's diet, and now it's still selling these machines to seekers.
With the decisions that Master Sadiya has entered, and the efforts that he is still making to improve his life and his staff, it will be understood that I need to seek along with finding.
The fight against poverty and the betterment of life is not a matter of merit to the government.
If the government wants to provide support, but the people have no end or interest in improving their lives by pursuing their own activities in accordance with the situation they are in, then the only step-by-step will be carried on without achieving a goal.
Its story shows that running a business or a venture to gain access does not require some visitors to travel or travel to other cities or countries abroad.
Because she considers the situation in which she is, she uses the benefits that exist in her environment to improve her life.
In addition, Sadiya’s teacher carried out these activities on her feet with no confidence from her husband, because he ran away and left her.
In other words, trying to be a leader and a seeker is something that is in my heart.
Then he showed the kind of strength that women had to change their lives and stand up to their necks without seeking anyone's help.
This is also a lesson that shows that, whatever a person does, he should stand by his side, for confidence in someone who is not sure.
Indeed, Master Sadiya was a teacher, a teacher and a teacher who set an example and a learning experience for the rest of the population.
Also, by March of the construction, Master Sadiya completed payment of all the services being monitored, and then stopped receiving support from the government at her own discretion.
Faeza Mustafa.
U.S. policymakers will face the threat of COVID-19 - Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
In recent days, the World Health Organization (WHO) chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has expressed concern over the measures taken by other countries to stop the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic that is expected to have been developed, stating that prevention and prevention must be avoided.
And it should be distributed in an appropriate way all over the world, because it will be suitable for the great diversity of nations.
Indeed, some U.S. politicians are aiming to show a sense of self-determination, about the distribution of the risk of disease, and are also disrupting the interconnectedness between land and land in the face of war and disease.
At present, a further 23 million people have been confirmed to have contracted COVID-19 worldwide.
In addition, there are people who have lost their lives as a result of the disease that has reached more than 800 thousand.
Under such a severe condition, attention is increased to the impact of the risk of infection, and the content is, in the days after, a great result has been obtained in the study of the risk in other countries, the case produced by the virus, and the belief in the inclusion of ethnic minorities.
On the other hand, some U.S. politicians have expressed a strong desire to do so.
Even "Science" claims that the U.S. government has already given away the Covid-19 fuel purchase agreements with their value to more than 6 billion dollars, from companies that include multiple sources.
Although the U.S. government's intention is understood, the U.S.'s presence is on the move to spread the disease, but other emerging countries also need more energy, considering that they are more vulnerable to poor health outcomes.
The Ecologist also stated that, if the U.S. achieved the goal of renewable energy to be produced, the amount of renewable energy to be produced would be reduced.
Mr. John Nkengasong, the head of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention in Africa, also expressed concern about the issue.
As some of the perpetrators of the day-to-day issues have pointed out, even if the production of raw materials has been successful, it will not be possible to achieve the goal of seeing after the disease, then the distribution of the materials is structured, which is an important element for the international community.
And it is appropriate for the nations of the earth to strengthen the unity between them.
The WHO's chief executive, Tedros, also pointed out that, if you want to see the aftermath of the disease, it must be removed from all regions of the world, you will not be able to achieve the goal of survival from the effects of the disease alone.
