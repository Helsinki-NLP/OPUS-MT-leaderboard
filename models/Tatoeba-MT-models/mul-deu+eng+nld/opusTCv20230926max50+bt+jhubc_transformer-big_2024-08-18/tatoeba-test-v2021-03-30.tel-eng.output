He's our boy.
I'm going to start with this very soon.
How'd you get here?
The sin is crying.
What are you talkin' about?
There's a new dress for Mary's party.
Layla called me.
My dad's going to sleep when he's watching.
He's no longer at home.
And he had two coats of mail beside him, one long and the other long.
The ancients are slow-moving.
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
We didn't sleep for a few days.
Ramadhan is back.
He's hit me
He's a Ram.
Tom slammed his hands in the air.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
Inevitably
Are you all right?
You've made me know you're my brother.
Is it true, Emily?
When's Seth going to go?
It's not that easy, you know.
What's in the box?
Is there any good water in there?
This plant has a number of long-lived roots.
Is it true, Emily?
It's near the station.
His eyes were covered with soapy water, which was hot in Tom's eyes, and he was lying on the bed.
You're going to be a seven-year-old?
Is all of this really happening?
The boy was a small squirrel.
It is clear that there is no other way
Seth gave me a good look.
Did you do the homework?
Some of the dogs are still alive.
There are islands in the sea.
Did you have a meal?
He's going to teach the kids Spanish.
How long do you have to go to the station?
It's an international women's day !
Where'd you put my book?
She's been teaching music for 30 years.
He has written a book for her.
When I heard Tom's voice, Mary was stunned.
There's no reason to be afraid.
It's not over yet today
Avid doesn't want to say much more.
We want to hear it.
Are you still afraid of what's going to happen?
It hurt me a lot.
I've got to be able to do it all around me.
I'll tell you a little bit about the bus stop nearby.
They didn't come
What's your room number?
When will you come back again?
As far as I know, he didn't get married.
We don't understand french.
The sin was sorely sinister.
Have you ever been to Paris ?
Avid doesn't have children
We've got to leave him
I didn't see my bag anywhere.
They'll sing a song
you're so happy you're
We've got to get people to work.
Why didn't you make it?
Show me where it's going to hurt.
I'll give this book to Ram.
The Pope is crying out for power.
I know you're not going to agree.
The pencils are in the same color.
I'll be very careful
I looked at the house.
Did you do the homework?
This is a very wise question.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
What's your favorite color, blue, or blue, or blue?
I don't want to talk to you
She's sitting on the ball.
We've got tens of thousands there.
I don't believe him
I don't like coffee.
Do you want to go out for dinner tonight?
Rama is here.
There's no benefit to them
What you've been talking about.
Are you all right?
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
Stay where you are, wherever you are.
You're living around here, right?
What are you going to do tomorrow?
"We played basketball last night.
Give it to Ram.
Seth smiled.
I've never been to Japan.
They're the birds
How many of these do you need?
What's the time now?
I don't know where they are
He put it on.
Are you all right?
Thank you so much for licking me.
It's hard to speak English well.
I'm really sorry about last night.
If I were you, I wouldn't be there today.
We've made it to be
I'm going to fall from the top of the stairs!
You can't do this when you're using
She's not a doctor.
Why haven't you been asleep yet?
He's dressed like a woman's.
How'd you get this pump?
There's nothing else
The kids love the cake.
It doesn't make sense to say the game.
You've come a long way.
The snails are delicious.
Let's take that opportunity.
Take the tea.
What's the length of that book?
Come on, I'll give you a little bit.
You can't stay here much longer.
You've got to talk hard.
I'm going to leave this time
I dont need anything.
How many of these do you need?
How long is she?
I took it.
What are you going to take?
That's what I was eating.
Its not a word.
Mary had lied to you, but she didn't.
Tom's friend, however, said he was going to leave.
She's found out with fear.
It's not good for you to sit all day.
Don't let him be there.
Did you do the homework?
How are you?
What's your dream?
Ah, the wonder!
Avid's daughter was intimidated.
The movie's going to start.
Is that true?
Why did you call me?
The guild's over?
When will my mother's death come?
You can do it.
People will believe that God is God's.
I made a mistake, but I didn't want to.
I'm learning the Bermuda language.
You'll be able to eat in this room.
Don't hesitate to ask me for help.
It's time to go to school, isn't it?
It's not all your fault
It makes me hungry again.
My dad isn't at home right now.
Ramadhan is back.
Layla's here?
I'll make mistakes too.
Mary Boy's friend had warned him that he would be leaving.
It's a party.
Tom's been very scared.
Did you do the homework?
It hurts my head.
Where there's music, there's music where there's words.
Is the work complete?
Is it true, Emily?
How long has it been?
I don't know who won.
Out of sight, out of mind.
I don't think it will be useful
I'm going to the next stop.
Is it really that bad?
I'm not allowed to do it here.
What's the time now?
How it's in the woods
I've started to talk.
Mary had bought a handbag of Nakhili Guchhi.
He's on his way to school.
He's coming to dinner for dinner.
It's not just you that's got to take care of me too.
Do you know why he's so angry?
It seems to be very interesting.
Is it Chinese or Japanese? it's Korean.
It's better to leave him alone.
The help was very late.
You're telling the truth?
You don't need to sigma
Go to there.
What are you saying ? .
Is the work I've done?
Don't get stuck in my work.
There's two shots for one shot.
Its a lesson.
Is there anything else to say about it?
Wrong
She's got cold air.
It's very valuable
Did you go to work at home yesterday?
What am I going to lose?
Are you infuriated?
You'll understand when you're my father.
It's not a great game, it's a good game.
Tell me about your day-to-day life.
You can go to the fish, or you can go to the fish.
My computer is very expensive .
Where's Mary?
He's got three times more than me.
I've never seen him.
You're ready to do it
Are you all right?
How are you? <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Let's go there tomorrow!
It's usually what I do.
Did you come from the school?
Why can't the giraffes sing?
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
I know he's coming.
Its not my fault.
The work is almost over.
I hear you're not good.
Why did you lie to her?
It's not that easy
You're a big one.
A little girl came out of the room under the table.
Take the tea right away.
I don't have time to talk anymore
I don't speak Japanese.
Keep your mouth shut every day.
When do you want to stop drinking?
The arms and legs are very long.
It's a machine learning.
He asked me how many languages I'd like to speak.
It's been a long time since I made my own decisions.
He smeared the blood in his hands.
You've got to come once.
You've seen it?
Have you ever had a heartbeat? - No.
We need money to do what we do.
I don't agree
Who are we ?
I've heard the clock ticking.
Can I make a phone call?
Shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Where's your boy ?
Animals are the only ones that have fats in them.
Please don't give me a cup of coffee.
My advice is that you do it.
It's a machine learning.
He didn't keep his word.
Are you going to gorillas?
Did you do the homework?
She knocked on the door, knocking on her heart.
Yes, yes?
Layla is invited to the wedding.
It may take a long time or even longer in the afternoon.
He's made a decision for everyone.
Shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
I've been drinking coffee.
How are you? <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
