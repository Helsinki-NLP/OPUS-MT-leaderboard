Members of the National Assembly of Wales fear they will look like Muppets
Some members of the National Assembly have been discouraged by the recommendation to change their official name to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The theme has started with a plan to change the name of the National Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Representatives of all political trends in the National Assembly are concerned that this could lead to ridicule.
A member of the National Assembly, a member of the Labour Party, said that his groupmates were concerned because it was ridiculed with the words “Twp and Pwp.”
To explain to readers outside of Wales: the foreign word daft means napaka and pwp means cake.
A member of the album said that the group as a whole "is not happy" and has proposed other names.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said his group was "receptive" about the name change, but noted that the word "MWP" is very similar to the word "Muppet".
For the explanation: the letter w is similar to the pronunciation of Yorkshire in English.
The National Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting a draft law on the name change, said: “The final decision on all the names by which members of the National Assembly are invited, of course, will be made by the members themselves.”
The Government of Wales Act of 2017 gave the National Assembly of Wales the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public survey on proposals for the name, which broadly supported the idea of renaming the National Assembly as the Welsh Parliament.
With regard to the appointment of the members of the National Assembly, the Commission preferred the designation ‘Members of the Welsh Parliament’ (WMP), but in the public survey participants favoured the ‘MWP’ option the most.
Members of the Assembly are likely to propose other nominations, but reaching an agreement could prove to be a test for President Elin Jones, who is expected to submit amendments to the bill in the coming weeks.
The reform act also includes other changes to the working principles of the National Assembly, including the rules on the deprivation of membership of the National Assembly and the structure of the committee system.
The final vote on the appointment of the members of the National Assembly will remain in the legislative debate for the members.
Macedonians hold a referendum on renaming the country
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether to rename their country as the "Republic of North Macedonia".
The referendum will be held with the aim of resolving a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province of Macedonia.
Athens has long argued that the name of its northern arbiter represents a claim to this territory and has repeatedly raised objections to the EU and NATO candidacy.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who is against the referendum on the name change, has said he intends to ignore the vote.
But supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zajev, argue that the name change is only the price the country would pay for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells are silent as the churches of Harlem are in trouble
“The older people I’ve talked to have said that in ancient times there was a bar and a church on every corner,” Adams said.
“Nine is not both.”
He said the disappearance of bars was understandable.
“People are interacting in a different way today,” he said.
“Bars are no longer the living quarters of the neighborhood where people live every day.”
As for the churches, however, he is concerned that the money from the sale of property will not continue as long as the leaders hope, and “they will sooner or later be back in the beginning”.
Adams added that churches can be replaced by apartment buildings, whose apartments are filled with people who don’t reach the rest of the neighborhood’s shrines with a helping hand.
“The vast majority of those who buy apartments in these buildings are white,” he added, “who therefore speed up the arrival of the day when all these churches close their doors, as it is unlikely that the majority of the people living here will become members of these churches.”
Both churches built white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis – the Metropolitan Community was built in 1870, the Church of St. Martin ten years later.
The original White Methodist congregation left in the 1930s.
The congregation of Blacks, who had worshipped God nearby, took over the ownership of the building.
The Church of St. Martin was occupied by a congregation of African Americans led by Rev. John Howard Johnson, who also led a boycott against shopkeepers on Harlem’s main shopping street, 125th Street, when they refused to hire or promote blacks.
The 1939 fire severely damaged the building, but when members of Father Johnson’s congregation planned to renovate the building, they introduced a carillion, or clockwork.
Father Johnson's son and clerk at St Martin's Church, Rev. David Johnson proudly called the carillon "the watch of the poor."
The expert who played the carillon in July gave it a different name: "cultural value" and "an irreplaceable historical tool".
Expert Tiffany Ng Michigan University also noted that it was the world’s first carillon played by black musician Dionysio A. Lind, who continued playing a larger carillon 18 years ago at Riverside Church.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin's Church did not replace him.
In recent months, St. Martin’s Church has had a history of architects and contractors, some of whom have been involved by secular leaders of the church, others by the bishopric.
In July, the governing body of the Church, or the governing body of secular leaders, complained in writing to the bishop that the bishopric “trying to pass on the costs”, although the bishopric was not even involved in the hiring of architects and contractors sent by the bishopric.
Some members of the association complained about the poor transparency of the bishop's actions.
In California, 13-Year-Old Shark Injured A Boy Who Dived After A Homicide
According to officials, a 13-year-old shark attacked and injured a boy who dived into a lobster in California on the opening day of the lobster season.
The attack took place just before seven o'clock in the morning near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning, when the boy heard appetizers and then swam with others to help the boy get out of the water.
According to Hammel, he initially thought the boy was expressing his enthusiasm for getting the lobster, but “he realized then that the boy was screaming, ‘I was bitten!
I've been bitten!".
His whole cradle was bare," Hammel described the look he saw as he reached the boy.
“I called on everyone to come out of the water, ‘There’s a shark in the water!’” added Hammel.
The boy was taken by plane to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego.
The extinct shark species is unknown so far.
Water rescuer and captain Larry Giles said at a press conference that the shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but then it was determined that it was not a dangerous shark.
Giles added that the victim's injuries were at the top of the body.
For research and safety purposes, authorities closed access to Ponto Beach in Ecinitas for 48 hours from Casablanca to Swamin.
Giles added that there are over 135 sharks in the region, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to take power in the UK beauty market
Sainsbury’s takes over the Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams chains, creating supermarket beauty transitions where expert consultants also work.
As part of a significant penetration of the UK’s <0xC2><0xA3>2.7 billion beauty market, which continues to be on the rise as sales of fashion and homewear continue to decline, wider ranges of beauty products are being tested across 11 stores across the country, putting them into second half if successful the following year.
Beauty products are being invested because supermarkets are looking for ways to make use of the shelf space previously allocated for TVs, microwaves and home appliances.
Sainsbury’s said it plans to double the range of its beauty products to up to 3,000 products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr PawPaw.
The existing product ranges from L’Oréal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees are also given more space in brands such as the one currently available in Boots stores.
Also, the supermarket is re-launching its makeup series Boutique, in which most of the products are suitable for vegans, as young buyers demand more and more.
In addition, fragrance retailer Fragrance Shop is testing exclusive licenses at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened last week in Croydon, South London and the second will open this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Shopping online and switching to everyday shopping for small amounts of food from local grocery stores means that supermarkets need to make more effort to convince people to visit them.
Sainsbury’s CEO Mike Coupe has said that retail outlets are becoming more and more like supermarkets, as the supermarket chain tries to fight back against low-cost retail chains like Aldi and Lidl by offering more services and industrial goods.
Sainsbury's has put Argose's outlets in hundreds of stores. The same has been done with Habitat's outlets since Sainsbury's bought both chains two years ago, which has allegedly supported food sales and made acquisitions more profitable.
The supermarket’s earlier attempt to renovate its beauty and healing departments ended in failure.
Sainsbury tried a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but it ended with a shelf on how to share the proceeds from the sale of pharmacies in supermarkets with each other.
The new strategy was formulated after Sainsbury’s sold its 281 sons to Celesi, who owns the entire Lloyds Pharmacy business, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
The strategy also plays a role in Lloyds, adding luxury skin care products from its four stores to its range of products, including brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury’s business manager, said: “We’ve changed the look and feel of our beauty transitions to improve the environment around our customers.
We have also spent money on specialised training for employees who are always ready to advise.
Our brand range meets every need. The trendy environment and convenient locations mean, however, that we are now a competitive beauty trade destination that can change the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones is furious because Holly Willoughby gave up 11 million pounds of the deal.
Dragons Deni star Peter Jones left the show after TV host Holly Willoughby gave up a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal in her lifestyle brand business to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has little time for the truly brand of home goods and clothing.
A couple of businesses have been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s trademark Goop.
The 37-year-old head of This Morning announced his departure on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons Den star Peter Jones angry, stepping out of their luxury lifestyle brand at the last minute to focus on her new successful contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources said Jones was “married” when a television star admitted at a tense meeting that took place on Tuesday at a man’s business empire headquarters in Marlows Buckinghamshire that his new contracts for a <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million deal meant that a woman no longer had enough money for a row.
The business has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand and was thought to double Willoughby’s estimated <0xC2><0xA3>11 million in assets.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that he was leaving Truthy, Jones left the UK for one of his vacation homes.
One source said: “Truth was definitely Holly’s primary preference.
It was meant to secure her further future, so the woman thought she would be dealing with it for the next few decades.
His decision to leave left everything to the utter amazement of the matter.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, because it was so close to the launch of the product series.
Marlow's headquarters is a warehouse full of ready-to-sell goods."
Experts believe that the head of the TV show "This Morning", one of the UK's highest paid celebrities, can cost the company millions, because the products, whose choice ranges from sofa mattresses and nails to the production of clothes and household appliances, have been invested in a lump sum of money.
This could mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three children, Willoughby and his wife, Dan Baldwin, have been close to Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby created True with Capp in 2016. 52-year-old Jones joined the brand as chairman in March.
The couple go on vacation together and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby becomes M&S brand ambassador and replaces Ant McPartlin in the I'm A Celebrity TV series.
One of Jones’ close sources said last night: “I don’t want to comment on his business.”
A difficult conversation, “because we fell in love”
Trump joked about the criticism of the news that was directed at him for a comment that some consider “deserving to the president” and for excessive positivity towards the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said in his “news anchor” voice:
“I haven’t given up on anything.”
He noted that Kim is interested in a second meeting after Trump welcomed their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards North Korea’s abandonment of nuclear weapons.
Negotiations on the abandonment of nuclear weapons have been halted.
More than three months after the summit in Singapore, North Korea’s top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see the US “responsive response” to North Korea’s initial disarmament steps.
He said the United States would continue to impose pressure on the country in the future.
Trump’s voice of encouragement was much more enjoyable.
“We are doing very well with North Korea,” he said.
“There was a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would be dead.
Everything is going very well between us now.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded good results: missile tests have been completed, help to release hostages, and the return of remains of American servants to their homeland has been arranged.
He also defended his unusual communication with Kim.
“Being president is very easy, but instead of letting 10,000 people wait outside to get into this crowded stadium, it’s better if we have about 200 people here,” Trump said, referring to the crowd standing in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake destroy Indonesian island, kill hundreds of people
When the effects of the Lombok earthquake were eliminated, foreign non-governmental organisations were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok had to be relocated, no national disaster was declared, which is a prerequisite for international aid.
“Unfortunately, they have often made it very clear that they do not want international aid, so the stories are a bit complicated,” said Ms Sumbung.
While Save the Children is putting together a team to go to Palus, it is not yet clear whether foreigners will be able to work in the region.
Mr Sutopo, a spokesperson for the National Disaster Agency, said that Indonesian authorities are assessing the situation in Palus, in order to decide whether international agencies are allowed to contribute to the relief.
Given how frequent earthquakes are in Indonesia, the country has surprisingly little prepared to deal with natural forces.
Although a tsunami shelter has been built in Aceh, they are not particularly common in other coastal areas.
While a tsunami warning was issued, the apparent absence of a tsunami warning siren probably increased the number of casualties in Palus.
Traveling between the numerous islands of Indonesia is also quite tempting in the best times.
Natural disasters are making the logistics there even more complicated.
A hospital stop in Lombok to treat the victims of the earthquake is headed to Palus, but it will take at least three days to reach the new site of the accident.
President Joko Widodo has turned Indonesia’s cracked infrastructure improvement into a central part of his election campaign and has allocated money to roads and railways.
However, Mr Joko's budget deficits are threatening the government, as new elections are ahead next year.
Also, Mr Jokot is under pressure from the tensions in Indonesia among the displaced, where members of the Muslim community in the majority have turned to an older form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands left their homes due to fighting between Christian and Muslim forces in the streets, using machetes, vibes and arrows, and other original weapons.
Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge beats Chelsea in a tie-breaker game
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a loss to Chelsea in the Premier League, scoring his 89th minute in a Saturday game at Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge received a feed from Xherdan Shaqir, being about 27 yards away from Chelsea's goal when his team led 1-0.
He hit the ball to his left before he hit the post further away.
The ball flew high over the penalty area and hit the upper right corner of the net.
It fell over the jumping Kepa Arrizabala and crashed into the net.
“I was just trying to get in that position, get to the ball, and players like Shaq are pushing the ball forward as much as possible, so I was just trying to win for myself as much time as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kant coming, I made one touch, and I gave an unthinkable blow.”
At the end of the first half, Chelsea led 1-0 in the 25th minute to the knockout goal of Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The Blues striker fed the ball back to Mateo Kovacic in this game before he turned around in the middle and ate at Liverpool's side.
Kovacic gave fast food in the middle of the day.
Then he created a beautiful aerial feed, leading Hazard to the penal area.
Hazard got through the defense and kicked the ball with his left foot from Liverpool player Alisson Becker through a post further away to the net.
Liverpool will play in the Champions League sub-group with Naples on Wednesday at 15:00 at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Euroleague game on Thursday at 15:00 in London.
Indonesia's tsunami death toll rises to 832
The death toll in Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, the country's disaster agency said Sunday morning.
Hulks of people were left under the rubble of buildings collapsed on Friday due to a 7.5-magnitude earthquake that led to 18-metre hydrocarbons, the agency's spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a press conference.
With over 380,000 inhabitants, the city of Palu collapsed under collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man after stabbed woman to death after murder
The murder investigation was started this morning after finding a woman's body in Merseyside, Birkenhead.
The body of a 44-year-old woman with turkey wounds was found at 7:55 a.m. in Grayson Mews on John Street.
The police are calling to contact people who have moved in the area who may have seen or heard something.
Police Inspector Brian O’Hagan said: “The investigation is just beginning, but I would ask anyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead and heard or saw anything suspicious to contact us.
I would also ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, whose on-board cameras could record anything, to contact us, as they may have vital information for our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman found in one of the buildings was a local resident of Birkenhead.
This afternoon, the alleged friends of the woman came to the scene, who asked questions about where the woman was found this morning.
The investigation is underway and the police said they are informing the woman's close relatives of the matter at the moment.
The taxi driver in Grayson Mews wanted to go back to the apartment, but the police told him that no one can enter or leave the house.
The man was shocked to hear the incident.
Residents were told that getting back into the house could take hours.
The police officer told one man that the entire area is now being treated as a crime scene.
One woman was in tears at the scene.
He always said, “It’s terrible.”
At two o’clock in the afternoon, two police buses were still closed in the area, and a third was just next to it.
Hulk police officers stood in the area and watched the apartment building.
Anyone with information about the event will be asked to send a direct message to the <0x40>MerPolCC account, call 101, or anonymously contact Crimestoppers by phone 0800 555 111 using the keyword in the September 30th log 247.
The shape of Parliament's Cromwell is the last memorial to be the cause of the "rewriting of history" riot
Removing it would be a poetic justice for the destruction of so many of England's cultural and religious objects in the Taliban style that the men's inhumane hunters did.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's recommendation as foolishness and attempting to rewrite history.
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “In the current debate on the elimination of images, it was impossible to keep the memorial intact in front of Oliver Cromwell’s Westminster Palace.
Cromwell did not steal the pictures in the English Civil War himself, nor did he order others to do so.
Perhaps Cromwell was sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor, Thomas, in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's excellent presentation of Cromwell is evidence of the opinion of the 19th century and part of the historical description of this person whom, in the opinion of a number of people, should still be honored."
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “At the end of the 19th century, more people considered Cromwell to be the defender of the external pressures of Parliament, and in this case, of course, of royal power.
Whether this is an accurate reflection is a never-ending historical dispute.
It is certain that the mid-17th century dispute has shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell clearly represents this gap on one side.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be commemorated and commemorated."
Chinese Farmer Deceased With Murder
According to local media reports, a pig from a farm in southern China attacked the market, which killed a man.
The man, identified only by his surname Yuan, was found dead and covered in blood with an injured artery near Liupanshui Market in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post newspaper reported on Sunday.
Manufactured on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China, to vaccinate a pig on its own table.
He and his cousin had reportedly come from Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, the man’s cousin found him dead and discovered that the next door was open.
He said the snail had a big bloody mouthful.
A forensic investigation confirmed that 249.47 kilograms of oregano had reportedly killed a farmer.
“My cousin’s legs were completely bloody and bruised,” the Guiyang Evening News reported the words of Wu, the victim’s cousin.
Security camera footage showed that Yuan entered the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday morning to feed his pig.
His body was found nearly an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The marketing manager told Evening News that the pig was locked so that he could not attack anyone else until the police collect evidence at the scene.
The yuan family and market leaders are reportedly discussing the payment of compensation for the death of the man.
Although rarely, it has also been observed in the past that pigs attack people.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their Massachusetts farm. The man was severely injured.
Ten years earlier, a 294.83 kilograms-weighing pig sniffed at a Welsh farmer's tractor until a man's wife scared the animal away.
When one Oregon farmer ate his own pigs in 2012, one Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs don’t usually attack, but because of the taste of blood, their heads could run off.
“They’re just playful.
They are very curious maracrates, whose purpose is not to harm.
“You just have to have a good story,” the man said.
Hurricane Rosa's aftershocks bring heavy rainfall in the U.S. south
According to forecasts, Hurricane Rosa will weaken as it moves across Mexico's north coast to cooler waters.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will bring flooding rains to northern Mexico and the U.S. Southwest.
On Sunday morning at 05:00 East Coast time, Rosa classified 136.78 kilometres per hour as a Category 1 hurricane, 619.59 kilometres south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move further north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low pressure above the Pacific Ocean begins to form, moving eastward toward the U.S. west coast. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday, it begins to direct deep tropical humidity to the U.S. south-west.
On Monday, Rosa arrives in Mexico, where it rains as much as 25.4 centimeters.
Subsequently, the tropical humidity reacting to approaching low pressure in the southern part of the country will cause extensive heavy rainfall in the coming days.
Sometimes, the rain that has decomposed 2.54 to 10.16 centimeters of rain causes sudden thunderstorms, floodwaters, and possible droughts in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity causes an increase in rainfall of five to about seven and a half centimeters per hour, especially in Southern Nevada and Arizona.
5.08 to 10.16 centimeters of rainfall is also expected in certain areas of the southern United States, particularly in Arizona.
Sudden floods are possible with rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the scattering of tropical rains.
Definitely should not move on foot in the desert at the risk of tropical rains.
Heavy rains can cause canyons to become fast-flowing rivers, and sudden storms can sometimes be accompanied by wind gusts and flying dust.
The imminent low-pressure environment sometimes brings with it severe rainfall on the coasts of Southern California.
There may be a total amount of rainfall that reaches more than 1.27 centimeters and can cause less floodwater and muddy roads.
It would be the first crop in the region during the rainy season.
Dispersed tropical rainfall will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday evening and early Monday morning, with heavy rainfall on Monday evenings and Tuesdays.
Heavy rains will arrive at the Four Corner on Tuesday and will remain until Wednesday.
In October, the U.S. forecasts large temperature fluctuations caused by the cooling of the Arctic, while temperatures in the tropics remain high.
Sometimes this leads to large temperature changes in small areas.
Sunday weather is an excellent example of significant temperature differences in the central United States.
Temperature differences between Kansas City (Missouri) and Omaha (Nebraska), as well as between St. Louis and Des Moines (Iowa) range from nearly 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, he will try to collect a lot of summer heat.
Much of the central and eastern part of the United States is expected to be warm at the beginning of October, with temperatures remaining around 80 degrees Celsius from the southern level to the eastern part of the country.
In New York City, 26.6 degrees Celsius is expected on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above the average.
Our long-term climate forecast shows that in the eastern part of the United States there is a likelihood of high average temperatures in the first half of October.
Brett Kavanaugh’s trial was attended by more than 20 million people
More than 20 million people watched on Thursday on six television channels the captivating confessions of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and the woman Christine Blasey Ford, who allegedly accused him of sexual violence in the 1980s.
At the same time, a political stalemate continued in which broadcasters interrupted broadcasting conventional broadcasts to reflect last-minute calls on Friday: Arizona Senator Jeff Flake signed an agreement with the FBI to arrange a one-week indictment.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was absolutely certain that Kavanaugh was suffocating him with his head and trying to rip off a woman's clothes at the end of high school.
Kavanaugh said in his passionate confession that he was absolutely certain that it did not happen.
According to Nielsen’s report, more than 20.4 million people watched the broadcast on Friday.
The company calculated the average audience on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other channels broadcasting it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen also usually has problems calculating the number of people who are watching the transmissions in the authorities.
For comparison, it is about the same size of the audience as it is at the football final tournament games or at the Oscars.
The Fox News Channel opinion leaders, who have strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, led all networks in a full-day session with an average of 5.69 million viewers, Nielsen said.
With 3.26 million viewers, ABC ranked second.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC had 2.94 million viewers, MSNBC had 2.89 million viewers and CNN had 2.52 million viewers, Nielsen said.
There was a lot of interest even after the trial.
Flake was the central character of Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican office filed a statement stating that she was voting for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras hit the man on Friday morning when he was hit by a demonstrator’s driveway election, trying to go to an elevator legal committee session.
He stood on the ground for several minutes when he was accused and it was broadcast directly on CNN.
"I'm standing here in front of you," said one woman.
“Do you think he’s telling the truth?”
He was told, “You have power, while so many women are completely powerless.”
Flake said his department issued a statement and added before closing the elevator that he had more to say at the Legal Affairs Committee meeting.
The cable and television networks reflected the live broadcast hours later, when the Committee on Legal Affairs had to vote to send Kavanaugh's appointment to the Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he only does so in the sense that the FBI will investigate the allegations against the candidate next week, which have been demanded by the minority Democrats.
Flake was partially persuaded by a conversation with his Democratic friend Senator Chris Coons.
After a later conversation with Coons and other senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision had an impact, as it was obvious that the Republicans would not get Kavanaugh's vote together without confirmation of the investigation.
President Trump initiated an FBI investigation into Kavanaugh's accusations.
British Prime Minister May Accuses Brexit Critics of Political Game
In an interview with the Sunday Times, the prime minister accused those who are considering his plans to leave the European Union of "political play" with Britain's future and harming national interest.
British Prime Minister Theresa May will attend a Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom on September 29, 2018.
In another interview with a newspaper that featured Theresa May along with former Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Johnson pressured her attack on the so-called Brexit cable plan, saying the proposal that Britain and the EU should collect tariffs on each other was “completely brainwashed.”
Wayde Sims Shooting: Police Arrest Dyteon Simpson Suspected in LSU Player Murder
Police have arrested a man suspected of shooting 20-year-old LSU basketball player Wayde Sims dead.
20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and put in jail on second-degree murder charges, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
The authorities released a video of the opposition between Sims and Simpson, adding that Sims had lost his glasses during the crash.
Police found the glasses at the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA, CBS's television channel WAFB reported.
After Simpson was interrogated, the police said that the man confessed to shooting Wayne dead.
The lawyer said the man’s security deposit was set at $350,000 ($308,600.30).
The East Baton Rouge Coroner released an initial report on Friday that caused a bullet wound to the head in the neck area.
The department thanks the Louisiana State Police Refugee Task Force, the State Police Crime Lab, the Southern University Police and the people living in the area for their help in investigating the suspect’s arrest.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked the region’s law enforcement agencies for “setting the path of care and justice”.
Sims was 20 years old.
The 1.98-metre man grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball at LSU.
His previous season games averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 table balls.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the entire team had been "struck" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
"It's something you're always worried about," Wade said.
Volcanoes pour ash over Mexico City
The ash erupting from the popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern parts of the Mexican capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Center warned Mexicans on Saturday to keep them away from the volcano as operations resumed in the crater, resulting in 183 cases of gas emissions and ash eruptions within 24 hours.
The centre was witnessing a number of riots and riots.
The images shared on social media depicted a thousand-covered car windshields in various parts of Mexico City, such as Xochimilcos.
Geophysicists noted an increase in activity of a volcano located 72 km south of the capital after a 7.1 magnitude earthquake rocked central Mexico in September 2017.
The Don Goyo volcano has been active since 1994.
Police clashes with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after protesters clashed with the wet police in support of independence protesters. Thousands joined anti-demonstrations to mark Catalonia’s opposition vote on resignation.
A group of masked fighters, held back by wet police, attacked the latter with eggs and powder paint, creating a thick cloud of dust on the streets, which is usually full of tourists.
The riots also occurred later when the police had to use the jewels to check the necklaces.
For several hours, supporters of independence chanting "No Forgetting, No Forgiveness" clashed with protesters in favor of unity in the country, who shouted "Let Spain live!".
According to local media, 14 people who suffered minor injuries received medical help during the demonstration.
Tensions continue to rise in the independence-supporting region a year later, when Madrid declared the referendum on 1 October illegal, but which Catalans in favour of secession still highlighted.
Voters overwhelmingly voted in favour of independence, although the voter turnout was low, as opponents of resignation largely ignored the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year when police tried to prevent voting in front of polling stations across the region, which led to violent clashes.
Proponents of independence had spent the night in front of polling stations on Friday night to avoid demonstrations supporting the national police.
The protests, however, took place, but had to take a different path.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who took part in a protest against the separation with his wife, said she no longer had the hope of seeing Catalonia as independent.
“Last year, one of the best moments of our lives took place.
“I saw my parents cry with joy over the opportunity to vote, but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Despite the important but small victory in the regional elections held in December last year, Catalan independence-backed parties have found it difficult to maintain their position this year, as a number of the most prominent leaders have either gone to the polls themselves or have been held to the polls themselves, and are awaiting a part of their trial.
The 42-year-old mechanic Joan Puig, who recorded a protest to support the police with his mobile phone, said the clashes were fueled by politicians on both sides.
“The situation is getting more and more tense,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders, who has been in pretrial detention since last year, announced that he will participate in the European Parliament elections next year.
"Candidacy in the European Parliament elections is the best way to condemn the decline of democratic values and the pressures of the Spanish government," he said.

A blow to me gives Livingston a 1-0 win over the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal against Livingston wins
Livingston sacked Rangers to lead Steven Gerrard to a second loss in 18 games, when the man has been manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's blow proved decisive when Gary Holt raised the level to Hibernian in a second.
Gerrard will remain unwinning in the Premier League this season and will face the leading Hearts the next Sunday, with eight points on the ground.
Before that, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the Euroleague on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston extended his invincible attack to seven games, while head coach Holt still felt the taste of loss the month before Kenny Miller was replaced.
Livingston Loses Opportunity Against Nurse Visitors
Holt's team should have been in the lead long before the goal, as their immediate playing style caused all sorts of problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through the defense, but his efforts blunted in front of the gate, where Alan Lithgow made an effort to hit Craig Halkett's header over the gate.
The predators calmly let Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could cause problems to guests in certain places.
And that's also the way the decisive gate was hit.
The Rangers gave up the free kick and Livingston had a chance to play Declan Gallagher, Robinson and Menga, who took the ball and managed to get it out of the penalty area.
By this time, the Rangers mainly held the ball, but could not penetrate the defense, so the goalkeeper Liam Kelly's side was mostly calm.
The same pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos once forced Kelly to defend the goal.
Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor kicked off Scott Pittman's hit and Lithgow slammed brightly in Livingston's next team effort.
The strikes repeatedly reached Livingston's penalty area and were consistently kicked out of it. Two penalty shots were also directed to go, one of them for attempting to replace Glenn Middleton and the other for touching the ball with his hand.
The Phenomenal Achievement of Livingston – Analysis
BBC Scotland Alasdair Lamont Tony Macaroni Stadium
A phenomenal performance and result from Livingston.
Each player was great, exceeding the line-up by moving upwards completely.
Their style of play and players have hardly changed since their return to the top, but Holt has to be honored for the way he has tightened the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halket was huge, organizing a perfectly organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their backs throughout the game.
The Rangers, however, lacked inspiration.
Regardless of their intermediate good standing under Gerrard’s direction, this was left to little, in accordance with the examples here.
Their last possession of the ball proved to be insufficient: reaching the home page was only a procedure that could serve as an alarm clock for the Rangers in the center of the table.
Erdogan's controversial reception in Cologne
In Berlin on Saturday (September 29th) there were both smiling and worrying clouds when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast.
This is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, aimed at improving relations between NATO allies.
They have been left out on issues relating to human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan headed to Cologne to open a new gigantic mosque.
The city is the largest community of Turks outside Turkey.
Police referred to security, banning gatherings in front of a mosque with 25,000 members, but a number of supporters appeared nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan, many of whom are Kurds, also made his voice heard, condemning both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to host the Turkish president in their own country.
Combating protests show that the attitude towards the guest has been divided: some Turks living in Germany greet him as a hero, while others insult the man as a self-governing.
Road accident on Deptford Road: bicycle driver killed in car collision
A bicycle crashed into a car in London.
The collision took place near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street on a high-speed road in Deptford, in the south-eastern part of the city at around 10:15 p.m. British Summer Time.
The driver stopped and came to the ambulance, but the man died at the scene.
The collision took place a few months after a second cyclist died in a collision nearly two kilometers from Saturday’s Childers Street crash site, where the driver on the bike fled the scene.
London police said authorities were working on the identification of the man and informing his relatives.
At the venue, traffic is closed and buses are redirected, motor vehicle drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartini prison: six prison officials injured in riots
The prison said that six prison officers were injured in the riots in a very secure male prison.
The riots broke out at His Majesty's Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire on Sunday at 9:30 p.m. British Summer Time and are not yet over.
The turmoil involving eight inmates in one of the tyrants involved in the incidents has been led by expert police officers.
Prisoners were treated for minor facial injuries at the scene.
A spokesman for the prison service said: “Prisoners with special training have been called upon to resolve the ongoing case at HMP Long Lartini Prison.
Five crew members received medical help due to injuries.
We do not tolerate any violence in our prisons, those responsible are handed over to the police and their imprisonment may be extended."
HMP Long Lartinis has more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison leader was taken to hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
However, in October last year, police were called to the prison to silence the serious riots in which prison officials were attacked with billions of bullets.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City with sudden surges (for wetlands the hurricane may be beneficial)
Tropical low pressure does not hit Arizona often, but it is likely to happen early next week when Hurricane Rosa moves across the southwestern desert of the United States, bringing the threat of sudden surges.
The National Weather Service has already organized monitoring of sudden waves on Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, California and southeastern Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
According to the forecast, Rosa will head straight for Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching the region already on Monday with rainy seasons.
According to the Phoenix National Weather Service, “since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or low pressure levels within a radius of 321.86 kilometers from Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that passed 64.37 kilometers from the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 5.08 to 10.16 centimetres of rainfall, which can reach up to 15.24 centimetres in the restricted areas of the Arizona Mogollon Rim.
In other desert areas of the U.S. Edo region, including the central and Great Ancestry of the Rocky Mountains, the amount of rainfall is likely to be 2.54 to 5.08 centimetres, ranging from limited areas to 10.16 centimetres.
Rosa rains can be a blessing for sudden winter floods, as the region is struggling with drought.
While the floods are very worrying, such rainfall is likely to be beneficial as drought prevails in South America.
According to the U.S. drought monitor, at least 40% of Arizona is extreme, or second-class drought, according to weather.com.
Hurricane Rosa Baja crosses the California peninsula on the Mexican mainland.
Rosa, which was still at the level of the hurricane at 6.43 kilometers per hour on Sunday morning, is currently 619.95 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico, moving at a speed of 19.31 kilometers per hour north.
The storm comes into contact with the cooling waters of the Pacific Ocean and therefore disappears a little.
Rosa is therefore expected to reach the mainland of Mexico with a strong tropical storm on Monday afternoon or midnight.
The amount of rainfall in certain areas of Mexico can be high, leading to a significant flood risk.
“From Baja California to the north of Sonora, rainfall of 7.62 to 15.24 centimetres can be expected, sometimes up to 25.4 centimetres,” weather.com said.
Rosa then heads over to the north of the tropical storm of Mexico, reaching the Arizona border early on Tuesday morning as a tropical low pressure that moves across Arizona and reaches the southern part of Utah late on Tuesday.
“The main threat that follows Rosa or its aftermath is very strong rainfall in Baja California, the northern part of Sonora, and the desert of the southern part of the United States,” the National Hurricane Center said.
These rains can cause life-threatening flash floods and floods in deserts and picturesque mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: four murder-related arrests
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of intended murder after a 16-year-old boy with tube wounds was found in Somerset.
A teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton on Sunday at 04:00 British Summer Time.
The victim was taken to a “stable” hospital.
A 17-year-old, 18-year-old and 20-year-old man was arrested overnight in the Radstock area of Avon and Somerset, police said.
Officials request to contact anyone who may have a case of mobile phone recordings.
Trump says Kavanaugh "suffered" the Democratic Party "under the truth and hatred"
“Judge Kavanaugh’s support is a voice against the Democratic Party’s ruthless and unacceptable tactics,” Trump said in his inaugural speech in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh “suffered” during the process of his appointment to the Democratic Party “under the truth and anger.”
Kavanaugh testified in front of Congress on Thursday, sharply and emotionally rejecting Christine Blasey Ford’s accusations that the man attacked her decades ago when they were teenagers.
He also testified at the hearing to Ford about his accusations.
The president said on Saturday that “America saw on that day Kavanaugh’s splendor, quality and courage.”
“The voice given to the appointment of Judge Kavanaugh is the voice to appoint one of the most valued lawmakers of our time, who has an impeccable background in public service,” he told the West Virginia-backed crowd.
The President indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's appointment, while speaking about the importance of the republic's electoral activity in the midterm elections.
“We have five weeks left until the most important election of our lives.
“I’m not running, but I’m running,” he said.
“That’s why I’m everywhere to fight for great candidates.”
Trump said the Democrats are on a mission to “stand up and prevent.”
The first major procedural vote on the Senate floor on Kavanaugh’s candidacy is expected to take place no later than Friday, the parent of Republican party leaders told CNN.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia have killed thousands, death toll rises
At least 384 people have been killed and many have been captured as waves of hail stormed the beach after a powerful earthquake and tsunami struck the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered on Friday at a beach festival in the city of Palu, when six-metre waves struck the beach during a storm, killing a large number of people and destroying all that remained on the road.
The tsunami followed a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
“When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still doing their jobs on the beach, not fleeing immediately, thus remaining victims,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia’s disaster mitigation agency, said at a press conference in Jakarta.
“The tsunami did not come alone, but took with it cars, salaries and homes, sweeping everything from the ground,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami was moving at an open sea speed of 800 km per hour before reaching shore.
Some people climbed a tree to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to the Palu 24 centre.
The aerial photographs published by the disaster agency showed destroyed buildings and shops, broken and collapsed bridges and mosques surrounded by water.
The following events in the coastal town continued on Saturday.
With a population of 2.4 million, there was an earthquake.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Implementation Agency (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released following a strong earthquake on Friday was nearly 200 times higher than the nuclear bomb dropped in Hiroshima in World War II.
The geography of a city located on a long and narrow bay could increase the intensity of the tsunami, the BPPT said.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, supermarkets and hotels have collapsed.
He said the bodies of some of the victims were found under the rubble of collapsed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the death toll and damage could be greater than 300 km north of Palus on the coastline of Donggala, which was closer to the quake.
The reports from Dongal “are completely incomplete and do not contain any information,” Nugroho said.
“More than 300,000 people live in the region,” the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its team and volunteers are heading to the affected areas.
“It’s a tragedy that can get even worse,” he said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for not notifying a tsunami in the city of Palu, although authorities said the waves reached the beach at the same time the warning was issued.
Amateur footage on social media shows a man on the top floor of a building warning people on the street below panicked about the approaching tsunami.
Minutes later, the water wall arrives at the beach, bringing with it houses and cars.
Reuters did not immediately confirm the accuracy of the material.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a massive power outage, which hampered communication in the Palu region and made it difficult for the authorities to organise rescue work.
The military has started sending transport planes from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but evacuators still urgently need food and other basic work.
The airport in the city was reopened for rescue work, with the rest closed until October.
President Joko Widodo plans to visit the evacuation centres on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has risen to more than 800.
It's very bad.
While World Vision workers from Donggala arrived safely in the city of Palu, where they were sheltered in the gift boxes erected in their office yard, they saw swirling views on their way, Mr. Doseba said.
“They said you saw a lot of destroyed houses,” he said.
It's very bad.
While aid forces vigorously began efforts to mitigate the disaster, some complained that staff of foreign aid organisations with extensive experience had been prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian rules, funds, supplies and relief forces may only be sent from abroad if the site of the accident is declared a national disaster zone.
It hasn't happened yet.
“This continues to be a disaster at the provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“When the government says, ‘Okay, this is a national disaster,’ we can start accepting international aid, but that state of affairs has not yet been declared.”
When Palus arrived on the second night after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, the friends of the lost people and families were still full of hope that their loved ones would be the wonderful events that would ease the onset of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of the sewer.
On Sunday, the rescuers released a woman who was trapped under rubble next to her mother’s body for two days.
Gendon Subandono, head coach of Indonesia’s national ice hockey team, trained two missing ice hockey players for the Asian Games that took place in Indonesia earlier this month.
The others who are trapped in the Roa Roa hotel are his students, Mr Mandagi added.
“I have a personal burden on me as a senior sliding guard,” he said.
Mr Gendon spoke about how, after spreading the news of the Roa Roa hotel collapse among the community of sledgehammers, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to Palu competitors who were at the beach festival.
However, his messages were marked with only one gray bird instead of two blue birds.
“I think that means the messages didn’t get there,” he said.
The thieves took <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>23,585.88 during the completion of the ATM at Newport on the Levees
On Friday morning, the thieves stole Newport on the Levees ATM’s Brink employee’s <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>23,585.88, according to a Newport Police Department press release.
The driver emptied the ATM at the entertainment facility and manufactured to bring more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a press release.
When the man acted, “the other man ran behind Brink’s employee” and stole a bag that was full of money.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, according to a press release, but police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information about the deceased is asked to contact the Newport Police by phone (<0x2B>01633) 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper takes his new name Ye
The rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
On Saturday, he tweeted, “Former Kanye West.”
The 41-year-old Westi has been nicknamed Ye for some time and the man also used the name as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change takes place before his premiere on Saturday Night Live, where the man is expected to release his new album Yandhi.
He replaces by sending singer Ariana Grandet, who canceled his concert “in the midst of emotions,” said the author.
In addition to being an abbreviation for a man’s present pronoun, West has previously said that it is a word of religious importance to him.
“I think ‘ye’ is one of the most unused words in the Bible, which means ‘you’,” West said earlier, discussing the name of his album with radio host Big Boy.
“So I am you, I am ours, they are ours.
I changed my name from Kanye, which means “this one,” to Ye, which is just a reflection of our good and bad, our confusion and everything else.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are.”
Kanye West is not the only rapper who plays with his name.
Sean Combs is known primarily by the names Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year the musician announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
Formerly cooperating with West, JAY-Z has also used his name with and without a pencil, in capitals and lowercases.
Mexican politician AMLO vows not to use military force against civilians
As the country approaches the 50th anniversary of the bloody attacks on students, Mexican presidential candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians.
Lopez Obrador promised on Sunday in Tlatelolco Plazas that “never use military force to control Mexicans.”
The military attacked a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing 300 people at a time when all of Latin America was carrying a confirmed leftist student movement.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by paying monthly grants to students and opening more free public universities.
He has said that unemployment and the lack of educational opportunities attract young criminals to the rich.
The U.S. should double its funding for artificial intelligence.
“As China is becoming increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount allocated to research in this field,” said Kai-Fu Lee, a financier and AI businessman who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments were published after various parts of the U.S. government made statements on artificial intelligence, although the U.S. generally does not have an official artificial intelligence strategy.
At the same time, last year, China introduced its plan to be a maker of artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
“Doubling the budget for artificial intelligence research would be a good start, given that other countries are so much behind the U.S. and we are acting on behalf of the next breakthrough in artificial intelligence,” Lee said.
Double funding would double the likelihood that the next major AI achievement will be made in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinnovation Ventures, which funded one of China’s most prominent artificial intelligence firms Face<0x2B><0x2B><0x2B>.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mello University with an artificial intelligence system that won America's best Othello player. Later, he was a man on the board of Microsoft Research and the president of Google's China branch.
Lee acknowledged a previous U.S. government technology competition such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Robotics Challenge (DRA) and asked when the next contest would be held to help identify the next dreamers.
“U.S. scientists have to work hard to get funding from the government,” Lee said.
“China is not the one who takes over the disciplines, they are companies,” Lee said.
Facebook, Google, and other tech companies have hired brilliant scientists from universities in recent years to work on artificial intelligence.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could help the US to support the efforts of artificial intelligence.
“I think that people who have obtained a doctorate in artificial intelligence should be automatically offered a green card,” the man said.
In July 2017, the Chinese State Council announced a next-generation AI development plan.
“The Chinese National Science Foundation distributes funding to people working in academic institutions in a similar way to how the National Science Foundation and other government agencies allocate money to U.S. scientists, but the quality of academic work is lower in China,” Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense set up a joint artificial intelligence center to involve partners from both industry and educational institutions, but the White House announced the creation of an artificial intelligence committee.
This month, DARPA announced that it had begun funding the two-million-dollar AI Next initiative.
But the National Science Foundation currently funds more than $100 million a year for research related to artificial intelligence.
At the same time, the U.S. legislation aimed at creating an artificial intelligence national security committee has not been amended.
Macedonians Vote in Referendum on Rename Change
Macedonians voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change the name of the country to the Republic of North Macedonia, a step that would also resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece, which has prevented Macedonia from joining the EU and NATO.
Greece, which is a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northernmost region constitutes a requirement for this territory and has banned Macedonia from joining NATO and the EU.
The governments of the two countries made an agreement in June on a new name for Macedonia, but anti-nationalists claim that the name would harm the national identity of the Macedonian Slavs.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he did not intend to participate in the referendum and the denial campaign has raised doubts about whether the voter turnout will reach the 50% turnout required for the referendum to be valid.
The referendum asks: “Do you support Macedonia’s accession to NATO and the EU, agreeing to the agreement with Greece?”
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this is a price to pay for Macedonia, one of the countries created after the collapse of Yugoslavia, to ensure membership with organisations such as the EU and NATO.
"I came here today to vote for the future of our country and for the young people of Macedonia so that they can live freely under the protection of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us," said the 79-year-old Olivera Georgievska, who voted in Skopje.
While the vote is not legally binding, a sufficient number of MEPs have said that they will follow the result of the vote to make it decisive.
A two-thirds majority in Parliament is required for a change of name.
The National Electoral Commission said there were no reports of irregularities as of 1 p.m.
However, the voter turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the previous 2016 parliamentary elections, when 66 percent of registered voters voted.
"I came to vote for my children. Our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, who voted in the Macedonian capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dusko gave Strumica their vote on 30 September 2018 in a referendum on Macedonia to change the name of the country, giving them the opportunity to join NATO and the European Union.
In front of the parliament building in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage, raising tents in front of the chair for those who ignore the referendum.
“We want to be part of NATO and the EU, but we want to join head-to-head, not through the door of the servants,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we still have dignity.
If they don’t want to welcome us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and get European-Asian integration.”
Zaev said NATO membership would bring the necessary investment to Macedonia at an unemployment rate of over 20 percent.
"I believe that the vast majority support the name change, because more than 80 percent of the citizens are in favour of EU and NATO membership," Zaev said after giving his vote.
He said the “yes word” would be “confirmation of our future.”
The results of a poll published by the Macedonian Institute of Political Studies on Monday revealed that 30-43% of voters, which is below the required electoral activity, intend to take part in the referendum.
According to a survey conducted by Telema TV in Macedonia, 57% of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent said they would say yes.
The success rate of the referendum is 50 percent plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the government’s Western policy after the government took over in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero goes through all of Brighton's defense for goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling broke through Brighton's defense, securing a 2–0 victory at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England, on Saturday.
Aguero made the impression that his goal hit in the 65th minute of the game came ridiculously easily.
The Argentine attacker went through the middle field at the beginning of the order.
He broke through three of Brighton's defenders before reaching the open field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green shirts.
He broke through another defender before running past several players on the Brighton penalty area border.
Then he hit the ball to his left, where Sterling was.
The English striker used the first shot to give the ball back to Aguero, who used his right foot to hit Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan on the right side of the net.
"Aguerol has problems with his legs," Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We said he was playing 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky to have him knocking on the door.”
But Sterling was the one who gave Sky Blues the initial lead in the Premier League draw.
The gate hit in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball in this game clearly in the territory of Brighton.
He sent the ball beautifully out of the air to Leroy Sane on the left.
You got to hit the ball a few times before you drove Sterling further.
Sky Blues kicked the ball off the net just before it slipped out of bounds.
Manchester City will play in the Champions League subgroup with Hoffenheim on Tuesday at 12:55 pm at the Rhein–Neckar stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play a cheerleader against Rockies
When the Nationals missed the finals of the tournament, there was no great reason for a fresh start.
The thrilling Scherzer, however, hopes to land in the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if the Rockies, who lead the Los Angeles Dodgers in one game in the NL West, still have hope of winning the final.
The Rockies guaranteed at least a 5–2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but the team still wants to secure the status of their first division.
“While we’re not playing for anything, we can at least try, knowing that playing in an atmosphere with an audience and another team in Denver is probably at a higher level than any other game I can expect this year.
“Why shouldn’t I want to compete here?”
The Nationals have not yet named the opener as of Sunday, but in such a situation are reportedly inclined towards Scherzer's feed.
Scherzer, for whom it would be the 34th feeding, made a warming session on Thursday and fed as usual on Sunday.
This Washington’s right-handed player leads 18–7, his ERA is 2.53, the number of kicks 300 and the favorable odds of his 220 2/3 this season.
Trump gives a speech in West Virginia <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
The president indirectly referred to the situation surrounding Brett Kavanaugh's election to the Supreme Court, while speaking about the importance of the republic's electoral activity in the midterm elections.
“Everything we’ve done is in November.
Five weeks before our lifetime, one of the most important elections.
It’s a big event that I’m not running for, but I’m actually running for, so I’m everywhere to fight for great candidates,” he said.
Trump continued: “You see this terrible, extremely terrible group of Democrats, you see it happening in front of your own eyes.
And they have decided to take back power using any means. You will see their evil and dirty game.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to drive for power and control; all they want is power and control over everything, and we don't give it to them."
The Democrats are on a mission to “stand up and stop” him.
“And you’ve seen it in the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “angry, evil, mean, and false.”
He referred to Senator Dianne Feinstein, a Democratic member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, who was screaming loudly in the audience.
“Do you remember his answer?
Did you leak this document?
Uh, uh, what?
No, no, no, wait – it was one of the worst examples of body language, actually the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
The Labour Party is no longer a big party.
It is unacceptable for those who express their opinion.
When the momentum activists of my local party voted to condemn me, it was not surprising.
After all, I am the last of the Labour Members on the list of Members who are told that you are not welcome, and all this because of the publication of my opinion.
My colleague, Joan Ryan, from this House, was a party to the same treatment because he strongly stood for anti-Jewishism.
In my case, the judges condemned me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
Responsible economic policy, national security and European issues, which are very similar to those on which Jeremy had a disagreement with previous leaders.
The Nottingham East Labour Party said in a statement that “we want the meetings to be inclusive and creative.”
For the most part, the experience of my eight-year-long local Labour MP with the meetings of the General Assembly on Friday evenings is exactly that.
Unfortunately, as it stands today, it is no longer valid for most meetings, and the promise of being “lower and more generous” in politics has long been forgotten than ever before.
It is becoming increasingly obvious that different perspectives are not acceptable in the Labour Party, and for each opinion it is assessed who is acceptable to the party’s board.
It started right after Jeremy became the leader. A co-worker with whom I previously thought I would share similar political views was now waiting for me to change my mind and take positions that I would never agree to, regardless of whether it was a bold market or a state.
Whenever I go out in public, no matter what I'm actually saying, it's followed by a verdict on social media, encouraging my resignation, ignoring party politics and saying that I shouldn't be part of the Labour Party.
And it's not just my personal experience.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my co-workers, because the comments directed at me are mostly political.
I admire the competence and decision-making of those collaborators who face sexist or racist abuse every day, but never swear by it.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this policy area is how levels of abuse have become commonplace.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is, however, that we are no longer such a large community, and with every change in the "disreliance" initiative or election rules, the party becomes narrower.
I have been given a lot of advice over the last two years to keep my head on the ground, talk less, and "then everything would be fine."
But I didn’t come to do that in politics.
From the moment I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a school student, motivated by the carelessness of the Thatcher government, which had left my large school classroom, literally, to collapse, I have tried to speak as a minister of the church, as a minister of the church, as a minister of the church, as a leader of the church, for the sake of better public services.
I’ve never had my own politics hidden, including in the last election.
It is in no way possible for anyone in Nottingham East to get confused with my political views or the areas of non-compliance with the local leadership.
To all those who promoted the movement on Friday, I want to say that if the country is moving towards a Brexit that is damaging our households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to spend my time and energy being loyal to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact, the only message I have is not for the Nottingham Moment, but for my supporters, whether they belong to the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that not one of the threats or political considerations of the revocation of yours will stop me from doing so.

Ayr 38–17 Melrose: Invincible Ayr moves to the top
Two of the late events may have tilted the final result somewhat, but there’s no doubt that Ayr deserves a win in this wonderfully fun Tennetti’s first league game.
They are now the only team to be unleashed in the top ten of the table.
In the end, it was a high level of protection for the team and a better risk-taking that led to the home team’s victory and coach Peter Murchiel has the full right to be satisfied.
“We’ve been put to the test all the time during the games and we’re still unbeaten, so of course I’m happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie Melrose once said, “I have a story about Ayr, they used their opportunities better than ours.”
Grant Anderson's 14th game-minute test, taken over by Frazier Climo, gave Ayr the lead, but the Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who surrendered to the Warriors, gave Melros the yellow card the opportunity to pass the failed test.
Climo increased Ayr's lead by a penalty kick just before the end of the half-time, reaching a standing 17–5 in Ayr's favour by a single turn.
But Melrose successfully started the second half, and Patrick Anderson's attempt to take over Baggot reduced the gap by five points.
Then there was a long delay due to a serious injury by Ruaridh Knott, after which the man was taken to the support frame. Continuing the game, Ayr further increased the lead thanks to Stafford McDowall's attempt by Climo.
Ayri's acting captain Blair Macpherson was then on a yellow card, but again paid Melrose player Bruce Colvine for a failed pass after heavy pressure.
However, the homefield team regained strength, and when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card for blocking Climo without a ball on the penalty line, MacPherson put the ball behind the downing Ayrids.
Climo forwarded the ball, as he did almost immediately after the game resumed, when Kyle Rowe attempted a cassette hit by David Armstrong and sent side guard Gregor Henry off the homefield on the fifth try of the team playing.
Still Game star wants to start a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran appears to be ready to step into the hospitality industry after it was discovered that the man was named director of a renowned restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the BBC television series, which he writes and plays with longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The pair have announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last in the series and it seems that Kiernan will make a living after Craiglang's new plans.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, but a Scottish Suni source suggested that Kiernan wanted to enter Glasgow's "rising restaurant".
“The sea is ours”: Bolivia without sea borders hopes that the court will reopen the way for them to the Pacific
Marines are patrolling the Navy headquarters in La Paz.
Ocean blue flags fly over the buildings of the Authority.
For naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, there is a slogan: “The sea is our right.
Restoring it is our responsibility.”
In Bolivia, the memory of the coastline, lost to Chile in the bloody resource conflict in the 19th century, is still alive. The same living is the desire to sail again in the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are perhaps the highest in recent decades, as Bolivia awaits a decision by the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of negotiations.
“Bolivia has a spirit of courage, unity and tranquillity, and the country naturally expects a positive outcome,” said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Hulk Bolivians across the country are watching the International Court of Justice ruling from the big screens in the hope that the Hague Court will decide in favor of Bolivia, after which Chile is forced to hold negotiations with Bolivia after decades of disruptive discussions to give its last way to the sea.
Bolivia’s charismatic indigenous president Evo Morales, who is expected to face a controversial re-election next year, is on the ballot with Monday’s decision.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he swore at the end of August.
Some analysts, however, believe that the court will probably not vote in favour of Bolivia, or if so, it would change very little of it.
The UN authority in the Netherlands does not have the power to give up the territory of Chile and it has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the decision of the International Court of Justice is made only six months after the final hearing of the statements indicates that this was not a “serious case,” said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, an expert in Chilean international law.
And moving away from Bolivia’s additional causes, the last four years may have worsened the situation.
“The problem of access to the sea has been kidnapped by the current Bolivian authorities,” Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
Morales’ wartime speech has lost all of Chile’s remaining benevolence, he noted.
Bolivia and Chile are continuing negotiations at some point, but after all this, the debate is extremely difficult.
The two countries have not exchanged their envoys since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, who is Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision was unnecessarily hasty.
Monday will give Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of country relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "end the 139-year-long separations with mutual benefit," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of Latin America’s most well-known presidents, is using the maritime issue as a political expression.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific,” he added.
“The decision is an opportunity to see that we have to get over the past.”
North Korea Says It Won't Get Rid of Nuclear Weapons Until It Can Trust The U.S.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his people would never give up nuclear weapons first if Washington could not be trusted.
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to review the promises that rival leaders made to each other at the Singapore summit.
He commented on the matter when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo almost seems to be resuming nuclear diplomacy more than three months after a meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Ri said these were airstrikes, believing that the U.S.’s continued restrictions and refusal to declare an end to the war with Korea would make North Korea surrender.
Washington will be cautious about such a statement if Pyongyang does not take the first significant steps towards armament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is seriously planning to give up arms, which the country probably sees as the only way to ensure its own security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to agree on a second Kim and Trump summit.
Parisian fashion forces bring to my audience a series of massive headgear that will be brought to buyers in their neighborhood shopping streets
If you want to expand your hummingbird collection or completely protect yourself from the sun, you no longer have to look.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne brought a series of strange super-sized headgear to the stage as part of their 2019 summer season, which obscured the Paris fashion week.
Tall and impractical cubes are in fashion this summer via Instagram and these designers have sent their footwear creations to fashion designers.
Valentino’s top piece was a model’s head-covered overwrapped beige cubic, which had been decorated with a reminiscent of a wide edge.
Other extra-large items of clothing included jewellery-built peas, magic cherry, and even pineapple, but their purpose is not to warm up.
Also, Thom Browne showed a strange selection of masks, doing it just in time before Halloween.
Most of the colored masks had curled mouths, so they resembled Hannibal Lecter more than high fashion.
One part of the creation was reminiscent of a diving costume with an air tube and glasses, while the other was reminiscent of a melted ice sheet.
And if you're going to keep up with the giant push-ups, you're in luck.
The Moegurians predict that super-large roofs may also reach the shopping streets near you.
Oversized cubes immediately come on the deck of La Bomba, a 60 centimeter wide shoulder cube seen in the head of all celebrities from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand, which has created a highly impractical scarf on social media, sent another great piece to fashionists – a shoulder bag that is almost the same size as a model wearing a bikini.
The dark orange raffinate bag with raffinate nards and white leather jacket was the top piece of the Jacquemuse La Riviera 2019 summer collection at the Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I look forward to seeing big cribs and beach bags on the shopping streets next summer. Since the designer has made such a big impact, it would be hard to ignore the demand for super-large items of clothing.”
John Edward: Language skills are important to world citizens
Scottish private schools have remained at the forefront of academic excellence and it continued in 2018 with the following outstanding exam results, reinforced by personal and shared success in sports, arts, music and other community ventures.
These schools, with a total of over 30,000 students from all over Scotland, and represented by the Scottish Council of Private Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best service for their students and their parents.
The purpose of private schools is to prepare students for additional and higher education, their chosen profession, and for their place as world citizens.
As an educational sector that is able to design and implement a curriculum tailored to the circumstances, we see that modern languages are still well-known and desired subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “When you speak to a person in a language that is understandable to him, it comes to his mind.
If you speak to him in his mother tongue, it will reach his heart.”
It is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely solely on the English language if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
In this year’s recent exam results, we can see that there are languages at the forefront of the tables, with the highest rate of passing the exams among private schools.
In total, 68 percent of students who studied a foreign language received a high score of A.
Data collected from 74 SCIS schools show that 72 percent of the students received A grades in Mandarin, 72 percent of German learners, 69 percent of French learners, and 63 percent of Spanish learners.
This shows that Scottish private schools support foreign language as vital skills for life, which children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages that are now among the subjects of choice are similar to STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) in the curriculum of private schools and other schools.
A 2014 study by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills (UK Commission for Employment and Skills) found that, among the reasons why employers find it difficult to find job vacancies, 17% of respondents found lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming more and more mandatory in order to prepare young people for their future jobs.
As more hopeful job offers require language skills, such skills are becoming essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career path taken, acquiring a second language will give a person a real advantage in the future, because language skills are life-threatening.
Communicating directly with foreign nationals gives a multilingual person an immediate competitive advantage.
According to a YouGo survey of more than 4,000 UK adults in 2013, 75 percent of respondents do not speak any foreign language well enough to have a conversation. The only language with a percentage of learners who were bilingual was pro in French.
That is why funding for language learning is important for today’s children.
Skills in multiple languages, especially in developing economies, provide better opportunities for children to find good jobs.
In Scotland, different languages are taught in each school.
Hulk’s school focuses on classical modern languages, while other schools teach languages that are considered to be the most important in the UK in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of the interests of the child, in private schools there is always the opportunity to choose between several languages taught by experts in their field.
Scottish private schools are committed to providing a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills needed to succeed, regardless of what the future brings them.
It can no longer be denied that in a global business environment, languages are of paramount importance for the future of the country, so it must also be reflected in education.
It is precisely modern languages that should really be considered as ‘international communication skills’.
Private schools continue to offer young Scots a choice, diversity and openness.
We have to do it right.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Board of Private Schools.
LeBron makes his Lakers debut on Sunday in San Diego
Indulgent fans no longer have to wait to see LeBron James making his debut at the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in the Sunday pre-season opener Denver Nuggets against San Diego.
However, the number of minutes of the game has yet to be determined.
"It's over one and under 48," Walton Lakers said on the official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell said that James is likely to play a number of minutes.
After last week's training, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game pre-season schedule.
“I don’t need pre-season games at this stage of my career to warm up myself,” he said.
Trump's West Virginia election campaign event, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is launching his campaign series of events tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is Trump’s first of five planned campaign events for next week, including stops in friendly locations such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the confirmation vote will stand until Trump elects who to appoint as the Supreme Court’s vacant seat, he is seeking to increase support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans threaten to lose control in Congress following a November vote.
What time is Trump’s campaign event in West Virginia going on tonight and how to watch it online?
Trump’s campaign event in Wheeling, West Virginia will take place on Saturday evening, September 29, 2018 at 19:00 East Coast time.
Trump’s campaign event in West Virginia can be viewed online via YouTube streaming.
Trump is likely to talk about this week's sittings by Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, which became tense about allegations of sexual misconduct, and at the same time the Senate confirmation vote has been suspended for a week until the FBI investigates the matter.
But the main goal of the campaign series is to help rally a new momentum for Republicans who face difficult elections in November.
President Trump’s campaign manager said the purpose of the event over the next five weeks was to “encourage volunteers and supporters as Republicans seek to protect and extend to them the majority in the Senate and House of Representatives.”
“Congress scrutiny is so important for the president’s agenda that Trump is heading into the fast-paced campaign season by diving into as many states as possible,” Trump’s campaign spokesman told Reuters.
Tonight’s campaign event, scheduled to take place at Wesbanco Stadium in Wheeling, could bring back supporters from “Ohio and Pennsylvania and get a coverage in the Pittsburgh media as well,” West Virginia Metro News reported.
This is the second time Trump has visited West Virginia in the past month, a state where the man received more than 40 percent of the vote in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senator Patrick Morriseyd, who is leading the polls on the front lines.
“For Morrisey, it’s not a good sign that the president has come to encourage his results,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team gets nervous, keeping hopes high ahead of Sunday’s singles
After three unilateral sessions, the games that took place on Saturday afternoon were sometimes exactly what Ryder Cup needed.
An all-rounder pendulum is a perfectly fictional concept in sports, but players really believe in it, especially in competitions like this one here.
So, what do you think is the turning point now?
"They led by six points, four of which have now become four, so I think I can think of it as a minor turning point," Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
Europe has an advantage, that’s clear, because they are led by four points and there are still 12 points in the game.
According to Spieth, Americans feel they don’t have enough wind sailing, but they have a lot of encouragement, especially in the face of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each received three points out of four.
Spieth has been a staple both in the field and in the field of greenery and shows an example.
These winning streaks from the neck became more and more widespread with each round, shadowing the decisive putt that would have led to the fourth match's draw after he and Thomas were in the ground with the two.
His well, which won the match on the 15th, sent a similar cry, which showed the man's belief that the Americans were not yet out of the competition.
“You just have to focus and worry about your match,” Spieth said.
That’s all the players can do.
18 holes to leave a trace.
The only players to score more points in the last two days than Spieth and Thomas are the undisputed stars of the Ryder Cup, Francesco Molinar and Tommy Fleetwood.
Europe's strange but beloved couple is four out of four and nothing can go wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple not to hit the bogey on Saturday afternoon, avoiding the bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and back at nine on Friday morning.
This game and how their energy flows into and out of noisy crowds reinforces the view that the players they compete with on Sunday, and that when the sun rises over Le Golf National, there is no more famous player to confirm a possible European victory than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both in different holes at the same time.
However, the stories of Europe's splendor are inconceivable.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson did a quick job with Sergio Garcia, this morning's four-ball hero, when the man was paired with Alex Noren.
Bogey and the two doubles in the first nine dug the Spaniards and the Swedes into a hole so deep that they had no hope of digging themselves out of it.
But on Saturday, there's no one to help you out.
Four-ball and pairs games are extremely binding to look closely at the relationship between the pairs, the advice they give each other, the advice they lack and the way they can change in a moment.
Europe has played better as a team so far and managed to lead by the last day with a strong lead, but this session of four showed that the US team is struggling with a nerve in which some, especially the Americans, have doubted.
Europe will lead the Ryder Cup on the last day 10-6
Europe will get a good head start on the last day of the Ryder Cup, taking the lead 10-6 for the United States after Saturday’s four-ball and pairs games.
The superb duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the two-time challenger Tiger Woods to raise their current score at Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European side, who contributed to the preservation of the losing streak at Hazeltine two years ago, ruled after failing the American side in the morning in four balls, winning the series 3-1.
The United States offered more resistance in the pairs game, winning two games, but they were unable to compensate for the deficit.
Jim Furyki's side needs eight points out of Sunday's 12 singles games to keep the lead.
Fleetwood is the first European starter to win four points in a row. Together with Molina, who is called Molliwood after a happy weekend, they are the second pair to win four points in Ryder Cup history.
After destroying Woods and Patrick Reed in four balls, they continued in the same spirit, defeating Woods and American starter Bryson Dechambeauveel 5-4.
Woods, who pulled himself through two games on Saturday, showed a random glow, but by now lost his 29 four-ball and 19 pairs games, earning seven losses in a row.
Justin Rose, who had a four-ball break in the morning, returned with partner Henrik Stenson in a pairs game, defeating 2-1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - who are ranked first and third in the world.
Europe did not succeed, although the competition was held pleasant and windy weather south of Paris.
The three-time winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas scored two points for the Americans on Saturday.
They won 2–1 in a four-ball final against Spain's Jon Rahmi and Ian Poulter, coming back later and winning 4–3 in a pairs game against Poulter and Rory McIlroyd, losing two openings.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history, the team has come back from a four-point deficit, going into singles, although as a owner Furyk only needs a week to keep the lead.
Even though they’ve been in second place for two days, after Sunday’s counterattack, it doesn’t seem like they’ll succeed.
North Korea Says “Nothing” Does Not Make It Armed Due to Unilateral Lack of Confidence
North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued restrictions deepened their distrust of the United States and that the country would not unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons under such conditions.
At the World Organization’s annual meeting, Ri Yong Ho said North Korea had taken “significant goodwill measures” over the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test site, and promising not to disseminate nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“But we don’t see the United States responding to that,” he said.
“Without the distrust of the United States, our country lacks security, and in such circumstances, we in no way agreed to make ourselves unilaterally the first weapon.”
While Ri reiterated North Korea’s familiar complaints about Washington’s “stage-by-step” approach to making North Korea free of nuclear weapons, which rewards North Korea for taking step-by-step steps, it seemed important in his remarks to the Pianist that he was not rejecting a side-by-side approach.
Ri referred to the joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the U.S. president and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim promised to move toward a “nuclear waiver” of the Korean peninsula and Trump promised North Korea security death.
North Korea has wanted an official end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed calls to loosen the stringent international restrictions imposed on North Korea.
“The U.S. is calling for ‘the first to give up nuclear weapons’ and is increasing the pressure on the restrictions to achieve their goal by force, even against a declaration of an end to the war,” Ri said.
“The realization that restrictions are pressing on our knees is a dream for people who don’t know us at all.
But the problem is that continuing restrictions deepen our distrust.”
Ri did not mention the plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leader stressed earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: “If South Korea were one of the parties to the issue of nuclear disarmament, not the United States, the issue of nuclear disarmament on the Korean peninsula would not have been the issue.”
However, Ri’s speech differed sharply from last year’s when he told the UN General Assembly that North Korea’s approach to the US mainland with missiles was inevitable after “Mr Evil President” Trump called Kim “one of the rockets” at a suicide mission.
Last year, North Korea praised the U.N.’s threat to completely destroy Kim’s courage to take steps to become unarmed, but added that there is still much more to be done and that restrictions should remain in place until North Korea’s nuclear weapons are abandoned.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no timetable for it, saying, “Whether it takes two years, three years or five months – it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should be rewarded for Pyongyang’s actions.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: “The Security Council’s restrictions must continue to be enforced vigorously and without fail until we can fully and definitively confirm the abolition of nuclear weapons.”
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously increased the restrictions on North Korea in an effort to prevent the financing of Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met alongside the UN General Assembly in Riga and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, although the last trip did not go very well.
After his meeting with Pyongyang in July, he said progress had been made, after which North Korea condemned him for “gangster-like demands” within a few hours.
North Korea promised to dismantle the missiles and the nuclear complex at a meeting with Moon this month if the United States took “corresponding measures”.
He said Kim had told him that under "responsive measures" it meant Trump's security guarantees allowed in Singapore and the movement towards normalization of relations with Washington.
<0xE2><0x86><0x90> Harvard Students Learn How to Get Enough Rest
This year, Harvard University is offering a new course where students will need to sleep more to cope with the growing aggressive culture of caffeine-rich night-time learning marathons.
Students who love the academicity of the best university in the world are often helped when it comes to the basics of self-care.
Professor Charles Czeisler, the designer of this course, a Harvard Medical School sleep doctor and a specialist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, says it is the first homemade one in the United States.
He encouraged the creation of the course after he gave a talk on how sleep disorders affect learning.
“At the end of this, a girl came to me and asked, ‘Why am I being told about it only now, in my last year of school?’
He said that no one ever told him about the importance of sleep - it made me sick," he explained to the Telegraph.
The course, which came to be taught for the first time this year, explains to students how good sleep habits contribute to academic and athletic outcomes and also help improve their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at the Harvard Medical School and the university’s director of health, said the university decided to take a course of study after it was found that the students were in severe insomnia during the work week.
The hour-long course covers a number of interactive tasks.
In one part, students will be able to click on coffee cups, curtains, sports shoes and books, and they will be explained about the effects of caffeine and light, how insomnia affects sports performance and the importance of sleeping habits.
The second part explains how long-term insomnia can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
The map of the campus, along with the interactive symbols, encourages participants to think about their daily habits.
“We know that this does not change the behavior of the students immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know the health effects of cigarette smoking," added Professor Czeisler.
He said that he is still proud of night-time learning marathons, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students means that insomnia is still a growing problem.
“Ensuring sufficient quality sleep should be a student’s “sleeping weapon” to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety,” he added. “It helps even against weight gain, as sleep deprivation makes the brain hungry, making a person constantly hungry.”
A 19-year-old student of chemical and physical biology from California, Raymond So helped Professor Cheisler create the course, having attended one of his classes the previous year, in his first Harvard year.
Raymond said the course opened his eyes and encouraged him to help create a university course.
In the next step, she wants all graduate students to pass a similar study programme before joining a competing institution.
Professor Czeisler advised students to set the alarm clock to both sleep and wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of “blue light” created by electronic screens and LED lighting, as this can damage their daily rhythm and cause problems with sleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga goal scored by Gerrardi Men
The Rangers suffered another poor guest match result when Dolly Menga's blow sent by Steven Gerrard brought a 1-0 victory to Livingston.
Ibrox's side had hoped to win their first guest race since February, when 4–1 St Johnstone was defeated, but Gary Holt's team only caused Gerrard's second loss in 18 games, remaining eight points behind the Ladbrokes Premiership lead from Hearts.
I was hit by my gate seven minutes before half-time and the Rangers' poor preparedness couldn't recover from it.
The Rangers thus fall to sixth place, Livingston climbs to third place, remaining under Hibernian with only one goal.
For the Rangers, the problems may not be over yet, because their attacker Calum Spence needed a head-on treatment after he was hit with an apparently rejected object.
Gerrard made eight side changes that led to the Ayr and Betfred Cup semi-finals.
Holt, however, moved on at the same time as Livi 11, who took a point from Hearts last week and he would have been happy with how his well-trained boys beat his opponents every step of the way.
The Rangers may have been more dominant, but Livingston did a lot more with his ball.
They should have hit the gate in the second minute, when the first Menga exchange sent Scott Pittman through Allan McGregor's gate, but the midfielder did not take advantage of his opportunity.
A deep Keaghan Jacobs free kick then found Captain Craig Halkett, but its defending partner Alan Lithgow was only able to make a wide-edged punch in the back post.
The Rangers gained control, but they seemed to have more hope than they believed in the last third of their game.
Alfredo Morelos felt strongly that he should have received a penalty kick when he clashed with Steven Lawless in the 15th minute of the game, Judge Steven Thomson did not satisfy the Columbia player's complaint.
Rangers managed to score only two goals in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly wasn't worried either about Lassana Coulibaly's header or Ovie Ejaria's event.
While Livi’s 34th minute break may have violated the rules of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it purely for their preseason.
Again, the Rangers couldn’t control Jacobs’ deep, heavy performance.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher struck the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept the peace and chose Menga, who simply brought the plan to an end.
Gerrard acted in the interim, swapping Coulibaly for Ryan Kent. This exchange almost paid off when the extreme player smashed Morelos, but the impressive Kelly tried to stop him from doing so.
But Livingston continued to attract visitors to play exactly the kind of game that suits those where Lithgow and Halket picked up a long ball.
Holt's side could have promoted his lead at the final stage, but McGregor stood firm, stopping Jacobs before Lithgow hit the corner with a big bow.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton again applied for a penalty kick when he went up with Jacobs, which Thomson did not satisfy again.
Almanahh: The inventor of Geiger listings
And now the page of our Sunday Morning Almanac: September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago and LOENDADES... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity. This was an invention that eventually led to a device known as a Geiger meter.
From this foundation of science, Geiger's lecturer also became the starting point of pop culture, as in the 1950 film Coronado's Watches, in which the main parts were apparently unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: “What else is that?”
Rogers: “This is a Geiger meter used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
Wearing these earplugs makes it possible to hear the podina of atoms separated from the radioactivity of the minerals."
Evans: “Don’t tell me, it’s still going crazy!”
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention bearing his name lives on.
New Cancer Vaccine Can Teach Your Immune System to “See” Cheat Cells
New Cancer Vaccine Can Teach Your Immune System to “See” Cheat Cells and Kill Them
Vaccine Teaches the Immune System to Know as Part of Cheat Cell Treatment
The method involves taking immune cells from a patient and changing their cells in the laboratory
They are then able to "see" a common protein for many cancers and are injected back
The vaccine of the study shows promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
One woman who was treated for the immune system with a vaccine that taught the detection of cheating cells, her ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method involves removing immune cells from the patient. These cells are transformed in the laboratory so that they can "see" the protein that has been prevalent in various HER2 cancers, and then inject these cells back.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, explained: “Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “leads the growth of many types of cancer,” including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancers, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach in which patients receive immune cells and are taught to target cancer cells has been used to treat certain types of leukaemia.
Kanye West started with a Trump-backed tribe, wearing a MAGA hat live on SNL.
It didn't go very well.
You can Saturday Night Live studios retaliate against Kanye West for a degrading violin chorus, following a messy speech in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and announced his candidacy for the same position in 2020.
After that evening his third song, which was called Ghost Town and in which he wore a hat titled Make America Great, he began to protest against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“I’ve talked so much to white people who ask me, ‘How do you like Trump, he’s racist?’
“If I had been so concerned about racism, I would have left America a long time ago,” he said.
SNL started a deal with Matt Damon, where Hollywood celebrity joked about Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding Christine Blasey Ford's alleged sexual violence.
While this episode didn't air, West's audio footage was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock tried to look at West's post.
West also complained to the audience that he had quite a hard time behind the scenes about his hat.
They made fun of me behind the scenes.
They said I wouldn't go there, hat on my head.
They made fun of me!
And then they say I'm drowning in place," he said according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, “You want to see a drowning place? I’m putting my Superman cage on my back because that means you can’t tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move on?
Try it with love.”
His comments sparked audience outrage at least twice and seemed embarrassing to the SNL team. According to Variety, one person stated: "The whole studio was deadly."
West was brought on the show at the last minute to replace Ariana Grande because of the singer's former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller had died a few days earlier.
West impressed many with the song "I Love It", during which she looked like a Perrier bottle.
West received support from the conservative TPUSA group, led by Candace Turner, who said: "To one brave soul: WE WILL RESPECT THE JEWS TO THE GODDAM."
But broadcaster Karen Hunter remarked that West was simply "who she is, and that's absolutely wonderful."
“But I decided to reward MITTE (by buying my music or clothing or supporting his ‘art’) someone who I think believes and disseminates a harmful worldview to my community.
He's free.
“Like us,” he added.
Before the broadcast, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he is now "the former Kanye West."
He is not the first singer to change his stage name, following Diddy, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Also, rapper Snoop Dogg has been named Snoop Lion and of course the newly released music legend Prince, who changed his name to a symbol.
Accusation of Murder in Belfast Restaurant Crash
A 45-year-old man was charged with homicide after another man was stabbed in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
According to police, the incident took place in Ballyhackamore.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast Magistrate's Court on Monday.
The prosecution will be reviewed by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Game of Thrones celebrity Kit Harington does not approve of caste masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his sword-flashing role in Jon Snowina's HBO violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actor (31) downloads an aggressive heroic stereotype, saying that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel they need to be tough.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit thought that “something went wrong” and raised the question of how to solve the problem of shrimp masculinity in the <0x23>MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married her Game of Thrones companion Rose Leslie (31), admitted that she feels “very strongly” that this problem needs attention.
“I personally feel pretty strongly that we’ve gone wrong somewhere with masculinity,” he said.
“What have we taught men when they grow up about the problem we’re seeing now?”
Kit believes that the rise in masculinity of the cast is partly to blame for television, because it shows superficial characters.
He continued: “What has been born and what is taught?
What is taught on television and on the streets gives young boys the feeling that they need to be exactly what they want to be men.
I think that's really one of the biggest questions of our time - how to change it?
“There’s obviously something wrong with the young people.”
In the interview, he also admitted that after the end of the series, no game of Thrones will ever take place next summer, saying that he is "on the side of his battlefields and horses".
Starting in November, Kit takes part in the revival of Sam Shepard's True West, which tells the story of the filmmaker and his kidnapped brother.
The actor recently announced that he considers meeting his wife Rose to be the best thing to do with the Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife in this series, so it gave me my future family and my future life,” he said.
Rose played the Emmy-winning fantasy series Ygritte, the other character Jon Snow loved.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family home in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has reported that the number of people living with HIV and AIDS has increased sharply to 14%.
According to health care professionals, more than 820,000 people suffer from this disease.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, some 40,000 new cases were reported.
Most of the new cases have arisen from sex, thus changing the past.
In fact , HIV spread through blood transfusions in some parts of China .
But in this way, the number of people infected with HIV had dropped to almost zero, Chinese health officials confirmed at a conference in Yunnan province.
Every year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
The spread of HIV through sex is a serious problem for the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was legalized in China in 1997, but the distinction between LGBT people is said to be high.
Because of the country’s old values, studies show that 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry women.
Many transmissions of diseases are associated with insufficient sexual protection of such relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has allowed general access to HIV medicines to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies leaking data from an employee of the GOP senator, saying these are “dangerous mistakes” and “water requirement theories”
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday condemned allegations that her employee had posted personal data from three Republican U.S. senators on lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat confirmed that such claims are being spread by “ultra-right” trolls and their websites.
“Lies, lies, and even more degrading lies,” Waters said in a tweet.
The published information allegedly included addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham (South Carolina) and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch (both from Utah).
The information was posted by an unknown person at Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The information was leaked shortly after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Ancient websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the post was linked to the Waters office and released member information for an employee under Waters, Hill said.
“This unjustified claim is a complete and absolute mistake,” Waters continued.
“My employees, whose identity, personal data and security are endangered by their fraudulent and false claims, are in no way responsible for this information sheet.
This unjustified claim is a complete and irrefutable lie.”
Waters’ statement was quickly reviewed on the Internet, including former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer, one of the reviewers.
“This denial is due to anger,” Fleischer wrote.
“It suggests that he has a mood that is not appropriate for a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they have not done, they must not become angry.
They must not be discouraged.
They must not question the motives of the accused.
They have to stay calm.”
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters' reaction to a Democrat critic of Judge Kavanaugh, who critics accused of being too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Republican candidate Omar Navarro, who is running for Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his views on Twitter.
“It’s important, if it’s true,” he said.
In a statement, Waters said his office had warned “the relevant law enforcement agencies about these fraudulent allegations.”
“We will do everything we can to find out the perpetrators,” he continued, “and to legally hold them accountable for all their actions, which are destructive and dangerous to all my employees.”
Johnny English Strikes Again Review - Under Armed Rowan Atkinson's Spy-Parody
It is now customary to look for the meanings of Brexit in all new British films and it seems to be particularly appropriate in the parody of the Johnny English comic book series – which began in 2003 with Johnny English and became the line-up for Johnny English Reborn in 2011.
Is it humorous to joke about how stupid we obviously are in the country’s new export opportunity?
In any case, incompetent Johnny English has been allowed to do things again in his own way - and that this vast comic creation is intended for non-English-speaking film territories.
Of course, it’s a secret agent who, despite his strange pretension, resembles a little Clouseau, a little Mr Bean, and a little character who gave a tone to the Chariots of Fire icon at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
It is also based on a traveler and an international mysterious Atkinson, who was once played in the forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials, which leaves nothing but chaos behind.
There are only one or two pleasant moments in this last JE movie.
I liked Johnny English's approach to the helicopter when he wore a medieval iron belt and the helicopter's denser for a moment he slammed against the helmet.
Atkinson's ability to make a physical comedy is shown, but humor seems less important and strangely exaggerated, especially as "serious" spy films such as 007 and Mission Impossible also offer self-confident comedy.
It seems that this humor is intended for children rather than adults, and for me Johnny English’s planned adventures are not as inventive and focused as Atkinson’s dark films Beana.
There is now an ever-actual assumption that the UK is in serious trouble.
A cyber-hacker has hacked into Britain’s top-secret spy network, revealing the identities of all British secret police officers, preparing a major disappointment for an on-site agent – a sadly minor role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last shoulderpiece for the prime minister, who is a festive and troubled character who suffers from the burden of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does the character Teresa-May perfectly, but there is not much to work on in the script.
His bone counselors recommend that since all active spies are at risk, he must call back someone who has retired.
And that means Johnny English, who now works as a schoolmaster in one of the proud institutions, teaching secret lessons on how to be a secret agent: here are a few good places where English offers a School of Rock-type espionage school.
English is flown back to Whitehall for emergency information, and she is reunited with her former long-time partner Bough, played by Ben Miller again.
Bough is now married to the captain of a submarine where the talents of actress Vicki Pepperdine have been seriously wasted.
So Batman and Robin, his Majesty's Secret Service's shadows are back in action, meeting Olga Kur<0xC3><0xB5>lenko incarnated in a beautiful femme fatale with Ophelia Bulletova.
At the same time, the prime minister dangerously falls into the trap of a charismatic tech billionaire, who claims to be able to solve all of Britain's computer troubles: the unfortunate Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their arduous odyssey: hiding themselves as presenters, they set fire to a French restaurant; they create chaos while secretly hovering over Volta's luxury yacht; and English launches a real robbery when he tries to use the virtual reality masterpiece to get acquainted with the Volta House.
In this last section no brakes are used, but as cute and stormy as it is, the whole thing has a children's TV cute on the side.
That's a pretty average stuff.
And as with other Johnny English films, I came up with the question: is it really not for the British film industry to give Rowan Atkinson a role that would be fair to his talent?
The Labour Party refuses to draw up a plan in which the British work four days a week, but they are paid five days in advance
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party has been considering a reversal plan that provides for the British to work four days a week, but they will be paid five days in advance.
The party wants corporate leaders to pass on the artificial intelligence revolution (AI) to saved workers, giving them one additional day off.
That's how employees would have a three-day weekend - but they would get the same pay.
According to the source, this idea would fit into the party’s economic agenda and thus the state intends to lean in favor of workers.
Thursday's working week has been approved at the Trade Union Congress to allow workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A Labour Party source told The Sunday Times: “It is expected that the review of the bill will be announced before the end of the year.
“It’s not overnight, but Thursday’s work week is an effort that fits with the party’s approach to balancing the economy for the benefit of both workers and the party’s overall industrial strategy.
The Labour Party is not the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party also promised a working week on Thursday during its 2017 election campaign.
At the moment, however, this effort is not supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A spokesperson for the Labour Party said: "Thursday's work week is not a party policy and the party is not discussing it."
Senator John McDonnell used last week’s Labour conference to clarify his vision of a socialist turn in the economy.
McDonnell said he had decided to take power back from “non-profit executives” and “profit-serveers.”
Aseccantler’s plans also mean that the current shareholders of the water companies may not be able to regain their full shareholding, as the Labour Party could make “major calculations” in relation to the perceived misdemeanor.
He confirmed his plan to put employees on the boards of directors of the company and to create inclusive equity funds to provide 10% of private sector companies' equity to employees, instead of providing annual bonuses up to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>561.65.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy talk about whether FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds
The investigation into the charges against FBI judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on the candidacy for the Supreme Court by at least one week and raises the question of whether the Bureau’s findings could affect the cessation of support for Republican senators.
In Sunday’s poll, you could ask “60 Minutes” co-chairman Scott Pelley of Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could reveal anything that might change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open-minded than his colleague from South Carolina.
“Of course,” Kennedy said.
“I said I was going to the hearing, I said I was talking to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the charges were made and asked, “Did you do that?”
He was decisive, confident and unequivocal.”
Graham's voice seems to be rock-proof.
“I am confident in my decision about Brett Kavanaugh and that could only be changed in the bombardment,” he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know how it happened, but I know Brett strongly denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And all that he has named have not been able to confirm it.
It's a 36-year-old thing.
I don’t see anything new coming.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it contributed to the reduction of poverty?
This Saturday, the annual New York Global Citizen Festival is hosting a music event, which has an immensely impressive celebrity participation and an equally impressive goal: to eliminate poverty from the world.
Now for the seventh time, the Global Citizen Festival sees tens of thousands of people in Central Park’s Great Lawn area not only enjoying singers such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also raising awareness of the true purpose of the event for the year, which is the end of the 20th century.
Founded in 2012, the Global Citizen Festival is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by continuously increasing the number of people fighting it.
In order to get a free event ticket (if you just don’t want to pay for a VIP ticket), the concert visitors had to perform several tasks or volunteer activities, send an email to some world leader, call or do something else important to help raise awareness of the loss in their pursuit.
But how successful has Global Citizen been, how many more 12 years to achieve this goal?
Is the idea of giving people a free concert a real way to convince them to demand action, or is it just another click-through where people feel like they’re doing something important by signing an application on the internet or by streaming?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has registered more than 19 million “activities” of its supporters, seeking to achieve a number of different goals.
These measures have helped world leaders to inform more than $37 billion of commitments and policies that will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group referred to 390 commitments and notifications resulting from their activities, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid out or financed.
The group estimates that the secured funds have so far directly affected nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key commitments include the UK-based investor-implementer partnership The Power of Nutrition, which is committed to “give children the fullest potential” by promising to give Rwanda $35 million to help end the global subsistence crisis after receiving more than 4,700 Ci.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments, and global citizens like you, we can turn malnutrition into a historic landmark of social injustice,” Tracey Ullman, the ambassador for The Power of Nutrition, told a crowd in London in April 2018.
The group also reported that after more than 5,000 activities calling for better nutrition for mothers and children in the UK, the government announced the funding project The Power of Nutrition, which reaches 5 million women and children in need of nutrition intervention.
In response to one of the CCPs on their website asking, “What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?”
Global Citizen responded: “It’s a long and difficult road – sometimes we fall down and fail.
But as we face the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements, we are sure of our success, because together we are more powerful.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are just a few of the performers who will perform at this year’s event in New York, led by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use naval “impediment” to block Russian energy exports
According to the Washington Examiner, Washington could use its navy if necessary to avoid a hit on the Russian energy market, including in the Middle East, US Interior Minister Ryan Zinke said.
Zinke argued that Russia’s involvement in Syria, especially if it operates at the invitation of a legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
“I think the reason they’re in the Middle East is because they want to mediate energy, as they do in Eastern Europe, on the stomach of Southern Europe,” he said.
And according to the official, there are ways and means to solve it.
"The United States has this opportunity to ensure, through our navy, that maritime lines are open and blocked if necessary, to ensure that their energy does not enter the market," he added.
Zinke’s statement was addressed to the participants of the event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that represents the US “voice of the energy consumer”.
He went on to compare Washington’s approach to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they are essentially the same.
“The economic choice between Iran and Russia is more or less the power and fuel replacement,” he said, referring to Russia as a “one-trick pony” whose economy relies on fossil fuels.
These statements come at a time when the Trump administration is tasked with increasing liquefied natural gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to eliminate the “unfit” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, turned Berlin into a “prisoner.”
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which doubles the capacity of the existing pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s acute response to the project has been driven simply by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said at the September meeting in Moscow with U.S. Energy Minister Rick Perry.
The U.S. position has been repulsed by Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industrial organisation, the German Industrial Union (BDI), called on the US to stay away from EU energy policy and from the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"It would be a big problem for me if a third country interferes with our energy supply," German Industry Union (BDI) chief Dieter Kempf said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren is seriously considering running for president in 2020, says Massachusetts Senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she was seriously considering running for president in the midterm elections.
In Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed his candidacy.
“Women have time to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and that includes the first lady,” he told The Hill.
“After November 6th, I will seriously consider running for president.”
Warren also gave an assessment of President Donald Trump's actions in the House of Commons, saying that it "leads the country in the wrong direction.
“I am seriously concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” he said.
Warren has expressed criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren said, “Of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote.”
However, a poll published on Thursday showed that most of Warren’s own voters do not think he should run in 2020.
According to a poll by Suffolk University’s Political Research Center/Boston Globe, 58% of “probable” Massachusetts voters thought the senator should not run.
Thirty-two percent supported this nomination.
The poll showed more support for former governor Deval Patrick's candidacy, 38% supported a possible candidacy, and 48% opposed it.
Other high-profile Democratic names discussed in connection with the possible 2020 candidacy include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make a formal decision in January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin Quotes at Donald Trump's Meeting Track Palin's PTSD
Track Palin (26) spent a year recruiting after Iraq in September.
He was arrested on Monday evening in connection with a case of domestic violence and was charged
“What my son is going through, what he’s going through when he comes back, I can relate to other families who feel the consequences of PTSD and the wounds our soldiers are coming back with,” Trump told a gathering in Tulsa.
He called for the arrest of his son "in the room" and said in connection with his son and other military veterans that "they will come back a little differently, they will come back with no restraints, they will come back wondering if there is enough respect for what the soldiers and the pilots have given you and all the troops."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and was charged with domestic violence by Dan Bennett, a spokesperson for the Wasilla Police Department, with his involvement in a report on domestic violence and possession of a weapon in a drunken state.
18 States and the Columbia Region Debate New Asylum Policy
Eighteen countries and the Columbia region are supporting a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that bans asylum-seekers fleeing violence or domestic violence.
Representatives of 18 countries and regions filed a brief statement from court friends in Washington on Friday to support a challenging policy related to the asylum seeker, NBC News reported.
The applicant’s full name, Grace v. Sessions, in the suit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against Union policy, has not been published.
The woman said she was abused by her “accompany and her violent gang members’ sons,” but U.S. officials did not accept her asylum application on July 20.
He was arrested in Texas.
National lawyers supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala as countries that produce a large number of U.S. asylum seekers, including gangs and domestic violence, as a major problem.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed the 2014 decision of the Immigrant Appeals Board, which allowed undocumented immigrants to flee from domestic violence.
In a statement on Friday, the Attorney General of the Columbia region, Karl Racine, said the new policy "discriminates decades of national, Union and international law".
“Federal law requires all asylum applications to be resolved in accordance with the specific facts and circumstances of the application and such a claim violates this principle,” the court said in a statement.
Lawyers also claimed in the brief statement that banning immigrants from entering the United States is damaging the U.S. economy, saying they are likely to become entrepreneurs and “provide the necessary workforce.”
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigrant judges in June to no longer provide shelter to victims fleeing domestic abuse and violence against the wealthy.
“The asylum application is available to those who leave their home country due to persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality, or a certain social group or political opinion,” Sessions said in a June 11 statement.
The goal of asylum has never been to alleviate all the problems - even all the serious problems that people face every day.
Amusement rescues in Palus, where deaths have doubled in the fight to find survivors
The situation was becoming more and more threatening to the survivors.
“The situation is very tense,” said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, who comforted her in her fever at the evacuation center of the torn-up town of Palu.
“Every minute there are new people in the ambulance.
“Clean water is not enough.”
Residents returned to their destroyed homes, sorting out the stuff they had gone through and trying to save everything they found.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals damaged by a 7.5-magnitude earthquake were overcrowded.
Some injured, including a broken back and shoulder arm, rested in Dwi Haris outside Palu Army Hospital, where patients continued to be treated outdoors due to severe follow-up.
The whistles filled her eyes as she remembered how a strong earthquake shook her fifth-floor hotel room, which she shared with her husband and daughter.
“It’s time to save yourself.
I think I was pressed against the wall,” Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family had come to the wedding.
“I heard my wife yelling, but then it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to him and my baby.
I hope they're not in danger."
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of ‘Troubled With Labor Ads’
A week after the Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement in the US daily news about the daily benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using American press to spread propaganda.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to an extra fee paid by the China Daily in the Des Moines Register — Iowa’s largest newspaper — after China was accused of interfering in the November 6 U.S. Congressional elections, which China denies.
Trump’s allegation that Beijing was trying to intervene in the U.S. election marked what U.S. officials described to Reuters as a new stage in Washington’s expanding campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in a growing trade war, where import tariffs are being adjusted for each other.
China’s countermeasures at the start of the tariff war were intended to target states like Iowa exporters as they supported Trump’s Republican parties, China and US experts have explained.
U.S. Ambassador to China and former Iowa governor, as well as China’s largest agricultural exporter Terry Branstad, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in a Des Moines Register opinion paper on Sunday: "China has now doubled its bullying by publishing diffraction advertisements in our free press."
“In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is using America’s expensive freedom of speech and free press practice by placing its paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“On the other hand, there is only a limited voice in the Beijing street kiosk, and you don’t see the really different views that the Chinese people may have on China’s worrying economic direction, given that the media is firmly under the control of the Chinese Communist Party,” he added.
He added that one of the most prominent Chinese newspapers refused to publish his article, but did not say which newspaper it was.
Analysts warn Republicans are alienating women voters before midterm elections in Kavanaugh fiasco
While many Republicans are waiting for and defending the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who has been accused of a number of sexual assaults, analysts have warned that they will see a setback during the upcoming midterm elections, especially for women.
The sentiments surrounding the situation have been lax, and most Republicans have already shown that they want to move on with the vote.
These things can’t be taken back,” Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the University of Syracuse at Maxwell School of Political Science, told The Hill on Saturday.
Reeher has expressed suspicion that the last-minute attempt by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) to investigate the FBI is sufficient to reassure angry voters.
"Women don't forget what happened yesterday - they don't forget it tomorrow or November," MoveOn's parental counsel and national representative Karine Jean-Pierre told the Washington DC newspaper on Friday.
On Friday morning, demonstrators repeated “November is coming!” at a demonstration in their Senate hallway because Republicans overseeing the judges’ committee decided to move on with Kavanaugh’s candidacy, despite Dr. Blasey Ford’s testimony, Mic said.
“Democratic inland and inland waterways are starting to get out of the chart,” unofficial political analyst Stu Rothenberg told reporters.
“People say it’s already high, it’s true.
But it can be higher, especially among women voters in the suburbs and younger voters aged 18-29 who don’t like the president and are often left out of the vote.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony, describing his allegations of sexual assault against a candidate of the Supreme Court, analysts predicted a setback as Republicans moved forward with confirmation.
“It has become very confusing for the GOP,” former chairman of the Republican National Committee Michael Steele told NBC News earlier this week.
“It’s not just about the Commission’s vote, the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh will be appointed, it’s also about how the Republicans have dealt with it and how they have treated it,” said the head of the U.S. House of Representatives at Priorities.
However, the Americans seem to be a bit divided, who believe in the testimonies of Ford and who Kavanaugh, but a little more in support of the first.
A new survey by YouGo showed that 41% of respondents believed in Ford's testimony, while 35% said they believed in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% said they thought Kavanaugh was probably or definitely lying during his testimony, while only 30% thought about the same Ford.
Thanks to Flake, the FBI is currently investigating Ford’s allegations and at least one other charge against Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford admitted to the Senate Judiciary Committee last week on oath that Kavanaugh attacked him when he was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate showed him his sexuality when they attended a party at Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web Inventor Plans to Start a New Internet That Would Stuck in the Bust with Google and Facebook
World Wide Web inventor Tim Berners-Lee has launched a startup that seeks to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project by the technology legend Inrupt is a company that builds the Berners-Lee open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people have been given access to the information.
In an exceptional interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt's aim was "to rule the world".
“We have to do it now,” he said of the start-up.
“This is a historic moment.”
The application uses Solid technology to enable people to create their own “personal online data collection” or POD.
It can include contact lists, task lists, calendar, music collection, and other personal and competent tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, which are all available in one browser and at the same time.
This personal online database makes it unique for the user to be able to choose who will be able to access this information.
The company refers to it as “Personal Authorization through Data”.
According to John Bruce, head of the company, Inrupt’s idea is that the company will bring the resources, process and relevant skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
Currently, the company consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform acquired by IBM, some developers hired to work on the project under a contract, and a community of volunteer encoders.
As of this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether to introduce a complete change if all of their business models are fully supported overnight.
“We don’t ask for their permission.”
In a post published on Saturday in Medioum, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt’s goal is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web created on the basis of Solid.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Even when Inrupt is launched, Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
“I am extremely optimistic about the next era of the web,” added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: The Spiritual Cross of Victoria was opened in World War I
The only church in England to receive the Victorian Cross during World War I celebrated its 100th anniversary in its hometown.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann fought out his medal in the attack of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt on 29 September 1918.
But four days later, he was shot dead by a sniper and did not know that he had been awarded the highest British military honor.
Her two grandsons opened a memorial stone on Saturday in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it would be “genially symbolic” if the stone were opened exactly 100 years after his grandfather’s award-winning struggle.
According to the London Gazette, Lieutenant Colonel Vann on 29 September 1918 led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a very thick fog of japs and bullets."
Later, he rushes to the line of attack and carries it on with a "greatest galvanization" before he rushes to one of the bullets alone and kills three opponents indiscriminately.
Colonel Vanni was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, when only a little more than a month was left until the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “something I know I can never repeat, but for which I am always grateful.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, set the bar for a parade led by Brentwood's Royal Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was "very honoured to participate in this parade" and added that "the presence and support of so many people shows that a true hero can be appreciated."
MMA fans were up all night watching Bellator 206, but only saw P<0xC3><0xB5>rsas Peppa
Imagine that you’ve been up all night to watch the Bellator 206, but this basic event isn’t shown to you.
The San Jose match featured 13 fights, including six on the main map, and was shown live on Channel 5 throughout the night in the United Kingdom.
At 6 a.m., when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to hit each other's breasts, UK viewers were left with a gunshot because Peppa appeared on the screen.
Many were not thrilled by this, especially those who had stayed awake until early hours to see this struggle.
One fan described the transition to children’s comedy on Twitter as “a lot of hurting jokes.”
“It’s government regulation that the content was no longer appropriate at 6:00 and they had to switch to the children’s program,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and communications when asked about the broadcast.
“Peppa, yes.”
Bellator President Scott Coker said they intend to work on their timetable to take more of the UK's viewers into account in the future.
“When I think about the replay now, I think we’ll be able to solve this problem in the future,” Coker said.
“But if it is there at 6 a.m. on Sunday morning, we cannot do it before our own Sunday, which is their Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program was changed, there was a lot of back and forth text and not all of them were not friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical issue.
But it wasn’t, it was a government rule.
I can assure you that next time this will not happen.
We show references instead of six fights – as we usually do – we tried to offer more to the fans and we just went over time.
It’s a tough situation.”
Previous articleDesert Island Discs: Tom Daley Feels ‘Undervalued’ About Sexuality
Olympic-winning diver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling that he was inferior to others because of his sexuality — but that gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn’t realize until high school that “everyone is not like him.”
While attending Lauren Laverne's Radio 4 broadcast Desert Island Discs, he said he was talking about gay rights to give others hope.
Being a parent also changed her attitude to winning the Olympics, giving her the feeling that it’s not that important anymore.
You can get the usual long-term envoy Kirsty Young had to take a few months off due to her illness.
In Laverne's first broadcast, Daley said she felt growing up less valuable than others because it wasn't socially acceptable when you liked boys and girls.
He said, “To this day, these feelings that I am not worthy and feel different have given me the power and strength to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was "something" worth it, and did not let others down when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The two-time bronze Olympic winner has become the leader of the highly-rated LGBT campaign, using his appearance at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to turn to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he is talking about it because he is lucky that he is able to live openly without consequences and wants to give hope to others as well.
The three-time world champion said falling in love with a man - American film artist Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "was a surprise for him."
Daley was married last year to an Oscar winner over 20 years old, but she said the age difference was never a problem.
“When you’re young enough to live through so much,” he went to his first Olympics at the age of 14, and his father died of cancer three years later, “it was hard to find someone the same old who had experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple became parents in June, they have a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said his “whole outlook” has changed.
“If you had asked me last year, it was all about winning a gold medal,” he said.
“But you know, there are a lot more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said her father did not agree to die and one of the last things she asked was whether they had tickets to London in 2012 - because she wanted to sit in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him, ‘Father, you can’t sit in the front row because you’re gone by now,’” he said.
“I held her hand when she stopped breathing, and it was only after she had actually stopped breathing and died that I finally admitted that she wasn’t invincible,” she said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
“I just knew it was what I had dreamed of all my life – diving in front of the crowd at home at the Olympics, there’s no better feeling,” he said.
It also inspired her first selection of songs - Heather Small's Proud - which helped her prepare for the Olympics and still gives her a chickpeas.

Mickelson was removed from the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson sets a record on Sunday as he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he needs to improve his form to avoid unfortunate progress.
Mickelson, who plays for the record 12th time every two years, was removed from the game by captain Jim Furyk for a Saturday pairs game and four balls.
Instead of being in the middle of the action, as he has often been for the United States, the five-time winner divided his day into two, being an encouragement and working on his game, hoping to improve it.
Never the most direct hitter, not even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old is not particularly suited to play on the narrow Le Golf National golf course, where a long hard track penalizes missed hits all the time.
And if the pitch itself isn’t scary enough, Mickelson will stand on Sunday, in his ninth race, facing the exact British Open champion Francesco Molina, who has joined forces with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of his races this week.
If the Americans, who are 12 points behind at the start of a single game with four points, start with fire, the Mickelson match could be extremely important.
Furyk expressed confidence in her husband, but he had not much else to add.
“He fully understood his part of today, shoved me on the shoulder, put his hand around my shoulder and said it was ready for tomorrow,” Furyk added.
“He is very confident.
He's a celebrity and he's given so much to our teams both in the past and this week.
I didn’t expect him to play two games.
I expected more, but it went like that and we had to choose that path.
He wants to be out, just like everyone else.”
Mickelson will pass Nick Faldo's record as the most played player in the Ryder Cup games on Sunday.
This may mark the end of his Ryder Cup career, which has never met his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven weeks, but Furyk said his presence has made the team an additional spiritual contribution.
"He's funny, he's witty, he likes to have fun with people and he's just great in the team room," he explained.
“I think the younger players had a lot of fun going against him this week and it was great to see it.
It’s more than just a game.”
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the great advance may soon disappear
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows from his own experience that the great leadership position of the Ryder Cup on the last day at the start of the individual games can easily become an unpleasant experience.
The Danish went public at the 1997 competition in Valderrama, where, together with Captain Seve Ballesteros, a five-point lead was held in front of the Americans, but when it reached the finish line it had drastically declined, winning only with a result of 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 : 131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“You even remember that we had a great leadership position in Valderrama; we had great success in Brookline, where we lost and in Valderrama, where we won, this victory came very barely,” Bjorn said after a Class of 2018 victory 5:3 on Friday and a National victory of 6 Le 10 yesterday.
So history shows me and the whole team that it can happen again.
You're going to do your best tomorrow.
You go out and do the right thing.
It's not over until you've got points in writing.
We have a goal, which is to win the championship, and so we focus on that.
I have always said I focus on the 12 players who are on our side, but we are very aware of who our opponents are - the best players in the world."
Satisfied with how his players have played on this difficult golf course, Bjorn added: “I’m not going to get ahead of things.
Tomorrow will be a whole new obstacle.
We’ll have a personal experience tomorrow, so it’s something else.
It’s great to be with an opponent when things go well, but if you’re there in person, you’ll be fully tested as a golfer.
This is the message you need to convey to the players - give your best tomorrow.
Now that you leave your partner behind, he has to go and do it himself.”
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk hopes that his players will perform better in person than with opponents, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Furyk himself has experienced both over the past few days, being part of Brookline's winning team, before becoming part of a loss when Europe undertook "The Miracle of Medina".
"I remember every damn word," he said in response to a question about how in 1999 Captain Ben Crenshaw encouraged his players to put all of his game on the last day.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you have to start with fire, like in Brookline and like in Medina.
When the swing goes in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle class.
We're setting up our team accordingly and putting the boys on the pitch in a way that makes us feel like a miracle can be born tomorrow."
Thomas has been given the task of trying to lead the competition and he has the best encounters with Rory McIlroy, along with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahmi, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as well as other top Europeans in the competition.
“I put my boys in that order because I think that’s how we’re properly covered,” Bjorn said of his choice of individual games.
Germany's new warship has been delayed again.
The German navy's newest high-speed cruiser should have come into service in 2014, replacing outdated Cold War-era warships, but it won't happen until next year due to faulty systems and increased snowball costs, local media reported.
The deployment of the new Baden-Württemberg-class cruiser "Rheinland-Pfalz" has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to a military press release published in Die Zeit.
The ship should have joined the Navy as early as 2014, but the worrying post-delivery problems did not make this ambitious project a success.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will be replaced by the outdated Bremen-class speedboats.
It is understandable that they have a powerful rabbit, a host of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, and some concealment technologies such as radar, infrared and audible signals reduction.
Other important options include longer periods of maintenance - the latest fast-trackers should be able to be sent out from home for up to two years.
Continuous delays, however, mean that state-of-the-art warships - which allow Germany to strengthen power abroad - are already becoming obsolete by the time it enters service.
An unsuccessful F125 crash was reported last year when the German Navy officially refused to take the ship into service and returned it to the Hamburg Blohm & Voss shipyard.
This was the first time the Navy had sent the ship back to the shipbuilder after receiving it.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but the German media cited a number of significant "software and hardware deficiencies" that would render the warship unusable if used on combat missions.
The software deficiencies were particularly important, as the Baden-Württemberg-class ships are managed by a crew of about 120 sailors - only half of the workforce of older Bremen-class speedboats.
It also turned out that the ship is significantly overweight, which reduces its performance and limits the Navy’s ability to add future innovations.
The 7,000-ton Rhineland-Palatinate is believed to be twice as heavy as the same class of ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the defective hardware, the cost of the entire project, including the training of the team, also becomes a problem.
It has been said to amount to 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars) - compared to the original 2.2 billion euros.
The problems associated with the newer rapid launches are becoming particularly important in the light of recent warnings that the German navy’s capacity is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the German Parliamentary Defence Committee, acknowledged that the navy had in fact "killed the ships that could be withdrawn".
The official said the issue has grown as a snowball over time, as the old ships were removed, but the replacement ships did not come.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Württemberg high-speed cruisers could join the navy.
The National Trust investigates the secrecy of skin diseases
A new study in the Scottish Mountains aims to reveal how skinheads use the landscape to search for their food.
The results are expected to shed new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help guide future safeguards.
Research by Scottish National Trust scientists traces conventional and soprano pipes, as well as brown longtails and Daubenton fur, in the gardens of Inverewe in Wester Ross.
Special recorders are positioned in the main locations of the area to monitor the activity of skin rashes throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers also conduct outdoor research using handheld sensors.
The competent assessment of all records determines the frequency and activity of skin rashes.
A map of habitats and a report are then created to create a detailed landscape picture of their behaviour.
NTS conservation consultant Rob Dewar hopes that the results will show which habitats are the most important for scallops and how different species use them.
This information will help to determine the usefulness of habitat management, such as the creation of meadows and how best to conserve forests for skinheads and other related species.
In Scotland and the United Kingdom as a whole, the number of fur coats has decreased significantly in the last century.
They are endangered by construction and development activities that affect their habitat and its loss.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a threat, as can the chemical treatment of flying papers and some building materials, as well as attacks from pet cats.
The skinheads aren't really blind.
However, because of their night hunting, their ears are more useful in catching prey than their eyes.
They use complex habitat techniques to identify the insects and obstacles on their flight pathways.
The NTS, which is responsible for the maintenance of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes skin rashes very seriously.
They have ten trained specialists who conduct regular surveys, inspections, and sometimes even rescues.
The organization has even set up Scotland's first and only special skin reserve in the Thrave area in Dumfrie and Galloways, where eight of Scotland's ten skin species live.
Property manager David Thompson says that this area is the ideal territory for them.
“At Threeave, we have a big area for skinny hair,” he said.
“We have old buildings, lots of old trees and a great place to live.
But there’s a lot more to discover about skin rashes, so the work we do here and in other areas helps us better understand what they need.”
He stresses the importance of screening for skin rashes before starting a real estate care activity, as the undesirable destruction of one place of pregnancy and childbirth can kill up to 400 women and young people, and even destroy the entire local population.
Leatherheads are protected and their killing, harassment or destruction is illegal.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish officer of the Leatherhead Defence Union, has encouraged the public to help.
He said: “We still have so much to learn about our skin rashes and we just don’t know how many of our species and how their larvae feed.”
Ronaldo Rejects Rape Charges While Lawyers Plan to Complain to German Magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has dismissed the rape charges against him as “fake news,” saying people “want to advertise themselves” using his name.
His lawyers are planning to sue the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which published the accusations.
The Portuguese and Youth attackers were accused of raping Kathryn Mayor in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
She reportedly paid a woman's allowance of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>330,643.10 to avoid talking about the incident, Der Spiegel said on Friday.
Turning to a live Instagram video of its 142 million followers half an hour after the accusations, Ronaldo, 33, said it was “fake news.”
“No, no, no, no, no.
Today's untold is fake news," Ballon d'Or, a five-time winner, told the news.
They want to advertise themselves by my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous by my name, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and all right," the player added smiling.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to file a complaint with Der Spiegel about “unauthorized disclosure of suspicions about privacy.”
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player is seeking compensation "for causing moral damage that corresponds to the severity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged case took place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at the nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayor reportedly returned to the player's hotel room, where he was allegedly raped on the basis of documents filed by Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told him that he was “99 percent a good man”, of whom “one percent is down”.
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed the couple's sexual relationship, but it was not unanimous.
He also claims that he went to the police and took photos of the injuries in the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court solution because he was afraid of "payback" and was concerned about "public humiliation".
Now, the 34-year-old woman says she is now trying to refute the solution as the alleged case continues to traumatize her.
Ronaldo had left Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack and joined Real Madrid and this summer he moved the giant Juve to Italy for a deal worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million.
Brexit: One may begin to regret the departure of automakers forever
The United Kingdom would "forgive it forever" if it lost its position as the world's leader in the automotive industry after Brexit, Secretary of Commerce Greg Clark said.
He added that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if the UK leaves the EU without a deal, it would temporarily suspend their production facility near Derby, Burnaston.
"We need a deal," Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of border stoppages without a Brexit deal could pay for jobs.
The Burnastone plant, which manufactures Toyota Auris and Avensis vehicles, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“My view is that if the UK starts leaving the EU at the end of March, we will see a stop to the manufacturing process at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, CEO of Burnastone Toyota.
Other UK automakers have also been afraid to leave the EU without agreements, feeling concerned about the functioning of cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says it will shut down its Oxford-based Mini plant after Brexit for one month.
The main concerns of automakers are related to supply chain risks in the absence of a Brexit deal.
Toyota’s production line works as needed, with spare parts arriving from both the UK and the EU every 37 minutes.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without an agreement concluded on 29 March, there may be disturbances at the border that, according to industry, could lead to delays and a lack of parts.
Toyota would not be able to keep more than one day of stock at its Derbyshire plant, so production must be stopped.
Clark said Theresa May Chequers' plan for future EU relations was "precisely calibrated to avoid such border checks."
"We want an agreement. We want the best solution that allows what we want, and not just to take advantage of the current success, but to take full advantage of the opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4 Today.
“The evidence not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers shows that we need to be able to continue what has been a very successful supply chain set.”
Toyota was unable to say how long production would be halted, but in the longer term warned that the additional costs would reduce the factory’s competitiveness and ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, a spokesperson for Unite, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years, said that its members are increasingly concerned: “We know from our experience that when jobs disappear, they will not come back.
A government spokesperson said: "We have presented a precise and reliable plan for our future relations with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, says White House
Donald Trump's high-profile meeting with Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be delayed by another week as the fight against top-ranking candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein is monitoring the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating the Russian election intervention, the relationship between Trump’s aide and Russia, and the president’s obstruction of possible justice.
If Trump fires the deputy attorney general and thereby threatens Mueller’s independence, Washington has been igniting rumors for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the use of hearing aids and the possibility of removing the president through the 25th Amendment to record conversations with Trump.
Rosenstein didn't confirm it.
But last Monday he went to the White House, announcing that he was going to step back.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then in New York at the UN, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said he did not want to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid meeting with a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey, and Minds.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh, delaying the Senate vote.
Trump's spokesperson, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: “This date has not yet been set, it may be this week, but it may be postponed by another week, taking into account all the things that are going on with the Supreme Court.
But let’s look at it and keep the press up to date, as always.”
Some journalists would dispute this claim: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
Chief of Staff Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the lack of hours of information was not due to the disappointment of TV journalists, although he added: "I do not dispute the fact that they have been made disappointed."
He then suggested direct contact between Trump and the press.
“The president is making more questions and answers to the session than any president before him,” he said, adding evidence: “We’ve looked at those numbers.”
“If the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly from the President of the United States, it’s much better than talking to me,” Sanders said.
We’re trying to do this a lot, and you’ve seen how we’ve done it over the last few weeks, so it’s happening during the press conference, when you can talk to the President of the United States.”
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or press conferences with guests.
Solo press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president demonstrated perhaps why, having gathered in front of journalists on a free ride and sometimes with a strange appearance .
Health Minister writes to EU workers NHS in Scotland over fears of Brexit
The Minister of Health has written to EU workers working in the Scottish NHS to express their gratitude to the country and wishing for their presence after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter after less than six months before the UK left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already undertaken to cover the costs related to the status of EU citizens who work in its public services.
Freeman wrote in his letter: “Negotiations have continued this summer on the UK-EU regression towards the expected decisions this autumn.
However, the UK Government has also made preparations for a possible non-agreement scenario.
I know this is a very disturbing time for you.
That is why I wanted to reiterate how much I appreciate each employee’s contribution, regardless of his or her nationality.
Amethyst colleagues from across the EU and elsewhere bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of healthcare and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after major trauma
Tennessee State Tigers backer Christion Abercrombie underwent an emergency cut after Saturday's head injury and beating 31:27 from Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessee Mike Organ said.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred just before half-time.
"He fell flat and just collapsed," Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen while on the sidelines before he was placed on the support frame for further inspection from the field.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris (WSMV - Nashville, Tennessee) that Abercrombie's operation at Vanderbilt Medical Center has ended.
Harris added that no details were available about the type/range of the injury and Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Red-shirted second-year student Abercrombie was in his first season in Tennessee State after coming over from Illinois.
He had five fights on Saturday before leaving the game, which made a total of 18 games this season.
Foreign buyers are required to pay a higher Templar tax when buying real estate in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher temple fee when they buy real estate in the UK, using this extra cash to help the homeless under the new Tory plans.
This Step Makes Corbyn's Aspiration to Attract Young Voters Harmless
The stamp duty shall be levied on those who do not pay tax in the United Kingdom
The Ministry of Finance hopes that it will create up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher temple tax rate if they buy real estate in the UK, using it to help the homeless, Theresa May said today.
The move is seen as an attempt to undermine Jeremy Corbyn’s drive to lure young voters with promises to provide them affordable housing and target high-income people.
The Templar Tax will tax individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK, directing the government’s desire to fight homelessness.
The surcharge – which is in addition to this Temporary Fee, including the higher levels established two years ago for the second home and for forwarding-related purchases – may be up to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance hopes that this movement will generate up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year.
It is estimated that 13% of the properties purchased in London belong to non-UK residents, which raises prices and makes it difficult for first-time buyers to get under foot when buying housing.
Many of the country's rich regions - especially in the capital - have become "ghost cities" thanks to a large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time out of the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a tax cut to help young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping property prices high when they buy land but don't use it, and called on Mayd to abandon quotas for affordable homes to correct Britain's "life-style embarrassment".
Corbyn has announced a sweeping reform of the housing economy, including rent controls and a halt to the harassment of innocent people.
He also wants to give the councils more powers to build new homes.
May said: “Last year, as Prime Minister, I pledged to restore the British dream – that life would be better for every new generation.
And that means improving our broken housing market.
The UK is always open to people who want to live, work and build their own lives here.
It is true, however, that it is as easy for individuals who do not live in the UK as it is for companies located abroad to buy homes as it is for hard-working British residents.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home has become too far away, and harsh sleeping conditions are a common reality.”
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate goal is to lead Scotland'
Sunderlani leader Jack Ross says his “final goal” is to become the leader of Scotland at some point.
Scotsman (42) is pleased with the challenge of re-establishing the North-East club, which is currently in third place in League One, with only 3 points behind.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St Mirren back to the Scottish Champions League last season.
“I wanted to represent my country as a player.
I got a B-Class and it was limited," Ross told Sportsound.
“But I grew up with my father in Hampden, Scotland, and that’s always something that has pulled me back.
But this opportunity will only come if I am successful in the management of the club."
Ross' predecessors to Sunderland have been Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former head of Alloa Athletic says he did not feel the fear of such large and well-known names, having previously faced both Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“For me, it’s a success at the moment to be able to take this club to the Champions League.”
Due to its structure and facilities, this club is undoubtedly part of the Champions League," he said.
“It’s not an easy task to reach you, but I only see myself as a success if I manage to get the club back there.”
Ross has worked as a manager for only three years, previously as Deputy Director of Dumbarton and 15 months as a senior executive at Hearts.
He then helped Alloa recover from a third-level drop and turned St Mirren's lowest position into the winner of the next championship.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he was during his career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
“It was a real crossroads,” he recalled taking Alloa.
“I really believed that driving was more appropriate for me than playing.
It seems strange because I was able to do it, I got a reasonable income, and I enjoyed some of the highlights.
But playing can be difficult.
There are a lot of things that need to be done every week.
I’m still experiencing this with the stress and pressure of my work in mind, but the leadership just seems to be more right.
I’ve always wanted to drive, and now I’m doing it. I feel more comfortable now than ever in adulthood.”

According to research, the best time for the surface is on Saturday at 5:30 p.m.
The summer heat has improved the UK’s troubled pub turnover, but greater pressure has been exerted on restaurant chains.
The figures showed that the turnover of pubs and bars increased by 2.7% in July, but restaurants fell by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, CGA’s representative for the business consultancy, said: “Continuously longer than expected participation in the Sunshine and England World Championships meant that July was similar to June, when pubs grew by 2.8 percent, except for the fact that restaurants were still racing.
In June, the 1.8% decline in restaurant trade deteriorated further in July.
Drink-based pubs and bars traded the most successfully and liked trying restaurants the poorest.
The food-based pubs also suffered despite the sun, although not as dramatically as the restaurant owners.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
Between managed pubs and bars, beverage sales increased by 6.6 percent over the month, while food sales fell by three percent.
Paul Newman, an analyst on leisure and hospitality, said: “These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
Weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factor when it comes to sales outside the domestic market.
It is not surprising that restaurant chains continue to fight, although a 4.8 percent drop in sales compared to the previous year is particularly painful in addition to the ongoing price pressure.

One in Five Children Have Secret Social Media Accounts They Hide From Their Parents
The study found that one in five children, some of them 11 years old, have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A study of 20,000 high school students found the growth of “fake Insta” pages
The news heightened the fear that sexual content will be posted
Twenty percent of the students said they had a “basic account” for showing parents
The study found that one in five children, some only 11-year-olds, create secret social media accounts that they hide from adults.
A study of 20,000 high school students found a significant increase in “fake Insta” accounts (referring to the image sharing page on Instagram).
The news raised the fear that sexual content would be posted.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a “basic account” for showing to parents as well as an acceptable account.
One of the discoverers of the secret page of her 13-year-old daughter saw that the teenager invited others to rape themselves.
Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) found that 40 percent of 11- to 18-year-olds owned two profiles and half of them acknowledged the existence of personal accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of HMC, said: “It’s disturbing to see so many teenagers being tempted to create accounts online where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Doyle will be a spokesperson for athletes on the board of Scottish Athletics
At the annual meeting of the Board of Scottish Athletics, Eilidh Doyle was elected non-executive leader of the Executive Board.
Doyle is Scotland’s most acclaimed lightweight athlete and chairman Ian Beattie described what happened as a good opportunity for sports enthusiasts to benefit from his extensive international experience over the last decade.
“Eilidhi is respected everywhere in Scotland, in the UK and in other sports communities, and we are confident that Scottish athletes will benefit from his leadership vocation,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I need to be a spokesperson for the athletes and I hope that I can make a real contribution to Scotland’s sport and contribute to its development.”
The American, who won four Olympic golds at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics in the 200 metres and 400 metres in total and now frequently shares his views on the BBC, was unable to walk after a transient ischemic attack.
He tweeted: “I had a blast a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that if I recover and if, then to what extent, only time shows.
I’ve done a lot of hard work, but I’ve recovered completely, learned to walk again, and I’m already doing speed training!
Thank you for your encouraging messages!”
Breast pump advertising, which compares women to cows, divides the internet into two
The breast pump company has shared the internet with two camps of advertisements comparing a breastfeeding mother to a milking cow.
In celebration of the presentation of the world’s first silent-carrying breast pump, Elvie, a consumer-focused technology company, released an ironic music video-like advertisement to showcase the freedom this new pump gives to mothers who want to live out.
Four real moms dance with cows on a full board and sing, "Yes, I'm running myself, but you don't see a tail on me" and, "If you haven't noticed, these aren't bulls, these are my breasts."
The psalm repeats: “Pump, pump, feed the children, pump, pump, fill my damasks with milk.”
However, the advertising posted on the company’s Facebook page has generated similar opinions on the Internet.
Video viewers with 77,000 views and thousands of comments are dissenting, many of whom say that it illuminates the dairy industry’s tents.
“The use of cows to advertise this product was a very bad decision.
“Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but the difference is that they are stolen from them for days after birth.”
Elvie Breast Pump Doesn't Torch Breastfeeder Eye (Elvie/Mother)
Another commentator said: “Obviously traumatic for both mother and child.
But why not use these to advertise breast pumps for mothers who can still keep their children?”
Someone added: "A completely unsatisfactory advertisement."
Some of it's advertising, and one woman thought the story was fun.
“I think it’s a brilliant idea.
I would buy one if I were still breastfeeding.
The milk pump made me feel like a cow.
Advertising is a bit of a turnaround, but let's take it the way it is.
“It’s a great product,” one wrote.
Another commented: “It’s a fun advertisement (often in your workplace or in your water) for mothers who pump and feel like cows.
This advertisement does not applaud or condemn the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women reveals that they have all danced in their bras with unobtrusive pumps.
The idea of the campaign is based on the saying that many breast milk pumping women feel like cows.
But the Elvie Pump is completely quiet, has no wires or pipes and does not look like an infant carrier, giving women the freedom to move around, keep children and even go outdoors while pumping.
Mother’s partner and ECD Ana Balarin commented: “The Elvie Pump is such an innovative product that it deserves a bold and irritating introduction.
We wanted to highlight breast pumping and all its challenges with the comparison of women’s expression and dairy cows, while presenting with an entertaining and familiar key the extraordinary freedom that the new pump creates.
This isn't the first time news has hit Elvie's pump.
During the London fashion show, the mother of two children, Marta Jakubowski, a costume designer, appeared wearing the product.
Thousands of migrant children silently camped on Texas border
The number of children displaced by migrants has risen sharply, although monthly border crossings have remained quite the same. Partly because the harsh rhetoric and policies enforced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to establish children with the help of sponsors.
Typically, most sponsors are immigrants with documents and they are afraid of violating the possibility of staying in their country, for this they require the right to care for the child.
The risk increased in June, when the national authorities announced that potential sponsors and other household-owned adults could provide fingerprints and data will be shared with immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs officer, admitted to Congress last week that the agency had arrested a dozen people who had applied for financial support from non-compliant minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of the detainees lacked a criminal record.
“Nearly 80 percent of sponsors or household members are illegally staying in the country, and a large number of them have a criminal background.
So we will continue to pursue them,” Mr. Albence said.
In order to deal with children more quickly, officials imposed new rules that require some of them to appear in court within a month of their arrest, according to asylum workers in 60 days.
Many defend their legal content from the immigration judge by videoconferencing, coming to the spot.
Those who are unsuitable for release will be sent out of the country quickly.
According to asylum workers, and based on reports from the system published in recent months - the longer the child is in custody, the more likely they are to become nervous or depressed, which can lead to violent protests or escape tests.
According to lawyers, these concerns are more relevant in large detention facilities such as Tornillo, where a child’s difficulty may remain between the two eyes due to the size of the child.
They added that moving children to a tent without enough time to get used to the hours or to say goodbye to friends can lead to trauma that many are already in trouble.
Syria demands immediate withdrawal of U.S., French and Turkish occupation forces
Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem has called on Syrian refugees to return home to the UN General Assembly, despite the country being at war for eight years.
Moualemi, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, said the foreign forces on the Syrian soil were illegally engaged in counterterrorism and are being treated accordingly.
“They have to leave immediately and unconditionally,” he said in the assembly.
Moualem said that Syria's "anti-terrorist war is almost over." Since 2011, more than 360,000 people have died and millions more have left their homes.
He said that Damascus will continue to fight in this holy war until we have cleared the entire Syrian territory of both terrorist groups and “any foreign force illegally in place.”
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising both Kurdish units and Syrian Arabs who are opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in a war-torn country.
Speaking about the refugees, Moualem said the conditions for their return were appropriate and blamed the incomprehensible fears that would prevent the arrival of refugees for spreading part of the West.
“We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to help them get involved,” he said.
“They’re politicizing something that’s just a humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not be given reconstruction aid until there is an end to the war between Assad and the opposition.
According to the UN diplomats, the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create the last rebel base in the Idlib buffer zone has created an opportunity for further political talks.
The Russo-Turkish agreement prevented a wide range of Russian-backed Syrian forces in the province with a population of three million.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had “clear deadlines” and expressed hope that military action would hit the jihadists, including the Nusra Front soldiers linked to Al-Qaeda, who were “destroyed.”
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convince a new committee of government and opposition members with its first meetings to draft a post-war Syrian constitution and pave the way for elections.
Moualem called on the Syrian government to participate in the committee, saying the panel's work could be limited to reviewing the articles of the current constitution and warned against intervention.
Why Trump will be elected for a second term
According to this logic, Trump could win the next election in 2020 if his resignation and scandal had not previously ended his presidency, as liberal viewers probably want.
What would undoubtedly be “the most exciting end of the presidency!”
At the moment, viewers do not show signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, the top hour ratings have doubled, reaching more than 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at the peak hour. Compared to 1.7 million viewers four years ago, their number has increased. MSNBC can "The Rachel Maddow Show" 3.5 million viewers have kept this rating high among the most haunted.
"It's the tension we're involved in because we don't understand it," ABC's head of the drama Designated Survivor said of the Secretary of State who will become president if the attack destroys the House of Representatives.

He recalls the 2016 pre-election taxi ride in Boston.
The leader told him he was voting for Mr. Trump.
“Why?” he asked.
“He said he made me laugh,” Mrs. Scovell told me.
All of this chaos has an entertaining value.
Of course, unlike other TV shows, Washington’s rumors could become fateful to Roe v. Wade’s future and reunite with immigrant families and the global economy.
Staying away from the theme is only the luxury of the spectators in the foreground.

He could not help but see how Brett Kavanaugh would act on the Senate Judiciary Committee and how the fate of the Supreme Court hung at the end of the hair.
“I remember how we did all sorts of crazy things in our own time, and people said it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization,” Fleiss told me.

Elsewhere, cash flows move to the most acute White House midterm elections
It is not surprising that the money flow to the 17th District of Pennsylvania is due to the reorganization of the congressional area, sending two market-dominant operators to the same place.
This resulted in Conor Lamb from the Democratic Republic of Pittsburgh, the prefecture of Pittsburgh, who won the spot in the second district in an emergency election last spring.
Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former Pennsylvania 12th district, is the one who overlaps the larger section with the new 17th.
The maps were modified following the January decision of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, which resulted in the old districts being divided into unconstitutional constituencies, favoring Republicans.
The new 17th election has saved a campaign in which the financial departments of the largest parties — the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (DCCC) and the Republican Campaign National Committee (NRCC) — are trumping themselves with money.
Lamb became famous in Pennsylvania after a snap victory in the widely viewed March 18th Pennsylvania Congressional District Extraordinary Elections.
It has been a Republican for decades and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Politicians have given the Democrats a small advantage.
U.S. El Salvador Sentenced for Supporting China, Then Withdrawn
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama already recognized Beijing, which was a small setback for Washington.
Mr Trump met in June 2017 in a friendly atmosphere with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varel and his Panama hotel until partners threw out the Trump Company’s management team.
Foreign ministry officials in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama have decided to recall the American leaders of the diplomatic mission, as the ministry’s spokeswoman Heather Nauert said earlier this month that these countries were no longer backing Taiwan.
However, only El Salvador, which received $140 million in aid from the United States in 2017, was planned to be punished, including for drug surveillance, development and economic stimulus.
The proposed penalties, which included reductions in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and the number of killings.
During internal meetings, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level consultation aimed at security and economic prosperity in order to organize a follow-up to a meeting similar to the one held last year, which was seen as a pre-development effort.
But in mid-September, senior officials clarified that they wanted to continue the talks and end discussions on any El Salvador sanctions.
According to diplomats, Vice President Mike Pence, who is speaking at a mid-October meeting, is now being counted to talk about the government's views.
And the three American envoys returned secretly to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without any new harsh announcements or sanctions from Washington.
A White House spokesperson, Mr Bolton, refused to comment on the unreported details of three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss national discussions on the grounds of anonymity.
Their discussions were confirmed by an analyst close to the government, who also spoke on demand of anonymity.
The History of Teachers
Next, Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller may be publishing a report on Trump’s possible jurisprudence, about which there is a lot of evidence in the state archives.
Mueller is also reportedly investigating in his study whether Trump’s campaign is linked to Russia’s attack on our elections.
If Congress were to change a party, Trump would have to report to that body as if he were going to talk to voters and maybe even his peers again.
There are a lot of things here, and I don’t want to point out that neither Trump nor his European counterparts are inevitable.
We all have to make a choice on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the duration of the struggle.
In 1938, German officials were ready for a coup d'état against Hitler, if only the West had prevented and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We drowned and missed the opportunity to avoid the subsequent multi-year killings.
History revolves around such turning points, and the love of democracy marches closer or forward.
Americans are now facing a number of turning points.
What do we do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in boiling water since it was announced last year that he had proposed a covert recording of the president and speculated about his ineligibility for the position.
Rosenstein says the Times statement is inaccurate.
“How to respond if the FBI’s investigation into Brett Kavanaugh’s recent request is not complete or fair – or if he is confirmed in the U.S. Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we vote for Congress in the midterm elections if Trump should take responsibility?
If these tests fail, democracy will go on a long winter vacation.
But I don't think we're going to fail because we've learned from Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew, who was summoned by the same Nazi regime in Auschwitz, who once took over and used our embassy.
He survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later he sent me a nail light on a table with a hook.
With such a legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?”

Rangers' Graham Dorrans is optimistic about Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that the victory over Australia, which followed an impressive lead against Villarreal in Spain earlier this month, puts them in a strong position to become the Europa League G group.
The knee injury did not allow midfielder Graham Dorrans to make the first appearance of the season before a 2–2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use this result as a jumping field for better results.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal is a strong opponent," said the 31-year-old.
“We went to the game, believing we could achieve something and left the game with a point.
We might have been able to achieve more, but in general, it was a fair result.
They were better in the first half of the game and again in the second half.
Thursday will once again be a great and important European night.
Hopefully we will get three points, but it will be a tough game because they got a good result in their last game, but because the people support us, I am sure we can get together and get a good result.
Last year was a tough year, thanks to that, I was injured and there were changes inside the club, but now we all have a good sense of interior.
The team is good and the guys really enjoy it; the training is good.
Hopefully we can move on now, leave the previous season behind and be successful.”
Women can’t sleep because of fear of retirement insurance
Despite the fact that the survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few discussed this with their family members.
About half of the participants in the nationwide study said they were talking to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they had talked about it with their children.
“People want family members to take care of them, but at the same time they don’t talk about it,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance activities at Nationwide.
This should, however, be started.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare to take care of your family if they don’t know your wishes in advance.
Work with your counselor and family to discuss where and how to get care, as these choices can be extremely important in terms of costs.
Consult with your financial advisor: Your advisor may have a good plan for how to pay for these expenses.
Your financing options related to long-term care may include, for example, a traditional long-term maintenance insurance policy, a hybrid value life insurance policy to help cover those costs, or a property self-insurance policy – as long as you have the necessary money.
Prepare your legal documents: Stop all possible legal battles as early as the age of.
Take care of yourself by a health care commissioner to identify a trustee who will monitor your medical care and ensure that specialists will comply with your wishes at a time when you are unable to communicate.
You should also consider the trustworthiness of your finances.
Choose a trusted person who would make financial decisions for you and ensure that your bills are paid even if you are incompetent.
Don’t forget the little details: Imagine that your old mother has a medical emergency and she’s on her way to the hospital.
Are you able to answer questions related to medications and allergies?
Write down these things so you can be ready if needed.
“It’s not just about the financial side, it’s about who the doctors are,” Martin explained.
“What medications are needed?
Who takes care of the dog?
Put it all in."
A gun was fired several times in Ilfracombe.
The gunman was shot several times in the air when he was taken home on the way home after the night.
In the 1940s, the victims were shot in Ilfracombe, Oxford Grove, Devon, in the chest, stomach, and hands.
The police described the shooting at about 2:30 p.m. as a random act.
The victim did not see the attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening and the police are asking all witnesses to contact him.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died as a result of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, adding that the number of deaths is still increasing.
Since the communication has been interrupted, the rescuers have received no information from the regent of Donggala, north of Palu, which is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
The following are some important facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi province, located on the narrow bay on the west bank of the island of Sulawesi, and its population was estimated at 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when it was struck unexpectedly by an earthquake and tsunami.
The Donggala Regents is an area that extends over 300 km (180 miles) to the north of the island of Sulawesi.
In 2017, Regents, an administrative region under the province, had an estimated population of 299,200.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main economic activities of the Central Sulawesi Province, especially the Donggala Coast.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, which is mainly concentrated on the coast of Morowa, Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency, the tsunami has hit Palu and Donggala several times over the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami in Donggala killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
In 1996, a tsunami struck the western part of Donggala, killing nine.
Indonesia is seismically located in the Pacific Ocean and is hit by earthquakes on a regular basis.
The following are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunami in recent years:
On December 26, 2004, a large earthquake on the western coast of Aceh Province in northern Sumatra, Indonesia, triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries and killed 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: Several major earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in March and early April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-degree earthquake struck Indonesia’s most populated southern island of Java, causing a tsunami that hit the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-degree earthquake hit the area near the provincial capital of West Sumatra, Padang.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-degree earthquake struck one of the Sumatra islands – Mentawai Island, conquering a tsunami up to 10 meters high, which destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A deep earthquake hit the Pidie Jaya regent in Aceh, sowing destruction and panic, reminding people of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami brought destruction.
There was no tsunami at the time, but more than 100 people were killed in the collapsed buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes hit Indonesia’s tourism hub Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mainly in the north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily left thousands of tourists in a straitjacket.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested over domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested in connection with the attack.
According to a report published by the Alaska State Troopers on Saturday, Palin (29) was arrested in Wasillas, Alaska, on suspicion of domestic violence, interference in the report and resistance to arrest.
According to a police report, when a woman tried to inform police of alleged crimes, Palin took the phone from her.
Palin will be held at the Mat-Su Preliminary Investigation Agency and will be held against an unsecured $500 bail, KTUU said.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he declared that he was “not guilty in any way,” the news network reported.
Palin faces three Class A offences, meaning he can be expected to face up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He has also been charged with a Class B fine, punishable by a one-day prison sentence and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that a criminal charge has been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
In connection with the alleged attack, his mother, Sarah Palin, called the police.
The case is currently being discussed by the Alaska Veterinary Authority.
In January 2016, he was accused of being attacked at home, of meddling in a report of domestic violence and of possessing a weapon, all in a drunken state.
His girlfriend claimed that the man had stabbed him in the face.
Veteran groups criticized Sarah Palin in 2016 when she linked her son’s violent behavior to PTSD resulting from her service in Iraq.
Tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds of dead
At least 384 people have been killed since an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-degree earthquake triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electrical and communications networks are not functioning and the number of deaths is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake struck the outskirts of Sulawesi city centre, from the Indonesian capital Jakarta to the north.
On social media, there are videos showing the moments of the earthquake.
At the time of the tsunami, hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the shores of the city of Palu.
Federal prosecutors in NYC request the rare death penalty suspected in the terrorist attack.
New York’s federal prosecutors are demanding the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, who is suspected of being involved in the New York terror attack that killed eight people. This rare punishment has not been executed for federal crime since 1953.
Saipov (30) allegedly used Home Depot's rental car to attack a bicycle path along West Side's roads in Lower Manhattan, leaving both pedestrians and cyclists on their way in October.
According to the application for the death penalty in the southern part of New York, prosecutors must prove to justify the death penalty that Saipov intentionally killed eight victims and also caused serious bodily harm.
In both cases, on the basis of court documents, the act is a possible death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, federal jurors filed a 22-point charge against Saipov, which included eight murder charges, along with extortion, which federal prosecutors generally use in organized crime, and charged the prosecutors with intimidation and violence.
The attack presupposed "a thorough planning and planning," prosecutors said, describing Saipov's actions as "enthusiastic, cruel and degrading."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov inflicted injuries, damage and damage to Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnacco's family and friends."
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
It's been ten years since the Southern District Court of New York's last death trial.
Indicted Khalid Barnes was convicted of the murder of two drug traffickers, but was sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The death penalty was last executed in 1953 in the New York federal case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, when the couple were convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage in the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years ago.
Both Rosenbergs were executed on an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native usbek, showed a lack of remorse in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
Police said he had told investigators that he was overjoyed.
According to the accusation, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack on the videos of ISIS viewed from his phone.
According to police, he also wanted the ISIS flag to be displayed at his hospital.
In the 22-point indictment, he did not take the blame.
David Patton, one of Saipov’s public defenders, said they were “clearly disappointed” in the ruling.
“In our view, the decision to apply for the death penalty will extend the trauma of all those involved in the case to the guilty instead of a life sentence without the possibility of emancipation,” Patton said.
Previously, Saipov’s defence team asked prosecutors not to apply for the death penalty.
MEP Tory said Nigel Farage should be appointed to lead the Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage promised to “mobilize the People’s Army” during today’s Tory conference.
The former UKIP leader said politicians needed to “feel the heat” of Eurosceptics, as one of the members of parliament, Theresa May, recommended leading negotiations with the EU.
Peter Bone, a member of the Conservative House of Commons, said at a march in Birmingham that the UK “would be out by now” if Mr Farage was Brexit secretary.
But Mrs May faces the problem of reconciling her deeply torn lines, stressed by conservatives in favor of staying, joining her protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is in trouble keeping track of his Chequers plan among Brexit supporters, icebreakers and EU attacks.
The Allies demanded that he continue the deal despite the clash with Brussels and force Eurosceptics and liberals to choose between his package and the “chaos.”
Bone said Leave Means Leave at a gathering in Solihull, wishing to “forgo Chequers’ plan”.
He recommended taking Farage as a partner and giving him responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"It's his responsibility we'd be out by now," he said.
Wellingborough MEP added: "I stand out from Brexit, but we must abandon Chequers' plan."
Reflecting on his opposition to the EU, he said: “We did not fight in World Wars to be submissive.
We want to create our own laws in our own country.”
Mr Bone rejected the recommendations that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: “The opinion that the British people have changed their mind and want to stay is not true.”
Tory Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns was also on the march, telling reporters: “I’m just saying one thing: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“The Chequers plan is unpopular among the general public, the opposition is not voting for it, it is unpopular in our party and among our activists who actually walk the streets and choose us at all.
Please leave Chequers' plan and start listening."
With a message to Mayle, he added: “Prime Ministers can keep their jobs if they keep their promises.”
Farage said the politicians who had been at the meeting should be "feeling the heat" if they plan to betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
“It is now a matter of trust between us – the people – and our political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit and we’re here today to tell them, ‘We won’t let that happen.’”
In a message to an enthusiastic audience, he added: “I want you to make our political class, which is on the brink of Brexit betrayal, uncomfortable.
“We are mobilizing the people’s army of the country that gave us victory with Brexit, and we will not rest until we have achieved an independent, self-governing, proud Britain.”
At the same time, the glaciers marched through Birmingham before the duel held in the centre of the city.
A handful of activists chanted “Tories against Brexit” after the group was formed this weekend.
Lord Adonis of the Liberals mocked the Conservatives for the security issues that became part of their party's opening conference.
“These are the people who say that IT systems can be deployed and all the technology can be brought to Canada, and moreover, for smooth border crossings, for unrestricted cross-border trading in Ireland,” he added.
“This is a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.
Warren is seriously considering running for president.
According to Elizabeth Warren, she is considering running for president after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that a Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future in the West Massachusetts City Hall on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for the next election in November against GOP State Representative Geoff Diehl, who was Trump’s vice president of the 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
It is speculated that in 2020, he may turn out to be against Trump.
Saturday’s afternoon event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with voters in the city hall after Trump took office.
He asked if he was planning to run for president.
Warren said, “It’s time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, which means it’s also on the rise.”
LSU's Sims Shooting Arrested
LA Police in Baton Rouge on Saturday said a suspect in the shooting of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims was arrested on Friday.
Baton Rouge Police Department reported the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at 11 a.m. at an ET news conference.
They released a video of Friday's shooting, asking for help in identifying the man seen on footage.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot and killed near the Southern University town on Friday morning.
“The Wayde Sims got a bullet wound in the head and died behind it,” Murphy J. Paul, the police chief, told the media on Saturday, via 247sport.
Wayde stepped in to protect his friend and got a bullet from Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated, and he confessed to being at the scene, owning a gun, and shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and arrested at the East Baton Rouge Police Department.
The nearly 2-metre young Sims, who grew up at Baton Rouge, played 32 games last season, 10 of them in the starting line-up, averaging 17.4 minutes, throwing 5.6 points and taking 2.9 table football per game.
Russia Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the World Championship after the team's record gave him the victory over Sebastian Vettel
From that moment it became clear that Valtteri Bottas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the order of the Mercedes team plays a major role in the race.
Bottas got a good start and left Hamilton almost bored when he defended his position for the first two times and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Water was the first to go to the boxing stops and left the Hamilton Group behind in dense traffic, which should have been decisive.
Mercedes went into the boxing lap later and came out after Vettel, but Hamilton took the lead after side-by-side when the Ferrari driver reluctantly left the inside for free after a third-round attempt to defend it with a double move.
Max Verstappen started the competition from the back of the grid and was in seventh place at the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then led the race most of the time, driving the rubbers whirling towards the finish and passing Kimi Räikkönen, taking fourth place.
He eventually drove to the boxing stop in the 44th round, but failed to increase the speed of the last eight rounds, which gave Räikkönen fourth place.
Today is a difficult day, because Valtteri did a great job all week and was a real gentleman passing by me.
“The team has done a great job so that they have one of two,” Hamilton said.
It was a very bad body language.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump accused Senator Dianne Feinstein of failing to leak a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual harassment.
Speaking at the West Virginia meeting, the president did not address Ford’s testimony directly to the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead commented on what is currently happening in the Senate, which shows that people are “true, disgusting and false.”
“The only beautiful thing that can happen and is happening right now that has happened in the Senate in a couple of days is that you see anger and anger, evil, disgusting and lying people,” he said.
“When you look at press releases and leaks that say, ‘Oh, I didn’t do that.
I didn't do it."
You remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak?
Do you remember his answer to the question “Did you leak the document?” – “Ah, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak."
Wait a minute.
Did we leak ... no, we didn't leak," he added in the senator's appearance.
Ford sent Feinstein a letter in July about the charges against Kavanaugh and it was leaked in early September, but Feinstein denied that the leak came from his workplace.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s accusations or leak his story,” Feinstein told the committee.
“He asked me to remain confidential, and I did so at his request.”
But his refusal did not suit the president, who commented during Saturday’s meeting: “You know what, it was a very bad body language.
Maybe he didn’t, but it’s one of the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing to defend a Supreme Court candidate accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that Democrats use these accusations for their own purposes.
“They have decided to take back power without choosing the means.
You will see this cruelty and resentment. They don’t care who they hurt, who they need to drive across to gain power and control,” he said.
Premier League: Dundee Stars 5 : 3 Belfast Giants
Giantsi Patrick Dwyer scored two goals against Dundee
The Dundee Stars won a rematch on Friday with the Belfast Giants, who lost 5–3 to Dundee.
The Giants started the game early with two goalkeepers, Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie led the home team before Dwyer led Giants again.
Francois Bouchard equated Dundee's position before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen's gates secured their victory.
This was Adam Keefe's third loss to the men in the elite league. They came to Belfast on Friday night to beat the Dundees in a 2–1 draw.
It was the fourth game of the season, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
Dwyer's opening came in the fourth minute at 3:35 with the help of Kendall McFaulli and David Rutherford, as Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
Sullivan brought the home team back in the first half at 13:10, before Matt Marquardt helped Cownie hit the lead in 15:16 minutes.
Dwyer ensured that the Giants would lead before the first break, knocking at the end of the first third of his evening second goal.
On the home field, the players regrouped and Bouchard put them back to the level, knocking in a numerical overtime at the 27:37 goal minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran joined forces to help Nielsen give Dundee a leading position for the first time at the end of the second third, securing the last third victory in their team's attack zone.
The Giants, who have now lost four of the last five games, will face Milton Keynes in the next game at home.
The pilot dies to save hundreds of people from the earthquake
One Indonesian pilot was declared a hero after he gave his life to ensure the safe airlift of a plane carrying hundreds of people.
A major earthquake on the island of Sulawesi on Friday caused a tsunami that left more than 800 people dead, many of whom were unknown.
The area is haunted by strong descents and many people are trapped under the ruins of the city of Palu.
Despite the fact that 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung’s colleagues fled Palu Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport’s floating air tower, he refused to leave.
He remained at work to ensure the safe airlift of Batik Air Flight 6321 while on the flight line.
Then he jumped out of the air tower, thinking it would collapse.
He later died in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait confirmed his decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australian ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter to transport him from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died in the morning, even before the helicopter arrived at the Palace.
“We were extremely sad to hear about it,” the spokesman added.
At the same time, authorities fear that the number of deaths could rise to thousands. According to the state disaster relief agency, access to Donggala, Sig and Boutong city was limited.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the agency’s spokesperson, said: “The number of survivors may increase because the bodies of many victims are still under siege and have not been recovered.”
6-metre waves rocked the city of Palu, where Sunday Massivization takes place.
The military and passenger planes provide assistance and equipment.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “An ambulance brings new victims every minute.
Clean water is rare.
Small markets are being looted everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to help the survivors, but we can’t say what they can find there.
It’s already a tragedy, but the situation can get even worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country’s military: “Please work night and day to complete all evacuation-related tasks.
“Are you ready for that?” he told CNN.
The Indonesian city of Lombok was hit earlier this year by an earthquake that killed more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugin says one man missing after lagoon plane crash
While it was previously said that all 47 passengers and crew had been safely evacuated from the plane by drowning, the airline, which drove the plane that crashed into the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, now claims that one man has been missing.
Air News said in a statement that they had not been able to find a single male passenger since Saturday afternoon.
The airline said they were working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately answer the passenger’s questions about details such as his age and nationality.
Local ships helped save other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the Chuuk Island airport when it landed in the water.
Officials said on Friday that seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday, but their condition was stable.
The circumstances of the accident and the exact sequence of events are still unclear.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed far from the border of the lagoon.
Some witnesses thought the plane was flying over the airstrip.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was landing at a very low altitude.
"It's very good," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and the other passengers were able to fly on a sinking plane to the emergency exit in the water above the belt.
He mentioned that the salon staff was panicking and screaming and that he had a little head trauma.
The U.S. Navy and seamen who worked on a nearby pier also helped to save lives by using inflatable boats to bring people to shore before the plane crashed about 30 meters into the water.
Air Safety Network data shows that 111 people have died in aviation accidents related to PNG-registered carriers over the past two decades, but none of them were related to Air News.
Analyst prepares schedule for the night when a woman was burned alive
The prosecutor’s office ended a case on Saturday over a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett spent several hours analyzing intelligence data as an expert observer.
He revealed to the jury how he used cell phone phone extracts to reconstruct the movements of 29-year-old Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers the night the girl died.
According to The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett said she received location information from several mobile phones, which showed that Tellis was with Chambers the night the girl died, which was inconsistent with the young man’s earlier claims.
When the data showed that he had been with Chambers, the young man himself had claimed that he was with his friend Michael Sanford, so he went to the police to talk to Sanford.
Sanford entered the courtroom on Saturday and confessed that he was not in town that day.
When the defendants asked him if Tellis had told the truth when he said he had been in Sanford's car, Sanford said that Tellis " lied because my car was in Nashville".
Another disagreement was that Tellis said he had known Chambers about two weeks before the girl's death.
The phone records showed that the women had known each other for only a week.
Rowlett claimed that some time after Chambers' death, he deleted Chambers' messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He wiped the girl out of his life," Hale said.
The defense is planning to make its case on Sunday.
The judge said he thinks the trial will be held later that same day for a jury hearing.
The High Breed: what is conscious hip hop?
The Hiphop trio wants to combat negative genre definition by adding positive messages to the music.
The High Breed claims that hip hop has moved away from the principles of solving its political messages and social problems.
They want to go back to the roots of hip hop and make conscious hip hop popular again.
Bands such as The Fugees and Common have recently regained popularity in the UK thanks to bands such as Akala and Lowkey.

New York babysitter complains of racist message after couple in court
A New York City babysitter complains of a discriminatory firing in court after a message from her parents that the mother complained that the babysitter was “again black.”
Couples deny that they are racists, compared to extortion of the situation.
The mother of two children, Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, expressed her anger when she learned that their new babysitting provider, Giselle Maurice, was black when she first came to work in 2016.
Ms Plasco-Flaxman wrote a message to her husband stating: "EIIIIIIIIIIII, THE COURT'S REQUIREMENTS."
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it twice to Miss Maurice.
According to the New York Post, the uncomfortable Plasco-Flaxman, after his proselytizing understanding Miss Maurice, claimed that their social caregiver, who was an African-American, had done a poor job and had been waiting for a Filipino instead.
Miss Maurice was paid for one working day and then sent home with Uber.
Now, Maurice is suing a couple in court to get compensation for the dismissal he wants to receive daily in the amount of $350 for the next six months, and the same work he was originally hired to do, but without a contract.
“I want to show them to look, so do it,” he told The Post, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple have rejected the claim that they are racists, saying that the termination of employment with Maurice was a reasonable act because they feared they could no longer trust her after insulting the girl.
“My wife sent him something he didn’t think of.
He's not a racist.
“We are not racists,” her husband, Joel Plasco, told The Post.
“But would you let your children take care of the person you’ve been rude to, even if it was unintentional?
Your new-born?
Come on, now."
Commenting on the comparison with the extortion, Plasco said his wife was two months away from the birth of the child and was “in a very difficult situation”.
“Would you go against someone like that?
“It’s not that bad,” the investment bank added.
While the trial is still going on, public opinion has quickly condemned the couple on social media, where they are heavily judged for their behavior and thinking.
New Letter Reveals Paddington Publishers Feared Readers Wouldn't Relate to Talking Bear
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, wrote: “It is difficult to put yourself in the shoes of a person who read it for the first time before it was published.
It’s very fun to know now what we know about Paddington’s great success.”
She said her father, inspired to write a children's book about a small toy corner, worked as a BBC cameraman, would have been optimistic about his rejection of his work, and added that the 60th anniversary of the book's release was due to his father's death last year with a nucleus.
About Paddington, whom he described as a “very important member of our family,” he added that his father was quietly proud of his ultimate success.
“He was quite a quiet man and not a proud man,” he said.
“But since Paddington was so real to him, it was like feeling when your child accomplishes something: you’re proud of them, even though it’s not your accomplishment directly.
I think he looked at Paddington's success that way.
Although it was his creation and imagination, he always acknowledged Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
Upon landing, her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors worked unintentionally to save her life.
“They called regularly to say that the daughter’s condition was very bad and that they didn’t believe she would survive,” said Ednan-Laperouse.
“I got a call from Nadi saying that my daughter is going to die in two minutes and I have to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, darling, I love you so much.
I'll see you soon.
I'll be with you soon.
The drugs that doctors gave her to keep her heart beating had slowly begun to disappear and she left the body.
He had died a long time before, and now all the systems began to stop working.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing what was going on.
I couldn’t cry, cry or cry because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to stay together.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now mourning her daughter, boarded the plane with other passengers who knew nothing about her passing.
“Nobody knew that,” he said.
“I kept my head on the ground and tears were flowing all this time.
It's hard to explain, but I felt a tremendous outburst of compassion for Nadi on this flight.
He needed my love and understanding.
I know how much she loved him.”
Postcards of a grieving woman prevent self-doubt on a bridge
Two women who lost their beloved suicide note work together to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have pasted maps on the bridge of Wales with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Ms. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he suffered from depression, and 18 when he killed himself.
“I don’t want no parent to feel what I feel every day,” she said.
45-year-old Prl Davis, who lives in Lydney, said his son was a promising chef with an infectious smile.
“Everyone knew him because of his smile.
They always said that his smile makes the whole room shine.”
Despite this, he stopped working before his death because he was “in a very bad place with his own people.”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother after he had taken his own life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I'm constantly worried that it has a domino effect."
Davis created these maps “to let people know that there are people to turn to and talk to, even with a friend.
Don’t be quiet, you have to talk.”
Mr. Humphreys, who has been a friend of Mr. Davis's for years, lost Mark, his 15-year-old partner, shortly after the death of the man's mother.
“He didn’t say he felt bad or was depressed or anything,” he said.
“We noticed a change in his behavior a few days before Christmas.
He was at his lowest point during the first Christmas – when the kids opened their presents, he had no eyebrows or anything.”
Ms Humphreys said the man’s death was a terrible trauma to them, but they had to deal with it: “It rips the wound into the entire family.
We're gonna get ripped off.
But we have to move on and continue the fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs at the end of his hair while the FBI is investigating
“I believed that if we could actually get something he wanted — a limited time and scope study — we might be able to achieve unity,” Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared that the committee would “collect” in the midst of a permanent partisan stalemate.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate this?
Their reluctance was due to timing.
There will be an election in just five weeks, on November 6. If Republicans are not expected to do well, they will be markedly weakened in their intentions to get the desired man on the forefront of the world's highest court.
George W. Bush has taken the phone to call the senators, doing lobbying to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush, and through whom he met his wife, Ashley, who was Mr. Bush’s personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI submits its report?
The vote will take place in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr Kavanaugh will receive at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to give a decisive vote and confirm Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.
North Korea’s number of militias “repeated” under Kim’s government
South Korean lawmakers have said that the number of North Korean militias in South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South Korean Ministry of Harmonization, said that compared to the 2011 quakes (2706), their number had declined last year (1127).
Mr Park said the main factors are stronger border controls between North Korea and China and a greater number of human traffickers.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
A large number of North Korean militias have been offered South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most are fleeing through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and which is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized area between the two Koreas.
China takes militias as illegal immigrants rather than as refugees and often forces them back to their homeland.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are technically still at war, have improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the heads of the two countries met in Pyongyang to negotiate the elimination of nuclear weapons.
This happened after a historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June, where they promised to work in general towards the nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the US for lack of progress in sanctions.
“Without trust in the United States, our country lacks security, and in such circumstances, we in no way agree to make ourselves the first unilateral weapon,” Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said the man was not qualified to be a judge of the Supreme Court
House opposition leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said the man was "temperamentally incompetent" to work as a Supreme Court judge.
Pelosi expressed his opinion at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas, on Saturday.
“I inevitably noticed that if any woman had acted in this way, she would have been called hysterical,” Pelosi said of his reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony given to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied the accusations that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when both were teenagers.
Kavanaugh was very emotional in his opening remarks, describing his family and high school years, and he almost cried from time to time, and sometimes remained verbal.
She also denounced the Democratic Party members who were on the committee, calling the accusations against her for the loss of Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential election a “gross and coordinated propaganda assassin” organized by angry liberals.
According to Pelosi, he believes that Kavanaugh's testimony proved that the man was not suitable for the Supreme Court because it showed that he was bent on the Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with these statements and the way he attacked Clinton and the Democrats," he said.
Fears remained modest when asked if he would try to resign if Kavanaugh was to be confirmed if the Democrats were to get a majority in the House.
“I’m saying so much – if he doesn’t tell Congress or the FBI the truth, he’s not just a Supreme Court judge, he’s not a judge in the court where he currently works,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals.
Fears added that as a Democrat, he was concerned about Kavanaugh’s possible Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade’s rulings because the man is considered a conservative judge.
At his confirmation session, Kavanaugh avoided questions as to whether he would annul any decisions of the Supreme Court.
“This is not a time when a hysterical person can become a judge and expect us to say whether it’s not nice,” Pelosi said.
And women have to wear it.
It is a fair vocabulary, a month-long and years-long surge of anger, and he can't escape without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think that’s unusual, do I?”
She continued: “I got help from a woman who was somewhere in charge; she said that she was crying too when she got angry, but she developed a method that was that when she got angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to, ‘I’m crying, you can think,
I'm angry."
And he just kept going.
And I thought it was brilliant.”
Pisces are partially accepted as an outlet of anger, because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my most memorable memories is of an old job in an office with a majority of men, where I found myself once indescribable in a rage when an older woman – a strict leader I had always been afraid of – grabbed me by a collar and got lucky in a staircase.
“Never show them how to cry,” he told me.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you're sad, and it gives them satisfaction."
Patricia Schroeder, then Democratic Party congressman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on a man's presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Hart stayed on board a hunter named Monkey Business with an extramarital mistress and ended the campaign, deeply upset Schroeder thought that there was no reason why he should not think about running for president himself.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” he told me laughing 30 years later.
"There were already seven candidates and the last thing they needed was someone else to join."
Someone said it was like "Snow White and the Seven Thumbs."
As the campaign was ending, he was late for fundraising, and he promised not to run if he couldn’t get two million dollars.
It was a hopeless battle.
He discovered that some of his supporters who donated $1,000 to the men gave him only $250.
“Do they think I’m getting a favor?” he thought.
When he gave a speech announcing that he was not launching an official campaign, feelings—thanks to the people who supported him—were irritated by the system that made it difficult to raise money and appeal to voters instead of delegates, and anger against sexism—became so remorseful that he won.
“You would have thought I had a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder reminded the press of the reaction against him.
“You could have thought that Kleenex was my sponsorship company.
I remember thinking about what they wrote on my gravestone.
“Did he cry?”
How the U.S.-China trade war could be beneficial to Beijing
The opening lines of the trade war between the US and China were grim, and while the battle is not far from over, experts say the interstate divide could be beneficial to Beijing in the long run.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump made his first warning this year by imposing taxes on major Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation this week took place with new tariffs pertaining to the value of $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion) per commodity, essentially imposing taxes on goods arriving from China to the United States.
Beijing has always responded to the same by sorting out US goods worth $60 billion last year with tariffs of five to ten percent.
China has promised the U.S. to let go of the wound, and the world’s second-largest economy is likely to not be seen anytime soon.
Washington’s withdrawal would mean relinquishing the demands, but publicly bowing down to the US would be too embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts argue that if Beijing’s maps work out correctly, the trade war with the US could support China in the long run, reducing the interdependence between the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that lead to the loss of control of the economy in another country is actually far more dangerous than side viewers have previously admitted,” said Abigail Grace, a researcher at the Asian Security Center.
Foreign Minister Says Syria Is Ready to Return Refugees
Syria has said it is ready for a voluntary return of refugees and is asking for help in rebuilding the country after more than seven years of war.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the situation in the country is improving.
"The situation on the territory of the country is now more stable and safer thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government is continuing to restore normality to the areas destroyed by terrorists.
There are now all the conditions for refugees who have left the country because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily lives and lives, to voluntarily return to the country.
According to UN estimates, 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime would welcome aid for the reconstruction of the ravaged country.
At the same time, he stressed that the state does not accept conditional aid or aid from the countries that supported the uprising.
Europe wins Ryder caricatures in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup in France, scoring 16.5 vs 10.5 for the U.S. team at Le Golf National near Paris.
The United States has now lost six consecutive losses on Europe’s surface and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn scored 14.5 points to win the United States.
Throughout the tournament, US star Phil Mickelson beat par-3 in 16 waters, giving the win to Francesco Molinar.
Italian golfer Molinari excelled in all of his rounds, becoming one of four players to score 5:0:0 in the current format of the tournament, starting in 1979.
Jordan Spiethe scored a 5–4 draw against Thorbjorn Olesen, who was at the bottom of the European team.
The best player in the world, Dustin Johnson, was ahead of Ian Poulter, 2nd and 1st England, who could be the last to win the Ryder Cup.
Eight of Ryder’s career-winning veterans, Sergio Garcia from Spain, became the most successful Europlane ever in the 25.5-point race.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t hold back.
It's been a tough year.
I am grateful to Thomas that he chose me and believed in me.
I'm so happy, so happy we got the hook back.
It's a team spirit and I'm glad I was able to help," Garcia said after the European victory.
He gives the torque to compatriot Jon Rahm, who on Sunday won the singles game against US golfer Tiger Woods 2&1.
“I’m incredibly proud to have won Tiger Woods – I grew up looking at him,” Rahm, 23, said.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now has a career-high score of 13:21:3 for Ryder.
Weird stats for one of the best players of all time, who has won 14 major tournament titles, leaving only Jack Nicklaus behind.
The U.S. team was on the brink of finding fairways all weekend; the exception were Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk said after the team’s disappointment: “I’m proud of the guys, they were hearty.
In the morning there was a moment when we put pressure on the Europeans.
We fought with them.
The hat is in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All of his 12 players did a very good job.
We'll get together, work with the American PGA and our Ryder Caricatures Committee, and we'll move on.
I love these 12 types and I'm proud to be their captain.
The hat needs to be lightened.
We were better played.”
New information on water resistance: concentration decreased in Pinellas, Manatees and Sarasota
The most recent report from the Florida Fisheries and Wildlife Commission (FWC) shows a decrease in the overall concentration of thriving waters in the Tampa Bay region.
According to the FWC, there have been reports of a more vague blossom in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties, indicating declining concentrations.
The water catchment area is approximately 130 miles (209 km) along the coast from the northern part of Pinellas County to the southern part of Lee County.
The spots may be found 10 miles (16 km) off the coast of Hillsborough County, but there have been fewer spots compared to last week.
Water pollution has also been observed in Pasco County.
Last week, the concentration of land in the county of Pinellas was reported from the concentration of land on the coast or at the open sea, the concentration of land in Hillsborough County from low to high at the open sea, the concentration of land in the county of Manatee County from background to high, the concentration of land in the county of Pinellas, the concentration of land in the county of Colellas, and the concentration of land in the county of Sarasota County from coast to open at the sea.
The counties of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier continue to report respiratory irritation.
There have been no reports of respiratory tract irritation in North Florida over the past week.
