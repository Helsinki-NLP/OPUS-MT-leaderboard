You can’t love Thomas to do it.
You can even tell Thomas that you're going to come.
Or the trumpet, if you tell me what the name of the bridegroom is.
You're down here.
Trubus gives you the personal tomesa.
You're often seen by the squirrels of Thomas Trubus.
Trubus is talking to you about the Tomes chore.
For you are content to listen to the feebleminded,
You're the one who said it.
It's about the othe bi mango.
You'll see a movie in the movie.
