Accumulated rapidly increasing incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union or the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, from 1 January to 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease cases (COVID-19) shows similar trends in the countries of the European Union or the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, confirming that, although at different stages depending on the country, the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing rapidly in all countries.
Based on the experience of Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should improve their preparation for a wave of COVID-19 patients who will require medical care and, in particular, intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, a conglomerate of cases of unknown etiology pneumonia was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On January 9, 2020, China’s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the causative agent was a new coronavirus now known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection has been called coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Evidence to date indicates that 80% of people with COVID-19 have a mild disease, i.e. a respiratory tract infection with or without pneumonia, and that most recover.
In 14% of cases, COVID-19 evolves into a more serious disease that requires hospitalization, while the remaining 6% develop a critical disease that requires intensive care.
Mortality in COVID-19 hospitalized patients is 4%.
In this study, we looked at trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in each country in the European Union or the European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the United Kingdom (UK) and compared them to those in Hubei Province, China.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and the UK with that of Italy from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Cases of COVID-19 in EU/EEA and UK countries
After China, COVID-19 continued to spread geographically, and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world today follow that of this country.
On March 11, 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
In the March 5 edition of Eurosurveillance 2020, Spiteri et al. reported on the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe according to the WHO case definition.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were registered in France on January 24, 2020, in people who had returned from Wuhan, Hubei province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases had been detected in the 30 countries of the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom (UK), according to which between 31 December 2019 and that date inclusive, there had been 39,768 cases and 1727 deaths, of which 17,750 cases and 1441 deaths had occurred in Italy alone.
Obtaining the cumulative amount and cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases
At the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC), the counts of COVID-19 cases reported in each country of the world, obtained only from official sources, such as the Ministry of Health of the countries, national and regional health authorities and the WHO, are updated daily at 8:00 a.m.
These data were used to examine COVID-19 trends in the EU/EEA and the UK and to compare them with those in Italy.
As an indicator of the prevalence of active COVID-19 cases, we calculated the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases shortened to 14 days; thus, we took into account the natural course of COVID-19, in each EU/EEA and UK country, during the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also present the cumulative number of cases reported in each country as of March 15, 2020, at 8:00 a.m., compared with that of Italy for the period from January 31 to March 15, 2020.
COVID-19 trends in the EU/EEA countries and the UK
Trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases truncated to 14 days in the EU/EEA countries and the UK in general followed that of Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
In the EU/EEA and the UK as a whole, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 began to increase around February 21 and then increased considerably around February 28, 2020 (complementary material).
This was mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of reported cases from Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the UK exhibited similar upward trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 (complementary material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and UK countries, compared to Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
As of March 15, at 8:00 a.m., 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK had already registered a total number of cases comparable to that of Italy only 3 weeks before or less.
Our results indicate that the number of COVID-19 cases reported is rapidly increasing in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The observed trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 suggest that the pandemic is advancing at a similar rate in all countries.
This is so despite the different stages in which countries are located, variations in national public health responses, and possibly different case definitions in different countries and different protocols to select patients to be tested to confirm COVID-19, including delayed tests.
At the beginning of March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy described a situation in which 10% of COVID-19 patients required intensive care, and the media reported that hospitals and intensive care units in these regions had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on admissions of COVID-19 cases to a hospital or intensive care unit are currently available at EU/EEA level for only 6% and 1% of cases, respectively (data not shown).
However, they should be systematically collected to complement current surveillance data that focus on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
A 2010–11 study showed a large variation in the availability of intensive care and intermediate care beds in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 beds per 100,000 inhabitants in Portugal.
This means that countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 beds of intensive care and intermediate care per 100,000 inhabitants in 2010–11).
Model scenarios related to the saturation of healthcare capacity, with calculations for each EU/EEA country and the UK of the prevalence of COVID-19 hospitalization cases associated with a <0x3E>90% risk of overcapacity of intensive care beds, are provided in the sixth update of the ECV-CODC rapid risk assessment.
Since, so far, there have been conglomerates of cases in certain regions of EU/EEA and UK countries, and hospitals and intensive care units normally serve a defined regional population, information on cases and intensive care beds should preferably be made available to the NUTS2 territory.
Italy’s experience and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care units should therefore be prepared for a sustained community-wide SARS-CoV-2 transmission scenario and an increase in the number of COVID-19 patients requiring medical care and, in particular, intensive care, such as that occurring in the affected regions of Italy.
As indicated in the rapid risk assessment of the ECDC, it is essential to adopt a rapid, proactive and comprehensive approach to delay the spread of SARS-CoV-2, with a change from a containment approach to a mitigation one, since the expected rapid increase in the number of cases will implement, if it is not appropriate to agree with the number of cases, and may not give sufficient time to hospitals and decision-makers.
The rapid risk assessment also lists the public health measures needed to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a short period of opportunity during which countries have the opportunity to deepen their control efforts to curb the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce pressure on the health system.
If this is not done, healthcare systems in other EU/EEA countries are likely to face a wave of patients requiring intensive care in the coming days and weeks.
The 2019 coronavirus disease outbreak (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has so far caused the deaths of 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 in China and elsewhere around the world, causing a catastrophe for humans.
Similar to its homologous virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 could also be transmitted from the bat and cause similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has a lower severity and mortality than SARS, but it is much more transmissible and affects older people than young people and more men than women.
In response to the growing number of publications on emerging disease, the purpose of this article is to provide a timely and comprehensive analysis of the research topic, which is developing rapidly.
We will address the basic aspects of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and disease prevention.
Although many questions still have no answer, we hope this analysis will help to understand and eradicate this menacing disease.
The Spring Festival on January 25, 2020 has become an unheard-of and unbreakable memory for all Chinese, who were urged to stay at home throughout the holiday and for several more weeks due to the outbreak of a new viral disease.
The virus has almost the same name as the coronavirus (CoV) that caused a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003; therefore, on February 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) called it SARS-CoV-2, and the associated disease was called coronavirus disease (IDCO-19 2019).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China, and spread rapidly across the country and to nearly 50 more countries around the world.
As of March 2, 2020, the virus has caused more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients being discharged and more than 3,000 patients dead.
The WHO warns that COVID-19 is the "public enemy number 1" and that it is potentially more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 scientific articles have been published on COVID-19, including its virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, from the first patient report on January 7, 2020.
The aim of this analysis is to summarize the advances in research on this rapidly developing new subject.
When possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another disease caused by CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, an outbreak in 2012).
We will also examine what is known so far about disease prevention and prognosis, as well as some crucial questions that have not yet been answered.
Coronaviruses have traditionally been considered non-lethal pathogens for humans, which mainly cause about 15% of common colds 4.
However, in this century, we have twice encountered highly pathogenic coronaviruses in humans, namely SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which originally caused an outbreak in China in 2003, and in Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and soon spread to many other countries with horrific morbidity and mortality.
Thus, the current COVID-19 outbreak is the third coronavirus outbreak recorded in the history of mankind.
As shown in Fig. 1.1, conglomerates of pneumonia of unknown origin were first reported on December 31, 2019 from Wuhan to the National Health Commission of China.
Seven days later, the coronavirus sequence was announced.
On January 15, 2020, the first death was recorded in Wuhan.
Meanwhile, the epidemic quickly spread to cities, provinces, and neighboring countries.
On January 20, the infection of health care providers was reported, suggesting that human-to-human transmission was possible.
On January 23, the city of Wuhan was quarantined and all public transport was suspended.
On January 24, the first clinical study on the disease reported that of the 41 patients with confirmed cases, only 21 had direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market that was considered the site of origin of the infection from an unknown animal source.
On January 30, the WHO declared the outbreak a global health emergency.
To date, the disease has already spread across China and nearly 50 more countries around the world (Figure 2).
As the situation evolves rapidly, the final dimension and severity of the outbreak cannot yet be determined.
On February 11, 2020, a multicenter study of 8866 patients, including 4021 confirmed COVID-19 patients, presented a more up-to-date illustration of the epidemic described below (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infected people of all ages, but mainly people aged 30 to 65.
Nearly half (47.7%) of infected people were over 50 years old, very few were under 20 and only 14 infected people were under 10 years old.
SARS-CoV-2 infected men (0.31/100 000) more than women (0.27/100 000).
COVID-19 expanded to conglomerates mostly in Hubei and surrounding areas.
On average, 5 days (2 to 9) elapsed between the onset and the diagnosis of COVID-19.
The average incubation period was 4.8 days (between 3.0 and 7.2).
The average time from onset to death was 9.5 days (between 4.8 and 13).
The baseline reproductive number (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of people infected increased exponentially before January 23, 2020, which coincides with the time of mass mobilization prior to the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality rate of patients with confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%), and the adjusted mortality rate of all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 were sex (male), age (<0xE2><0x89><0xA5>60) and severe pneumonia.
Coronaviruses are a subfamily of large, enveloped viruses that contain a one-way chain RNA.
They can be divided into four genera, i.e. alpha, beta, gamma and delta, of which alphacoronaviruses and deltacoronaviruses are those that infect humans.
The clamp glycoprotein (S) of the envelope binds to its cellular receptors, the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, and then membrane fusi<0xC3><0xB3>n occurs.
The viral RNA genome is released to the cytoplasm; after replication of the viral genome, the genomic RNA, along with the envelope glycoproteins and nucleocapside proteins, forms vesicles containing virions, which then fuse with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was announced on January 10, 2020.
It was discovered that SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of beta-coronavirus with a genetic identity of more than 99.98% in 10 sequential samples taken from the original site of the outbreak: the Huanan seafood market of Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is more genetically similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
With a transmission electron microscope, SARS-CoV-2 particles were found in ultra-thin sections of the human respiratory epithelium.
Human ACE2 was determined to be a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
However, the SARS-CoV-2 S protein binds to human ACE2 weaker than that of SARS-CoV, which is consistent with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes a less severe infection in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 may also form a new short protein encoded by orf3b and a secreted protein encoded by orf8.
The orf3b of SARS-CoV-2 could have a function in viral pathogenicity and inhibit IFN<0xCE><0xB2> expression; however, the orf8 does not contain any known functional domain or motif.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou, et al., revealed the full-length human ACE2 cryomicroscopy structure at 2.9 <0xC3><0x85> resolution, in complex with the transporter amino acid B0AT1.
They found that the complex, which had open and closed conformations, was assembled as a dimer, and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex can bind two S proteins, providing evidence for coronavirus recognition and infection.
B0AT1 could become a therapeutic target for drug study in order to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The Origin and the Intermediate Guest
It is known that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated in bats and were transmitted to humans by means of squirrels and camels, respectively.
In a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronaviruses, bat was considered to be the native host of SARS-CoV-2, as the new virus is identical in 96% to two bat SARS-like viruses called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-X-Co.
However, it is still unknown which intermediate host helped the virus cross the species barrier to infect humans, and it remains to clarify the transmission pathway.
Ji, et al., proposed snakes as carriers of bat virus to humans, which involved homologous recombination within protein S.
According to one study, researchers from Guangzhou, China, suggested that pangolins (long snail mammals that feed on ants and are commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine) are a possible intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 based on a 99% genetic homology in a coronavirus and discovered SARS-Cool-2 in pangolin.
However, a difference of 1% propagated by the totality of two genomes remains a large difference; therefore, conclusive results are expected that provide concrete evidence (Fig. 33).
The physicochemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still widely unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days at less than 20 <0xC2><0xB0>C with a humidity of 40-50%.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to be sensitive to ultraviolet rays and heat at 56<0xC2><0xB0>C for 30 minutes; ether, 75% ethanol, a disinfectant with chlorine, perchloric acid, chloroform, and other fat solvents, but not chlorhexidine, are effective for deactivating the virus.
The entire human population in general lacks immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore susceptible to the new coronavirus.
To date, no detailed study on the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 has been announced.
Consequently, we can only use previous studies with other coronaviruses, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig. 4).
In general, after the virus invades the host, it is first recognized by the innate immune system of the host through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including type C lectin receptors, Toll-type receptors (TLRs), NOD-type receptors (NLRs) and R-type receptors.
Through different pathways, the virus induces the expression of inflammatory factors, the maturation of dendritic cells and the synthesis of type I interferons (IFNs) that limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the macrophage phagocytosis of viral antigens.
However, the N protein of SARS-CoV can help the virus escape immune responses.
Soon, the adaptive immune response adds to the fight against the virus.
T cells, including CD4<0x2B> and CD8<0x2B> T cells, play an important role in defense.
CD4<0x2B> T cells stimulate B cells to produce virus-specific antibodies, and CD8<0x2B> T cells directly kill virus-infected cells.
Cooperating T cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines to help defending cells.
However, coronaviruses can inhibit T-cell functions by inducing T-cell apoptosis.
Humoral immunity, which includes supplements such as C3a and C5a and antibodies, is also essential to combat viral infection.
For example, the isolated antibodies of a recovered patient neutralized MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an overreaction of the immune system locally generates a large amount of free radicals that can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs, and in the worst case, multiorgan failure and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by the appearance in conglomerates, most likely affects older people with comorbidities and pregnant women.
It is common for people who are exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune functions are compromised to be more likely to become infected than others.
The estimated average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1 to 14 days, mostly between 3 and 7 days, according to a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1099 cases shows that the incubation period was 3 days on average and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as described above, shows that the incubation period was 4.8 days (between 3.0 and 7.2) based on the demographic of 8866 cases.
It is very important for health authorities to adjust the effective quarantine time according to the most accurate incubation period; this way, asymptomatic infected people will be prevented from transmitting the virus to others.
As usual, people exposed to the virus or infected should normally remain in quarantine for 14 days.
Should the quarantine be extended to 24 days?
Fever is usually the primary and initial symptom of COVID-19, which may be accompanied by no other symptoms or by other symptoms such as dry cough, dyspnea, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, rhinorrhea, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients had dyspnea or hypoxemia a week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, patients rapidly evolved to develop acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever or respiratory symptoms and acute fever, even without pulmonary abnormalities in imaging studies, should be tested for the virus for an early diagnosis.
A demographic study of late December 2019 indicated that the percentages of symptoms were 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for dyspnoea and 3% for diarrhea; 8% of patients required respiratory assistance.
Similar findings were reported in two recent studies of a family conglomerate and a conglomerate caused by the transmission of an asymptomatic person.
Similarly, a 2012 demographic study showed that patients with MERS-CoV also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and dyspnea (55%) as the main symptoms.
However, 80 per cent of them required respiratory assistance, much more than COVID-19 patients and in line with MERS’ highest mortality in relation to COVID-19.
Diarrhoea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also observed in MERS patients.
In patients with SARS, fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), dyspnea (40%-42%), diarrhoea (20%-25%), and sore throat (13%-25%) were the main symptoms and respiratory assistance was required in approximately 14% to 20%.
As of February 14, COVID-19 mortality was 2% when confirmed cases reached 66,576 worldwide.
Similarly, SARS mortality by November 2002 was 10% in 8096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, according to a June 2012 demographic study, mortality was 37% in 2494 confirmed cases.
In a previous study, the R0 of SARS-CoV-2 was reported to be high and to 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval (IC) of 5.71 to 7.23, while the R0 of SARS-CoV only ranged between 2 and 4.
A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV in terms of symptoms, mortality and R0 is presented in Table 1.1.
The above figures suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher propagation capacity than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but its lethality is lower than that of the latter two.
Therefore, it is much more difficult to control the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic than those of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
The appearance in conglomerates usually occurs within the same family or from the same meeting or vehicle, such as a cruise.
Patients usually have a history of travel or residence in Wuhan and other affected areas or contact with infected people or patients in the two weeks prior to appearance.
However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks and that hospital discharge patients can re-enter the virus, an alarm signal that the quarantine time should be increased.
Patients have a normal or reduced amount of white blood cells in peripheral blood (especially lymphocytes) in the early stage.
For example, lymphopenia was observed with a white blood cell count of <0x3C>4<0xC3><0x97>109/l, including a lymphocyte count of <0x3C>1<0xC3><0x97>109/l, and elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase in 1099 COVID-19 patients.
Levels of liver and muscle enzymes and myoglobin were elevated in the blood of some patients, and reactive protein C and erythrocyte sedimentation were elevated in the blood of most patients.
In patients with severe cases, the level of dimer-D, a product of fibrin degradation present in the blood, was elevated, and the lymphocyte count was progressively reduced.
Anomalies are detected in the chest x-rays of most COVID-19 patients, characterized by bilateral shadows or opacities in crystal glass in the lungs.
Patients usually develop atypical pneumonia, acute pulmonary injury, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDRA).
When SDRA occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation and progressive fibrosis seriously affect gas exchange.
Pneumocyte dysfunction type I and type II decreases surfactant level and increases surface tension, which reduces the ability of the lungs to expand and increases the risk of lung collapse.
Consequently, the worst findings in thoracic x-rays are usually in parallel with the maximum severity of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 showed the peeling of pneumocytes, the formation of a hyalin membrane and infiltration of lymphocytes in the interstitium, and similar multinucleated syncytial cells in the lungs of a patient who died from the disease, and the infectious disease, and the disease-related disease.
The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by a reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used as the main criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high rate of false negatives, which could accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations began to be used for diagnosis (which was no longer based solely on RT-PCR) in China on February 13, 2020.
A similar situation also occurred with the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, a combination of disease history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and radiological findings is essential and imperative for an effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, the Feng Zhang group described a protocol of using the SHERLOCK technique based on CRISPR for detecting SARS-CoV-2, which detects synthetic fragments of SARS-CoV-2 RNA at between 20 <0xC3><0x97> 10-18 mol/l and less gradples variably shows a re-use of a non-coil instrument at 10 <0xC3><0x97> 10-18 mol/l-100 coli.
Hopefully, the new technique can drastically increase sensitivity and convenience if verified in clinical samples.
Due to the lack of experience with the new coronavirus, doctors can mostly provide supportive care to COVID-19 patients, while testing with a variety of therapies that have been used or previously proposed for the treatment of other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and other viral diseases (table 2).
These therapies include current or potential treatments with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, recovered patient plasma, Chinese medicine and psychological support.
It was even proposed to use plasma from recovered patients for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies compete to see who first develops antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs at first and probably also attacks, to a lesser extent, other organs that express ACE2, such as those of the digestive tract and the kidneys.
However, respiratory dysfunction and insufficiency are the greatest threat to patients and the leading cause of death.
As a result, respiratory assistance is critical to alleviating symptoms and saving lives, and includes general oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygen, non-invasive ventilation, and invasive mechanical ventilation according to the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms need extracorporeal membrane oxygenation assistance (OMEC), a modified cardiopulmonary bypass technique used to treat potentially fatal heart or respiratory failures.
In addition, maintenance of electrolyte balance, prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shock, and protection of vital organ functions are also essential in patients with SARS-CoV-2.
It is known that the cytokine storm is the result of an overreaction of the immune system in patients with SARS and MERS.
Cytokine storm is a form of systemic inflammatory response characterized by the release of a number of cytokines, including TNF<0xCE><0xB1>, IL-1<0xCE><0xB2>, IL-2, IL-6, IFN<0xCE><0xB1>, IFN<0xCE><0xB2>, IFN<0xCE><0xB3>, and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune cells to release a huge amount of free radicals that are the main cause of SDRA and multiorganic failure.
Immunosuppression is essential for the treatment of cytokine storms, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, an IL6 antireceptor monoclonal antibody, have been used to treat cytokine storm.
Other immunosuppressive treatments for cytokine storm are modulation of T-cell-directed immune response; blocking of IFN-<0xCE><0xB3>, IL-1 and TNF; inhibition of JAK; blinatumomab; a cytokine signaling pathway 4 suppressor, and HD inhibitors.
Steroids, such as immunosuppressants, were widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, high-dose steroids were not beneficial for serious lung injuries in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
Instead, they can cause serious side effects, specifically osteonecrosis, which significantly affects the prognosis.
However, the prudent use of low to moderate doses of corticosteroids for a short period of time has been recommended for patients with COVID-19 in critical condition.
At the date of this analysis, the efficacy of any antiviral therapy has not been confirmed.
However, the efficacy of remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue, administered intravenously in an American patient with COVID-19, has been proven.
Remdesivir is a new antiviral drug developed by Gilead initially for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg viruses.
Subsequently, remdesivir also demonstrated the potential to inhibit other single-stranded RNA viruses, such as MERS and SARS viruses.
On the basis of these, Gilead has provided the compound to China to carry out a couple of trials in people infected with SARS-CoV-2, and there is great expectation for the results.
In addition, baricitinib, interferon alfa, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin have been suggested as possible therapies for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse reactions may occur after combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of these treatments with other drugs used in patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma of recovered patients and antibody generation
The extraction of blood from patients who have recovered from a contagious disease to treat other patients who have contracted the same disease or to protect healthy people so that they do not contract the disease is not something new.
In fact, recovered patients usually have a relatively high level of antibodies against the pathogen in the blood.
Antibodies are an immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other foreign objects, and recognize certain molecules in pathogens and directly neutralize them.
On this basis, plasma was extracted from the blood of a group of patients who recovered from COVID-19 and injected into 10 seriously ill patients.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, accompanied by a reduction in inflammation and viral loads and improved oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, it is necessary to verify and clarify this in order to propose the method for large-scale use until specific therapies are developed.
In addition, given the therapeutic effects, some plasma-associated disadvantages should be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can overstimulate the immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, potentially producing deadly toxicity.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and the plasma demand is high to treat patients in critical condition.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies quickly enough to fight a global pandemic.
Therefore, it is more important and practical to isolate B cells from recovered patients and identify the genetic codes that encode effective antibodies or seek effective antibodies against the virus' essential proteins.
In this way, we can easily increase the production of antibodies.
MCT has been used for thousands of years to treat a variety of diseases in China.
However, its effects largely depend on a combination of several components in a formula that varies according to the diagnosis of a disease according to MCT theories.
Most effective components are still unknown or inaccurate, as it is difficult to extract and verify such components or their optimal combinations.
Currently, due to the lack of effective and specific therapy for COVID-19, MCT has become one of the leading alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or for those who have recovered from severe stages.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du capsules and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules were determined to be effective for the treatment of COVID-19.
The main rates of recovery in the treatment of patients with COVID-19 were observed in several provinces of China that used TCM in 87% of their patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), while the province of Hubei, which used TCM in more than%, used TCM in only about 30% of its patients.
However, this is a fairly approximate comparison, as many other impact factors, such as the number and severity of patients, should be included in the evaluation.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and his colleagues published a study comparing Western medicine (MO) treatment only with the combined treatment of MO and MCT.
They found that the times required for recovery of body temperature, disappearance of symptoms and hospitalization were noticeably lower in the MO<0x2B>MCT group than in the MO group alone.
More surprisingly, the rate of worsening of symptoms (mild to severe) was significantly lower in the MO<0x2B>MCT group than in the MO group alone (7.4% vs. 46.2%) and mortality was lower in the MO<0x2B>MCT group alone (8.8% vs. 39%).
However, the efficacy and safety of MCT are still awaiting further well-controlled trials at larger scales and at more centres.
It would also be interesting to characterize the mechanism of action and determine the effective components of MCT treatments or their combinations if possible.
Patients with suspicion or confirmation of COVID-19 are generally very much afraid of the highly contagious and even deadly disease, and people in quarantine also experience boredom, loneliness and anger.
In addition, symptoms of infection such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as adverse effects of treatments, such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids, can cause more anxiety and mental distress.
In the early phase of the SARS outbreak, a number of psychiatric morbidities were reported, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor arousal, psychotic symptoms, delirium and even suicidal tendencies.
Mandatory contact tracking and quarantine, as part of public health responses to the COVID-19 outbreak, can make people feel more nervous and guilty about the effects of contagion, quarantine and stigma on their family and friends.
Mental health care should therefore be given to COVID-19 patients, people with suspicion and people who are in contact with them, as well as to the general public who need it.
Psychological support should include the formation of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear communications with regular and accurate updates on the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and treatment plans and the use of electronic devices and professional applications to avoid close contact between people.
They are essential effective vaccines to disrupt the transmission chain of infected animal and human reservoirs to susceptible hosts, and often complement antiviral treatment in controlling epidemics caused by emerging viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop protein-S-based vaccines to generate powerful and long-lasting neutralizing antibodies or immunity that protect against SARS-CoV.
Live attenuated virus vaccines have been evaluated in animal models for SARS.
However, the in vivo efficacy of these potential vaccines in the elderly and the models of lethal stimulation and their protection against zoonotic virus infection must still be determined before a clinical trial is initiated.
This is probably due to SARS extinction 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since.
Instead, there are still cases and conglomerates of MERS sporadically in the Middle East that spread to other regions due to the persistence of zoonotic sources in endemic areas.
Vaccination strategies for MERS have been developed using deactivated viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and recombinant protein subunits, and some have been evaluated in animal models.
The development of a safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine for non-immune people is an urgent and decisive task to control the ongoing pandemic.
However, it is difficult to overcome the difficulties due to the long period (18 months on average) necessary for the development of a vaccine and the dynamic variations of coronaviruses.
As it is a new disease, COVID-19 has just begun to manifest its complete clinical course in thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can recover gradually without sequelae.
However, as with SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, creating a model of disease prognosis is essential for health agencies to prioritize their services, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on the clinical studies reported so far, the following factors may affect or be associated with the prognosis of COVID-19 patients (Table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor for SARS prognosis, which is also correct for COVID-19.
COVID-19 occurred mostly in people aged 30 to 65 years and 47.7% of those patients were over 50 in a study of 8866 cases, as described above.
Patients who required intensive care were more likely to have underlying comorbidities and complications and were significantly larger than those who did not (mean age 66 versus 51), suggesting that age is a prognostic factor for the evolution of patients with COVID-19.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 has infected more men than women (0.31/100 000 versus 0.27/100 000), as described above.
Comorbidities and complications: COVID-19 patients who require intensive care are more likely to suffer from acute heart injury and arrhythmia.
Heart events were also the leading cause of death in patients with SARS.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can also bind to ACE2-positive cholangiocytes, which can cause liver dysfunction in patients with COVID-19.
It should be noted that age and underlying diseases are strongly correlated and may interfere with each other.
Abnormal laboratory results: The level of reactive C protein (PCR) in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue injury and has been proposed as a possible prognostic factor for the disease, response to therapy, and final recovery.
In addition, the correlation between the PCR level and the severity and prognosis of COVID-19 has been proposed.
In addition, elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatine kinase (CK) can also help predict patient evolution.
These enzymes are intensely expressed in various organs, especially the heart and liver, and are released when tissue is damaged.
Therefore, they are traditional markers of heart or liver dysfunction.
Main clinical symptoms: chest x-rays and temporal progression of clinical symptoms should be considered in conjunction with other symptoms for the prediction of clinical outcomes and complications of COVID-19.
Steroid Usage: As described above, steroids are immunosuppressants that are commonly used as adjuvant therapy for infectious diseases in order to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Since the use of high doses of corticosteroids in patients with severe SARS was widespread, many survivors developed avascular osteonecrosis with permanent disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used in low doses and for a short period of time in patients with COVID-19.
Mental stress: As described above, during the COVID-19 outbreak, many patients have suffered extraordinary stress, as in general, they endured long periods of quarantine and extreme uncertainty, and witnessed the deaths of close relatives and other patients.
It is essential to provide psychotherapy and long-term support to these patients to help them recover from stress and return to their normal lives.
According to demographic studies conducted so far, COVID-19 appears to have different epidemiological characteristics than SARS.
In addition to replicating in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can be efficiently replicated in the upper respiratory tract and causes mild or no symptoms at the early stage of infection, as with other coronaviruses that cause common colds.
Therefore, infected patients at an early stage or incubation period can produce a large amount of viruses during their daily activities, which greatly complicates the control of the epidemic.
However, SARS-CoV transmission was considered to occur when patients were seriously ill, while transmission mostly did not occur in the early phase.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 outbreak is much more severe and difficult to control than the SARS outbreak.
Great efforts are being made at this time in China, including the closure of Wuhan and surrounding cities and the ongoing quarantine of nearly the entire population in hopes of stopping SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
While these measures have caused considerable damage to the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new patients is decreasing, indicating a slowdown in the epidemic.
According to the most optimistic forecast, the outbreak will have ended by March and the downward phase will last 3 or 4 months.
However, some other experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter, et al., estimated that COVID-19, which appears to be considerably more infectious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., created a model to predict the evolution of the epidemic and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the world’s population.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in both nasal and pharyngeal exudate in patients who had recovered and left the hospital 2 weeks earlier, indicating that the newly identified virus could become a cyclic influenza-like episode.
However, there have been promising signs in China given the decline in the number of new cases, indicating that current strategies might be working.
It was originally predicted that Ebola would cause up to one million cases with half a million deaths.
However, through strict quarantine and isolation, the disease has been managed to control.
It is possible that, like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 weakens in terms of infectivity and eventually extinguishes or becomes a less pathogenic virus that coexists with humans.
A comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with that of SARS and MERS is provided below (Fig. 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible through cough or sneezing, and possibly also through direct contact with virus-contaminated materials.
The virus was also detected in the feces, which raises a new possibility of fecal-oral transmission.
A recent study of 138 cases reported that 41% of cases had possibly been caused by nosocomial infections, including 17 patients with other previous diseases and 40 health care providers.
Therefore, precautions should be taken to protect humans, especially health care providers, social workers, family members, colleagues and even transients in contact with infected patients or persons.
The first line of defense that could be used to reduce the risk of infection is the use of masks; the use of surgical masks and N95 respirator masks (series number 1860) helps control the spread of viruses.
Surgical masks prevent a potentially infected person’s fluid droplets from being transmitted through the air or sticking to surfaces, from where they could be transmitted to other people.
However, only N95 masks (series number 1860) can protect against inhalation of virions as small as 10 to 80 nm, and only 5% of virions can penetrate them completely; SARS-CoV-2 is similar in size to SARS-CoV and both measure about 85 nm.
Since particles can penetrate up to five stacked surgical masks, healthcare providers in direct contact with patients should wear N95 masks (series number 1860) and not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health care providers should wear tailored isolation coats in order to further reduce contact with viruses.
Viruses can also infect a person through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor became infected with SARS-CoV-2 despite wearing an N95 mask; the virus may have entered his body through his inflamed eyes.
Therefore, health care providers should also wear protective eyelashes or transparent glasses while working with patients.
For the general public of affected or potentially affected areas, it is strongly suggested that the population wash their hands with disinfectant soaps more than usual, try to stay at home in voluntary quarantine and limit contact with people who may be infected.
Three feet is considered a proper distance for people to stay away from a patient.
These measures are effective methods for reducing the risk of infection and preventing the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 appeared as a new virus for the human world, its high homology with SARS-CoV, as reported on January 7, 2020, should have caused great alarm in China for its experience with the SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, it was not until January 19, 2020 that the director of the Wuhan Center for Disease Control reassured citizens by saying that the new virus had low contagiousness and limited reproductive capacity among humans, and that there would be no problems in preventing and containing the disease.
This message remarkably relaxed the public’s alarm, especially at a time when the whole country was preparing for the Spring Festival, and the critical moment was taken away to contain the disease on a minimal scale in Wuhan.
China’s disease control agencies should learn from this hard lesson and adopt decisive improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies should be more cautious when making public announcements, as each word is important to citizens and can cause them to change their attitude or their decisions; (2) more sensitive and responsive to unusual information from clinics, rather than waiting for the formal report of doctors or officials; (3) more restrictive in order to contain a possible epidemic.
The COVID-19 outbreak caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus began in late December 2019.
In less than two months, it has spread across China and about 50 more countries around the world at the time of this analysis.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and there are also many similarities between the symptoms of COVID-19 and SARS, the COVID-19 outbreak has generated the feeling of SARS re-emergence.
However, there are some notable differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are essential to contain the epidemic and treat patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more than young people and more men than women, and severity and mortality are also higher in older people than in young people.
SARS has a higher mortality rate than COVID-19 (10.91% versus 1.44%).
Patients with COVID-19 transmit the virus even though they have no symptoms, while patients with SARS usually do so when they are seriously ill, resulting in a much greater difficulty in containing the spread of COVID-19 compared to SARS.
This explains, in part, why SARS-CoV-2 spread much faster and more widely than SARS-CoV.
Regular RNA testing for SARS-CoV-2 may be negative in some patients with COVID-19.
On the other hand, cured patients can give positive to the virus again.
These results dramatically increase the risk of the virus spreading.
Given the rapid progress in COVID-19 research, several important issues remain to be resolved, such as the following:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96% of genetic homology was found between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-like bat coronaviruses, it is still not possible to conclude that SARS-CoV-2 comes from bats.
What animal was the intermediate species that transmitted the original host virus, say, bats, to humans?
Without knowing the answers to Nos. 1 and 2, it is not possible to stop the transmission efficiently, and the outbreak can recur at any time.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical tests have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, how exactly does the virus enter the airway cells and cause subsequent pathological changes?
Does the virus also bind to cells that express ACE2 in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, it is not possible to achieve a quick and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does the virus evolve genetically as it is transmitted between humans?
Will it become a global pandemic, will it erupt like SARS, or will it periodically reappear like the flu?
Although it may take some time, it is essential to look for answers to these questions and many others.
However, no matter what the cost, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and return to our normal lives.
Zoonotic origins of human coronaviruses
Mutation and adaptation have driven the co-evolution of coronaviruses and their guests, including humans, for thousands of years.
Until 2003, two human coronaviruses were known to cause mild diseases, such as the common cold.
The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have reversed the coin by revealing how devastating and deadly a human coronavirus infection can be.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China in late 2019 put coronaviruses at the centre of attention again and surprised us with high transmissibility and reduced pathogenicity compared to its brother, SARS-CoV.
Human coronavirus infection is a zoonosis and it would be helpful to know the zoonotic origins of human coronaviruses.
Most human coronaviruses have their origin in bats, in which they are not pathogens.
Intermediate reservoir hosts of some human coronaviruses are also known.
Identifying animal hosts has direct implications for the prevention of diseases in humans.
Investigating the interactions between coronaviruses and hosts in animals could also throw important information about the pathogenicity of coronaviruses in humans.
In this analysis, we present an overview of existing knowledge about the seven human coronaviruses, with an emphasis on the history of their discovery, as well as their zoonotic origins and the transmission between species.
Notably, we compared and contrasted the different human coronaviruses from the perspective of the evolution of the virus and the recombination of the genome.
The current coronavirus disease epidemic 2019 (COVID-19) is analyzed in this context.
In addition, the requirements for successful host changes and the implications of the evolution of the virus on the severity of the disease are also highlighted.
Coronaviruses belong to the Coronaviridae family, which comprises a group of enveloped, single-stranded RNA viruses.
These viruses, which house the largest genome, 26 to 32 kilobases, among the RNA viruses, were called "coronaviruses" because of their morphology, due to the corona form they have under an electron microscope.
As for its structure, coronaviruses have unsegmented genomes that share a similar organization.
Approximately two-thirds of the genome contains two large open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which translate into the replicate polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab.
The polyproteins are further processed to generate 16 nonstructural proteins, called nsp1-16.
The remaining part of the genome contains ORF for structural proteins, including spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
A number of specific accessory proteins of each strain are also encoded by different coronavirus strains.
Based on the difference in protein sequences, coronaviruses are classified into four genera (alphacoronavirus, betacoronavirus, gammacoronavirus, and deltacoronavirus), among which the genus of betacoronaviruses contains the majority of human coronaviruses and is subdivided into four, BA, and D,
Phylogenetic evidence has shown that bats and rodents are the gene source of most alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses, while birds are the main reservoir of gammacoronaviruses and deltacoronaviruses.
For thousands of years, coronaviruses have constantly crossed the barriers of species and some have emerged as important human pathogens.
To date, seven human coronaviruses are known.
Among them, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alphacoronaviruses.
The other five beta-coronaviruses are HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms, such as a common cold or diarrhea.
Instead, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and the newly identified SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic and cause severe lower respiratory tract infection in a relatively higher number of patients, with a higher probability of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDRA) and extrapulmonary manifestations.
The first strain of HCoV-229E, B814, was isolated from the nasal secretion of patients with common cold in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more knowledge has been accumulated through extensive studies on HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, which cause self-limited symptoms.
In fact, until the outbreak of SARS, it was a widely accepted concept that human coronavirus infection is generally harmless.
The SARS outbreak that occurred in 2003 is one of the most devastating in history today and infected more than 8,000 people, with a crude lethality of about 10%.
Ten years later, the outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) led to a persistent epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula with sporadic spread to the rest of the world.
The new human coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV), later dubbed SARS-CoV-2, is the causative agent of the ongoing coronavirus disease epidemic 2019 (COVID-19), which has claimed more than 3,120 lives and infected more than 91,000 people as of March 3, 2020.
The alarm has been ringing and the world must prepare for the approaching SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
The seven human coronaviruses have a zoonotic origin in bats, mice, or domestic animals.
Several lines of evidence support the evolutionary origin of all human coronaviruses in bats, in which the viruses are well adapted and not pathogenic, but have great genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic has posed enormous medical, scientific, social and moral challenges in China and the rest of the world.
Tracing the zoonotic origins of human coronaviruses provides a framework for understanding the natural history, driving force and constraints of jumping between species.
This could also guide or facilitate the search for the reservoir and intermediate animal hosts and SARS-CoV-2 amplifiers, which would have important implications for the prevention of propagation in the future.
In this analysis, we present a general description of the zoonotic origins, the transmission between species and the pathogenesis of human coronaviruses.
In particular, we highlight and analyze the common theme that the parent viruses of human coronaviruses are normally not pathogenic in their natural reservoir hosts, but become pathogenic after transmission between species to a new host.
We also looked at the evolution trend of human coronaviruses, where increased transmissibility usually leads to a decrease in pathogenicity.
The evolution of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is also analyzed in this context.
Animal coronaviruses have been known since the late 1930s.
Before the B814 strain of HCoV-229E was first isolated from the nasal secretion of patients who had contracted a common cold, different coronaviruses had been isolated in different infected animals, such as turkey, mouse, cow, pig, cat and dog.
In recent decades, seven human coronaviruses have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of human coronavirus discoveries in chronological order (Table 1) would be informative and instructive.
The first strain of HCoV-229E was isolated from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract infection in 1966 and subsequently adapted to grow on WI-38 cell lines of the lung.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E had common cold symptoms, such as headache, sneezing, general discomfort and sore throat, with fever and cough in 10-20% of cases.
Later, in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from organ culture and the subsequent serialized pass in the brains of lactating mice.
The clinical characteristics of HCoV-OC43 infection appear to be similar to those caused by HCoV-229E, whose symptoms are identical to those of infections by other airway pathogens, such as influenza A viruses and rhinoviruses.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are distributed around the world and tend to be transmitted predominantly during the winter season, in temperate climates.
In general, the incubation time of these two viruses is less than a week, followed by a disease period of about 2 weeks.
According to a study with human volunteers, healthy people infected with HCoV-229E developed a mild common cold.
Only a few immunocompromised patients had a serious infection of the lower respiratory tract.
SARS, also known as “atypical pneumonia,” caused the first pandemic caused by a well-documented human coronavirus in human history, and the etiological agent is SARS-CoV, the third human coronavirus that was discovered.
The first SARS case dates back to late 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.
The SARS epidemic resulted in 8,096 reported cases with 774 deaths and spread across many countries and continents.
Aside from the superpropagators, it was estimated that each case could cause approximately two secondary cases, with an incubation period of 4 to 7 days and the appearance of the maximum viral load on the tenth day of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially have myalgia, headache, fever, general discomfort and chills, followed by dyspnea, coughing and breathing difficulties as late symptoms.
Lymphopenia, impaired liver function and elevated creatine kinase levels are common abnormal results in SARS laboratory tests.
Diffuse alveolar damage, proliferation of epithelial cells and an increase in macrophages are also observed in patients with SARS.
Approximately 20-30% of patients subsequently require intensive care and mechanical respiratory assistance.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, several organs, including the gastrointestinal tract, liver, and kidney, may also be infected in these severe cases, usually accompanied by a cyclone of cytokines, which could be fatal, particularly in immunodepressed patients.
The virus was first isolated from the open-air lung biopsy of a relative of the initial patient who traveled to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, enormous efforts have been devoted to the investigation of human coronaviruses.
The HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old child from the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
Initially, it was found to be prevalent in young children, older adults and immunocompromised patients with respiratory diseases.
The presence of corise, conjunctivitis, fever and bronchiolitis is common in the disease caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus from a nasal sample taken from an 8-month-old child suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it was identified in the Netherlands, it is actually distributed around the world.
It has been estimated that HCoV-NL63 causes approximately 4.7% of common respiratory diseases, and its maximum incidence occurs in early summer, spring and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also known as crup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who had been hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to community-acquired pneumonia and bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 was reported to be associated with acute exacerbations of asthma.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 was found worldwide and caused mild respiratory diseases.
These four community-acquired human coronaviruses have adapted well to humans and, in general, are less likely to mutate to cause highly pathogenic diseases, although accidents have occurred from unknown causes, as in the rare case of a more virulent subtype of HCoV-NL63 infecting a lower virulent subtype in China, which was recently reported.
In general, when these human coronaviruses acquire the ability to transmit efficiently and continuously in humans, they also become less virulent or pathogenic.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient who had developed acute pneumonia and renal failure in Saudi Arabia.
Although most laboratory-confirmed cases come from the Middle East, cases have been imported with occasional contagion to close contacts in several European countries and Tunisia.
Another secondary outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestations of MERS are similar to those of SARS, characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also developed acute renal failure, which so far only occurs with MERS among the diseases caused by human coronavirus.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhoea and vomiting.
As of February 14, 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory-confirmed cases were reported, with a high lethality of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most devastating viruses known to humans.
From mid to late December 2019, conglomerates of pneumonia patients were detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, which retrospectively associated with SARS-CoV-2.
The World Health Organization declared the ongoing outbreak of lower respiratory tract infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 a public health emergency of international importance and also named COVID-19 disease.
As of March 3, 2020, 90,053 cases have been confirmed worldwide, with a crude lethality of 3.4%.
Remarkably, the fatality in Hubei, China, is 4.2%, while outside it is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infection, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which occurs as fever, cough and dyspnea.
Diarrhoea has also been observed in some patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most serious symptoms and can quickly evolve into acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to a high nucleotide sequence homology of 82%, they are categorized into different branches of the phylogenetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 is apparently less pathogenic, but more transmissible compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Cases of asymptomatic people infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported, which could contribute to its rapid spread worldwide.
When comparing and contrasting SARS-CoV-2 with the other six human coronaviruses, similarities and differences of great interest are identified.
First, the incubation period and the duration of the course of human coronavirus disease are very similar.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six human coronaviruses.
Second, the severity of the symptoms of COVID-19 lies between SARS-CoV and the four human coronaviruses acquired in the community (i.e., HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection has features that are most commonly observed in community-acquired human coronavirus infections, including the presence of non-specific or mild symptoms or even the absence of symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subgroup of serious cases of COVID-19 is also observed as is the case with SARS-CoV infection, although the ratio is slightly smaller.
Thirdly, SARS-CoV-2 transmission also shows interesting patterns characteristic of both community-acquired human coronaviruses and SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of human coronaviruses acquired in the community.
On the other hand, it remains to be verified whether the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 decreases after passages between humans, as is the case with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, as with other human coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in fecal samples.
If the fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 performs an important function, as in the case of SARS-CoV, at least in some circumstances, it should still be diluted in future studies.
It is also of particular interest to find out if SARS-CoV-2 could exhibit seasonality, as is the case with acquired human coronaviruses in the community.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including its transmissibility, pathogenicity and sustainable propagation after human crossings, will influence the final outcome of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak.
The four human coronaviruses acquired in the community that cause mild symptoms have adapted well to humans.
From another perspective, it could also be true that humans have adapted well to these four human coronaviruses.
In other words, both could be survivors of ancient human coronavirus pandemics.
Human coronaviruses that cause serious diseases have been eliminated in humans and humans who developed serious diseases by human coronaviruses.
For this to happen, human coronaviruses must be replicated in humans to a sufficient extent to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations that counteract host restriction factors.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak persists and the more people it infects, the more likely it will be to fully adapt to humans.
If it adapts well, its transmission in humans would be difficult to stop through quarantine or other infection control measures.
For many years, the four coronaviruses acquired in the community have circulated in human populations and caused common colds in immunocompetent people.
These viruses do not need an animal reservoir.
In contrast, SARS-CoV and highly pathogenic MERS-CoV have not adapted well to humans and their transmission between humans is unsustainable.
They need to stay and propagate in their zoonotic reservoirs and seek the opportunity to propagate to susceptible human targets, possibly through one or more intermediate hosts and amplifiers.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar characteristics to both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and the four human coronaviruses acquired in the community.
It is highly transmissible as human coronaviruses acquired in the community, at least for the time being.
However, it is more pathogenic than human coronaviruses acquired in the community and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether it will fully adapt to humans and circulate among humans without a reservoir or intermediate animal host.
Before analyzing the animal origins of human coronaviruses, it will be useful to examine the definitions and characteristics of evolutionary, natural, reservoir, intermediate and amplifier hosts of human coronaviruses.
An animal acts as an evolutionary host of a human coronavirus if it houses a closely related ancestor who shares a high homology at the nucleotide sequence level.
The ancestral virus is usually well adapted and is not pathogenic in this host.
Similarly, a reservoir host hosts a human coronavirus on a continuous and long-term basis.
In both cases, guests become naturally infected and are natural guests of the human coronavirus or its parental virus.
Instead, if the human coronavirus was introduced into the intermediate host just before or at almost the same time it was introduced into humans, it is not well adapted to the new host and is usually pathogenic.
The intermediate host may act as the zoonotic source of infection in humans and fulfill the function of amplifier host by allowing the virus to be transiently replicated and then transmitted to humans to amplify the scale of infection in humans.
A human coronavirus can cause an infection in the terminal host if it cannot sustain its transmission in the intermediate host.
On the contrary, human coronaviruses can also adapt to the intermediate host and even generate long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes a natural reservoir host.
Epidemiological data revealed retrospectively that the initial case of SARS had been in contact with hunting animals.
Subsequent research on seroprevalence indicated that animal traders had a higher prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV IgG compared to that of the general population.
Masked palm civets (Paguma larvae) and a raccoon dog in live animal markets were the first identified carriers of SARS-CoV-like viruses that are almost identical to SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly supported by the fact that no more cases of SARS were recorded after killing all the civics in the markets.
However, it was reported that the civets of the wild masked palms or farms without exposure to the markets of live animals mostly gave negative in SARS-CoV, suggesting that the civets of the masked palms would only act as an amplifier intermediate host, but not as the SARS natural reservoir.
Notably, since 80% of the different animals in the Guangzhou markets have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, the possibility that several species of small mammals also act as SARS-CoV amplifier intermediate hosts cannot be ruled out.
All of them seem to be terminal guests of SARS-CoV.
Subsequent searches of the natural animal host of SARS-CoV revealed a closely related bat coronavirus, called SARS-related Rhinolophus bat CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which exists in Chinese herding bats.
These bats are positive in anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and the SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 genome sequence.
This and other bat coronaviruses share a nucleotide sequence homology of 88-92% with SARS-CoV.
These studies have laid the foundation for the new concept that bats harbor emerging pathogens in humans.
Several SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-CoV) have also been identified in bats, but none, except one called WIV1, can be isolated as a live virus.
The human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known to be the SARS-CoV receptor.
It was shown that the WIV1 obtained from a bat fecal sample uses bat, bat, and human ACE2 as a receptor to enter cells.
Astonishingly, serums of patients with recovering SARS were able to neutralize WIV1.
To date, WIV1 represents the most closely related ancestor of SARS-CoV in bats, which shares a nucleotide sequence homology of 95%.
Despite the high homology between these two viruses, in general, it is believed that WIV1 is not the immediate parent SARS-CoV virus and that bats are not the immediate reservoir host of SARS-CoV.
According to the phylogenetic analysis, MERS-CoV is categorized into the same group as bat CoV-HKU4 and bat CoV-HKU5.
The bat CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV use the same host receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), for virus entry.
MERS-CoV RNA-dependent polymerase RNA sequences phylogenetically approach their bat betacoronavirus counterparts identified in Europe and Africa.
So far, no live MERS-CoV can be found in wild bats.
The MERS-CoV and its closest relative, bat CoV-HKU25, share a nucleotide sequence homology of only 87%.
Therefore, the bat may not be the immediate reservoir host of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that dromedaries are seropositive in MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies specifically, as well as camels originating from the Middle East in several African countries.
A live MERS-CoV identical to the virus found in humans was isolated from the nasal exudate of dromedaries, which further supports that camels act as bona fide reservoir hosts of MERS-CoV.
It should also be noted that, in general, mild symptoms were observed, but a massive spread of the virus in camels infected for research with MERS-CoV.
Notably, infected camels spread viruses not only through the respiratory tract, but also through the fecal-oral tract, which is also the main route of spread of bat viruses.
However, questions remain, as many confirmed cases of MERS do not have a history of contact with camels prior to the onset of symptoms, which is reasonably attributed to transmission between humans or to unknown transmission pathways involving unrecognized animal species that host MERS.
SARS-CoV-2 shares a 96.2% nucleotide homology with a bat coronavirus, RaTG13, isolated from bats Rhinolophus affinis.
As in the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too large to assign a parental relationship.
That is, bats may not be immediate reservoir hosts of SARS-CoV-2 unless they are found in future bat coronavirus virtually identical.
Presumably, SARS-CoV-2 intermediate animal hosts should be among the wild species that are sold and killed in the Huanan seafood wholesale market, with many of the initial COVID-19 cases associated, indicating a likely event of animal-to-human transmission.
Several recent studies based on metagenomic sequencing have suggested that a group of small endangered mammals, known as pangolines (Manis javanica), may also host SARS-CoV-2-related ancestral betacoronaviruses.
The genomes of this novel pangolin coronavirus share a nucleotide sequence homology of 85-92% with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are equally closely related to RaTG13, with an identity of about 90% at the nucleotide sequence level.
They are grouped into two sublines of SARS-CoV-2-like viruses in the phylogenetic tree, one of which shares a receptor-binding domain (RBD) more similar to SARS-CoV-2, with an amino acid sequence identity of 97.4%.
In marked contrast, the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are more divergent, despite a higher degree of sequence homology across the genome.
A previous study in diseased pangolins also reported the detection of viral contigues in lung samples, which are also related to SARS-CoV-2.
This study adopted different methods of assembly and manual healing to generate a partial genome sequence comprising about 86.3% of the full-length viral genome.
We cannot rule out the possibility that pangolin is one of the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence supporting a direct origin in the SARS-CoV-2 pangolin due to the sequence divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and the betacoronaviruses of SARS-CoV-2-related pangolins.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even smaller than that between SARS-CoV-2 and betacoronaviruses of SARS-CoV-2-related pangolins.
The evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammals still needs to be established.
Although the highest sequence homology was found in RBDs between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin, beta-coronaviruses related to SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2, and RaTG13 share the highest complete genome sequence homology.
It is highly speculative that the high degree of similarity between beta-coronavirus beta-pangoline related SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 is due to the convergent evolution mediated by selectivity.
A counterproposal advocates a recombination between beta-coronavirus pangolin-related SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 in the third wild animal species.
As a driving force in evolution, recombination is widespread among beta-coronaviruses.
A conclusion has not yet been reached on the immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to highly pathogenic human coronaviruses, the zoonotic origin of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 was also studied.
Phylogenetic evidence indicated that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E could have originated from bat coronavirus, while the parent HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 viruses have been found in rodents.
A bat coronavirus called ARCoV.2 (Apalaches Mountain Coronavirus) detected in a tricolor bat in North America was reported to have a close relationship with HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E was genetically related to another bat coronavirus, called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was detected in Ghana, although camelids have also been suspected as intermediate hosts.
For further clarity, the knowledge to date of the animal origins of known human coronaviruses is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Phylogenetic analysis has provided evidence of human coronavirus transmission events between species in history.
When HCoV-OC43 crossed between species to infect humans from livestock in 1890, a pandemic of respiratory infection was recorded.
The history of transmission between HCoV-229E species is not known with such precision.
Alphacoronaviruses of bats closely related to HCoV-229E have been found.
Among them is an alpaca alfacoronavirus.
Several lines of evidence support the transmission of bat virus to humans directly.
First, unlike alpacas, humans could have contact with bats in a shared ecological niche.
Instead, humans have close contact with alpacas.
Second, HCoV-229E-related bat alphacoronaviruses are diverse and non-pathogenic in bats, while alpaca alphacoronaviruses caused an outbreak of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, alpaca alfacoronavirus has not been found in wild animals.
Therefore, the possibility of alpacas acquiring human HCoV-229E-related alphacoronavirus cannot be ruled out.
In fact, bats are the direct source of pathogenic viruses in humans, such as the rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
Therefore, it would not be too surprising that bats would transmit HCoV-229E to humans directly.
Alternatively, while bat alphacoronaviruses act as a genetic pool of HCoV-229E, alpacas and dromedaries could act as intermediate hosts that transmit the viruses to humans, specifically in the case of MERS-CoV.
The MERS-CoV serves as an excellent example of transmission between species, from bats to dromedaries, and from dromedaries to humans.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV in bats is discovered with its initial identification, and has also been supported by subsequent findings.
It is evident that bats contribute, with a rich collection of virus species, to the exchange of genetic fragments between species and to the transmission between species.
Longevity, densely populated colonies, close social interaction and great ability to fly are all favorable conditions that make bats the ideal “virus propagator.”
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV has been introduced into dromedaries for decades.
It is well adapted to these camels, who have gone from being an intermediate guest, to being a stable and natural reservoir guest.
MERS-CoV causes very mild disease and maintains a relatively low mutation rate in these animals.
Its sporadic transmission to humans is an accident and humans remain a terminal host of MERS-CoV, as the transmission is unsustainable.
Compared to the role of camels in the transmission of MERS-CoV, the role of pangolines, if any, in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is different.
In particular, beta-coronaviruses of pangolins are highly pathogenic in pangolins.
They may be a terminal host of SARS-CoV-2-related beta-coronaviruses, as are the civets in the case of SARS-CoV.
Several possibilities of transmission between species of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans should be confirmed or ruled out in future studies.
First, bats could be the reservoir host of a SARS-CoV-2-related virus, almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans could share the ecological niche with bats, through slaughter or coal mining.
Secondly, pangolins could be one of the intermediate amplifier hosts in which a SARS-CoV-2-related virus had recently been introduced.
Humans contract the virus through slaughter and consumption of hunting meat.
Many mammals, including pets, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
A study of antibodies in domestic and wild animals is needed.
Thirdly, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 could have occurred in a third species that has contact with both bats and pangolins.
The search for the animal origins of SARS-CoV-2 continues.
Aside from the different types of animal hosts, three main factors in viral terms also play an important role in facilitating coronaviruses crossing the barriers of the species.
First, their mutation rates are relatively high in RNA replication.
Compared to other single-chain RNA viruses, the estimated mutation rates of coronaviruses could be considered "moderate" to "high", with an average substitution rate of <0x7E>10-4 substitutions per year, per site 2, depending on the coronavirus adaptation phase to new guests.
Coronaviruses have a reading-check exorribonuclease, the elimination of which results in extremely high mutability and attenuation or even unfeasibility.
Interestingly, it is known that the remdesivir nucleotide analog suppresses the replication of the coronavirus by inhibiting this exorribonuclease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents tested in clinical trials.
However, the mutation rates of coronaviruses are about a million times higher than those of their guests.
In addition, the mutation rate is usually high when coronaviruses are not well adapted to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV, which has a high mutation rate, the SARS-CoV-2 mutation rate is apparently lower, suggesting a higher level of adaptation to humans.
It is to be expected that it has already adapted to another host close to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to dromedaries.
In theory, genetic drift is unlikely to cause vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 to lose their effectiveness quickly.
Secondly, the long RNA genome of coronaviruses exerts additional plasticity in genome modification for mutations and recombination, thereby increasing the likelihood of co-evolution between species, which promotes the appearance of new coronaviruses when appropriate conditions are given.
This is supported by the copious unique open reading frames and the functions of the proteins encoded towards the 3' direction of the genome.
Third, coronaviruses randomly and frequently change templates during RNA replication by a unique copy-choice mechanism.
In a host acting as a mixing vehicle, the chain change often occurs during RNA transcription of the coronavirus.
Full-length and highly homologous subgenomic RNAs could be recombined to generate new coronaviruses.
Natural recombinant phylogenetic evidence has been found in HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as in animal coronaviruses such as bat SL-CoV and bat CoV-HKU9.
Viral-host interaction in relation to transmission
In addition to the three above-mentioned viral factors, viral interaction with the host receptor is another key factor that influences the transmission between species.
Here, SARS-CoV recombination is taken as a typical example, which also showed evidence of positive selection in cross-species transmission events.
Based on the comparative analysis between isolated SARS-CoV strains of humans and civitas, SARS-CoV is believed to undergo rapid adaptation in different hosts, in particular with mutations in the RBD of protein S.
In general, the S-protein RBD of a coronavirus interacts with the cell receptor and is intensively selected by the host antibody response.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is found in amino acids 318 to 510 in the S1 fragment, which binds to human ACE2 and its receptors for viral entry.
The SARS-CoV RBD is able to recognize ACE2 receptors from several animals, including bat, civet, mouse, and raccoon dog, allowing transmission between virus species.
In fact, as observed, only 6 amino acid residues were different from the isolated strains of human and civeta viruses in the RBD and 4 of them are found in the receptor binding motif for interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
Civet SARS-CoV has K479N and S487T mutations in its RBD, which could increase the affinity of the spike protein interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions could be fundamental for the adaptation of the virus to humans.
It should be noted that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cellular receptor with SARS-CoV.
A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of protein S implies that the binding affinity of protein S to human ACE2 could have been altered.
In fact, an electron cryomicroscopy study indicates a 10- to 20-fold greater affinity of this binding compared to that of human ACE2 and SARS-CoV protein S.
It will also be of interest to determine whether any other receptors may be necessary for transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Surprisingly, HCoV-NL63 also binds to ACE2, but with a different portion of S.
There are many other human coronavirus receptors, such as aminopeptidease N in HCoV-229E and sialic acid 9-O-acetylated in HCoV-OC43.
They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of these coronaviruses in humans, after the transmission between species from their animal hosts.
In addition to cellular receptors, the outcome of transmission between human coronavirus species is also determined by other factors of dependence and restriction of the host.
The divergence of these host proteins between humans and the natural reservoir hosts of human coronaviruses, such as bats, dromedaries and rodents, could constitute an obstacle to transmission between species.
Human coronaviruses must usurp host dependency factors and subvert host restriction factors in order for the transmission between species to be successful.
In this regard, the molecular determinants in this important <0xC3><0xA1>rea of virus-host interaction still need to be identified and characterized.
Objective full genome research on host dependency and restriction factors for SARS-CoV-2 using advanced CRISPR technology could be beneficial.
The emergence of new human coronaviruses: we start from scratch
The diversity of bat coronaviruses provides numerous opportunities for the emergence of new human coronaviruses.
In this sense, bat coronaviruses act as the genetic pool of human coronaviruses.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination also drive the evolution of human coronaviruses and constitute two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein-coding genes has the potential to drastically modify viral phenotypes.
Among SARS-CoV accessory proteins, ORF8 was considered important in human adaptation, as SARS-CoV-related bat viruses were isolated, but it was determined that they encode divergent ORF8 proteins.
A characteristic elimination of 29 SARS-CoV nucleotides was found in isolated strains at the onset of the epidemic in humans.
This elimination divides ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and is believed to be an adaptive mutation that promotes host change.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a possible history of recombination with alpha and gammacoronavirus strains, in which a large number of smaller recombinant regions were identified in RNA polymerase dependent RNA.
Recombination locations were also identified in nsp9, most of nsp10 and parts of nsp14.
Similarly, it has been shown that the MERS-CoV epidemic suffered recombination events between different lineages, which occurred in dromedaries in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events have also been observed in other human coronaviruses, in which human coronaviruses are recombined with other animal coronaviruses in their nonstructural genes.
It should also be noted that artificial selection may contribute to undesirable changes in viral genomes, which is more likely to result from releasing viruses from selection pressures exerted, for example, by the host immune system.
An example of these effects is the loss of a full-length ORF4 in the HCoV-229E prototype strain, due to the elimination of two nucleotides.
Although an intact ORF4 in HCoV-229E-related bat and camel virus could be observed, alpaca alfacoronavirus has a single nucleotide insertion, causing a frame change.
Last but not least, the evolution of new human coronaviruses is also driven by the selection pressure on their reservoir guests.
No symptoms were detected or only mild symptoms were detected when bats were infected with coronavirus, indicating mutual adaptation between coronaviruses and bats.
Apparently, bats are well-adapted to coronaviruses anatomically and physiologically.
For example, defects in the activation of the pro-inflammatory response in bats efficiently reduce the pathology caused by coronaviruses.
In addition, the activity of natural killer cells in bats is suppressed due to the positive regulation of the natural killer cell inhibitor receptor NKG2/CD94 and the low level of expression of the class I molecules of the major histocompatibility complex.
In addition, the high level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated from the high metabolic activity of bats could suppress the replication of the coronavirus and affect the reading check of the exorribonuclease, which provides the selection pressure for the generation of new strains of highly pathogenic viruses when a pathogen is introduced.
More pathogenic coronavirus strains could also evolve by recombination, which would lead to the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics for adaptation to the host.
Therefore, it is no coincidence that three new human coronaviruses have emerged in the last two decades.
Coronaviruses are not pathogenic or cause mild symptoms in their reservoir hosts, such as bats and camels.
They replicate vigorously without provoking a strong immune response from the host.
Here are the secrets of why there are asymptomatic carriers and what causes serious cases of infection in humans.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to hyperactivation of the immune response and cytokine storm, in which the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lung damage.
Instead, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response has been dissociated from the replication of the coronavirus.
The same strategy of decoupling the immune response could have beneficial effects on anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
The interferon response is especially strong in bats.
Therefore, administration of type I interferon, at least in the early stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans, should be beneficial.
In addition, the activation of the NLRP3 inflammatory disease in bats is defective.
According to this reasoning, inhibition of NLRP3 inflammation with MCC950 could be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general line that led to the emergence of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Although a bat betacoronavirus has been found to share a 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV, there is also a bat coronavirus share a 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Although civets and other market animals have been found to host viruses identical to SARS-CoV, no immediate SARS-CoV-2 intermediate hosts have been identified.
Betacoronaviruses of pangolins have been found to be remarkably homologous to SARS-CoV-2, indicating that pangolins could act as one of the intermediate hosts or that betacoronaviruses of pangolins could contribute gene fragments to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is made by man, either deliberately or by accident.
Coronaviruses have regained prominence due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
The study of coronaviruses in bats and other animals has profoundly changed our perception of the importance of zoonotic origins and animal reservoirs of human coronaviruses in human transmission.
Extensive evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originated in bats and are transmitted to humans through intermediate hosts.
Since SARS-CoV infection originates from contact between humans and civics in markets, closing wet markets and killing civics that had in them could have been effective in curbing the SARS epidemic.
Following this same reasoning, pangolins should be removed from wet markets to prevent zoonotic transmission, given the discovery of several strains of pangolin betacoronavirus closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, whether and how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through pangolins and other mammals remains to be diluted in future research.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has existed in dromedaries for a long time.
These camels are an important transportation tool as well as a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool for the local population.
They are widely distributed throughout the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, it is impossible to sacrifice all camels to control MERS, as was done in China with wild animal markets to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To prevent recurrent outbreaks of MERS, a comprehensive approach should be taken to develop effective MERS-CoV vaccines for camels, in combination with other infection control measures.
Since we are not able to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes may appear that cause outbreaks.
A variety of zoonotic coronaviruses, are circulating in the wild.
In particular, bat coronaviruses with zoonotic potential are very diverse.
There is a great chance that these zoonotic coronaviruses will evolve and recombine, which would lead to the emergence of new coronaviruses that are more transmissible or more deadly in humans in the future.
The culture of eating wild animals in some parts of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
On the basis of poor experiences with SARS, MERS and COVID-19, a better preparedness and response plan should be adopted.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a very long time.
They remain in their own natural reservoirs until the opportunity to propagate is presented.
Although bats have many characteristics that favor the spread of viruses, human contact opportunities with bats and other wild species can be minimized if the population is educated to move away from them.
Continuous monitoring of mammals is necessary to better understand the ecology of coronaviruses and their natural hosts, which will be useful in preventing transmission from animal to human and future outbreaks.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonoses is for humans to stay away from ecological niches from the natural reservoirs of zoonotic viruses.
Several pieces are still missing in the puzzle of the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
First, if bats transmit an ancestral SARS-CoV-2 virus to pangolins, it will be interesting to analyze under what circumstances bats and pangolins could share the same ecological niche.
Secondly, if bats have a more direct role in human transmission, it should be determined how humans come into contact with bats.
Third, if a third mammal acts as the true intermediate host, it should be clarified how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats, and pangolins.
Finally, since many mammals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, experimental surveillance and infection should be carried out.
Whether it is a bat, a pangolin or another mammal, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or its parental viruses that are nearly identical will be identified in their natural hosts in the future.
Continuous research in this area will shed light on the evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
Diagnostic criteria for “suspicious cases” and “confirmed cases” of COVID-19 need to be updated
On February 6, 2020, our team published a quick guidance guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of new coronavirus infection 2019 (2019-nCoV), and this guideline included our experience and constitutes a good reference for fighting this pandemic worldwide.
However, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge gradually increase based on the results of ongoing research and experience in clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also continuously updated.
In this letter, we respond to a commentary on our guideline and provide the latest diagnostic criteria for "suspicious case" and "confirmed case" according to the latest Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 (seventh edition) published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new 2019 coronavirus (2019-nCoV) caused an outbreak, now officially known as 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and the virus was named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, the WHO described COVID-19 as a pandemic.
To combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a quick advisory guideline that was published online in Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
It has attracted a lot of attention since it was published.
However, it should be noted that COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge gradually increase based on the results of ongoing research and experience in clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also continuously updated.
For example, the Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), between January 16, 2020 and March 3, 2020, have published a total of seven editions and some contexts have changed considerably.
Now, our guide received a comment from Zhou et al., they presented a simple classification proposal based on their clinical experience.
His work added new evidence to our guideline and is also a valuable reference for this pandemic around the world.
We support your important work and express our gratitude.
However, their work also needs to be updated according to the latest Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 (seventh version of the trial) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (March 3, 2020), to confirm a suspected case, it is necessary to combine any point of epidemiological background characteristics with two points of clinical manifestations for a comprehensive analysis, or three points of clinical manifestations must be met if there is no epidemiological background:
epidemiological case reports: (1) travel or residency in the city of Wuhan or surrounding areas, or other communities where COVID-19 cases have been reported in the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (2) contact history with SARS-CoV-positive cases, and (3) contact history with SARS-CoV-positive cases.
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever or respiratory symptoms; (2) features in images of COVID-19 infection; (3) total white blood cell counts showing normal, decreased or reduced lymphocyte count in the early onset stage.
The diagnosis of a specific specific case V-confirmed must be based on a suspected case SA2 with some characteristic of pathogenic or serological tests in the following manner: (1) polymerase chain reaction test in real time positive for SARS-CoV-2; (2) full viral genome sequencing against I-G-containing anti-coup; and anti-Coupled anti-M-containing anti-Couple (3).
We can see that the polymerase chain reaction test in real time to detect nucleic acid in blood or respiratory samples was added to the second (January 18, 2020) and third (January 22, 2020) editions.
Pathogen detection of blood samples was added to the fourth (January 27, 2020) and fifth (February 8, 2020) editions; and then, serological tests were added to the seventh edition.
<0x7B>NS<0x7D>
In addition, there is more and more evidence that reminds us that we should be cautious with asymptomatic and atypical patients.
Therefore, the flow chart of Zhou et al. should be updated, as they classified the person without clinical symptoms as "low risk".
The scoring system should also be verified in other clinical studies and practices.
To conclude, we expect more direct evidence to emerge and ask readers to send us their comments.
For the diagnosis of "suspicious case" and "confirmed case", we recommend looking for and complying with the latest guidelines from their countries of origin.

Bangladesh reports five new deaths due to COVID-19, the highest in a day
Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths due to COVID-19 in one day.
It is the highest number of deaths in a day due to the virus.
As of yesterday, Bangladesh’s Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reported that the number of registered infected cases included 114 active cases and 33 recovered cases that were staying in their homes.
A total of 17 deaths have been recorded.
In an online briefing, IEDCR Director Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora said the victims were four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two cases were over 60 years old, two between 51 and 60 years old and one between 41 and 50 years old.
He also said two of the victims were from Daca.
On March 11, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 pandemic.
A hospital official told Anadolu Agency, a local news outlet, that one of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bangladesh Anti-Corruption Commission, whom they were serving at the Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, in an online video announcement, Bangladesh’s Minister of Road and Bridge Transport, Obaidul Quader, said that public transport would be suspended for longer than originally planned, until next Saturday.
This suspension of public transport had initially begun on March 26 and was scheduled to end on Saturday, April 4.
The transport of essential goods, such as medical supplies, fuel and food, was still allowed.
The first recorded cases of COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh occurred on March 8, two men returning from Italy and also the wife of one of them.
By March 19, these three had already recovered.
More than one million SARS-CoV-2 infections worldwide
On Thursday, the total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infections exceeded one million worldwide, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
At least 52,000 deaths were related to COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.
The milestone took place the same day that Malawi confirmed its first coronavirus infections and Zambia had its first coronavirus-related death.
North Korea said on Thursday it was one of the few countries without coronavirus infections.
Yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases in the twenty-four hours preceding 10:00 a.m., European Central Time (UTC-0800), on 4 April.
In the United States, there were more than 244,000 cases of coronavirus, linked to at least 5900 deaths.
CBS News reported, citing data from Johns Hopkins University, that on Wednesday there were more than 1,000 deaths in the United States caused by coronavirus infections.
Worldwide, countries have announced stricter measures to inhibit the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, the mayor of Moscow, extended the closure of the city until May 1.
At the national level, President Vladimir Putin declared that the Russians would continue to receive their salaries without going to work until April 30.
The Portuguese parliament voted to extend the state of national emergency for 15 days; the vote was approved by 215 votes in favour, ten abstentions and one vote against.
Saudi Arabia extended the stay touches in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina throughout the day; previously, the stay touch was only held between 3:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m.
Thailand planned to implement a touch of stay between 10:00 p.m. and 4:00 a.m.
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine announced that the state had extended its order to stay at home until May 1.
Supermarkets in Australia lower hygienic paper limits per transaction
On Sunday and Saturday afternoon, Australian supermarket chains Woolworths and Coles lowered their hygienic paper purchase limits to two and one package per transaction in all supermarkets in the country, respectively.
On Monday, ALDI also applied the limit of a package.
These limitations were posted as messages on the boxes and Facebook pages of the chains.
Consumers were reported to be supplying themselves for fear of COVID-19 in case people had to self-isolate.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited purchases of toilet paper for home delivery to one package per order.
These changes were introduced after the previous four-pack transaction restriction applied by Woolworths and Coles on March 4 and 5, respectively.
Coles, in his March 8 press release, reported that, with the application of the four-pack restriction, “many supermarkets still run out of the product within one hour of delivery,” and said the demand “had no precedent,” while ALDI, in a Facebook post on Tuesday, said it was “unexpected.”
Sales rose with a "strong rise" last week, according to a Woolworths spokesperson.
The Costco supermarket in Canberra also limited the quantity to two packages last week.
To further alleviate the shortage, Coles requested larger packages from suppliers and increased the frequency of deliveries, Woolworths ordered additional stocks, while ALDI made stocks available for a Wednesday special offer planned in advance.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said retailers are trying to increase stocks, but local city council restrictions on truck delivery schedules make it difficult.
It anticipates an increase in production costs as suppliers try to meet demand, and fewer offers.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that after the early release of stocks, some supermarkets cannot make Wednesday’s special offer.
In a report on News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail expert at Queensland University of Technology, said that supermarkets supply supplies every night.
He emphasized that toilet paper is a bulky item, which causes a low amount of inventory in numbers, and, when exhausted, leaves a large empty space in the shelves, which intensifies the feeling of scarcity.
Coles and Woolworths have the idea that if there were an abundant amount of the item on the shelves, if products like toilet paper rolls and disinfectants could be bought and there were large amounts, panic would probably be minimized, Russell Zimmerman told ABC News.
Recycled toilet paper maker Who Gives to Crap said on Wednesday that they ran out of stock.
Kimberly-Clark, who manufactures Kleenex toilet paper, and Solaris Paper, who manufactures Sorbent, said they were working 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, to maintain supply, according to the report on News.com.au.
Domain.com, a real estate site, reported that some property sellers offered free toilet paper to the first bidder at auctions in Melbourne, when fewer auctions were held because buyers had free time over the long weekend of Labor Day.
The Thursday edition of NT News, a newspaper printed in Darwin, included an eight-page billboard designed to be cut and used as toilet paper.
Supermarkets were initially reluctant to impose restrictions, according to a March 3 report by ABC Australia, in which they said they had no plans to introduce restrictions on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products are also in high demand, including masks, disinfectant, dry products, liquid soap and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia, on Sunday afternoon it was observed that the British online supermarket Ocado limited purchases of Andres toilet paper to two 12-roll packages.
The World Health Organization declares COVID-19 pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a pandemic the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
While the word “pandemic” only refers to the extent of the spread of a disease, not how dangerous specific cases are, WHO underlined the need to push governments to take action:
All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
If countries detect, test, treat, isolate, identify and mobilize their residents in the response, said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General.
We are very concerned, both by the alarming levels of propagation and gravity, and by the alarming levels of inaction.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic “has no precedent.”
In a statement released by CNN in February, he said, “In addition to the flu, no other respiratory virus has been traced from its onset to continued global spread.”
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar opinion, and said "we have never seen a pandemic caused by a coronavirus before."
“And we’ve never seen a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time,” he added.
The new pandemic situation comes after the WHO’s decision in January to declare the outbreak a public health emergency of international importance.
The director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said about the outbreak, “in conclusion, it will get worse.”
As of Thursday, the Associated Press reported that there were at least 126,000 COVID-19 cases worldwide, and more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing coronavirus disease pandemic (COVID-19), caused by coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, declared a public health emergency of international importance on January 30, 2020, and was recognized as a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
As of April 10, 2020, approximately 1.61 million COVID-19 cases were reported in 210 countries and territories, and about 97,000 deaths as a result.
About 364,000 people recovered.
The case-by-case mortality rate was estimated to be 4% in China, while globally it ranges from 13.04% in Algeria to 0.08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time from exposure to the onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but can vary from two to fourteen days.
There is no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment.
The primary treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy. The recommended preventive measures include washing your hands, covering your mouth when coughing, keeping away from other people, and controlling and self-isolating people who suspect they are infected.
Authorities around the world responded by implementing travel restrictions, quarantine, touchdowns, workplace hazard controls and facility closures.
The pandemic caused a severe global socio-economic disruption, the postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, and the widespread shortage of supplies aggravated by panic-driven purchases.
Schools and universities closed nationally or locally in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4% of the world’s student population.
Misinformation about the virus was disseminated on the Internet, and there were incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese people, other people of Eastern and Southeast Asian descent and appearance, and others from areas with significant virus cases.
Due to the reduction of travel and closures in the heavy industry, there was a decrease in air pollution and carbon emissions.
On December 31, 2019, health authorities in Wuhan, China (the capital of Hubei province) reported a group of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause, and an investigation was launched in early January 2020.
The cases, for the most part, were related to the Huanan seafood wholesale market, so the virus was thought to have a zoonotic origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus closely related to bat coronaviruses, pangolin coronaviruses and SARS-CoV. Subsequently, it was discovered that the first person who was known to have been in a group with symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 became ill on December 1, 2019.
Of the first group of cases reported in December 2019, it was determined that two-thirds had a link with the market.
On March 13, 2020, an unverified new report from the South China Morning Post suggested that, a case dating back to November 17, 2019, of a 55-year-old person from Hubei province, could have been the first. On February 26, 2020, the WHO amounted that, as the new cases out of China, according to reports, South China's case, Co-increased in China but increased.
There may be a considerable number of unreported cases, especially among those with milder symptoms.
As of 26 February, relatively few cases had been reported in young people, and those aged 19 and under accounted for 2.4% of cases worldwide. Patrick Vallance, the UK's chief scientific adviser, estimated that 60% of the UK's population would have to effectively become infected before it could log in.
The cases relate to the number of people who were tested for COVID-19, and who obtained a confirmed positive result according to official protocols.
As of 23 March, no country had conducted tests in more than 3% of its population, and many countries had official policies not to test people who only had mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on March 16 revealed that, in China, as of January 23, an estimated 86% of COVID-19 infections had not been detected, and that these unregistered infections were the source of infection in 79% of the cases recorded.
A statistical analysis published on March 30 estimated that the amounts of infections in Italy were considerably higher than reported cases.
Initial estimates of the baseline reproductive number (R0) for COVID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found it could be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 are recovering.
For those who do not, the time from the development of symptoms to death has been between 6 and 41 days, the most common being 14 days.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths had been attributed to COVID-19.
In China, as of February 5, about 80% of deaths corresponded to people over 60 years of age, and 75% had pre-existing diseases, including cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Official records of deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic, usually refer to people who died according to official protocols.
The number of actual deaths due to COVID-19 may be much higher, as people who died without being tested, for example, in their homes, in nursing homes, etc. may not be included.
Partial data from Italy revealed that the number of additional deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official COVID deaths by a factor of 4 to 5 times.
A spokesman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) admitted "We know [the number of reported deaths] is an underestimation," a statement corroborated by the anecdotal reports of first-time subcounting in the United States.
The first death outside mainland China occurred on February 1 in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia occurred in France on February 14.
On February 28, outside mainland China, more than a dozen deaths were recorded in each of the countries of Iran, South Korea and Italy.
As of 13 March, more than forty countries and territories had reported deaths on all continents except Antarctica, and a number of indicators were generally used to quantify mortality.
These numbers vary by region and over time, and are influenced by the number of tests, the quality of the health system, the treatment options, the time elapsed since the initial outbreak, and the characteristics of the population, such as age, gender and general health. The proportion of deaths on cases within determines the interval time of deaths divided by the number of cases.
According to statistics from Johns Hopkins University, the global proportion of deaths to cases is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204) as of April 10, 2020.
The number varies depending on the region.
In China, the estimates of the proportion of deaths per cause of reflux in cases decreased from 17.3% (in those with the onset of symptoms from January 1 to 10, 2020) to 0.7% (in those with the onset of symptoms after February 1, 2020).
These statistics do not have a defined time limit and consider a specific population from infection to resolution of the case.
Some scholars have tried to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at the University of Oxford estimates that the overall pandemic infection mortality rate is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The higher estimation of this range is consistent with the results of the first randomized tests for COVID-19 in Germany, and a statistical study that analyzed the impact of the tests on the estimates of the case fatality rate.
The WHO says the pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and the final duration of the outbreak are uncertain and may vary depending on the location.
Maciej Boni of Pennsylvania State University said, “Infectious outbreaks, if not controlled, generally stabilize and then begin to decline when the disease goes unavailable.
But right now, it’s almost impossible to make a reasonable prediction of when that will happen.”
China's top medical adviser, Zhong Nanshan, said it "could end in June" if all countries can be mobilized to follow the WHO's recommendation on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said that SARS-CoV-2 “will remain in circulation, possibly for one or two years.”
According to the Imperial College study led by Neil Ferguson, physical distancing and other measures will be necessary "until a vaccine is available (possibly 18 months or more)."
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said, “I think it’s unlikely that this coronavirus, given that it is so easily transmitted, will disappear completely” and “could become a seasonal disease, which reappears every year.”
The virulence of the recurrence would depend on the collective immunity and the magnitude of the mutation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 may be relatively non-specific and infected people may be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
The less common symptoms include fatigue, production of sputum in the respiratory tract (flame), loss of sense of smell, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, hemoptysis, diarrhea or cyanosis.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of the United States, emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, pressure or persistent pain in the chest, sudden confusion, difficulty waking up and bluish coloring may occur in the face or lips; in the event of severe recurrence of these symptoms.
Some of the infected people may be asymptomatic, not presenting clinical symptoms, although the test results confirm the infection, therefore, the researchers advised to carefully monitor and examine those who have close contact with confirmed infected people in order to rule out the infection.
Chinese estimates of the proportion of asymptomatic people range from a few to 44%.
The usual incubation period (the time between infection and onset of symptoms) ranges from one to 14 days; most often it is 5 days. As an example of uncertainty, the estimate of the proportion of people with COVID-19 who lost their sense of smell at first was 30% and then decreased to 15%.
Some details of how the disease spreads are still being determined.
It is believed that the disease spreads mainly during close contact and through small drops that occur when coughing, sneezing or speaking; narrow contact is considered a distance of 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
According to studies, when coughing without covering the mouth, droplets can move from 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some have suggested that the virus can also be transmitted through small droplets that remain in the air for longer periods, which can be generated when speaking. Breathing droplets can also occur during exhalation, even when speaking, although, usually, the virus is not transmitted through the air.
Drops can enter the mouth or nose of people who are nearby or possibly inhale into the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), can cause aerosolization of respiratory secretions and, therefore, air propagation.
It can also spread when one touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, and then touches the eyes, nose, or mouth.
While there is concern that it may be transmitted through the feces, this risk is thought to be low.
The Chinese government denied the possibility of oral fecal transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is more contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although propagation may be possible before the symptoms manifest and in more advanced stages of the disease.
People obtained positive results in disease tests up to three days before the onset of symptoms, indicating that transmission is possible before significant symptoms develop.
There are only a few laboratory-confirmed asymptomatic cases reports, but some countries have identified asymptomatic transmission during contact tracking investigations.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) argues that while it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, a person usually infects two or three others. The virus survives from hours to days on the surfaces.
Specifically, the virus was determined to be detectable for up to three days in plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel 304, one day in cardboard and up to four hours in copper.
This, however, varies depending on the humidity and temperature. Positive results were obtained in COVID-19 tests performed on pets and other animals.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, although British authorities recommend washing their hands after contact with animals, as well as after contact with other surfaces that may have touched infected people.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, which was first isolated from three people with pneumonia linked to the group of cases of acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All the features of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in nature-related coronaviruses. Outside of the human body, the virus dies by coming into contact with soap, which dissolves its protective envelope. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
It is believed to have a zoonotic origin.
Genetic analyses revealed that the coronavirus is genetically grouped with the genus betacoronavirus, its subgenus sarbecovirus (line B) along with two bat-derived strains.
At the level of the complete genome, it is 96% identical to other bat coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there is only one difference in amino acids in certain parts of the genome sequences between pangolin viruses and those of humans.
To date, the full genome comparison indicated that pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 share a maximum of 92% of the genetic material, which is not enough to demonstrate that pangolins are the intermediate host.
Virus infection can be provisionally diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, although, ultimately, it is confirmed by the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of infected secretions or by computerized tomography imaging.
According to a study conducted in Wuhan in which the polymerase chain reaction was compared with computed tomography, computed tomography is much more sensitive than the polymerase chain reaction, though less specific, and many of the features in the images coincide with the processes of other diseases and pneumonia.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends “not to use computed tomography as a method of detection or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19.”
The WHO has published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was published on January 17.
The test uses the polymerase chain reaction with real-time reverse transcriptase (rRT-PCR).
The test can be done on blood or respiratory samples.
The results are usually available within a few hours or days.
Usually, this test is done with a nasopharyngeal sysop, although a throat sysop can also be used. Some laboratories and companies are developing serological tests, which detect antibodies.
As of April 6, 2020, none of these proved to be accurate enough for widespread use to be approved.
In the U.S., a serological test developed by Cellex was approved for emergency use by certified laboratories only.
Characteristic features in X-rays and CT scans of symptomatic people include asymmetrical peripheral discolored glass opacities and absent pleural leaks.
The Italian Society of Radiology is compiling an international online database of the results obtained in confirmed case pictures.
Due to overlap with other infections such as adenovirus, the unconfirmed imaging diagnosis by polymerase chain reaction has a limited specificity in the identification of COVID-19.
A large study conducted in China compared the results of chest CT scans to those of the polymerase chain reaction and showed that, although the imaging diagnosis is less specific to the infection, it is faster and more sensitive, suggesting its consideration as a detection tool in the areas affected by the epidemic.
Convolutional neural networks based on artificial intelligence were developed to detect virus characteristics in the images, both with X-rays and with computerized tomography.
Strategies to prevent the transmission of the disease include maintaining good general personal hygiene, washing your hands, avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth with your hands without washing them before, and sneezing or coughing on a disposable cloth and throwing the cloth directly into a garbage container.
It is recommended that those who may already be infected wear a surgical mask in public.
Physical distancing measures are also recommended to prevent transmission; many Governments have restricted or inadvised all non-essential travel to and from countries and areas affected by the outbreak.
However, the virus has reached the stage of community spread in many parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within communities, and some community members do not know where or how they got infected. It is recommended that health care providers who care for someone who might be infected take standard precautions, contact precautions, and use higher sanitation or eye protection. Generating contacts is an important method for authorizing contacts.
The use of mobile phone location data by governments for this purpose has raised privacy concerns, and Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issued a statement demanding limits on this type of surveillance.
Several mobile apps have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use, and as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record a user’s proximity to other mobile phones.
Users then receive a message if they were in close contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19. They are circulating misconceptions about how to prevent infection; for example, nasal washing and mouth rinsing gauze are not effective.
There is no vaccine against COVID-19, although many organizations are working to develop one.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after using the bath or when they have visibly dirty hands; before eating and after snoring, coughing or sneezing.
This is because, outside the human body, the virus dies when it comes into contact with soap, which disintegrates its protective bubble.
The CDC also recommended using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol by volume when no soap and water are available.
The WHO recommends that people avoid touching their eyes, nose or mouth with their hands without washing them before.
The surfaces can be decontaminated with several solutions (within one minute after exposure to the disinfectant on a stainless steel surface), including 62-71% ethanol, 50-100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, 7% povidone, and 0-25% povidone iodine.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that, if a case of COVID is suspected or confirmed in a facility, such as an office or nursery, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, common spaces, shared electronic equipment, such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls and ATMs be disinfected.
Health organizations recommend that people cover their mouth and nose with a flexed elbow or a disposable cough or sneeze scarf, and discard the scarf immediately.
It is recommended that those who may be infected wear surgical masks, as the use of a mask can limit the volume and distance traveled by respiratory droplets that disperse when speaking, sneezing and coughing.
The WHO issued instructions on when and how to wear masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "Using a mask can reduce people's tendency to touch their face, which is an important source of infection without proper hand hygiene." It has also been recommended to use masks in people who care for someone who might have the disease.
The WHO has recommended the use of masks by healthy people only if they are at high risk, for example, those who care for a person with COVID-19, although it also recognizes that wearing masks can help people avoid touching their face.
Several countries have begun to promote the use of masks by the public.
In the U.S., the CDC recommends using non-medical fabric masks. China specifically recommended the use of disposable medical masks by healthy members of the public, especially when they are in close contact (1 meter (3 feet) or less) with other people.
Hong Kong recommends using a surgical mask to take public transport or be in busy places.
Thailand’s health officials recommend people make fabric masks in their homes and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia banned access to public spaces without wearing a mask or covering their nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam asked all people to wear a mask while in public spaces to be able to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government demanded the use of masks by all people entering a supermarket.
Israel has asked all residents to wear masks in public.
Taiwan, which has manufactured ten million masks a day since mid-March, on April 1 demanded the use of masks by passengers on intercity trains and buses.
Panama imposed the mandatory use of masks to go outdoors, while also recommending the manufacture of homemade masks to those who cannot buy them.
Masks have also been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) includes infection control measures designed to curb the spread of the disease by minimizing close contact between people.
Methods include quarantine, travel restrictions and the closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theaters and shopping malls.
People can implement methods of social distancing by staying in their homes, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, using forms of greeting that do not include contact, and physically distance themselves from other people.
Many governments now demand or recommend social distancing in regions affected by the outbreak.
The maximum size of the meetings recommended by U.S. government agencies and health organizations was rapidly reduced from 250 people (if there was no known spread of COVID-19 in a region) to 50 people, and subsequently to 10 people.
On March 22, 2020, Germany finally banned social gatherings of more than two people. Adults and those with underlying diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension and compromised immune systems are more likely to suffer from serious diseases and complications, and CDCs are recommended.
The use of the term "social distancing" has resulted in the assumption that people should adopt complete social isolation, rather than encouraging them to stay in touch with other people through alternative means. Some authorities have published guidelines on sexual health for use during the pandemic.
They include recommendations of having sex only with a person with whom they live, who does not have the virus or symptoms of the virus.
Self-isolation at home was recommended for those diagnosed with COVID-19 and those suspected of having been infected.
Detailed instructions on adequate self-isolation have been issued by health agencies, and many Governments have required or recommended self-quarantine of entire populations in the affected areas.
Stricter self-quarantine instructions were issued for those belonging to high-risk groups.
People who may have been in contact with someone with COVID-19 and who have recently traveled to a country or a region with widespread transmission are recommended to self-quarantine for 14 days from the time of the last possible exposure.
Strategies for controlling an outbreak are containment or suppression and mitigation.
The containment is carried out in the early stages of the outbreak and is aimed at identifying and isolating infected people, as well as introducing other infection control measures and vaccines to prevent the disease from spreading to the rest of the population.
When it is no longer possible to control the spread of the disease, efforts are moved to the mitigation phase: measures are taken to curb the spread and mitigate its effects on the health system and society.
A combination of containment and mitigation measures can be adopted at the same time.
The suppression requires more extreme measures to be able to reverse the pandemic through the reduction of the basic number of reproduction to less than 1. Part of controlling the outbreak of an infectious disease involves trying to decrease the epidemic peak, which is known as flattening the epidemic curve.
This reduces the risk of health services collapsing and allows more time for the development of vaccines and treatments.
The non-pharmaceutical interventions that can control the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, use of masks and self-quarantine; Community measures oriented to physical distancing, such as closure of schools and cancellation of events of mass competition.
Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea implemented mass-detection and localized quarantine assessments, and issued alerts on the movements of infected people.
Singapore provided financial support to the infected people who decided to quarantine and imposed large fines on those who did not.
Taiwan increased mask production and sanctioned the accumulation of medical supplies. Simulations in Britain and the United States show that mitigation (which decreases the spread of the epidemic but does not stop it) and suppression (which reverses the growth of the pandemic) have major challenges.
Optimum mitigation policies could reduce the maximum demand for healthcare by two-thirds and deaths by half, but still generate hundreds of thousands of deaths and the collapse of health systems.
Suppression may be preferred, but it must be maintained for as long as the virus circulates in the human population (or until a vaccine is available, if that happens first), since otherwise the transmission is rapidly reactivated when measures are flexible.
Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic entails social and economic costs.
There are no specific antiviral drugs approved for COVID-19, but efforts are being made to develop them, including testing existing drugs.
Taking over-the-counter cold medications, drinking fluids, and resting can help relieve symptoms.
Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids and respiratory assistance may be needed.
The use of steroids can worsen the results.
Several compounds that were previously approved for the treatment of other viral diseases for use in the treatment of COVID-19 are being investigated.
The WHO also indicated that some "domestic and traditional remedies" can alleviate symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
WHO describes capacity-building and adapting health care to the needs of COVID-19 patients as a key measure of response to the outbreak.
The ECDC and the WHO Regional Office for Europe have formulated guidelines aimed at hospitals and primary health care services for the redistribution of resources at different levels, including focusing laboratory services on COVID-19 testing, cancelling intensive care care procedures by increasing staff capacity, separating and isolating staff from COVID-19 positive patients.
There are several theories about where the first case may have originated (the so-called zero patient).
The first known case of the new coronavirus can be traced back to December 1, 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
Over the course of a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei gradually increased.
These were mainly linked to Huanan's wholesale seafood market, which also sold live animals, and one theory is that the virus came from one of these animals; or, in other words, that it has a zoonotic origin. On December 26, a series of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause was observed in Qihan's Provihang, in Huxi's Hu.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues about a “coronavirus similar to SARS.”
Police warned eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, for spreading false rumors, and another doctor, Ai Fen, was reprimanded by her superiors for giving the alarm.
Subsequently, on December 31, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public note and informed the WHO.
At the beginning of January, enough cases of unknown cause pneumonia had been reported to health authorities in Wuhan to initiate an investigation, and during the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, contributing to the migration for the Chinese New Year and the fact that Wuhan is a transportation hub and a major rail crossing.
On January 20, China reported about 140 new cases in one day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Subsequent official data show that, as of January 20, 2020, 6174 people had already developed symptoms. As of March 26, the United States has surpassed China and Italy with the most confirmed cases in the world. As of April 9, 2020, more than 1.61 million cases have been reported worldwide; more than 97 000 people have died and more than 36 have died.
Around 200 countries and territories have had at least one case.
Due to the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen area have restricted free movement and established border controls.
National reactions have included containment measures, such as quarantine (known as home stay orders, shelter orders on site or confinement) and touchdowns. By April 2, about 300 million people, or about 90% of the population, are in confinement in the United States.
As of March 26, 1,7 billion people worldwide met some kind of confinement, which increased to 2,6 billion people two days later, around a third of the world’s population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 dates back to December 1, 2019 in Wuhan; an unconfirmed report indicates that the first case occurred on November 17.
On December 26, Dr. Zhang Jixian observed a group of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause, and her hospital informed the CDC of Jianghan of Wuhan on December 27.
The first genetic tests of patient samples on December 27, 2019 indicated the presence of a coronavirus similar to SARS.
On December 31, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public note.
It was reported to the WHO the same day.
While these notifications were being made, police warned doctors in Wuhan to “spread rumors” about the outbreak.
China’s National Health Commission initially claimed that there was no “clear evidence” of human-to-human transmission.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a drastic campaign, later described by Chinese Communist Party Secretary General Xi Jinping, as a “people’s war,” to contain the spread of the virus.
In what was described as “the largest quarantine in human history,” a health cord was announced on Jan. 23 that banned travel inside and outside Wuhan, this spread to a total of 15 cities in Hubei, and affected a total of about 57 million people.
The use of private vehicles in the city was prohibited.
Chinese New Year celebrations (January 25) were cancelled in many places.
Authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Huoshenshan Hospital, which was completed in 10 days.
Subsequently, another hospital, Leishenshan Hospital, was built to receive more patients.
In addition to the new hospitals built, China also turned 14 other facilities in Wuhan, such as convention centers and stadiums, into temporary hospitals. On January 26, the government implemented more measures to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, which included the issuance of health declarations for travellers and the extension of the Prima holiday.
Universities and schools across the country were also closed.
The Hong Kong and Macau regions implemented a number of measures, especially in relation to schools and universities.
Remote work measures were established in several regions of China.
Travel restrictions in and out of Hubei were implemented.
Public transport was modified and museums were temporarily closed throughout China.
Public movement control was implemented in several cities, and it has been estimated that about 760 million people (more than half of the population) faced some kind of restrictions on outdoors. After the start of the global phase of the outbreak in March, Chinese authorities took strict measures to prevent the "importation" of the virus from other countries.
For example, Beijing has imposed a mandatory 14-day quarantine for all international travelers entering the city. By March 23, only one case had been transmitted nationally in mainland China in the previous five days, this time through a traveller who returned from Istanbul to Canton.
On March 24, 2020, Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang reported that the spread of nationally transmitted cases was basically blocked and that the outbreak had been controlled in China.
On the same day, travel restrictions were relaxed in Hubei, as well as in Wuhan, two months after the confinement was imposed. On March 26, 2020, China’s Foreign Ministry announced that the entry of visa holders or residence permit policy would be suspended from March 28, with no specific details.
Those wishing to enter China must apply for visas at Chinese embassies or consulates.
The Chinese government pushed the companies and factories to reopen on March 30 and provided economic stimulus packages for the firms. The State Council declared a day of mourning that will begin with a moment of national silence of three minutes on April 4 at 10:00 a.m.
On January 20, 2020, it was confirmed that COVID-19 spread from China to South Korea.
On February 20, the country’s health agency reported a significant increase in confirmed cases, mainly attributed to a meeting in Daegu of a new religious movement known as the Church of Jesus Shincheonji.
Shincheonji devotees who visited Daegu from Wuhan are suspected to have originated the outbreak.
As of February 22, of the 9,336 followers of the church, 1261 or about 13% reported symptoms. On February 23, 2020, South Korea declared the highest level of alert.
On 28 February, more than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported in Korea, which increased to 3150 on 29 February.
All of South Korea's military bases were quarantined after tests confirmed three soldiers tested positive for the virus.
South Korea presented what was considered the world’s largest and best-organized program to conduct virus detection tests in the population and isolate infected people, as well as identify and quarantine those who were in contact with it.
The methods of detection included mandatory self-reporting of symptoms by new arrivals from other countries through a mobile app, drive-thru centers to perform virus detection tests with available results the next day, and increased diagnostic capacity to be able to perform tests in up to 20,000 people every day.
South Korea’s program is considered a success in controlling the outbreak despite not adopting the quarantine in entire cities. South Korean society was initially polarized with respect to President Moon Jae-in’s response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions to demand Moon’s dismissal for what they considered a mishandling of the outbreak by the government, or to praise his response.
On March 23, it was reported that South Korea had the total number of cases on a day lower than in four weeks.
On March 29, it was reported that, from April 1, all new arrivals from abroad will have to remain in quarantine for two weeks.
According to media reports, on April 1, South Korea received requests for assistance for virus testing from 121 different countries.
On February 19, Iran reported its first confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections in Qom, where, according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education, two people died later that day.

Iran has allocated five trillion rials to fight the virus.
On February 26, 2020, President Hassan Rouhani said there were no plans to quarantine the areas affected by the outbreak, and that it would only quarantine people.
In March, plans were announced to limit travel between cities, although heavy traffic between cities as a result of the New Persian Nowruz year continued.
Shia shrines in Qom remained open to pilgrims until March 16, 2020. During February, Iran became a centre for the spread of the virus after China.
Amid claims of a cover-up of the magnitude of the outbreak in Iran, more than ten countries had tracked their cases to Iran by February 28, indicating that the magnitude of the outbreak could be more serious than the 388 cases reported by the Iranian government by that date.
The Iranian parliament closed, and on March 3, 23 of its 290 members reported that they had obtained positive results in the virus test.
On 12 March, Human Rights Watch urged Iranian prison authorities to unconditionally release human rights defenders detained for peaceful dissent, and also to temporarily release all eligible prisoners.
He pointed out that there is an increased risk of the virus spreading in closed institutions, such as detention centres, which also lack adequate medical care.
On March 15, the Iranian government reported 100 deaths on the same day, the highest number recorded in the country since the outbreak began.
By March 17, at least 12 Iranian expo politicians or politicians had died from the disease.
On March 23, Iran experienced 50 new cases per hour and a new death every ten minutes due to the coronavirus.
According to a WHO official, there may be five times more cases in Iran than reported.
It is also suggested that U.S. sanctions on Iran may be affecting the country’s financial capacity to respond to the virus outbreak.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has called for the easing of economic sanctions for countries most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
On January 31, the spread of the outbreak to Italy was confirmed, when two Chinese tourists tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Rome.
Cases began to rise rapidly, leading the Italian government to suspend all flights to and from China and declare a state of emergency.
Subsequently, a group of unrelated COVID-19 cases were detected, which began with 16 confirmed cases in Lombardy on 21 February. On 22 February, the Council of Ministers announced a new decree law to contain the outbreak, which included quarantining more than 50,000 people from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said, “It will not be allowed to enter or leave the areas affected by the outbreak.
On 4 March, the Italian Government ordered the complete closure of schools and universities throughout the country, while Italy had reached 100 deaths.
All major sporting events, including Serie A football matches, were to be held closed until April, but on March 9, all sporting events were completely suspended for at least one month.
On March 11, Prime Minister Conte ordered the suspension of virtually all commercial activities except supermarkets and pharmacies.

As of 5 April, there were 128,948 confirmed cases, 15,887 deaths and 21,815 recoveries in Italy, most of which occurred in the Lombardy region.
A CNN report said that combining Italy’s large elderly population and the inability to test all people who have the virus to date could contribute to the high mortality rate.
The UK’s response to the virus first emerged as one of the most relaxed affected countries, and until 18 March 2020, the British government did not impose any kind of mass social distancing or quarantine measures on its citizens.
As a result, the government received criticism for the apparent lack of speed and intensity in its response to public concerns. On March 16, Prime Minister Boris Johnson made an announcement in which he disadvised social contact and all non-essential travel, and suggested that people like restaurants avoid you and barely work from their homes when out.
On 20 March, the Government announced the closure of all leisure establishments as soon as possible, such as bars and gymnasiums, and promised to pay up to 80% of the workers' salaries necessary up to a limit of GBP 2500 per month to prevent unemployment during the crisis.
Unlike previous measures, the police could demand compliance with these restrictions through the imposition of fines and the dispersal of meetings.
The closure of most companies was ordered, with the exception of those considered "essential", including supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, hardware stores, gas stations and workshops.

On January 28, 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the U.S. government’s leading public health institute, announced that they had developed their own test kit.
Despite doing so, the United States had a slow start in testing, which hid the true magnitude of the outbreak at the time.
Testing was tainted by the defective test kits produced by the federal government in February, the lack of federal approval of non-governmental test kits (from academies, companies and hospitals) until the end of February, and the restrictive criteria for people to qualify for a test up to the beginning of February.
On February 27, the Washington Post reported that less than 4,000 tests had been conducted in the United States.
On March 13, The Atlantic reported that less than 14,000 tests had been carried out.

On the other hand, China's aid was widely accepted in parts of Latin America and Africa, and on 2 April the World Bank launched emergency support operations for developing countries.
The WHO praised the efforts of the Chinese authorities to control and contain the epidemic.
The WHO noted the difference between the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak, when Chinese authorities were accused of secrecy that prevented prevention and containment efforts, and the current crisis, in which the central government “has provided periodic updates to avoid panic over the Lunar New Year holidays.”
On 23 January, in response to the decision of the central authorities to implement a ban on transportation in Wuhan, the WHO representative Gauden Galea noted that, while "definitely not a recommendation made by the WHO", it was "a very important indication of the commitment to contain the epidemic in the place where it is most concentrated".
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom said ESPII was “due to the risk of global spread, especially to low- and middle-income countries without solid health systems.”
In response to the implementation of the travel restrictions, Tedros stated that "there is no reason to take measures that unnecessarily interfere with international trade and travel" and that "the WHO does not recommend limiting trade or movement".
On February 5, the WHO appealed to the global community for a $675 million contribution to fund strategic preparation in low-income countries, citing the urgency of supporting those countries "who do not have systems to detect people who contract the virus, in case there are any."
Tedros also made statements in which he stated that "we are only as strong as our weakest link" and urged the international community to "invest today or pay more in the future." On February 11, the WHO announced at a press conference that COVID-19 was the name of the disease.
On the same day, Tedros claimed that the United Nations Secretary-General, Ant<0xC3><0xB3>nio Guterres, had agreed to contribute “the power of the entire United Nations system in the response.”
As a result, a United Nations crisis management team was activated, which enabled the coordination of the response of all the United Nations, which, according to WHO, will allow them to “focus on the health response while the other agencies can provide their expertise to address the broad social, economic and developmental consequences.”
On 14 February, a joint mission team from the United Nations (WHO) and China (WHO) was set up to provide international experts and the WHO on the ground in China to assist in the national management and evaluate the "severity and transmission of the disease" through the organization of workshops and meetings with the main institutions at the national level.
In response to a developing outbreak in Iran, WHO sent a joint mission team there to assess the situation. On February 28, WHO officials said that the assessment of the global coronavirus threat would rise from "high" to "very high", its highest level of alert and risk assessment.
Mike Ryan, executive director of WHO’s emergency health program, warned in a statement that “This is a reality check for all governments on the planet: they wake up.
This virus may be on the way and we must be prepared,” insisting that appropriate response measures could help the world avoid “the worst.”
Ryan also said current data did not guarantee that public health officials would declare a global pandemic, and noted that such a statement would mean that “we are basically accepting that all human beings on the planet will be exposed to that virus.”
On March 11, the WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak pandemic.
The Director-General said the WHO was "very concerned, both by the alarming levels of propagation and severity, and by the alarming levels of inaction." The WHO has received significant criticism for what is considered an inadequate management of the pandemic, including the late declaration of a public health emergency and an outbreak of the pandemic.
The negative reaction included the request for the resignation of WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom, signed by 733,000 people on April 6.
On March 26, 2020, dozens of UN human rights experts underscored respect for the rights of all people during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The expert group indicated that everyone had the right to life-saving interventions and that the Government had this responsibility.
The group stressed that the lack of resources or health insurance should never be used as a justification for discrimination against a specific group.
The experts stressed that all persons have the right to health, including persons with disabilities, those belonging to minority groups, older persons, internally displaced persons, homeless persons, those living in conditions of extreme poverty, detainees, as well as refugees and other unspecified groups in need of support.
International governmental organizations are addressing the social and economic impacts of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) launched a platform to provide comprehensive and timely information on policy responses in countries around the world, as well as views and advice.
From policies to strengthening health systems and the global economy to addressing the effects of confinement and travel restrictions, the digital centre includes a country-by-country policy tracker, and aims to help countries learn from each other and facilitate a coordinated global response to the coronavirus challenge.
The Chinese government has been criticized by the United States, the UK Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove, and the son of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, Eduardo Bolsonaro, for his handling of the pandemic, which began in the Chinese province of Hubei.
Several administrators at the provincial level of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) were fired because of their handling of quarantine efforts in central China, a sign of dissatisfaction with the political system's response to the outbreak in those regions.
Some commentators believe this measure was taken to protect Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping from public anger over the coronavirus outbreak.
Some Chinese officials, for example, Zhao Lijian, rejected an earlier recognition of the onset of the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan, in favor of conspiracy theories about the origin of COVID-19 in the US or Italy.
The U.S. administration of Donald Trump has referred to the coronavirus as the "Chinese virus" or the "Wuhan virus", and claimed that China's "censorship overfused a virus that has now become a global pandemic", which in turn was pointed out by some critics to contain "administration" as racism and "distraction from its [distraction].
The Daily Beast obtained a telegram from the U.S. government describing a stratagem of communications with apparent origin in the National Security Council, and cited the strategy as "All about China."
We have been told that we are trying to convey this message in any way possible, including press conferences and television appearances. "Media outlets such as Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg have stated that China's efforts to send aid to countries affected by the virus are part of a propaganda effort to gain global influence.
European Union foreign policy representative Josep Borrell warned that “there is a geopolitical component that includes a struggle for influence through propaganda and a policy of generosity.”
Borrell also said that "China is aggressively pushing the message that, unlike the United States, it is a responsible and reliable partner."
China also called for the United States to lift its sanctions against Syria, Venezuela and Iran, while it reportedly sent aid to the latter two countries.
On April 3, U.S. sanctions blocked Jack Ma’s donation of 100,000 masks to Cuba.
U.S. authorities were also accused of diverting aid to other countries to their own country.
Disputes related to masks have been reported among other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland; and between the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey seized hundreds of respirators destined for Spain.
In early March, the Italian government criticized the European Union’s lack of solidarity with Italy, affected by the coronavirus.
Maurizio Massari, Italy’s ambassador to the European Union, said: “Only China responded bilaterally.
This is certainly not a good sign of European solidarity.”
On March 22, after a phone call with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the Russian army to send military doctors, special disinfection vehicles and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa quoted an anonymous "high-level political source" as saying that 80% of Russia's aid was "useless or of little use to Italy."
The source accused Russia of undertaking a "geopolitical and diplomatic" seduction offensive.
The President of Lombardy, Attilio Fontana, and the Italian Foreign Minister, Luigi Di Maio, rejected the journalistic reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia also sent a cargo plane with medical assistance to the United States.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that “by offering help to American colleagues, [Putin] assumes that, when American manufacturers of medical materials and equipment pick up momentum, they will also be able to match if necessary.”
NATO's planned military exercise "Defender 2020" in Germany, Poland and the Baltic States, NATO's largest military exercise since the end of the Cold War, will be conducted on a reduced scale.
The Secretary General of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, Kate Hudson, criticized the exercise Defender 2020: "In the current crisis of public health, it endangers the lives not only of the troops of the United States and the various European countries that participate in politics, but also those of the citizens of the countries in which they operate.
On March 14, 2020, the president of Iran, Hassan Rouhani, wrote a public letter to world leaders to ask for help, and said his country is having trouble fighting the outbreak due to lack of access to international markets as a result of the United States sanctions against Iran.
Political analysts anticipated that it could negatively affect Donald Trump’s chances of re-election in the 2020 presidential election. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea worsened due to the pandemic.
South Korea has criticized Japan’s “ambiguous and passive quarantine efforts” after Japan announced that anyone from South Korea will be quarantined for two weeks at government-designated sites.
South Korean society was initially polarized with respect to Moon Jae-in’s response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions to demand Moon's removal for what they considered a mishandling of the outbreak by the government, or to praise their response. The pandemic has allowed countries to pass emergency legislation in response.
Some commentators have expressed concern that it could allow governments to strengthen their control of power.
In Hungary, his parliament voted to allow Prime Minister Viktor Orb<0xC3><0xA1>n to rule by decree indefinitely, suspend parliament and elections and sanction those who are deemed to have disseminated false information about the virus and the government’s handling of the crisis.
Coronavirus outbreak was blamed on several cases of shortages of supplies, as a result of the increased worldwide use of equipment to combat outbreaks, panic-driven purchases and disruptions in logistics and factory operations.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued warnings about shortages of medicines and medical equipment due to increased consumer demand and disruption of suppliers.
Several localities also witnessed panic-driven purchases that left the shelves empty of essentials, such as food, toilet paper and bottled water, causing shortages of supplies.
The technology sector, in particular, has been warning of delays in shipments of electronic products.
According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom, the demand for personal protective equipment increased 100-fold.
This demand generated a price increase of up to twenty times the normal price and also caused delays of four to six months in the supply of medical items.
It also caused a shortage of personal protective equipment around the world, and WHO warned that this would endanger health workers.
In Australia, the pandemic provided a new opportunity for Daigou buyers to sell Australian products in China.
The activity has created a shortage of formula for babies in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian Government. Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in northern Italy and the Wuhan region, and the subsequent demand for food products, none of these areas were affected by this.
China and Italy’s measures against the accumulation and illicit trade in essential products have been successful, avoiding an acute food shortage that was anticipated in Europe and North America.
Northern Italy, with its significant agricultural output, has not had a significant reduction, but prices could increase, according to representatives of the sector.
Food shelves were only temporarily vacant, even in Wuhan city, while Chinese government officials released pork reserves to ensure sufficient food for the population.
In Italy there are similar laws that require food producers to maintain reserves for these emergencies.
Damage to the global economy was felt in China: According to a March 16 report, China’s economy was heavily affected in the first two months of 2020 due to measures taken by the government to stop the spread of the virus, and retail sales fell by 20.5%.
Since mainland China is an important economic and manufacturing center, the virus outbreak has been considered a significant destabilization threat to the world economy.
Agathe Demarais of The Economist Intelligence Unit has predicted that markets will remain volatile until a clearer picture of the potential consequences emerges.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic consequences of the epidemic on global growth could outweigh those of the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak.
An estimate by an expert at the University of Washington in San Luis indicated an impact of more than $300 billion on the world’s supply chains that could last up to two years.
According to reports, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) was "revolutionized" after a sharp drop in oil prices due to China's lower demand.
On February 24, global stock markets fell due to a significant increase in the number of COVID-19 cases outside mainland China.
On February 27, due to growing concerns about the coronavirus outbreak, several U.S. stock indices, including the NASDAQ-100, the S&P 500, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, posted their strongest falls since 2008, the Dow fell by 1191 points since the financial day – the biggest drop in 2007.
The three indices ended the week with more than 10% declines.
On 28 February, Scope Ratings GmbH affirmed China’s sovereign credit rating, but maintained a negative outlook.
The actions fell again on the basis of fears of the coronavirus, the biggest fall occurred on March 16.
Many consider that there is likely to be an economic recession.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian praised the state and central banks’ timely emergency measures.
Central banks are reacting faster than they reacted to the 2008 financial collapse.
Tourism is one of the most affected sectors due to travel bans, the closure of public places that include travel attractions and the recommendation of governments not to travel anywhere in the world.
As a result, numerous airlines have cancelled flights due to lower demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, while British regional airline Flybe collapsed.
The impact on the cruise industry has reached an unprecedented level.
Several railway stations and ferry terminals have also been closed.
The epidemic coincided with the Chunyun, an important travel season related to the Chinese New Year holidays.
Several events involving large crowds were cancelled by national and regional governments, including New Year’s festivals, while private companies also independently closed their stores and tourist attractions, such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many Lunar New Year events and tourist attractions have been closed to avoid mass concentrations, including the Forbidden City of Beijing and traditional temple fairs.
In 24 of China’s 31 provinces, municipalities and regions, authorities extended the New Year’s holiday until February 10, and ordered most workplaces not to reopen until that date.
These regions account for 80% of GDP and 90% of the country's exports.
Hong Kong raised its level of response to infectious disease to the highest and declared an emergency, closed schools until March and canceled its New Year celebrations. The retail sector was affected globally, with cuts in care hours or temporary closures.
Retail visits in Europe and Latin America decreased by 40%.
Retailers in North America and the Middle East experienced a drop of 50 to 60 percent.
This also caused a 33 to 43 percent drop in pedestrian traffic to shopping malls in March compared to February.
The operators of shopping malls around the world imposed additional measures, such as increased hygiene, installation of thermal scanners to control the temperature of buyers and cancellation of events. According to an estimate of the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the situation of the recession induced by the pandemic could leave an extreme situation in the situation of 14 to 22 million people.
In January and February 2020, during the peak of the epidemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Many of China’s nearly 300 million migrant rural workers were stranded in their homes in inland provinces or trapped in Hubei province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and asked for government help.
The coronavirus outbreak in 2020 could cost 47 million jobs in the United States and the unemployment rate can reach 32%, according to estimates of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Luis. The confinement in India has left tens of millions of Indian migrant workers who confiscated their jobs in the United States (who receive daily wages).
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for a universal credit plan. Almost half a million companies in Germany have implemented government-subsidized short-term work schemes, known as Kurzarbeit, for their workers.
The German short-term compensation scheme has been adopted by France and Britain.
The performing arts and cultural heritage sectors were deeply affected by the pandemic, which had an impact on the operations of organizations and on people, both employed and self-employed, around the world.
Culture and arts organizations sought to fulfill their mission (often funded with public funds) to provide the community with access to cultural heritage, maintain the safety of their employees and the public, and support artists whenever possible.
By March 2020, worldwide and to varying degrees, museums, libraries, venues and other cultural institutions had closed indefinitely, and their exhibitions, events and shows were cancelled or postponed.
In response, great efforts were made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent and increasing consequence of the disease is the cancellation of religious services. major sporting events and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences and fashion shows.
The film industry also suffered disruptions, and the Vatican announced the cancellation of the Holy Week celebrations in Rome, which take place during the last week of the Christian Lent penance season.
Many dioceses have recommended that older Christians stay in their homes instead of attending Mass on Sundays; some churches offered religious services via radio, live broadcasting over the Internet or television, while others offer spaces to pray from the car.
Following the decision of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rome to close its churches and chapels and with St. Peter's Square empty of Christian pilgrims, other religious bodies also cancelled their services and limited public concentrations in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gurdwaras.
Iran’s health ministry announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in areas affected by the outbreak and then the shrines were closed, while Saudi Arabia banned the entry of foreign pilgrims and their residents to the holy sites in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has caused the most significant change in the world sports calendar since World War II.
Most major sporting events were cancelled or postponed, including the 2019–20 UEFA Champions League, the 2019–20 Premier League, UEFA Euro 2020, the 2019–20 NBA season and the 2019–20 NHL season.
The outbreak interrupted plans for the 2020 Olympic Games, which were originally scheduled to start in late July; the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that the event will be "rescheduled for a date after 2020 but not after the summer of 2021."The casinos and other gambling venues around the world were either closed or closed.
This caused many gamblers to turn to the Internet, many online betting sites reported significant increases in their new enrollment rates. The entertainment industry was also affected, several music groups suspended or canceled concert tours.
Many large theaters, such as Broadway, also suspended all shows.
Some artists have explored ways to continue producing and sharing their work over the Internet as an alternative to traditional live show, such as live streams of concerts or creating "festivals" on the Internet for artists to interpret, distribute or publish their work.
Online, numerous Internet memes about the coronavirus spread, as many resort to humor and distraction amidst uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, there has been an increase in prejudice, xenophobia and racism towards people of Chinese and East Asian descent, and towards people in areas of Europe, the United States and other countries where the situation is critical.
Incidents of fear, suspicion and hostility have been observed in many countries, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
February reports (when most cases were still limited to China) have documented racist sentiments in various groups around the world that the Chinese deserved the virus or were receiving what they considered a fair reprisal.
Some countries in Africa have also seen an increase in anti-Chinese sentiments.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei have reported discrimination based on their regional origin.
Chinese and those in the areas affected by the virus have received support, both online and offline.
After the outbreak moved to new countries where the situation is critical, the people of Italy, the first country in Europe to experience a serious outbreak of COVID-19, could also be the subject of suspicion and xenophobia. Citizens of countries such as Malaysia, New Zealand, South Korea and Singapore initially signed petitions in order to achieve the prohibition.
In Japan, the hashtag <0x23>ChineseDontComeToJapan was trending on Twitter.
The Chinese, along with other Asian people in the UK and the United States, have reported higher levels of racist insults, as well as aggression.
U.S. President Donald Trump was criticized for referring to the coronavirus as the “Chinese virus,” a term that many critics considered racist and anti-Chinese.
Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses carrying Ukrainian and foreign evacuants from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhary.
According to reports, students from northeastern India, which shares a border with China, and who study in major Indian cities, suffered harassment in connection with the coronavirus outbreak.
The president of the state unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party in West Bengal, Dilip Ghosh, said that the Chinese had destroyed nature and "that's why God took revenge on them."
The Chinese consulate in Calcutta then condemned the comments and said they were “wrong.” In China, xenophobia and racism toward non-Chinese residents increased as a result of the pandemic, and foreigners were described as “foreign garbage” and destined for “waste.”
Many paid-walled newspapers removed them for part or all of their coverage of the coronavirus.
Many scientific publishers have published scientific articles related to the outbreak available with open access.
Some scientists chose to quickly share their results on preprint servers like bioRxiv.

Laboratory tests for coronavirus respiratory disease 2019 (COVID-19) and associated SARS-CoV-2 virus include methods that detect the presence of the virus and those that detect antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of viruses in the samples is confirmed through the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction test, which detects the RNA of the coronavirus.
This test is specific and is designed to detect only the RNA of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
It is used to confirm very recent or active infections.
Antibody detection (serology) can be used both for diagnosis and for population surveillance.
Antibody tests show how many people have had the disease, including those who had symptoms too mild to report or who were asymptomatic.
Based on the results of this test, a precise mortality rate of the disease and the level of collective immunity in the population can be determined.
Due to limited testing, as of March 2020, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population.
As of 23 March, no country had tested more than 3 per cent of its population, and there were large variations in the number of tests carried out in the various countries.
This variability is also likely to significantly affect reported lethal rates, which are likely to be highly overestimated in some countries.
Through the chain reaction of the polymerase with real time reverse transcriptase (rRT-PCR), the test can be done in respiratory samples obtained through various methods, including nasopharyngeal hysopaths or sputum samples.
Results are usually available within a few hours to 2 days.
The reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction test performed with pharyngeal hysopates is only reliable in the first week of the disease.
Subsequently, the virus may disappear in the throat, but it continues to multiply in the lungs.
In infected people who are tested in the second week, as an alternative, the sample material can be obtained from the deep parts of the respiratory tract by suction catheter, or the material that is expelled by coughing (sputum) can be used.
One of the first polymerase chain reaction tests was developed at Charité, Berlin, in January 2020, using the real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), and formed the basis of the 250,000 kits distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
On January 28, 2020, South Korea’s Kogenebiotech company developed a SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on the clinical-grade polymerase chain reaction (PowerChek Coronavirus).
In China, BGI Group was one of the first companies to obtain the emergency use approval of the National Medical Products Administration of China (National Medical Products Administration of China) in the Coronado (Central) for SARS-CoV-2 detection kit (Central) in the Coronado (Central) in the Coronado (Central) in the Coronado (Central) in the Coronado.
One in three genetic tests in earlier versions of the test kits generated incomplete results due to defective reagents, and a jam in testing at the CDC in Atlanta; as a result, on average, less than 100 samples per day were successfully processed throughout February 2020.
The reliability of tests using two components was not determined until February 28, 2020, and only then was it allowed for state and local laboratories to begin testing.
The Food and Drug Administration approved the test under an emergency use authorization. U.S. commercial laboratories began testing in early March 2020.
On March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the nationwide availability of COVID-19 testing based on the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction.
Similarly, on March 9, 2020, Quest Diagnostics made COVID-19 tests available nationwide.
No quantity limits were announced; the collection of specimens and processing must be carried out in accordance with CDC requirements.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the State Center for Research in Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR.
On February 11, 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Service for Surveillance of Medical Care. On March 12, 2020, it was reported that Mayo Clinic had developed a test to detect COVID-19 infection. On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received a 24-hour periodic FDA approval for a large-scale test that could be performed on a large-scale test.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA issued emergency use authorization for Abbott Laboratories for a test in Abbott’s m2000 system; the FDA had previously issued similar authorizations for Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also received FDA emergency use authorization for a test that lasts approximately 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved a test that uses nucleic acid isothermal amplification technology instead of polymerase chain reaction.
Since this does not require a series of alternating temperature cycles, this method can provide positive results in just five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
Currently, there are about 18,000 of these machines in the United States and Abbott plans to increase production to perform 50,000 tests per day. In Taiwan, a test is being developed using a monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to the nucleocapside protein (N protein) of the new coronavirus influenza-like test 15 minutes, with the hope that it can provide results in 20 minutes.
As of March 2020, the review of the publications concluded that “ chest x-rays have little diagnostic value in the early stages, while the results of CT [computed tomography] can be obtained even before the onset of symptoms.”
Typical features in CT include bilateral multilobal opacities in illustrated glass with a peripheral, asymmetric and posterior distribution.
As the disease progresses, subpleural domain, pattern in stone and consolidation develops.
According to a study conducted in Wuhan, at the origin point of the current pandemic, where the polymerase chain reaction was compared with computed tomography, computed tomography is much more sensitive than the polymerase chain reaction, though less specific, and many of the features in the images coincide with the processes of other diseases.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends "not to use computed tomography as a detection method or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19." Since March 2020, CDCs recommend polymerase chain reaction as an initial test.
Part of the immune system’s reaction to infection is the production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
These can be used to detect infection in people approximately 7 days after the onset of symptoms, to determine immunity and in population surveillance. Tests can be performed in central laboratories or by testing at the point of attention.
Automated high-performance systems in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform these analyses, but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
For central laboratory assays, a single peripheral blood sample is usually used, although serial specimens can be used to monitor the immune response.
For tests at the point of focus, a single blood sample is usually obtained by puncturing the skin.
Unlike polymerase chain reaction methods, no extraction step is required before analysis. On March 26, 2020, the FDA appointed 29 entities that provided notification to the agency as appropriate and therefore can now distribute their antibody tests.
As of April 7, 2020, only one test has been approved by the FDA under an emergency use authorization. At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European approval for their test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies against the virus in blood samples.
The ability to perform tests is several hundred samples within hours and is therefore much faster than the conventional viral RNA polymerase chain reaction test.
Antibodies can usually be detected 14 days after the onset of infection.In early April, the UK discovered that none of the antibody test kits it bought were good enough to use them.
In Hong Kong has created a program in which the patient's prefectures can stay in their homes, "emergency department gives the patient a tube for specimen", the patient squirts into the tube, sends it and obtains a result in a short time. The British NHS has announced that it is implementing a pilot program in its hospital to analyze the cases.
The drive-through centers have helped South Korea to do some of the fastest and most extensive tests in any country. In Germany, the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians said on March 2 that it had a capacity for approximately 12,000 tests per day in the previous week in the outpatient setting and that 7 people had been tested.
Health insurance assumes the costs when the test is ordered by a doctor.
According to the president of the Institute Robert Koch, Germany has an overall capacity to do 160,000 tests per week.
On March 19, tests were offered using the drive-through system in several large cities.
As of March 26, 2020, the total number of tests carried out in Germany was unknown, because only the positive results were reported.
A first sample sample of laboratory samples showed that, at the natural week of the 12/2020, more than 10 samples were analyzed at least 483,295 samples, up to and including the week of the 12/2020, and 33,491 samples (6.9%) showed positive results for SARS-CoV-2.
With the construction, which was overseen by BGI founder Wang Jian, and which took 5 days, the model showed that the cases in Hubei had been 47% higher and that the corresponding cost to face the quarantine would have doubled without this capacity for testing.
After the Wuhan laboratory, Huo-Yan laboratories were immediately built in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities in China.
As of March 4, 2020, the total daily production was 50,000 tests per day. Multiplexed open source designs provided by origami analysis were implemented that allow evaluating up to 1122 samples of patients for COVID19 using only 93 analyses. These balanced designs can be used in small laboratories without the need for handling robots.
By March, shortages and insufficient amounts of reagents affected mass testing in the European Union and the US.
This led some authors to explore sample preparation protocols that involve heating the samples to 98 <0xC2><0xB0>C (208 <0xC2><0xB0>F) for 5 minutes to release RNA genomes for further testing. On March 31, it was announced that the United Arab Emirates population was now doing more population-sized testing to increase coronavirus screening levels per person, and was increasing coronavirus screening levels per country in its population than any other.
This was achieved by combining drive-through capacity and the purchase of a mass-production laboratory at the population level of Group 42 and BGI (which was based on its "Huo-Yan" emergency detection laboratories in China).
Built in 14 days, the lab has the capacity to perform tens of thousands of reverse transcriptase chain reaction tests per day and is the first in the world of this magnitude to operate outside of China.
Different test formulas were developed that address different parts of the genetic profile of the coronavirus in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization adopted the German formula for manufacturing kits that it sent to low-income countries that lacked the resources to develop their own kits.
The German formula was published on January 17, 2020; the protocol developed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was not available until January 28, which delayed the tests available in the United States. China and the U.S. had problems with health satisfactory tests and resumed the reliability of test kits at the beginning of the outbreak.
On the contrary, experts say that the high availability of South Korea’s tests helped reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
The Government of South Korea achieved its capacity for testing, mainly in private-sector laboratories, over the course of several years.
On March 16, the World Health Organization called for the increase of testing programs as the best way to reduce the progress of the COVID-19 pandemic. The high demand for tests due to the widespread spread of the virus caused delays in hundreds of thousands of test responses in the private laboratories of the U.S. and its children.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of its test kits.
In the United States, CDC-developed test kits had "defects"; the government then removed the bureaucratic barriers that had prevented private testing. Spain bought test kits from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but obtained inaccurate results.
The company explained that the incorrect results may be due to incorrect sampling or incorrect use of the kits.
The Ministry of Spain said it would remove the kits that threw incorrect results and replace them with a different test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the test kits that the Czech Republic bought from China gave incorrect results. Slovakia bought 1.2 million kits to China that turned out to be inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matovi<0xC4><0x8D> suggested that they be dumped on the Danube. Ate<0xC5><0x9F> Kara, of the Turkish Ministry of Health, said that the test kits that Turkey bought from China had a "high error rate" and did not "put them into use". The UK bought a 3.5 million test kits to China, but, as of early 2020, it did not.
The conduct of tests, complemented by the quarantine of those who obtained positive results and the identification of the people with whom they had had contact who gave positive in SARS-CoV-2, resulted in satisfactory results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of V<0xC3><0xB2>, the place where the first COVID-19 death occurred in Italy, conducted two rounds of tests across the population of around 3400 inhabitants, with about ten days of difference.
Approximately half of the people who got positive results had no symptoms, and all the cases were quarantined.
With travel restrictions in the municipality, this completely eliminated the new infections.
With intensive contact tracking, travel restrictions from abroad, testing and quarantine, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore progressed much slower than in other developed countries, but that did not apply extreme restrictions, such as the forced closure of restaurants and retail establishments.
Many events were canceled, and on March 28, Singapore began recommending residents to stay in their homes, but schools reopened in time after the March 23 holiday.
Other countries have also controlled the pandemic with intensive contact tracking, travel restrictions from abroad, testing and quarantine, but with less stringent confinement, such as Iceland and South Korea.
According to a statistical study, countries that have performed more tests, in relation to the number of deaths, have much lower mortality rates for cases, probably because these countries have more ability to detect people who only have mild symptoms or who do not have symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries that do not have capacity for testing and that have national laboratories with limited experience in COVID-19 send their first five positive samples and their first ten negative samples for COVID-19 to one of the WHO’s 16 reference laboratories for confirmatory testing.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following table, the "Positive as % of tests" column is influenced by the country's testing policy.
A country that only tests on people entering hospitals will have a higher number of positive tests as a percentage of tests than a country that tests on all citizens, whether they show symptoms or not, the other issues are the same.
Handwashing, also known as hand hygiene, is the act of washing hands in order to remove dirt, grease, microorganisms or other unwanted substances.
Washing hands with soap constantly at certain "critical moments" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, for example diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted through the fecal-oral pathway.
People can also become infected with respiratory diseases, such as flu or common cold, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose or mouth (i.e., mucous membranes).
The five critical moments during the day when it is important to wash your hands with soap include: before and after defecation, after cleaning a child’s tail or changing diapers, before feeding a child, before eating and before and after preparing a meal or handling raw meat, fish or poultry meat.
If you do not have soap or water, your hands can be cleaned with ash. The World Health Organization recommends washing your hands:
Before, during and after preparing meals.
Before and after taking care of a sick person.
After changing diapers or cleaning a child who used the bathroom.
After snoring, cough or sneeze.
After touching animals, animal feed or animal waste.
Medical hand hygiene refers to hygienic practices related to medical procedures.
Hand washing before administering medication or medical care can prevent or minimize the spread of diseases.
The main medical purpose of handwashing is to remove pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause damage or disease from the hands.
This is especially important for people who handle food or work in the medical field, but it is also an important practice for the general public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including minimizing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
and reduce the infant mortality rate at births at home.
A 2013 study showed that improvements in hand washing practices can generate small improvements in height growth in children under five years of age.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates related to respiratory and diarrhea diseases can be reduced by introducing simple behavioral changes, such as washing hands with soap.
This simple action can reduce the mortality rate from these diseases by almost 50%.
Interventions that encourage hand washing can reduce diarrhea episodes by about a third, and this is similar to providing drinking water in low-income areas.
48% of the reductions in diarrhea episodes can be related to hand washing with soap. Hand washing with soap is the most effective and economical way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections, such as automatic behavior adopted in homes, schools and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, an important acute respiratory disease, is the leading cause of mortality in children under five years of age, and an estimated 1.8 million children are charged annually.
Diarrhea and pneumonia together account for nearly 3.5 million child deaths per year.
According to UNICEF, turning handwashing with soap before eating and after using the bath into a rooted habit can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, which would reduce deaths from diarrhea to nearly half and deaths from acute respiratory infections to a quarter.
Hand washing is usually integrated with other hygiene interventions as part of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) programs.
Hand washing also protects against impetigo, which is transmitted through direct physical contact.
A small detrimental effect of hand washing is that its frequent realization can cause skin damage due to dryness of the skin.
According to a Danish study conducted in 2012, excessive hand washing can cause a skin condition that causes itching and makes the skin become scaly known as hand eczema or hand dermatitis, which is especially common in health workers.
Hand washing too often is also considered one of the symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five critical moments during the day when washing hands with soap is important to reduce the oral-fecal transmission of diseases: after using the bath (urine, defecate), after cleaning a child's tail (change diapers), before feeding a child's handkerchief, before eating, and before/after caring.
Other occasions where a proper hand washing technique should be practiced to prevent disease transmission include before and after treating a cut or wound; after sneezing, coughing or sneezing the nose; after touching animal waste or handling animals; and after touching garbage.
In many countries, there is a low rate of hand washing with soap.
A study on lava washing in hand washing in hand washing in hand washing in 54 countries in 2015 in hand washing in hand washing in hand washing in hand washing in hand washing in hand washing in hand in hand. A study carried out in 2014 indicated that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate at 97%; the United States at hand washing in hand in hand in hand in hand in hand in hand in hand in hand in hand in hand in hand in hand in hand in hand in hand in hand in hand in hand in hand in hand in hand in hand in hand in hand in hand in hand in hand in hand in hand in hand in hand in hand in hand in.
The “Essential Health Care Program” implemented by the Department of Education of the Philippines is an example of a tailor-made action to promote children’s health and education.
Deparasizing twice a year, in addition to washing your hands with soap every day, brushing your teeth daily with fluoride, are the basis of this national program.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The removal of microorganisms from the skin improves by adding soaps or detergents to the water.
The main action of soaps and detergents is to reduce the barriers to the solution and increase solubility.
Water alone is ineffective in cleansing the skin because fats and proteins, which are components of organic matter, do not dissolve easily in water.
However, a reasonable flow of water facilitates cleaning.
Solid soap, due to its reusable nature, may contain bacteria acquired in the above uses.
Some studies that analyzed the transfer of bacteria from contaminated solid soap concluded that the transfer is unlikely, since the bacteria are rinsed with foam.
Even so, the CDC states that “liquid soap with dispensing controls that do not involve using hands is preferable.”
Antibacterial soaps have been promoted intensively for a health-conscious public.
Currently, there is no evidence that the use of the recommended disinfectants or antiseptics preserve antibiotic-resistant organisms by nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents, such as triclosan, which has an extensive list of strains of resistant organisms.
In this way, even if antibacterial soaps do not preserve antibiotic-resistant strains, they may not be as effective as they are promoted.
In addition to the surfactant and protection of the skin, the sophisticated formulas can contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as well as pH regulator, benzoic acid with antimicrobial activity and more conditioners for the skin (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, extracts).
Warm water to wash your hands is not enough to remove bacteria.
Bacteria grow much faster at body temperature (37<0xC2><0xB0>C).
However, warm soapy water is more effective than cold soapy water to remove natural oils that retain soil and bacteria.
However, contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that using warm water has no effect on reducing the microbial load on the hands.
A hand sanitizer or antiseptic for hands is a waterless agent for hand hygiene.
In the late 1990s and in the first part of the 21st century, hand sanitizers without water and with alcohol for rubbing (also known as alcohol-based rubbing solution, hand antiseptic solution for rubbing or hand sanitizers) began to gain popularity.
Most are based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol formulated with a thickening agent such as carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) in a gel, or a humectant such as glycerin in a liquid, or foam for easy use and to reduce the drying effect of the alcohol.
Adding diluted hydrogen peroxide further increases antimicrobial activity. Hand sanitizers containing at least 60-95% alcohol effectively remove germs.
Alcohol-based disinfectants for rubbing remove bacteria, drug-resistant bacteria (SARM and ERV), tuberculosis and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, SVR, rhinovirus, vaccinia, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi.
Alcohol-based scrubbing disinfectants containing 70% alcohol remove 99.97% (reduction of 3.5 logarithms, similar to 35 decibels reduction) from the bacteria in the hands 30 seconds after application and from 99.99% to 99.999% against hand-free viruses (reduction of 4 to 5 logarithms) and more from the bagariters.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are virtually ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk) viruses, the most common cause of contagious gastroenteritis. Sufficient antiseptic or alcohol-based hand solution should be used to rub, such as to moisten or completely cover both hands.
The palm and back of both hands, between the fingers and the ends of all fingers are rubbed for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam, or gel is dried.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends washing hands before hand disinfectants to rub, especially when the hands are visibly dirty.
The increased use of these agents is based on their ease of use and rapid activity of removal of microorganisms; however, they should not be used as a replacement for proper hand washing unless there is no water or soap available.
Frequent use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers can dry the skin, unless emollients or skin moisturizers are added to the formula.
The drying effect of the alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing emollients caused significantly less skin irritation and dryness than soaps or antimicrobial detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome, or alcohol hypersensitivity or additives present in alcohol-based hand solutions for rubbing are very rare.
The lower tendency to cause irritating contact dermatitis was attractive compared to hand washing with soap and water.
Despite its effectiveness, water-free agents do not remove organic matter from the hands, but simply disinfect them.
For this reason, hand sanitizers are not as effective as water and soap to prevent the spread of many pathogens, as the pathogens remain in the hands.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand sanitizers depends largely on the ingredients and the formula, in addition, historically, has been much lower than that of alcohol and alcohol-based solutions for rubbing.
More recently, formulas using benzalkonium chloride have been found to have persistent and cumulative antimicrobial activity after application, unlike alcohol, whose effectiveness decreases after repeated use, probably due to progressive skin adverse reactions.
Many people in low-income communities cannot buy soap and instead use ash or earth.
Ashes or soil may be more effective than water alone, but less effective than soap.
One concern is that if the soil or ash is contaminated with microorganisms, this can increase the spread of diseases rather than decrease it.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant, since, in contact with water, it forms an alkaline solution.
The WHO recommended using ash or sand as an alternative to soap when no soap is available.
The correct hand washing technique recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to prevent disease transmission includes the following steps:
Wet your hands with warm or cold running water.
Running water is recommended because containers with stagnant water may be contaminated, while the water temperature does not seem to make any difference.
Rub your hands to form foam with a generous amount of soap, including the backs of your hands, between your fingers and under your nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies indicate that people usually wash their hands more thoroughly when using soap than when using water alone.
Stir for at least 20 seconds.
Scrub creates friction, which helps to remove germs from the skin, and scrub for longer periods of time eliminates more germs.
Rinse well with running water.
Rinse in a container can again contaminate your hands.
Dry with a clean towel or leave to dry in the air.
Wet and wet hands are more easily contaminated. The parts that are most often forgotten are the thumb, wrist, areas between the fingers and under the nails.
Artificial nails and peeled nail enamel can house microorganisms.
Moisturizing lotion is often recommended to prevent hands from drying; dry skin can cause skin damage that can increase the risk of transmission of infections.
Several economical options can be used to facilitate hand washing when there is no running water or soap, for example, pouring water from a hanging jar or pumpkin with appropriate holes or using ash if necessary in developing countries. In situations where there is a limited supply of water in other economic countries, such as in schools or in rural areas.
A home tap is a simple technology consisting of using a suspended jar of a sock and a foot-operated lever to pour a small amount of water on your hands and a bar soap.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but there is some debate about the most effective form of drying in public bathrooms.
More and more research shows that paper towels are much more hygienic than the electric hand dryers found in many bathrooms.
In 2008, the University of Westminster, London, conducted a study, sponsored by the European Tissue Symposium, to compare the hygiene levels offered by paper towels, hot air hand dryers and more modern air jet hand dryers.
After washing and drying hands with the hot air dryer, it was detected that the total amount of bacteria increased, on average, by 194% in the fingertips and by 254% in the palms.
Drying with the air-jet dryer resulted in an average increase in the total amount of bacteria of 42% in the fingertips and 15% in the palms.
After washing and drying their hands with a paper towel, the total amount of bacteria decreased, on average, 76% in the fingertips and 77% in the palms. Scientists also conducted tests to determine if there was a possibility of cross-contamination by other users of the bath and bath environment type method.
The air jet dryer, which blows air from the unit at speeds of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), managed to blow the microorganisms of the hands and the unit and potentially contaminate other users of the bathroom and the bathroom environment at a distance of up to 2 meters.
The use of a hot air hand dryer propagated the microorganisms up to 0.25 meters away from the dryer.
In 2005, in a study conducted by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt, different methods of hand drying were evaluated.
The following changes in the number of bacteria were observed after hand drying:
There are many different manufacturers of hand dryers, and hand dryers have been compared to paper towel drying.
Washing your hands with hand sanitizer wipes is an alternative during travel, when there is no water or soap.
The alcohol-based hand sanitizer must contain at least 60% alcohol.
Handwashing of doctors became mandatory long after the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) for the prevention of diseases in a hospital setting.
There are electronic devices that provide feedback to remind hospital staff members to wash their hands when they forget.
One study found a decrease in infection rates with its use.
Doctors wash hands for at least 15 seconds, with plenty of water and soap or gel to form foam and rub all parts of the hands.
The hands should be tightened together by intertwining the fingers.
If there are remains under the nails, you can use a brush brush to remove them.
Since germs can remain in the water in your hands, it is important to rinse them well and dry them with a clean towel.
After drying, the paper towel should be used to close the water (and open any exit door if necessary).
This prevents the hands from getting contaminated again by those surfaces.
The purpose of hand washing in the health care environment is to eliminate pathogenic microorganisms (" germs") and avoid transmitting them.
According to the New England Journal of Medicine, the lack of hand washing continues to exist at unacceptable levels in most medical settings, where many doctors and nurses usually forget to wash their hands before touching patients and, in this way, transmit microorganisms.
One study showed that proper hand washing and other simple procedures can reduce the rate of catheter-related bloodstream infections by 66%. The World Health Organization has published a paper showing standard hand washing and hand rubbing in the healthcare sectors.
The preliminary version of the organization’s hand hygiene guide can also be found on its website for the public to comment.
Whitby and others carried out a relevant review.
Commercial devices can measure and verify hand hygiene, if proof of regulatory compliance is required.
The World Health Organization has “Five Moments” for Hand Washing:
after exposure to blood or body fluids
prior to aseptic work and
The addition of antiseptic chemicals in the soap (“medical” or “antibacterial” soaps) gives it the possibility of elimination of the hand washing agent.
This removal may be necessary before surgery or in environments where antibiotic-resistant organisms are very common. To wash hands before surgery, it is necessary to have a faucet that can be opened and closed without touching it with your hands, a bit of chlorhexidine or iodine for frying towel.
All jewels must be removed.
This procedure requires washing hands and forearms to the elbow, in general, for 2 to 6 minutes.
It is not necessary to wash for a long time (10 minutes).
When rinsing, the water from the forearms should be avoided to return to the hands.
After washing, the hands are dried with a sterilized cloth and a surgical coat is placed.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash your hands or use an antiseptic for hands before and after treating sick people.
To control infections caused by staphylococcus in hospitals, it has been found that the greatest benefit of hand cleaning is in the first 20% of washing and that very little additional benefit is obtained when the frequency of hand hygiene increases by more than 35%.
Washing with common soap results in more than three times the incidence of bacterial infections transmitted to food compared to washing with antibacterial soap. When comparing hand washing with an alcohol-based solution with hand washing with an antibacterial soap, the average time of the soap was reduced by 26%.
However, water and soap are more effective at reducing influenza A virus H1N1 and Clostridium difficile spores of the hands than alcohol-based hand sanitizers. Interventions to improve hand hygiene or at health care centers may include available staff training on hand washing and hand washing.
It is necessary to investigate more about which of these interventions are most effective in the different health care environments.
In developing countries, handwashing with soap is considered an economical and fundamental tool for achieving good health and even good nutrition.
However, the lack of a reliable supply of water, soap or hand-washing facilities in homes, schools and workplaces makes it a challenge to achieve universal hand-washing behaviors.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, there are very few hand-washing faucets near public or private retreats, although there are economical options to build hand-washing stations.
However, low hand washing rates can also be the result of rooted habits and not a lack of soap or water.
Promoting handwashing with soap can influence policy decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of handwashing, and cause a change in behavior in the population in the long term.
For this to work effectively, it is necessary to monitor and evaluate.
In a systematic review of 70 studies, it was observed that community approaches are effective in increasing handwashing in PRBMs, while social marketing campaigns are less effective. An example of promoting handwashing in schools is the "Three Stars" approach to taking other requirements and economical measures.
When the minimum standards are reached, schools can go from one to, finally, three stars.
The construction of hand-washing stations can be part of the campaigns to promote hand-washing that are being carried out to reduce disease and child mortality.
World Handwashing Day is another example of an awareness campaign that seeks to bring about a change in behavior. As a result of the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF pushed the creation of an emoji for handwashing.
Few studies have considered the overall profitability of hand washing in developing countries in relation to avoided AVADs.
However, one analysis indicates that promoting hand washing with soap is considerably more effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of hand washing for human health, in particular for people in vulnerable circumstances, such as mothers who have just given birth or soldiers in hospitals, was first recognized in the mid-20th century by two pioneers of hand hygiene: the modern medicine doctor Ignaz Semmelweis.
At that time, most people still believed that infections were caused by unpleasant odors called miasmas.
In the 1980s, outbreaks of food-borne diseases and health-related infections led the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to more actively promote hand hygiene as an important way to prevent the spread of infections.
The swine flu outbreak in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 made many countries more aware of the importance of washing their hands with soap to protect themselves from those infectious diseases.
For example, in Germany, posters with "correct handwashing techniques" were hung next to the toilets of public toilets and the toilets of office buildings and airports.
The phrase “washing your hands” is a statement of not wanting to take care of something or share the complicity of something.
It has its origin in the biblical passage of Matthew in which Pontius Pilate washed his hands in the face of the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but has become a much broader use phrase in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth begins to wash her hands compulsively in an attempt to clean up an imaginary stain, representing her conscience of guilt over the crimes she had committed and that she had induced her husband to commit.
It has also been found that after remembering or reflecting on unethical actions, people tend to wash their hands more often than others and tend to value more items for hand washing.
In addition, those who have been allowed to wash their hands after such reflection are less likely to engage in other compensatory “cleaning” actions, such as volunteering.
Religions recommend handwashing for hygienic and symbolic purposes. Symbolic handwashing, with water, but without soap, is part of the ritual handwashing in many religions, such as Bahaism, Hinduism, Tevila and Netilat Yadayim also reconnoitus in Judaism.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam force you to wash your hands after you go to the bathroom.
And Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism, and Islam force you to wash your hands before and after each meal.
Risk controls at the workplace in the face of COVID-19
The workplace risk controls in the face of COVID-19 refer to the application of occupational hygiene and safety methodologies in the risk controls for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Appropriate workplace risk controls depend on the workplace and the task and are based on a risk assessment of the sources of exposure, the severity of the disease in the community and the risk factors of workers who may be prone to contract COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), jobs with the lowest risk of exposure have minimal work contact with the public and co-workers, for whom basic infection prevention measures are advised, including rushin’ hand washing and rushin’ hand washing, and the worker’s recommendation to stay married.
Medium-risk jobs include those where frequent or close contact is required with people who are not known or suspected to have COVID-19, but who may be infected by the current community transmission or by an international trip.
This includes workers who are in contact with the general public, such as in schools, work environments with a lot of concentration of people, and some large retail environments.
Risk controls for this group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures, include ventilation with high-efficiency air filters, protective covers, and individual protective equipment available in case of a person with COVID-19.
OSHA considers that health care and funeral services workers, exposed to people who are known or suspected of having COVID-19, have a high risk of exposure, which increases to very high if they perform procedures that can generate aerosols in people who are known or suspected of having COVID-19 or taking or manipulating samples from these people.
Appropriate risk controls for these workers include engineering controls, such as negative-pressure ventilation rooms, and appropriate personal protective equipment for work activity.
COVID-19 outbreaks can have several consequences in the workplace.
Workers may be out of work for getting sick, for having to look after others, or for fear of possible exposure.
Trade patterns may change, both in terms of what goods are claimed and the means of acquiring those goods (such as buying in non-peak hours, by way of home delivery services or by window from the car).
Finally, shipments of items from geographical areas severely affected by COVID-19 could be disrupted, and a plan of preparedness and response to infectious diseases could be used to guide preventive measures.
The plans address levels of risk related to various workplaces and work activities, including sources of exposure, risk factors arising from domestic and community environments, and risk factors of individual workers, such as old age or chronic medical conditions.
They also describe the controls needed to address those risks and contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of the outbreaks.
Infectious disease preparedness and response plans may be subject to national or regional recommendations.
The response to an outbreak targets include reducing transmission among staff members, protecting people at greater risk of adverse health complications, maintaining business operations, and minimizing adverse effects on other entities in their supply chains.
The severity of the disease in the community in which the company is located affects the measures taken.
The Risk Control Hierarchy is a widely used framework for occupational hygiene and safety to classify risk controls according to their effectiveness.
If the risks of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are engineering controls, followed by administrative and, finally, individual protection equipment.
Engineering controls involve isolating employees from work-related hazards without resorting to worker behavior and may be the most cost-effective solution to implement.
Administrative controls are changes in employment policies or procedures that require action by the worker or employer.
Individual protection equipment is considered less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but can help prevent some exposures.
All types of personal protective equipment should be selected according to the hazard to the worker, positioned as appropriate (e.g., respirators), used appropriately and systematically, checked frequently, received maintenance, replaced if necessary and disposed of, cleaned and disposed of or disposed of properly in order to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA), jobs with the lowest risk of exposure have minimal work contact with the public and co-workers.
The measures of prevention of basic infections that are recommended for all workplaces include deep and frequent hand washing, the recommendation to workers to stay at home if they are sick, the respiratory hygiene standards that include covering themselves when coughing and sneezing, the provision of toilet paper towels and containers.
The immediate identification and isolation of people who may be infected is a fundamental measure to protect workers, customers, visitors and others in the workplace.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees who have symptoms of acute respiratory diseases remain in their homes until they cease to have fever, signs of fever and any other symptom employs these policies for at least 24 hours without having taken any medications to relieve the symptoms or to diminish the faith.
According to the OSHA, work with average risk of exposure includes those that require frequent or close contact less than six feet (1.8 m) with people who are not known or suspected to have COVID-19, but who may have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 because of a re-infection with a person due to a community-based transmission of the moment or around the time.
These include those who work in the United States, who work in the United States, who work in the United States, who work in the United States, who work in the United States, who work in the United States, who work in the United States, who work in the United States, who work in the United States, who work in the United States, who work in the United States, who work in the United States, who work in the United States, who work in the United States, and other countries, who work in the United States, who work in the United States.
Workers in this risk group should rarely use respirators.
If a person becomes ill on a plane, appropriate controls to protect workers and other passengers include separating the sick person from the others at a distance of 6 feet, appointing a crew member to care for the sick person and offering a paper mask when he touches the sick person or sniffs them and asks them to cover it.
The cabin crew should wear disposable surgical gloves to care for a sick passenger or to touch potentially contaminated body fluids or surfaces and, perhaps, personal protective equipment if the sick passenger has a fever, persistent cough, or difficulty breathing.
The gloves and other disposable items must be discarded in a bag for hazardous biological waste and the contaminated surfaces must be cleaned and disinfected later. In the case of commercial navigation, such as cruise ships and other vessels that are carrying passengers, the risk checks at the center include delaying the journey in self-employment or the disease.
In the case of schools and childcare centres, the CDC recommends short-term closure to clean or disinfect if an infected person was in the school building, regardless of community transmission.
When the community transmission is minimal or moderate, social distancing strategies can be implemented, such as cancelling excursions, assemblies and other mass meetings, such as physical education or choir classes or meals in the dining room, increasing the space between the children's health, escalating the room to the room to use separates, and limiting the visits is not the room.
When there is considerable transmission in the local community, in addition to social distancing strategies, it may be considered extending the cancellation of classes. For police personnel carrying out daily routine activities, the CDC considers the immediate health risk to be low.
Police officers are advised to contact persons with a confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19 who follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including the use of personal protective equipment.
If there is close contact during a detention, workers must clean and disinfect their work belt and equipment with an aerosol or household cleaning wipes before re-use and follow the standard operating procedure for the containment and disposal of personal protective equipment and the containment and washing of clothes.
OSHA considers that certain health workers and morgues are within high or very high risk exposure categories.
Among the high-risk exposure jobs are those of delivery, support, laboratory and medical transport workers who are exposed to patients with confirmed diagnoses or suspected COVID-19.
These become very high-risk exposure jobs if workers perform aerosol generation procedures in patients with confirmed diagnoses or suspected COVID-19 or if they take or manipulate samples from these patients.
Some aerosol generation procedures include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and examinations, or invasive sampling.
The morgue works of high risk of exposure include those in which workers are involved in the preparation of the bodies of people who had COVID-19 or who were suspected of having it at the time of death; these are confirmed to have a very high risk of exposure even if they perform autopsies.
Specialized ventilation with negative pressure may be suitable in some health care environments and morgues.
Samples should be handled taking Biosafety Level 3 precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients entering RS separate in different waiting rooms depending on whether or not they may be suspected of having COVID-19. In addition to other types of personal protective equipment, OSHA recommends the use of masks for those patients who have to be counted from RS2 to those who work at a distance of up to 6 feet.
In the United States, N95 respirators with filtration mask approved by NIOSH or higher must be used in the context of a written comprehensive respiratory program that includes fit tests, trainings, and medical examinations.
Other types of masks can provide greater protection and improve worker comfort. The WHO does not recommend the use of protective monkeys, as COVID-19 is a respiratory disease, not one that is transmitted by body fluids.
The WHO only recommends the use of a surgical mask for patient classification personnel entering.
For those who take respiratory samples from patients with COVID-19, provide care or transport them without performing aerosol generation procedures, WHO recommends the use of surgical mask, glasses or face protector, coat and gloves.
If an aerosol generation procedure is performed, the surgical mask should be replaced by an N95 or FFP2 respirator.
Due to the fact that the provision of personal protective equipment is insufficient, the WHO recommends minimizing the need to use them, replacing them by telemedicine, physical barriers such as transparent windows, the limitation of the admission to the room of a patient with COVID-19, and the limitation of the admission to the room of the patient by the patient of the patient with COVID-19 is not sufficient.

QUESTION: [Covid-19] Lighten the load and prepare for the future
END/DATE OF SHIPPING: March 14, 2020, 00:24 h, coordinated universal time
LICENSE: CC0: No rights reserved
This month, we are in unique circumstances.
The COVID-19 epidemic highlights our global human interconnection and the responsibilities we have with each other.
The challenges it presents are unprecedented, but we know that our best response lies in the empathy, cooperation and global community building that make up the core of this organization.
The camaraderie and concern we’ve seen among all our colleagues in emails, calls and conversations is a great validation of how amazing the people we’re lucky to work with are.
I couldn’t feel more gratitude and pride that you all were my companions.
Last week, someone shared with me the appreciation I felt for our work.
They reminded me how important it is for the world to be able to go to Wikipedia right now and the powerful symbol that is the fact that this critical resource remains online and available to everyone.
Their work makes this possible, whether by keeping the sites running, helping our colleagues get paid or keeping our communities safe.
The world needs the information that Wikipedia provides, today more than ever.
This is a time when not only what we do but the way we do it will have a profound effect on the world.
Due to the importance of this mission and its role in this, from this next week, we will make some important adjustments to the way we work together.
Adjustments to our work and schedules
As Robyn mentioned earlier, Team C met last night to talk about our approach and our schedule for the coming days and months.
In that conversation, we considered what we believed would be an appropriate response to what we are facing and what would be the best way to maintain the sustainability of the organization at this time.
To a greater extent, we wanted to eliminate stress and support our long-term mission.
If you need to slow down, that's fine.
For all staff, contractors and contracted workers:
Our daily work expectations will be about 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week, until next notice.
We are not declaring a holiday; if you can work on a more normal schedule, this would be very useful for the mission.
However, the world is an unpredictable place right now, and whether you have to take care of your loved ones, shop or go to the doctor, our priority is your well-being.
We're not keeping track of your hours.
If you're sick, don't work.
Although it should not be necessary to say it, we say it.
There’s no need to ask for sick leave or paid free time; just inform your manager and help your team review schedules and schedules to make sure key areas of work are covered.
(If you receive a positive diagnosis of COVID-19, notify Bryan of T&C Operations so T&C can help with support and make sure the management is aware of your situation.)
People who work per hour will receive the full payment.
As we have said, we renew our commitment to our contractors and hourly staff.
Everyone will be paid on the basis of their normal working hours under normal circumstances.
This also applies if you are sick and cannot work.
If you want to work, you have our support.
Many people use work as a way to channel their stress to the world around us.
What we do can be incredibly rewarding, especially in these times.
Again, it is your personal care.
What we ask you is to communicate with your manager so that we know what to expect and can adapt properly.
Certain work is considered essential.
There are a few things we must continue to do.
Site Reliability Engineering, Human Resource Operations, Trust and Security and Fundraising teams, among others, do critical work that may require additional support.
We will begin a process with all departments to assess current goals and modify our approach to support what is essential to our mission.
There are enough tasks for all of us; the only difference is that we will all focus on the most essential projects.
Reducing speed today won't hurt us tomorrow.
We don’t plan to “double the hours to catch up” when the pandemic ends.
You will not be expected to work overtime to meet deadlines that are no longer realistic.
We accept that circumstances have changed and will work to set new goals and deadlines when appropriate.
What happens to the APP, or Annual Planning?
To adjust to our new reality and expectations of daily working hours, we plan to adjust the schedule for the delivery of our 2020-2021 Annual Plan.
Our intention is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan that allocate more time to the budget so employees can prioritize critical work, personal care and care for loved ones while adapting to the needs of those who need or wish to work on a reduced schedule over the coming weeks.
This extension of our schedule greatly reduces current planning loads and pressure throughout the organization.
We will present our proposal to the Council next week and communicate the next steps to delegates and teams as soon as we have confirmation.
Thanks to the APP team for their leadership in this situation.
State, exhibition and cleaning of the office
Last week we learned that one of our colleagues at the San Francisco office may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, as a precautionary measure, we hired an antivirus cleaning team to disinfect all surfaces of the San Francisco office.
They used an antiviral solution for hospital use to disinfect all surfaces, in addition to the reception and elevators that go to our apartment.
The building has adopted its own protocol of duty of care, using products that support the safety of its occupants.
We are confident that the office will be well prepared for when we decide to return.
Our office in DC is located in a WeWork, which has shared its COVID-19 protocol with us and all staff in the DC offices.
Since last week, our DC office has moved its operations to a completely remote environment in accordance with the guidelines shared with San Francisco.
As some of our New York City colleagues already know, we have also talked about renting a place in Brooklyn.
These discussions are still ongoing but may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues work remotely for the first time.
Our colleagues who have worked remotely before know that this modality requires an adaptation, so they provide the following suggestions:
Limit the duration of meetings to intervals of one or two hours.
If longer sessions are required, consider how to separate them over the course of several days.
Define the meeting clearly with a list of topics and send the reading materials in advance.
Adopt video use by default, using tools like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate collaboration and live connection.
Designate a leader to moderate each meeting, a person who controls the questions in the chat and list of speakers, and someone who helps take notes (or take notes collaboratively).
Send an email to technical support if you need comfortable headphones.
Use the wellness refund for snacks.
Join <0x23>remoties on Slack to talk to your colleagues about distributed work
The RR. HH. Operations team is analyzing guidelines on web-based ergonomics to support the increase in distributed work across the Foundation.
This past week we have asked all recipients of community grants to cancel public events funded by Wikimedia, such as the edits, until the WHO declares the end of the pandemic.
Please note that we understand that our request for cancellations and other restrictions could make it impossible for you to fulfill your part of the agreed-upon activities for the grant and that there would be no penalty for having to delay or modify those objectives.
This next week we will follow up with additional guidelines on Wikimania and other community and regional thematic conferences.
The overall feeling of the global community appears to be, in part, sadness for the interruption and, in part, relief for clarity and the ability to focus on their own communities, both Wikimedia and others.
From now on, CRT will be working to establish a page on Meta-Wiki in order to give the community a space to monitor the impact and follow our communications with them.
Maintaining contact in relation to COVID-19 issues
We will send you an invitation through your calendars for next Thursday, 14:00 h, Coordinated Universal Time/07:00 h, Pacific Time, for a special staff meeting.
We will take this opportunity to share additional news, answer your questions and spend time connecting with each other.
We are together in this and we are available to help in the way we can.
In the meantime, you can continue to find the information in this email message and all additional essential information related to COVID-19 on the Office Wiki.
CRT will keep these pages up to date and all information in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular communications with staff residing in countries that are currently heavily affected.
If you have any questions about travel, events, an important workflow, any coverage problem, or anything else you might need help with, feel free to notify CRT and work with them.
We are here to help provide support and function as a link when needed.
If you have sensitive or sensitive issues, send an email to Bryan Judan, Director of Global Operations at RR. HH.
None of these changes should be considered an abandonment of our work and our obligations.
Instead, they are a recognition that, at this moment, our work and our obligations should probably be adapted in a way that hadn’t happened before.
These are the measures we believe are necessary to support each other so that we can continue to work, give our movement the necessary support and provide the world with the service it trusts.
Our planned work will continue to be there for us when the time comes.
For now, it is time to support each other and make room for the important work that will come in the coming weeks and possibly in the coming months.
We need all of you to make this possible and, therefore, we need you to take care of your families so that they can be in the best possible condition when the need arises.
Now, please wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M and Tony S) and the rest of the Leadership team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M and Toby N).
The angiotensin 2 converting enzyme (ECA2) is an enzyme that attaches to the outer surface (cell membranes) of cells of the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys and intestines.
ECA2 counteracts the activity of the related angiotensin converting enzyme (ECA) by reducing the amount of angiotensin II and increasing angiotensin (1-7), making it a therapeutic target for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases.
The human version of the enzyme is generally called hECA2.
The angiotensin 2 converting enzyme is a zinc-containing metalloenzyme found on the surface of endothelial cells and other types.
The ECA2 protein contains an N-terminal domain of M2 peptidase and a renal amino acid transporter C-terminal domain of collectrin.
ECA2 is a type I one-stage membrane protein, with its enzymatically active domain exposed on the surface of lung cells and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of ECA2 is cleaved from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme known as shedase and, as a result, the soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and ultimately excreted by the urine.
ECA2 is present in most organs: ECA2 is mainly adhered to the cell membrane of the lung type II alveolar cells, the enterocytes of the small intestine, venous arterial and endothelial cells, and the arterial smooth muscle cells of most organs.
The expression of ECA2 mRNA is also found in the cerebral cortex, striate body, hypothalamus, and brain stem.
The main function of the ECA2 is to counteract the ECA.
ACE breaks down the hormone from angiotensin I and forms angiotensin II, which is vasoconstrictor.
In turn, ECA2 cleaves the amino acid carboxyl-terminal phenylalanine of angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyzes it to form the vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Hyr-Tyr-Hyre-Hile-Phe).
ECA2 may also cleave several other peptides, including [des-Arg9]-bradiquinine, apelin, neurotensin, dinorfine A, and ghrelin.
ECA2 also regulates the membrane traffic of the neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and has been associated with Hartnup disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ECA2 serves as the main entry point for some coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
More specifically, binding of the spike protein S1 of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 to the enzymatic domain of ECA2 on the cell surface results in endocytosis and virus transfer along with the enzyme to the endosomes found within the cells.
This entry process also requires the preparation of the S protein by the host serine protease TMPRSS2, the inhibition of which is currently being investigated as possible therapy, which has led to certain hypotheses that reducing ECA2 levels in cells could help fight infection.
However, various professional associations and regulatory bodies have recommended continuing standard ACE and BRA inhibitory therapy.
A systematic meta-analysis review published on July 11, 2012 found that “the use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a significant 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to control cases.”
In addition, “the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients who received treatment with ACE inhibitors and who had an increased risk of pneumonia, particularly those with stroke and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a reduction in pneumonia-related mortality, although the results were not as solid for the overall risk of pneumonia."
Recombinant human ECA2 (rhECA2) appears to be a new therapy for acute lung injury and appears to improve lung hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in mammals with lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The half-life of rhECA2 in humans is approximately 10 hours and the onset of action is 30 minutes in addition to the course of effect (duration) of 24 hours.
Several findings suggest that rhECA2 could be a promising drug for those people with intolerance to classic renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (SRA inhibitors) or in diseases in which circulating angiotensin II is elevated.
COVID-19 applications are mobile software applications designed to help track contacts in response to the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, i.e. the process of identifying people ("contacts") who may have been in contact with an infected person.
Various applications were developed or proposed with official government support in some territories and jurisdictions.
Several frameworks have been developed for creating contact tracking applications.
Concerns have been raised regarding privacy, in particular, in relation to systems that are based on tracking the geographic location of application users.
There are other less invasive alternatives, such as using Bluetooth signals to record a user’s proximity to other cell phones.
On April 10, 2020, Apple and Google announced together that they would integrate the functionality to support such Bluetooth-based apps directly on their iOS and Android operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, along with Alipay, has implemented an app that allows citizens to verify whether they have been in contact with people who have COVID-19.
It is already in use in more than 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore an application called TraceTogether is being used.
The app was developed by a local IT community, launched as an open source app and will be handed over to the government. In North Macedonia, "StopKorona!" was launched, a Bluetooth-based app to track exposure to potentially infected people and provide a quick response to health authorities.
The application was developed by the Ministry of Communication and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app was awaiting approval from the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store.
On April 12, the government reported that the contact tracking application was in an advanced stage of development and would be available for implementation in the coming weeks. It is planned to use a similar application in Ireland and France ("StopCovid").
Both Australia and New Zealand are considering applications based on the TraceTogether app and the Singapore BlueTrace protocol. Russia plans to introduce a geoperimeter app for patients living in Moscow and having received a diagnosis of COVID-19, designed to ensure they do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at Cambridge University, exposed several potential practical problems with application-based systems, including false positives and possible inefficiency if application adoption is limited to only a small portion of the population.
In response to concerns about the spread of deceptive or harmful "coronavirus" apps, Apple limited the types of organizations that can add coronavirus-related apps on its App Store to "official" or trusted organizations only.
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy advocates expressed concern about the consequences of mass surveillance through coronavirus applications and, in particular, whether the infrastructure created to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will be dismantled once the threat has passed.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations submitted a statement demanding limits on this type of surveillance.
The organizations established eight conditions for governmental projects:
surveillance should be "legal, necessary and proportionate";
the extensions of monitoring and surveillance would have to have extinction clauses;
the use of the data should be limited to COVID-19-related objectives;
security and anonymity should be protected and there should be evidence of this protection;
Digital surveillance should avoid exacerbating discrimination and marginalisation;
any exchange of data with third parties should be defined in the law;
protections against abuse should be implemented and the rights of citizens to respond to such abuse should be established;
The Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (RSF) of Germany have also published checklists, including the participation of all "relevant stakeholders", including public health experts and marginalized groups.
The plan proposed by Google/Apple aims to address the problem of persistent surveillance by removing the tracking mechanism from its operating systems when it is no longer needed.
In some countries, network-based location tracking was used instead of applications, eliminating both the need to download an application and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network-based tracking was approved.
Network-based solutions that have access to raw data from locations present significant potential privacy issues.
However, not all systems with central servers need to have access to personal location data; several privacy protection systems have been created that use central servers only for intercommunication (see section below).
In South Korea, a non-app-based system was used to track contacts.
Instead of using a specific application, the system collected tracking information from various sources, including mobile device tracking data and credit card transaction data, and combined them to generate alerts via text messages for potentially infected people.
In addition to using this information to alert about potential contacts, the government has also made location information available to the public, something that is allowed due to far-reaching changes to information privacy laws after the outbreak of MERS in that country.
This information is available to the public through various applications and websites. Some countries, including Germany, considered using centralized and privacy protection systems.
As of April 6, 2020, the details have not yet been published.
Privacy-protected contact tracking is a well-established concept, with a lot of published research dating back to at least 2013. As of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as the use of low-energy Bluetooth (BLE) telephones to record user proximity.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordinated effort that contains both centralized and decentralized approaches and is not a single protocol. The decentralized protocols include decentralized proximity tracking to preserve privacy (DP-PPT/DP-3T), other inter-protection contact numbers (TCT) or contact numbers (CPT) for the contacting and contacting of the contacts (TCN, previously known as numbers).
In these protocols, personal identification data never exits the device and all pairing occurs on the device.
The MIT Media Lab Privacy Group has been developing SafePaths, a platform for the use of privacy-protecting techniques when collecting and using location or route intersection data to track the spread of COVID-19.
It is based on research from the technical report “Applications out of control: how to maintain personal privacy during an epidemic,” published in March 2020. Another similar effort is Enigma MPC’s SafeTrace platform, a company that develops privacy technologies that was also originally founded at the MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies that allow its users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and officials without compromising the privacy of that data.
On April 5, 2020, several groups united around what was essentially the same approach and with highly matching protocols formed the Global TCN Coalition with the aim of reducing fragmentation and enabling global interoperability of tracking and alerting applications, a key aspect to achieve broad adoption.
On April 9, 2020, the Singapore government announced that it had opened the code of the BlueTrace protocol used by its official government application.
On April 10, 2020, Apple and Google, the companies that control iOS and Android mobile platforms, announced an initiative to track contacts that they said would protect privacy, which is based on the combination of low-energy Bluetooth technology and privacy protection cryptography.
They also published specifications of the main technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system is intended to be implemented in three stages:
Implementation of tools for governments to create official coronavirus tracking apps that protect privacy
Google and Apple plan to address persistent adoption and surveillance issues by first deploying the system through OS updates and then removing them in the same way once the threat has passed.
b'Reprofiling (also known as repositioning or therapeutic change) is the readaptation of a drug approved for the treatment of a disease other than the one for which it was originally developed.
This is in line with scientific research currently seeking to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Other lines of research include the development of a COVID-19 vaccine and convalescent plasma transfusion. SARS-CoV-2 has approximately 66 chemomodulable proteins, each of which has multiple sites of binding to the ligand.
The analysis of these binding sites provides a reasonable basis for the project to develop an effective antiviral drug against COVID-19 proteins.
Among the most important target proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are papain-like protease, RNA-directed polymerase RNA, helicase, protein S, and ADP ribophosphatase.
Hussein A. A. et al. studied several compounds of medical interest that they then optimized and analyzed to identify the similarity of their main chain with the most similar approved drugs in order to accelerate the development of a potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug in their preclinical study and recommend it for the design of a clinical trial.
Chloroquine is an antimalarial drug that is also used against some autoimmune diseases.
On March 18, the WHO announced that chloroquine and related hydroxychloroquine would be among the four drugs to be studied in the Solidarity clinical trial.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that trials of New York State with chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine would begin on March 24. On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate through an urgent use (USA) authorization.
The treatment has not been approved by the FDA’s clinical trial process and is U.S.-approved only as an experimental treatment for urgent use in patients who are hospitalized but cannot receive treatment in a clinical trial.
The CDC said that "the use, dose or duration of hydroxychloroquine for the prophylaxis or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection" is not yet established.
Doctors have said they use the drug when “there is no other option.”
A Turkish research team in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
At Duke University and Oxford University, major studies are underway.
NYU’s Langone School of Medicine is conducting a trial on the safety and efficacy of the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed to show that favipiravir was "clearly effective".
Thirty-five patients in Shenzhen gave negative on an average of 4 days, while the duration of the disease was 11 days in 45 patients who did not receive it.
In a study conducted in Wuhan in 240 patients with pneumonia, half received favipiravir, while the other half received umifenovir.
The Italian Medicines Agency reminded the public that the existing evidence supporting the drug is scarce and preliminary.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would buy the drug from Japan for its reserves and that it would use the military to deliver the drug to university hospitals, where it will be used to treat patients with COVID-19.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has made proposals to the Trump Administration on the purchase of the drug. The drug may be less effective in serious cases of the disease if the virus has already multiplied.
It may not be safe for pregnant women or trying to conceive.
A study of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir antivirals, concluded that "no benefits were observed".
The drugs were designed to inhibit HIV replication by binding to the protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify the drugs to find a compound that binds to the SARS-CoV-2 protease. In the scientific community, there have been criticisms about the allocation of resources to the rehabilitation of drugs specifically developed for HIV/AIDS.
WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the international Solidarity trial.
Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infections. Gilead Sciences later discovered that remdesivir had antiviral activity in vitro against multiple filoviruses, pneumoviruses, paramixoviruses and coronaviruses.
A problem with antiviral treatment is the development of resistance through mutations that can result in a more serious disease and transmission.
Some early studies prior to trials suggest that remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance. Several clinical trials are underway, including two conducted by Cleveland University hospitals; one for people with moderate disease and one for those with more severe disease.
Three intravenous vitamin C clinical trials are underway for people hospitalized and severely affected by COVID-19; two placebo-controlled (China, Canada) and one uncontrolled (Italy).
The state of New York began trials with the antibiotic azithromycin on March 24, 2020.
Japan’s National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) is planning a clinical trial with Teijin’s Alvesco (cyclesonide), an inhalable corticosteroid for asthma, as a treatment for asymptomatic patients infected with the new coronavirus.
A form of angiotensin 2 converting enzyme, a phase II trial is underway and 200 serious patients hospitalized in Denmark, Germany and Austria will be enrolled to determine the effectiveness of the treatment.
Researchers at the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently studying the role of colchicine in reducing inflammation and lung complications in patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19.
The study, called COLCORONA, is enrolling 6,000 adults aged 40 and over with a diagnosis of COVID-19 and mild symptoms that do not require hospitalization.
Pregnant women, who are breastfeeding or who do not have an affective contraceptive method are not eligible.
Several anticoagulants are being evaluated in Italy.
Low molecular weight heparin is widely used to treat patients, so the Italian Medicines Agency published guidelines on its use.
On April 14, a multicentre study with 300 patients was announced in Italy that investigates the use of enoxaparin sodium in preventive and therapeutic doses.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, scientists are paying a lot of attention to the readaptation of antiviral drugs that have been developed for previous outbreaks of the SROM, SARG and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: ribavirin was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines
Umifenovir: Umifenovir was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines
These are some treatments that have been identified for possible re-admissions for the treatment of COVID-19:
Tocilizumab (blocks the IL-6 receptor): approved by China.
<0x7B>NS<0x7D>
b'A COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has completed clinical trials, there are many ongoing attempts to develop such a vaccine.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it did not expect there to be a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the disease, in less than 18 months.
In April, five possible vaccines were in phase I safety studies.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major outbreak spread around the world in 2020, triggering considerable investment and research activity to develop a vaccine.
Many organizations use published genomes to develop potential vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
Established in April, the requirements of CEPI’s vaccine development initiative are speed, manufacturing capacity, scale implementation, and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technology platforms were being researched and developed in early 2020 to create an effective COVID-19 vaccine.
Among the targets of the main platforms that went to Phase I safety studies are the following:
nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (phase I developer and possible vaccine: Modern, mRNA-1273)
virus vector (phase I developer and possible vaccine: CanSino Biologics, adenovirus type 5 vector)
As reported by the CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 possible vaccines are in the early stages of development, 78 of which are confirmed in active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute) and the other 37 are announced, but with little information available (presumably planned or under development).
A phase I or II trial performs preliminary safety and immunogenicity tests, usually randomized, is placebo-controlled, and is performed at several sites, while determining more accurate and effective doses.
Phase III trials usually involve more participants, including a control group, and evaluate the effectiveness of the vaccine to prevent the disease, while controlling the adverse effects that occur with the optimal dose.
Of the 79 vaccines in active development (confirmed at the beginning of April 2020), 74 were not yet under evaluation in humans (they were still in "preclinical" research).
Around January 24, 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it was investigating the potential of a vaccine with molecular attachment that would genetically modify viral proteins to stimulate the immune response.
Around January 24, 2020 in Canada, the University of Saskatchewan’s International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac) announced the start of work on a vaccine and expects human testing to begin in 2021.
Vaccine development projects were announced at the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention on January 26, 2020, and at the University of Hong Kong on January 28, 2020.
Around January 29, 2020, Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies, led by Hanneke Schuitemaker, announced that they had begun developing a vaccine.
Janssen is co-developing an oral vaccine with its biotech partner, Vaxart.
On March 18, 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced a manufacturing partnership with Vaxart for the development of the vaccine.
On February 8, 2020, the OncoGen laboratory in Romania published a document designing a vaccine with technology similar to that used in the treatment of neoantigenic cancer vaccines.
On March 25, the head of the research institute announced that the synthesis of the vaccine had been completed and that tests were beginning.
On February 27, 2020, a subsidiary of Generex, NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology, announced that it was starting a project to create a li-key peptide vaccine against COVID-19.
They wanted to produce a possible vaccine that could be tested in humans "within 90 days".
On March 5, 2020, the University of Washington in San Luis announced its plans to develop a vaccine.
On March 5, 2020, the United States Army Medical Research and Material Command at Fort Detrick and the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in Silver Spring, both in western Maryland, announced they were working on a vaccine.
On March 10, 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced that it had joined Novavax Inc.
in the development and manufacture of a vaccine.
The partners also announced plans for a phase I clinical trial and clinical trial by July 2020.
On March 12, 2020, India’s Ministry of Health announced that it was working with 11 isolated individuals and that, although it progresses quickly, it would take at least one and a half to two years to develop a vaccine.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec City, Quebec, reported the development of a coronavirus-like particle with partial funding from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
The possible vaccine is in the laboratory research stage and human testing is expected to begin in July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, The Guardian reported that U.S. President Donald Trump had offered CureVac “large amounts of money for exclusive access to a COVID-19 vaccine,” to which the German government complained.
On March 17, 2020, the US pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech to jointly develop a mRNA-based vaccine.
The possible mRNA-based vaccine BNT162 is currently in preclinical testing and clinical trials are expected to begin in April 2020.
In Italy, on March 17, 2020, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotechnology company, announced that it will have the results of the preclinical tests in April 2020 and that human trials of the possible final vaccine could begin in the fall.
In France, on March 19, 2020, the Coalition for Innovation in Epidemic Preparation (CEPI) announced an investment of USD 4.9 million in a research alliance for a COVID-19 vaccine that includes the Institut Pasteur, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh.
The other partners of CEPI for the development of a COVID-19 vaccine are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, the University of Hong Kong, the University of Oxford and the University of Queensland.
On March 20, 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had begun animal testing of six possible vaccines.
Researchers at the Imperial College of London announced on March 20, 2020 that they were developing a self-replicating RNA vaccine against COVID-19.
The possible vaccine was developed within 14 days of receiving the China sequence.
In late March, the Canadian government announced a CAD 275 million funding for 96 research projects on medical measures to counter COVID-19, which includes a large number of potential vaccines in Canadian companies and universities, such as the Medico Initiatives and the University of Saskatchewan.
More or less at the same time, the Canadian government announced the use of CAD 192 million specifically to develop a COVID-19 vaccine, with plans to create a "national vaccine bank" with several new vaccines that could be used if another coronavirus outbreak occurs.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine announced the testing of PittCoVacc, a possible COVID-19 vaccine, in mice and said that "the vaccines of the SARS-CoV-2 subunit after specific week-long SARS-CoV-2 vaccines were evidenced that two MNA-administered vaccines obtained powerful responses from antibody vapours.
In Canada, on April 16, 2020, the University of Waterloo School of Pharmacy announced the design of a possible DNA-based vaccine as a probable nasal spray.
Using bacteriophages, DNA will be designated to replicate within the human bacterium and produce virus-like harmless particles, which can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the government, industry and three U.S. universities gathered resources to access IBM’s supercomputers, along with cloud computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have non-specific effects.
That means they can have benefits beyond the disease they prevent.
Another randomized trial in Australia seeks to enroll 4,170 health workers.
Vaccines that are being developed may not be safe or effective.
Initial research to evaluate the effectiveness of vaccines with specific animal models of COVID-19, such as the transgenic mouse expressing ECA2, other laboratory animals and non-human primates, demonstrate the need to have level 3 biosecurity containment measures to ensure safety for the handling of live viruses and with international coordination.
SARG and SROM vaccines have been tested in non-human animal models.
As of 2020, there is no cure or vaccine that protects against SARS that has been shown to be safe and effective in humans.
According to research publications from 2005 to 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and drugs to treat SARS was a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world.
When SROM became generalized, existing research on SRAG was believed to be a useful template for developing vaccines and treatments against MERS-CoV infection.
In March 2020, one SROM (DNA-based) vaccine completed the Phase I clinical trials in humans, three others were in progress, all of which are viral vector vaccines, two adenovirus vectors (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one de ve.
Social media posts promoted a conspiracy theory that the COVID-19-causing virus was known and there was already a vaccine.
The patents cited by various social media publications refer to existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other coronavirus strains, such as the SARG coronavirus.
b'Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and difficulty breathing.
Other symptoms include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of smell, and abdominal pain.
The time between exposure and the onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but can vary between two and fourteen days.
While most cases result in mild symptoms, some progress to viral pneumonia and multiorganic insufficiency.
As of April 17, 2020, more than 2.24 million cases were reported in 210 countries and territories, with more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have recovered. The virus spreads mainly among people during close contact, usually through drops that occur when coughing, sneezing or speaking.
While these droplets occur when exhaled, they usually fall to the floor or on surfaces, rather than being contagious over long distances.
People can also become infected by touching a contaminated surface and then touching the eyes, nose or mouth.
The virus can survive on surfaces for up to 72 hours.
It is more contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although propagation is also possible before symptoms appear and in late stages of the disease. The standard method for diagnosis is the polymerase chain reaction with real time reverse transcription (rRT-PCR) of a nasopharynx.
The use of masks is recommended for those who suspect that they have the virus and its caregivers.
Recommendations on the use of masks for the general public vary. Some authorities recommend not to use them, others recommend that they be used, while others require their use.
There is currently no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in most countries in the six WHO regions.
Those who are infected with the virus may be asymptomatic or have flu-like symptoms, such as fever, cough, fatigue, and difficulty breathing.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, pain or persistent pressure in the chest, confusion, difficulty walking and bluish face or lips. If these symptoms occur, it is recommended to seek medical attention immediately.
It is less common to observe symptoms in the upper respiratory tract, such as sneezing, nasal dripping, and sore throat.
Gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea, have been identified in varying percentages.
Some cases in China initially showed chest pain and palpitations.
In some, the disease progressed to pneumonia, multiorgan insufficiency, and death.
This is called the incubation period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but it can vary from two to fourteen days.
97.5% of people who have symptoms do so within 11.5 days of infection. According to reports, not all infected people have symptoms.
The role of these asymptomatic carriers is not yet fully known; however, preliminary evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of infected people with no symptoms is currently unknown and is being studied, and the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported that 20 per cent of confirmed cases remained asymptomatic during hospitalization.
The National Health Commission of China began to include asymptomatic cases in daily cases on April 1, out of 166 infections that day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic when the test was performed.
Both the sputum and saliva can have large viral loads.
Speaking out loud releases more drops than when talking with a normal volume.
A study in Singapore found that not covering your mouth when coughing can cause droplets to travel 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is not usually airborne, the National Academy of Sciences has suggested that transmission via biological aerosols is possible and explained that air collectors in the hallway outside people's bedrooms gave positive viral RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can cause aerosolization of respiratory secretions and, consequently, air transmission.
While there are concerns about the possibility of it spreading through the stool, the risk is thought to be low. The virus is more contagious when people have symptoms; although propagation is possible before the onset of symptoms, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) explains that while it is not entirely clear how easily it spreads, a person generally infects two or three more people.
Specifically, the virus was detected for one day in the carton, up to three days in plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304), and up to four hours in products with 99% copper.
However, this varies depending on the humidity and temperature.
Soap and detergent are also effective if used correctly. Soap products degrade the virus’ protective lipid layer and deactivate it, as well as removing it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorohexidine glucanate (a surgical disinfectant), are less effective. In a Hong Kong study, saliva samples were taken on average two days after hospitalization.
In five out of six patients, the first sample had the highest viral load. In the case of the sixth patient, the highest viral load was observed on the second day of testing.
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 2 Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is a new novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, which was first isolated from three people with pneumonia connected to a group of acute respiratory disease cases in Wuhan.
All the features of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in coronaviruses of a related nature.
Outside of the human body, domestic soap kills the virus, as it reverts its protective bubble. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the organs most affected by COVID-19, because the virus enters host cells through the angiotensin I type 2 converting enzyme (ECA2), which is more abundant in the lungs' type II alveolar cells.
The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called "spice" (peplomer) to connect to the ECA2 and enter the host cell.
In 12% of infected people hospitalized in Wuhan, China, acute heart injury was identified, which is more common in severe disease.
Cardiovascular symptom rates are high, due to systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during the course of the disease, but acute myocardial injury may be related to the ECA2 receptors in the heart.
The ECA2 receptors have a high expression in the heart and participate in its functioning.
A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) was detected in ICU patients with COVID-19 virus infections and may be related to poor prognosis. In autopsies of people who died from COVID-19 pulmonos, diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) lymphomas were detected.
Although SARS-COV-2 has tropism for epithelial cells expressing respiratory ACE2, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, it was observed that pathogenic GM-CSF secretory T-lymphocytes are correlated with recruitment of IL-6 secretory monocytes and a serious lung pathology in COVID-19 patients.
In autopsies, lymphocyte infiltrates were also reported.
The WHO has published several test protocols to detect the disease.
The standard test method is the polymerase chain reaction with real-time reverse transcription (rRT-PCR).
The test is usually done on samples of the respiratory tract obtained by a nasopharyngeal hysopate; however, samples of nasal hysopates or sputum may also be used.
Usually, the results are available between a few hours or two days.
Blood tests may also be used, but two blood samples should be taken with two weeks difference and the results have very little immediate value.
Chinese scientists managed to isolate the coronavirus strain and published the genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world could independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect infection by the virus.
As of April 4, 2020, antibody tests (which can detect active infections and whether the person was infected in the past) were being developed, but were not widely used.
Experience in China with testing has shown that accuracy is only 60 to 70 percent.
The FDA in the United States approved the first immediate diagnostic test on March 21, 2020 for use at the end of that month. Diagnostic guidelines published by Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital suggested methods for detecting infections based on clinical characteristics and epidemiological risk.
Bilateral multilobular glass opacities with a peripheral, asymmetric and posterior distribution are common in the early stages of infection.
As the disease progresses, subpleural domain, pattern in disordered stone (lobulilar septal thickening with variable alveolar filling) and consolidation may appear.
Few data on microscopic lesions and the pathophysiology of COVID-19 are available.
The main pathological results of autopsies are as follows:
Macroscopy: pleuritis, pericarditis, pulmonary consolidation and pulmonary edema
Four types of severity of viral pneumonia can be observed:
mild pneumonia: pulmonary edema, pneumocyte hyperplasia, atypically large pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocyte infiltration and formation of giant cells with multiple nuclei
Severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudates.
ADHD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDRA) and severe hypoxemia.
Healing pneumonia: organization of exudate in alveolar cavities and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis
Blood: disseminated intravascular coagulation (IDC); leukoerythroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the chances of infection include staying at home, avoiding places with many people, washing your hands with soap and water often for at least 20 seconds, having good respiratory hygiene, and avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth without washing your hands.
The CDC recommends covering your mouth and nose with a scarf when coughing or sneezing and, if you don’t have scarves, use the inside of your elbow.
Appropriate hand hygiene is recommended after coughing or sneezing.
The CDC has recommended the use of cloth covers in public places, one of the reasons is to limit transmission by asymptomatic people. Social distancing strategies seek to reduce contact of people infected with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel and canceling public meetings.
Distance guidelines also indicate that people should maintain a distance of 6 feet (1.8 m).
There is no effective drug to prevent COVID-19. Since there is not expected to be a vaccine until 2021, as very soon, a key part to controlling COVID-19 is trying to prevent the epidemic peak, which is known as "flattening the curve".
The CDC also recommends washing hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, particularly after going to the bathroom or when the hands are visibly dirty, before eating and after snoring, coughing or sneezing.
They also recommend the use of an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that has a minimum of 60% alcohol, but only when water and soap are not available in a timely manner. For areas where hand sanitizers are not easy to obtain, WHO provides two formulations for local production.
In these formulations, the antimicrobial activity results from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help remove bacterial spores in alcohol; “it is not an active substance for hand antiseptics.”
Glycerol is added as a moisturizer.
Patients are provided supportive care, which may include rehydration, oxygen therapy, and treatment for other vital organs affected.
The CDC recommends that those suspected of having the virus wear a simple mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (OMEC) has been used to address the problem of respiratory insufficiency, but the benefits are still being analyzed.
To improve immunity, personal hygiene and a healthy lifestyle and diet have been recommended.
Supportive treatments can be useful for those who have mild symptoms at the initial stage of infection.The WHO and the National Health Commission of China have published recommendations for the care of people hospitalized with COVID-19.
Intensivists and pneumologists in the U.S. compiled the recommendations of several agencies in a free resource, the IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For the initial treatment of symptoms, some medical professionals recommend acetaminophen, rather than ibuprofen.
Precautions should be taken to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in health care settings when procedures that can generate aerosols, such as intubation or manual ventilation, are performed.
The CDC recommends health care professionals who care for people with COVID-19 to place the patient in an Air Infection Isolation Zone (AIIR), in addition to using standard precautions, contact precautions, and precautions to prevent air transmission.
Recommended equipments are EPP coat, mask, protective glasses and medical gloves. When available, respirators (rather than masks) are preferred.
N95 masks are approved for industrial environments, but the FDA authorized their use through an Urgent Use Authorization (USA).
They are designed to protect against particles that are in the air, such as dust, but efficacy against a specific biological agent that is not stipulated in the product indications is not guaranteed.
When masks are not available, the CDC recommends the use of protective eyelashes or, as a last resort, home masks.
Most COVID-19 cases are not serious enough to require mechanical ventilation or alternatives, but a percentage of cases are.
This type of respiratory support for hospitalized people with COVID-19-related respiratory failure is actively being studied and there is already some evidence that intubation can be avoided with a high-flow nasal cannula or positive bipressure in the respiratory tract.
It is not yet known whether either of these two provides the same benefit to people in critical condition.
Some doctors prefer to use invasive mechanical ventilation when available because this technique limits the propagation of aerosol particles compared to the high-flow nasal cannula. Severe cases occur mainly in older adults (those over 60 years and, in particular, those over 80 years old).
Many developed countries do not have enough beds per head in hospitals, limiting the healthcare system’s ability to handle the sudden increase in serious COVID-19 cases that require hospitalization.
A study in China found that 5% were admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical ventilation support, and 1.4% died.
In China, approximately 30% of people hospitalized with COVID-19 are finally transferred to the ICU.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex when a COVID-19 patient has acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDRA) and oxygenation is increasingly difficult.
Respirators are needed that have different modes of pressure control and PPTE to maximize the oxygen supply, while minimizing the risk of lung injury associated with the respirator and pneumothorax.
Older respirators may not have high PPTE.
Research into possible treatments began in January 2020 and several antiviral drugs are in clinical trials.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although the development of new drugs may take until 2021, several drugs that are being tested are already approved for other uses or are in advanced testing.
Antiviral medications can be tested in people with severe disease.
The WHO recommends volunteers to participate in efficacy and safety trials for possible treatments. The FDA has granted a temporary authorization to the plasma of convalescent as an experimental treatment in cases where a person’s life is at serious and immediate risk.
It has not been subjected to the necessary clinical studies to demonstrate whether it is safe and effective for a disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile application to deal with the outbreak of the disease.
Users must enter their name and identification number.
The application can detect "close contact" and thus a potential risk of infection by means of surveillance data.
Each user can also control the status of three other users.
If a possible risk is detected, the app not only recommends self-configuration, but also alerts local health officials. The analysis of the macrodata of cell phone information, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence are used to track and track people who are infected.
In March 2020, the Israeli government allowed security agencies to track the mobile phone data of people suspected of having coronavirus.
The measure was taken to strengthen the quarantine and protect those who can come into contact with infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared summary data on the location of the phones with the German federal government agency, Robert Koch Institute, in order to investigate and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia has implemented facial recognition technology to detect quarantine breaches.
Regional health commissioner Giulio Gallera said that mobile operators have informed him that “anyhow, 40% of people are still moving.”
The German government conducted a 48-hour weekend hackathon with more than 42,000 participants.
In addition, the President of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, made a worldwide request for creative solutions against the spread of the coronavirus.
People may feel anxious about quarantine, travel restrictions, and the side effects of treatment or fear the infection itself.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying, "The growing social isolation, loneliness, anxiety about health, stress and economic problems are a perfect storm for people's mental health and well-being."
The disease can follow a mild development with few or no symptoms, so it will look like other upper respiratory diseases, such as common colds.
Mild cases usually recover within two weeks, while severe or critical cases may take three to six weeks to do so.
Pregnant women may be at risk of getting a serious infection with the COVID-19 virus, according to data from other similar viruses, such as the SARG virus and SROM, but the COVID-19 data is insufficient. In some people, COVID-19 can affect the lungs and cause pneumonia.
In more serious cases, COVID-19 can progress rapidly to water respiratory distress syndrome (WASD) that causes respiratory failure, septic shock, and multiorganic insufficiency.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, clotting disorder, and heart, kidney, and liver damage.
The alteration of coagulation, specifically the increase in protombin time, has been reported in 6% of patients hospitalized with COVID-19; whereas the alteration of renal function is observed in 4% of this group.
Approximately 20-30% of people with CODIV-19 have elevated liver enzymes (aminotransferases).
According to the same report, the average time between the onset of symptoms and death was ten days, with five days of hospitalization.
However, for patients transferred to the ICU, an average time of seven days was between hospitalization and death.
In an initial case study, the median time from the onset of the first symptoms to death was 14 days, with a complete interval of 6 to 41 days.
In a study by the National Health Commission (NHC) of China, the mortality rate among men was 2.8% and among women was 1.7%.
Histopathological examinations of postmortem samples of the lungs show diffuse alveolar damage with exuded cell fibromyxoids in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic changes were observed in pneumocytes.
The image of the lungs resembled Acute Respiratory Difficulty Syndrome (SDRA).
In 11.8% of deaths reported by the National Health Commission of China, heart damage was due to elevated levels of troponin or cardiac arrest.
According to U.S. March data, 89% of hospitalized people had a pre-existing condition, and the availability of medical resources and socio-economic aspects of a region can also affect mortality.
Estimates of mortality from the condition vary due to these regional differences, but also due to methodological difficulties.
Insufficient counts of mild cases can make the mortality rate overestimated.
However, the fact that deaths are the result of cases contracted in the past may indicate that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to experience severe symptoms of COVID-19 and about 2.4 times more likely to need intensive care or die compared to non-smokers.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority found a 20-30% decrease in lung capacity in some people who recovered from the disease, and images of the lungs suggest organ damage.
This can also cause post-intensive care syndrome after recovery.
As of March 2020, it was unknown whether previous infections generated effective long-term immunity in people who recovered from the disease.
It seemed that immunity is possible, based on the behavior of other coronaviruses, but recovered cases of COVID-19 have been reported which subsequently gave positive to coronavirus.
These cases are believed to be a worsening of a persistent infection and not a re-infection.
This virus is considered to be natural and animal-derived, through an interspecific infection.
The actual origin is not known, but by December 2019, the spread of the infection was almost entirely due to human transmission.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, noted as the first date for the onset of symptoms as of December 1, 2019.
Official WHO publications reported that the first manifestation of the symptoms was on December 8, 2019.
In general, several measures are taken to quantify mortality.
These figures vary by region and over time, as well as being affected by the volume of tests, the quality of the health system, the treatment options, the time elapsed since the initial outbreak and the characteristics of the population, such as age, sex and overall health.
At the end of 2019, WHO assigned emergency CIE-10 disease codes U07.1 to deaths with laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection and U07.2 to deaths with a clinical or epidemiological diagnosis of COVID-19 amount.
Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the overall mortality rate is 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191) as of April 17, 2020.
The number varies by region. Other measures include the rate of fatality in diagnosed patients (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed people who die from a disease, and the rate of fatality in infected people, which reflects the percentage of infected people (with or without a diagnosis) who die from a disease.
These statistics do not depend on time and follow a specific population from infection to resolution of cases.
While not all infected people produce antibodies, the presence of these can provide information about how many people were infected.
In the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4600 inhabitants, 80 (1.7%) have already died.
In Gangelt, the disease spread during carnival festivals and affected the young, so there was a relatively low mortality, and it is possible that not all COVID-19 deaths have been classified as such.
Moreover, the German health system has not been surpassed.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of the population has antibodies, as determined by blood donors.
69 (0.004% of the population) have been confirmed to have died from COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and the mortality rate are different for both men and women.
Mortality is highest among men in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The greatest risk for men is for those in their 50s, and the gap between men and women narrows only at the age of 90.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 in men and 1.7 in women.
The exact reasons for this difference by sex are not known, but it could be due to genetic and behavioral factors.
Immunological differences based on sex, the lower number of women who smoke, and the fact that men have comorbid conditions, such as hypertension, at an earlier age may have contributed to the higher mortality rate in men.
In Europe, 57% of people infected were male and 72% of those killed by COVID-19 were male.
As of April 2020, the U.S. government does not track sex information in COVID-19 virus infections.
Research shows that viral diseases, such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS, affect men and women differently.
A higher percentage of health workers, particularly nursing staff, are women, and are more likely to be exposed to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on February 11, 2020 that the official name of the disease would be "COVID-19".
WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO refers to coronavirus, VI to virus, D to disease and 19 to the date the outbreak was discovered: December 31, 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid references to a specific geographical location (e.g., China), animal species or group of people, in accordance with international recommendations goes up denomination to prevent stigmatization. The virus that causes COVID-19 is called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The WHO also uses “the COVID-19 virus” and “the virus responsible for COVID-19” in public communications.
It is common for "coronavirus" to be used to refer to both the disease and the virus.
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, it was common to refer to the virus and the disease as "coronavirus" and "coronavirus of Wuhan".
In January 2020, WHO recommended 2019-nCov and respiratory disease water for 2019-nCoV as temporary names for the virus and disease, in line with the 2015 indication not to use locations in the name of viruses and diseases.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were issued on February 11, 2020.
Due to capacity constraints in standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers are printing health material, such as nasal swabs and ventilator parts.
For example, when an Italian hospital urgently needed the valve of a respirator and the supplier could not deliver it in the required time, a local emerging company reverse engineered and printed the 100 necessary valves overnight.
After the initial outbreak of COVID-19, conspiracy theories, false information and misinformation about the origin, scale, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease emerged and spread rapidly over the Internet.
It seems that humans can transmit the virus to some other animals.
The study found no evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks or chickens.
There are no medicines or vaccines approved to treat the disease.
Government organizations, academic groups and researchers from the sector are conducting international research on vaccines and medicines for COVID-19.
In March, the World Health Organization launched the "SOLIDARITY Trial" to assess the therapeutic effects of the four most promising existing antiviral compounds in terms of efficacy.
There is no vaccine, but several agencies are actively developing possible vaccines.
Previous work on SARS-CoV is being used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use the receptor ECA2 to enter human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are being investigated.
First, researchers seek to develop a complete virus vaccine.
The use of the virus, whether inactive or dead, aims to generate a rapid immune response of the human body to a new infection by the COVID-19 virus.
A second strategy, subunit vaccines, seeks to create a vaccine that sensitizes the immune system to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S protein that helps the virus get into the receptor ECA2.
A third strategy is nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, a new technique for creating vaccines).
Experimental vaccines from any of these strategies should be studied to determine their safety and effectiveness. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine with four volunteers in Seattle began.
The vaccine contains an innocuous copy of the genetic code of the virus that causes the disease. Antibody-based improvement has been suggested to be a potential challenge for development of SARS-COV-2 vaccines, but this is controversial.
As of April 2020, there are more than 300 active clinical trials.
Seven trials evaluated treatments already approved for malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
The re-adopted antiviral drugs make up most of Chinese research, including nine phase III trials on remdesivir in several countries and are due to report by the end of April.
In April 2020, a dynamic review of clinical developments on the vaccine and potential COVID-19 drugs was underway. Several antiviral drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 are being evaluated, including the following: remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine-combinant chloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lorinavir.
As of March 2020, there is evidence on the efficacy of remdesivir.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients treated with the compassionate use of remdesivir.
Phase III clinical trials are being conducted in the U.S., China and Italy. Chloroquine, which was previously used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020. The results obtained were preliminary.
However, there are applications for peer review for research.
The health authorities of Korea and China recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, although the Wuhan Institute of Virology recommends a daily dose of one gram, it notes that double that dose is very dangerous and could be lethal.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued an urgent use authorization for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of doctors treating COVID-19 patients. The 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines also includes the use of interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are needed to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Further in vivo studies of nitazoxanide have been recommended after determining that low concentrations inhibit SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that the initial primer of the S protein performed by the type 2 transmembrane serine-protease (TMPRSS2) by interception with the ECA2-Coceptor is essential for the entry of SARS-2.
Studies of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have important limitations that prevent the medical community from adopting these treatments without further studies. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and does not have a known function in the treatment of COVID-19.
The release of cytokines can be a complication of the last stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have properties that prevent the release of cytokines. The National Health Commission of China included tocilizumab in treatment guidelines after completing a small study.
It is in a non-randomized national phase II trial in Italy after observing positive results in people with severe disease.
Combined with a serum ferritin blood test to identify cytokine releases, it is expected to counter those effects, which are believed to be the cause of death of some infected people.
The FDA approved the interleukin-6 receptor antagonist based on past cases for the treatment of steroid-induced cytokine release syndrome induced by another cause, the treatment of T-CAR T lymphocytes, in 2017.
To date, there is no unrandomized controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
The transfer of purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune system of those who have recovered from COVID-19 to people who need them as a passive immunization method without vaccines is under investigation.
This strategy was tested with SRAG with inconclusive results.
Viral neutralization is the expected mechanism of action by which a passive treatment with antibodies can defend against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms are possible, such as antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity or phagocytosis.
Other forms of passive antibody treatment are being developed, for example, using manufactured monoclonal antibodies.
The production of convalescent serum, which consists of the liquid part of the blood of recovered patients and contains specific antibodies against this virus, could be increased to achieve a faster distribution.
Coronavirus Diseases, a group of closely related syndromes
