Professor Confesses He Killed His Girlfriend by Calling 911
Shannon Lamb, a university professor calling 911, told police that he shot his girlfriend with a gun and that the police should come home just a little shivering.
Lamb said his “sweet dog” was alive and probably upset, and that the dead woman’s family’s phones could be on the woman’s cell phone.
Police found Amy Prentiss's dead body at home and a handwritten note on a white notebook: "I'm so sorry, I wish I could bring everything back, I loved Amy so much, and she was the only woman who ever loved me," Lamb signed.
There is no evidence that Lamb, who gives two online classes for Delta State University in Cleveland, has already taken the 300-mile route to the school campus where he thinks his beloved history professor Ethan Scmidt was shot and killed by Lamb in front of his office.
Delta State University chief of police Lynn Buford said the gunshots were heard by university officials at 10:18 p.m.
Lamb's terrible 911 call was made shortly after, he said.
At the end of the day, another death occurred: Lamb committed suicide as the police approached him.
A day after the school shooting caused students and professors to hide behind locked doors, officials were still investigating what drove Lamb to do so.
In addition to investigators on both sides of the state, the details of the students and staff who knew him were drawn up by a talented but probably problematic teacher.
The students said they were waiting with four eyes to enter his class.
A police officer in Gautier, where Prentiss died, said Lamb had no criminal and legal records.
Schmidt even referred to Lamb in a book as one of the "wonderful people" he shared his academic life with.
Both taught at the Department of Social Sciences and History, where 17 faculty members were listed, and many students took lessons from both.
However, there were also signs that there were spiritual problems.
Speaking to students praising Lamb, Brandon Beavers said he was also a worried and tense person and appeared to be "like having a problem".
Another student, Mikel Sykes, told Lamb that he was struggling with stress at the end of the 2014-15 school year.
Lamb had previously asked for medical leave from Delta State University, stating that he had some health problems.
This year, he was only teaching two lessons from the internet.
The recent changes to the university's hiring policies could not guarantee that, despite Lamb's hard-working doctoral degree to earn, he was automatically a staffed faculty member.
University Dean William LaForge said he didn’t know there was a problem between Lamb and Schmidt, but that “Lamb had something obvious in mind.”
These are questions that Lamb can't answer anymore.
After the campus was cleared, police tracked Lamb's journey from Arkansas to Mississippi.
Washington County Attorney General Methel Johnson said his family committed suicide with a single 38-caliber gun in the backyard of a house about 1.5 km from his home in the Mississippi suburbs of Greenville before Lamb was arrested.
Lamb's car was found working on the highway.
Although it was not immediately clear why Lamb was going to this house, Johnson said that he believed that Lamb knew the people who lived in this house.
Lamb grew up in this area.
Lamb began working at the 3,500-student university of the city with a population of about 12,000 and was giving geography and education courses in 2009.
In the spring, he received his doctorate in education.
One of Lamb’s old friends described him as a smart, charismatic, and fun person.
When they met Carla Hairston, she said she was 15, while Lamb was 20.
Carla and her friends were in high school, and Lamb was a very nice person who tried to teach her how to play guitar for a few years.
At the time, he was a man who beat his heart fast.
Hairston, who is now 40 years old and lives in the Jackson suburb of Brandon, said to Lamb, "When he came, all the girls were gone."
Lamb and Prentiss had been together for some time.
Although Lamb said on 911, "I killed my wife," there's no official record of them getting married.
They had a dog named Lightning who lived with them in their brick houses on the banks of a river in Gautier.
The police said the dog was in good condition.
Prentiss' ex-husband, Shawn O'Steen, said they divorced 15 years ago, but that they have always been friends with Prentiss and now they have a 19-year-old daughter.
He also said that O'Steen's daughter was completely destroyed.
She and her mother were great friends.
O'Steen said she had never met Lamb but heard from her daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb and Prentiss met three years ago when Lamb and Abigail went on stage at a summer festival.
Then Lamb and Abigail played together on the general shows.
O'Steen said that she wrote her daughter's music herself and said.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked in various online companies.
Mike Shaffer, who works as a bartender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room near Gautier, said Lamb and Prentiss had seen the last few spectators after Lamb finished playing guitar and music on the night of September 5.
There was no sign of a problem.
He said they were a very happy couple.
Sometimes we cut off and lined up with each other.
They both had a great sense of humor.
Don Allan Mitchell, a professor of English at the same university, said that the murdered Professor Schmidt managed the first-class seminar program and was an expert on the history of Native Americans and the colony.
He was married and had three young children.
He graduated from Emporia State University in Kansas, and was also the president of a student solidarity group he founded.
On Tuesday night, about 900 people attended a candlestick ceremony at the Delta State University campus in Cleveland, including academics, university staff, students, and local visitors.
The college choir also attended the commemoration ceremony where she sang the songs "The Bright Morning Star" and "The Wonderful Glory" by Schmidt's wife Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt.
Classes continue on Wednesdays.
LaForge said, “We’re trying to bring back our students.”
The crisis is over.
It's time to wrap the wounds.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press writers Emily Wagster Pettus (Greenville, Mississippi) and Rebecca Santana (New Orleans) contributed to the news.
This text has been corrected to reflect the fact that the police have indicated that Lamb called 911 after he killed Schmidt, and that Lamb referred to Prentiss as "wife" on the 911 call, although there is no official evidence that the two were married.
Toys R Us Plans to Buy Less Holiday Season Item
Toys R Us said it would not hire as many holiday season members as it did last year, but the toy and baby products manufacturer said the company would provide more work opportunities for existing employees and seasonal workers.
The company said it plans to hire 40,000 people at stores and distribution centers across the country, with 45,000 during the 2014 holiday season.
Most of it will be part-time.
The company said interviews with candidates will begin this month and the number of staff will increase from October to December.
Even though there are more months to the holiday season, the holiday shopping season is approaching, and companies are preparing to equip their stores and hire temporary employees to help them with product sales, shipping and distribution.
Michael J. Fox made jokes about his "relationship" with Princess Diana
The gala of the film "Back to the Future" was a very important moment for Michael J. Fox.
It was also very important for personal reasons.
In the documentary Back in Time, which is about to enter the new vision, he said: “We were waiting for members of the Royal Family to come to the cinema, and suddenly I realized that the seat next to me was empty, and I realized that Princess Diana would sit next to me.
The film started, and I realized that dating the Princess of Wales was a fake stretch and stretching of my arms.
Back in Time is a documentary film that features interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson, and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and executive producer Steven Spielberg.
Back to the Future came into view for the first time 30 years ago.
Spielberg said: "This is the most exciting time travel film I've ever made."
In addition to the Back in Time VOD and DVD formats, it will also be shown in some select cinemas.
UN Chief Says There Is No Military Solution in Syria
Speaking about Russia’s growing military support for Syria, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said the Syrian problem, which has been going on for nearly five years, could not be solved “by military intervention” and that more weapons would only be more violence and suffering for millions of people.
The UN Secretary-General also invited all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to come together to find a political solution to the issue and to hold constructive talks.
Ban said at a press conference on Wednesday that the five permanent council members of the United Nations General Assembly, which will be held towards the end of the month, planned to meet with the foreign ministers of the United States, China, Russia, Britain and France.
He said he was deeply saddened by the split between Council members and the Syrian people that the regional forces “made the issue insoluble.”
Ban has invited five permanent members to join forces in the Syrian crisis, as in the Iran nuclear deal.
8 Poll Numbers That Show Donald Trump Is Serious
Some tried to label him as an adversarial.
The others made fun of him.
And some are supporting the internal explosion.
While some Republicans tried to pull Donald Trump down in polls, it (yet) didn’t work.
The latest 11 national polls showed him led by Donald Trump in double-digit numbers, and some are starting to seriously question the chances of the real estate emperor running for office.
Of course, it's early in the election.
None of this means that Trump can win the Republican nominee race.
Experts say Rick Perry's rise during these periods in 2011 caused the rise for Herman Cain, both of whom failed to win the nomination process in a single state.
And there are many reasons for him to be in trouble in the general election.
But outside groups such as Jeb Bush’s Super PAC group and the economic conservative Growth Club are realizing Trump’s enduring power and are starting to spend their dollars to overthrow him.
Here are some recent survey results showing whether or not the real estate emperor just came in and out of temporary:
Trump’s preferred rates have changed by 180 degrees.
A poll conducted at Monmouth University just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June showed that two out of ten Republicans had a positive view of the real estate emperor.
By mid-July, that was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52 percent.
Six out of ten Republicans now have a positive opinion on Donald Trump.
Three out of every 10 say they have a negative viewpoint.
And these numbers are seen high in the early stages.
Last week, an Iowa poll in Quinnipiac showed that 60 percent of Republicans there preferred Donald Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters may be pleased with Trump’s candidacy.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be “excited” or “satisfied” if Trump were to run for office.
Only two out of 10 people said they would “be sorry” if he became a candidate.
Only Ben Carson is creating the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (40 percent for Trump, who said they would be “enthusiastic” at 43 percent).
The other person closest to the fun?
Only 21 percent, Marco Rubio.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters say that if the institution’s favorite Jeb Bush is a candidate, they “will not be me” or “will regret.”
The majority of Republicans don’t see Trump’s stance as a problem.
While Donald Trump is criticized for his demonstrative language and humiliations, according to Monday’s ABC News/Washington Post polls, 52 percent of Republicans who asked questions believe the real estate emperor has the right mood to be president.
The same figure is true in Iowa where the country’s first party board will be held, where last week’s Quinnipac said 52 percent of Republicans thought he would have the personality to be a leader.
44% still believe they don’t have the personality to serve effectively, and according to ABC/Post, six out of 10 independents say their character doesn’t fit the White House.
Republicans are getting used to this idea.
When they put on the hats of political experts, Republican voters think Trump is serious.
According to a CNN/ORC poll last week, when asked who was the best candidate to win the GOP nomination, four out of every 10 people said Trump was the best.
It's an exchange since the end of July where four out of 10 people put their money into Jeb Bush.
Full disclosure: In the past, the crystal ballot of GOP voters was not very clear.
During that period, four out of 10 Republicans thought Rick Perry would be a candidate, in return only 28 percent chose Mitt Romney, who eventually ran for office.
It is still apparent that the majority of the GOP voters think Trump is smart about the election campaign.
Even if Republicans gather around another candidate, Trump is still defeating almost everyone.
Some experts point out that the scattered area can also contribute to Trump’s prominence, and it’s a fact that anti-Trump support has been scattered among more than a dozen candidates.
But a Monmouth University poll in early September shows that in the event of a possible head-to-head match between Trump and many Republican candidates, Trump receives the support of the majority every time.
He beat Carly Fiorina with 13 points, Marco Rubio with 14 points, Walker with 15 points, Jeb Bush with 19 points, and finally Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie with 33 points each.
Along with Ted Cruz.
Is it the only candidate who can win it?
In case of a possible loneliness, Ben Carson beats his businessman by 19 points.
The vast majority of Donald Trump’s supporters say they made their decisions.
A new CBS/NYT poll released Tuesday shows that more than half of voters who support Trump say they have locked their votes.
Clearly, a lot can happen to change that, and no one can say that they will really change their mind.
46 percent said they left the door open to change.
Trump’s biggest rival brain surgeon, Ben Carson, is still twice as close to voting for Trump, but voters who say they’re making their decisions are twice as close to voting for Trump.
Six-six Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
In a campaign speech two months ago, Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico "aggressive" at the beginning and center of his 2016 conversations, the issue of immigration has been.
Some think Trump’s overtalk will drive important Hispanic voters away from the Republican Party and harm re-branding efforts.
But according to a new ABC/Post poll on Monday, six out of 10 Republicans agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So as long as the issue of immigration remains on the agenda, Trump seems to remain on the agenda.
Anger at the government is rising to new heights.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are taking roughly half of the Republican votes because of their largely external circumstances.
In a new ABC/Post poll on Monday, six out of every 10 Republicans say they want someone from outside instead of someone with government experience.
And they're mad at Washington.
A Des Moines Register/Bloomberg poll conducted two weeks ago in Iowa showed that three out of four Republicans in Iowa were irritated by Republicans in Congress, 54 percent “unsatisfied” and 21 percent “extremely angry.”
Prime Minister Jeremy Corbyn to step down for the first time
From the day he was elected, Mr. Corbyn was eagerly awaited to appear on the Prime Minister's Questions agenda.
Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of the New Labour Party, will appear in Prime Minister’s Questions for the first time since David Cameron.
Mr. Corbyn will ask six questions shortly after noon, and his performance seems to be closely examined by the media and Labour MPs.
In the weekly show, he called for "less theatre and more reality".
He also said he could skip some of his sessions, leaving it to his colleagues.
This meeting will be Mr. Corbyn’s first parliamentary test, appointing the shadow cabinet and following his speech at the TUC’s annual congress on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the silence of the Labour Party leader during the national march reading on Tuesday to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the British War has been criticized by some Tory MPs and in the newspapers in the forefront of headline news.
Mr. Corbyn's decision to accompany me to the national march drew attention.
A spokesperson speaking on behalf of Mr. Corbyn said he stood in “a revered silence” and appreciated “the heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England.”
But Owen Smith, one of Mr. Corbyn's shadow cabinet members, told the BBC's News Night Two program that he would recommend to the Labour Party leader a national march "independent" of his belief in the abolition of the monarchy.
Mr Corbyn declined to serve on the top team of nearly a dozen shadow ministers due to differences in the economy, defense, and foreign relations, while at least one in six of the parliamentary party supported him as a leader.
BBC political reporter Robin Brant said political differences within the Labour Party were also beginning to "close up" and that these were issues of Mr. Corbyn's assignment to the position in the European Union and the government's application of the upper limit on aid.
Mr. Corbyn said at the TUC conference that the Labour Party offered new changes to completely lift the upper limit.
Hours later, Shadow Work and Retirement Minister Mr Smith said the party was opposed to lowering the government’s upper limit of just <0xC2><0xA3>26,000 to <0xC2><0xA3>23,000, and was “very open” about it.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth Labour Party leader David Cameron will meet at the Grandmother's Chamber of Commerce from the date he is the Conservative Party leader.
The Labour Party leader promised a different approach to politics and said he received “public source” and more than 30,000 recommendations to ask Mr. Cameron.
He told the Islington North MP that the Q&A program was very front-running and would focus on poverty, inequality and the challenges faced by young people instead of making a nagging exchange of words with "advancing answers."
Mr. Corbyn said that while he was away, for example, when Mr. Cameron was traveling abroad, the Prime Minister would represent him on the agenda of the Shadow Trade Minister Angela Eagle.
From time to time, he even suggested that other colleagues should go to this forum, and he also said that he appealed to Speaker John Bercow of the House of Commons to address the issue.
When he became the leader in 2005, Mr. Cameron often expressed to the Prime Minister that he wanted to move away from politics in the “Puppet Game” style associated with the Questions program, but a few years later admitted that he had failed in this regard.
Since its first publication in 1990, the Prime Minister's Questions program has been used as a basic measurement point to measure leaders' decision-making skills, their dominance in the House of Representatives, and their positions in the House of Commons, as opposed to the fact that some critics have said that this is a caricatured and reformed.
'Joburg shot': homeless young people get photography training
Johannesburg city centre is a difficult place for homeless people.
But a group of old street children have found a way to gain a new talent and make their way through.
I was filmed in Joburg, a non-profit studio that taught homeless young people to take pictures of their neighborhoods and make a living from it.
He went to meet one of the first graduates of the BBC News project.

The pound is rising with the acceleration of wage increases in the UK
While there was a rapid rise in the sterling following data showing the rise in fees in the UK, the FTSE 100 index also rose following an offer to buy for SABMiller.
UK premiums excluding premiums increased by 2.9% from the same period of the previous year between May and July.
This rate, which represents the fastest increase since 2009, is also seen as one of the leading indicators for possible interest rate increases.
The sterling rose by more than 1% against the US dollar to $1,5505 and by 0.84% against the euro to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.3730.
The FTSE 100 Index rose by 1.49% to 6,229.21 points.
The company that most notices this increase was SABMiller, which recorded a 20% increase with its attractive purchase offer from its rival EU InBev.
This offer will bring together the two largest beer companies in the world, and well-known brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch will meet under the same roof.
Burberry shares rose 0.9% as a result of positive profit news from rival luxury retail group Richemont.
Richemont’s current sales figures also showed that sales in China, one of the key markets for Burberry, are starting to rise again.
Mining giant Glencore's shares rose 5% after announcing it had earned $2.5 billion from its allotted share sale under its debt-cutting strategy.
The shares of the packaging and paper group Mondi were among the most valuable shares with a loss of 4.3% after Goldman Sachs' proposal for the company was reduced to "Sat."
JD Sports' share rose 3.1 per cent after it announced that the company's six-month pre-tax profit increased by <0xC2><0xA3>46.6 million by 83 per cent.
JD Sports boss says higher salaries could be detrimental to expansion
JD Sports Chairman Peter Cowgill said the higher minimum wage for workers in the UK could mean “more spending power in the pockets of potential consumers.”
However, he said that this spending power would not be able to surpass the costs of high-level employees in his company.
He added that the costs will affect JD Sports’ expansion plans and this could mean less extra work.
Metcash launches public campaign to fight Aldi invasion
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA stores in South Australia and Western Australia from an Aldi attack.
Market wholesaler Metcash has launched a popular campaign to defend retail stores in South Australia and Western Australia against the $700 million Aldi invasion.
Aldi is preparing to open its first of two distribution centers and 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year, while Metcash and IGA supermarkets are working to strengthen their relationship with local food suppliers, marking and marking the start of their relationship with local food suppliers.
IGA retailers and suppliers also contribute with brands such as Dunsborough-based ice cream maker Simmo, which offers a taste test at IGA stores, and with store owners selling discounted South Australian football league tickets to loyal customers.
Metcash, a wholesaler of food, beverages and equipment, is expected to provide more details on its defense strategy as it celebrates its annual investor strategy day on September 29.
The risk is large, since Metcash’s IGA store footprint in South Australia and Western Australia accounts for nearly 30%, and produces higher profit margins than Metcash’s IGA network in the eastern states.
Store owners in South Australia and Western Australia have a negatively narrow view, and IGA retailers enjoy a much stronger market share than they get in NSW, Victoria, and Queensland; compared to their eastern states, they are 30% more in GA and 24% more in BA.
But analysts like Morgan Stanley believe Aldi will capture about 5 percent of the market market within 12 months of opening its first stores in these two states, with sales being taken over by existing players, but generally unreliable retailers.
In a report published this week, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath predicted that IGA retailers would lose $360 million in a year and Metcash would lose $250 million by the end of 2016.
This is based on Aldi’s prediction that next year it will open 25 stores in GA and 30 stores in BA and earn $500 million and $600 million in sales in each market.
Mr. Kierath said the loss of food and market sales and Metcash’s high fixed-cost base volumes could cost Metcash about $13 million in interest and pre-tax earnings.
At the same time, despite recent Roy Morgan research revealing that IGA customers are the most loyal customers, Metcash is losing its market share in the eastern states, primarily Aldi and Coles.
According to Morgan Stanley, Metcash’s food and market sales will decline by 4.1 per cent in 2016, by 3.8 per cent in 2017, and by 2.1 per cent in 2018, reducing its market share from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3 per cent in 2020.
Last week, Magellan Financial Group founder and chief financial officer Hamish Douglass said at a business dinner in Melbourne Metcash could “most likely be erased within ten years.”
Metcash refused to respond to Mr. Douglass' comments.
But it turns out a Metcash board member contacted Mr. Douglass last week.
IGA’s market share has declined from 18% to 14% since 2010, and Metcash’s earnings from food and market business supplying around 1200 IGA retailers have fallen by 43% since 2012, with sales and margins falling as the company’s leverage ratio fell.
But the wholesaler resists, at Coles and Woolworths each week, investing more than $150 million a year in shelf prices matching hundreds of products, helping IGA retailers renovate their stores, adding faster-growing fresh foods and a better private label to the market.
Metcash board chairman Ian Morrice says price matching and store refurbishment programs are starting to come to fruition and the wholesaler is expected to return to basic profit growth for the first time in four years in 2017.
Thanasi Kokkinakis is backed by Tennis Australia President Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves more praise than criticism for his behavior.
Tennis Australia president Steve Healy said he was on the sidelines of the last storm, which was damaged by an accident around his friend Nick Kyrgios, and deserves a lot of praise from the critics.
Kokkinakis, a young member of the talented duo normally referred to as the "Special K's", found himself under the spotlights that were not welcome due to Kyrgios's crushing of Stan Wawrinka in a hundred frenzied ways at the Montreal Masters.
In a tough elimination game played in Cincinnati this afternoon, Kokkinakis and rival Ryan Harrison were separated twice by file judge Harrison, stating, "Wawrinka, it's over Kyrgios, and I have to go over that kid."
In the last US Open, Kokkinakis, seen breaking his rocket to potentially miss the pleasure of Richard Gasquet, was loyally defended by Healy.
The young player is currently competing with Sam Groth in Glasgow in the Davis Cup semi-finals behind Bernard Tomic for the second singles role against Britain.
Healy said, "What I feel quite enthusiastically is that I don't think Thanasi is a little bit into debate."
When he closed the front in the U.S., and when he lost, he broke his rocket, but he was not the first player to break the rocket because he was disappointed with himself, and I know Thanasi is well aware that he shouldn’t be proud of it either.
But in fact, in the United States, Harrison and others have managed themselves pretty well under extremely provocative conditions and I think he deserves a lot of praise.
He has a great team around him, a great family, and I think he's gone a little too far.
Despite being 19 years old, he is extremely mature, works very hard and adapts to the team, has no problems with other players, is met with great respect in the dressing room, performs difficult exercises, is extremely balanced and mature young and deserves to be judged on his own terms.
Healy also supported Kyrgios' decision to welcome significant partnership; from Friday onwards, he began explaining that what was right for everyone was "mutually deciding" but supporting Canberran to return to the team as a long-term leader.
"First of all, we want the team to focus entirely on the match, not on the fights around [Kyrgios]," Healy said.
And to me, as people like Nick, Federer and Murray have pointed out, the child rose up very quickly, growing up in front of the public and making some terrible mistakes and deserves all the criticisms he received, but we are trying to understand the consequences of his actions, because he thinks that his mind is the best, and he tries to understand the consequences of his actions.
European migrant crisis: Hungary declared a state of emergency, closed borders and ignored migrants
Hungary closed its southern border with Serbia on Tuesday, declaring an emergency in order to cut off the flow of migrants, and ignored those attempting to enter the country by illegal means.
Hundreds of migrants were accumulating in the neutral region, creating chaos at the border, and Serbian authorities moved in anger.
Migrants fleeing violence in their own countries set up tents along the roadside between the checkpoints of the two countries for an indefinite period and settled in these tents.
But his anger was growing more and more.
As a police helicopter passed from above, the migrants shouted "Open the Border!" and insulted the Hungarian agile force police.
Some of them rejected the food and water they had given them.
The Serbian Foreign Minister said that while the flow of migrants from Macedonia and Greece continues, it was “unacceptable” for Hungary to send migrants back.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, not to see damage from this process.
In the coming days, talks will need to be held with Brussels and other countries," said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
This tension on the Hungarian-Serbian border came a day after the 28-nation bloc failed to agree on a common immigration policy at a meeting in Brussels.
The ministers agreed to share responsibility for the 40,000 migrants who attacked Greece and Italy, and hoped that by the end of next month or year there would be an agreement between them to accept 120,000 more migrants from Hungary to EU countries.
German Prime Minister Angela Merkel and Austria on Tuesday called for an EU summit to be held next week to discuss the migrant crisis the continent is facing.
Hungary, on the other hand, is not very hopeful that Brussels or its neighbours will take any concrete steps on the issue.
The emergency call in the two southern regions on Tuesday gave officials broad powers to deal with the crisis, including shutting down roads and accelerating refugee-related cases.
On the other hand, Hungary’s Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said he planned to draw a barbed wire along the border with Romania to stop the flow of migrants from Serbia after the country pulled into the Serbian border.
CBS News reporter Charlie D'Agata announced that even inmates in prisons were employed in wire-drawing operations between Hungary and Serbia.
Over the past few months, Hungary has become a major narrow gateway and crossing point for European Union countries, and most of these migrants are refugees fleeing wars in Syria and other Middle Eastern countries.
Prime Minister Viktor Orban is insistent on the view that most of the incoming migrants are "economic migrants" who are trying to move to Europe for a better life rather than innocent people who come to flee the war - this is entirely the view of other EU countries, including Germany.
Laws in Hungary, which enter into force at midnight, impose even more severe penalties on human smugglers, besides making it a crime to cross the four-metre (13-foot) long barbed wire drawn to the Serbian border.
In a statement to reporters in the southern city of Szeged, government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs said: “The Hungarian government is declaring a state of emergency due to the situation caused by mass immigration.”
One thing is very clear: it is a crime to cross the border illegally.
While the convocation of soldiers still needs to be approved by the legislature, Associated Press reporters in the region have been saying that they have seen soldiers with dogs and vehicles equipped with heavy weapons here for days.
Orban's national security adviser Gyorgy Bakondi said authorities had crossed the border with 45 people trying to cross the border and arrested 15 people who had entered the country.
They've gone through damage to wire rods, and now they're under police custody, and under new laws, they're accused of committing crime.
Authorities are quickly repairing the wires.
Hungarian authorities also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning, using a train wagon covered with barbed wires to close one of the crossings.
For the Hungarians to carry out the operations, the click-click of the people, along with putting into service a small metal container, was also reflected in the main border crossing point near Roszke.
If 20 people were able to enter, thousands were left outside.
Another group of migrants said they would not accept food and water aid until they were allowed into Hungary, closing the highway connecting Serbia and Hungary.
2016 election: Hillary Clinton’s lead over Bernie Sanders has halved in national election
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to lead the two-digit Democratic race for the national nominee, but you, Bernie Sanders, grow up to her.
Clinton is currently in second place with Sanders taking 47% (down from 58%) of the Democratic vote with 27% (up from 17%).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he is in the presidential race, receives 15 percent of the Democratic vote.
Within five months of the start of the main races, most Democrats said it was too early to decide which candidate to support.
But Clinton’s supporters have more solid ideas about their own choices than any other candidate.
Clinton has been losing ground between a number of demographics since last month’s CBS News, and Sanders, on the other hand, has some gains.
Clinton is at the forefront of a big difference between women and moderates, but that difference closes.
Support between the men has fallen significantly and Sanders is following him only 5 points behind.
Clinton’s Democratic constituency under the age of 50 has evaporated and he and Sanders are now on par.
But Clinton is at the forefront of older voters.
Last month, Clinton was ahead of Sander with two-digit ladders between the Liberals, but now Sanders is five points ahead of the group.
At the national level, about half of the Democratic voters say they will passionately support Clinton if the party is a candidate.
While a quarter supports it under certain conditions, another 15% cut will support it only if it is a candidate.
A six-percent cut doesn't support Clinton.
Perhaps in a way that is not surprising, Clinton’s existing supporters tend to support him with passion in particular.
The views among those who don’t support Clinton right now are even more confusing – only a quarter can support him with passion.
While 48 percent of Democrats say they will support Clinton with passion, fewer Republicans are talking about running for president Donald Trump (35 percent).
When asked open-ended questions about why Clinton wanted her to be a candidate, Clinton’s supporters had the right first-line answers (16 percent), the idea that it’s now time to elect a female president (13 percent) and the best candidate for a job (10 percent).
Clinton’s supporters are also expressing their relationship with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
Compromise in problems and eligibility are also among the specified criteria.
As a vice president with potential for the presidency, 57 percent of Democratic voters may want to see him in the race, but a third of the union doesn’t think so.
When Democrats are asked what their second-placed election for the party is, Biden is top.
More than half of Clinton’s supporters say Biden could be a second choice, with a clear margin.
If Biden does not enter the Democratic Candidate race, Hillary Clinton’s lead over Sanders is increasing; her 20-point lead in a race where Biden is not in the Biden race is rising to 30 points.
Fifty-five percent of Democrats consider Clinton to be the best candidate to win the general election; however, that figure dropped from 78 percent last month to that level.
Although Biden was second in this regard, he was far behind, but the percentage of those who saw him as the most selective candidate increased.
Again, when asked what is the most important thing in a candidate, Democratic voters put issues ahead of election.
No Democratic candidate or candidate in the past month seems to be inadmissible as a candidate for these primary voters.
Democratic candidates or candidates perform well in some of the main characteristics among the primary voters of their own party.
The majority see Clinton, Sanders, and Biden as being honest and trustworthy, as well as having strong leadership qualities.
While Biden is in the top three in terms of honesty, Clinton is strong in leadership.
According to 30 percent of Democratic voters, Clinton is not honest and reliable, while about half of that is the same for Sanders (15 percent), 27 percent have no idea about it.
Democratic voters also generally see Clinton, Sanders, and Biden in line with their own ideology.
On all counts, a quarter of Democrats have no idea about Sanders.
While questions about the use of his personal email address and server during the State Department’s duties continue, most Democrats find it satisfactory to comment on the issue and say that their views on him are unaffected.
But this is a different story in the general American public.
Half of Americans are no longer satisfied with his explanations, while only one-third find it satisfactory.
The public's views on this matter were divided in March, shortly after the problem was taken under the lens.
Most U.S. email campaigns say they don’t affect their general views on Clinton, while negative views on the other hand have increased by 36%.
These are generally Republicans, and more than six out of 10 people say their views on Clinton have been distorted.
While Clinton is seen as being honest and trustworthy by his own party’s voters, it is still a problem among registered voters in general: only 32% see it as honest and trustworthy, down eight points from last month, and 15 points since May.
Sixty-two percent of registered voters do not find it honest and reliable.
At the same time, 55 percent of registered voters across the country do not find Trump to be honest and trustworthy.
However, both Clinton and Trump are getting good grades on leadership.
Among the six candidates who participated in the test, Biden, Carson and Bush received the best scores on honesty.
More than that, Sanders is honest most of the time, but as with Carson, most people have no idea about him.
351 The margin of error in samples obtained from the Democratic electorate is 6%.
Ben Carson is right behind Donald Trump in national polls
According to the latest CBS News/New York Times poll, Ben Carson is running close behind Donald Trump
The new survey shows that about half of the two candidates matched the game, and that the other candidates are not very likely.
Republican voters across the country continue to support Trump in large numbers, with 23% of support in the latest CBS poll before the Fox News debate last month climbing to 27% in the poll announced Tuesday.
But support for Carson rose from 6% to 23% in the same period.
The survey also found that Carson was doing pretty well in demographic groups, and that the support among Republican voters for college graduates was much higher than Trump.
The rest, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, fell to just 2% of last month’s 10 percent support with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio ranked third with 6%.
With 376 people selected from Republican voters, the latest survey had a 6% margin of error, and the survey was conducted in September.
The latest CNN/ORC poll published last week showed Carson’s Republican support, rising to 19 percent, just behind Trump’s 32 percent support.
The latest poll by ABC News/Washington Post also seriously put Trump ahead of Carson.
Trump, who faced the rise of Carson last week, apologised for questioning Carson Trump’s belief, but continued to randomly shake his retired brain surgeon.
At a campaign stop in Iowa, Trump said on Saturday, “We need energy.”
Five Brotherhood Members Accused of Death of First-Class Student at Baruch College
During a fraternity admission ceremony in the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania, murder cases against five people were opened almost two years after the death of a college student.
New York City Baruch College Pi Delta Psi brothers and sisters attacked Chun "Michael" Deng harshly in an opening ceremony in September 2013 and according to police, he contributed to his death by delaying him to take him to the hospital.
Authorities reported that his eyes were tied, that he was stuck on the back of a backpack full of 30 freeze sand, and that he was constantly clutched as he tried to walk towards the target in a frozen field.
Mr. Deng complained that over time his head hurts and then he loses consciousness.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi fraternity did not call 911 after Deng fell in love, and police said they waited an hour before taking him to the hospital.
But according to police commissioner Chris Wagner, who spoke at the press conference, they changed Deng's clothes, searched for his symptoms on Google, and asked for advice by contacting the national president of the fraternity, Andy Meng.
Commissioner Wagner said at this point, the members began to store their personal belongings and put the good of the brotherhood ahead of Michael Deng.
He couldn't be revived and lost his life the next morning.
According to an autopsy report, Deng was traumatized by repeated blows to the head, body, and hip with a non-sharp body.
Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Deng’s family, said many families were destroyed as a result of the Brotherhood’s acceptance ceremonies, losing at least one student’s life in acceptance ceremonies every year since 1970.
Brotherhoods and members should be held accountable for this, and this step is very important by the authorities.
The Monroe Town Grand Jury recommended that the first five members be sued for third-degree murder.
Thirty-two fraternity members, including Mr. Meng, will also be charged with the admission ceremony and criminal charges.
Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday, we will hold them accountable if there is an organization that has officially or unofficially confirmed it, not just the people involved in the work.
Baruch College banned fraternity and national fraternity ended its relationship with this local unit.
What happens when the Fed raises interest rates?
With the rise of interest rates, the bull market is booming and the bond income rises, and the economy is declining.
We know that.
What we do not know is how long all this will take and how long it will continue.
History, especially in the economy, provides very little information about timing.
The decline has been around for as long as 86 months, as it has been about 11 months after the first interest rate increase.
The U.S. Central Bank has often been instrumental in the Fed’s aggressiveness to raise interest rates, albeit not continuously, in the response of economic and financial assets.
That’s why U.S. central bank officials are insisting that investors should focus on how long the normalization process will take, not when interest rates start to rise.
It's a fact that there are various variables.
But as a result, market participants may think that the increase in interest rates is exaggerated.
In a note to customers, Julian Jessop, Global Chief Economist of Capital Economics, said: “The Fed’s first interest rate increase since the global financial crisis is inevitable to be interpreted by some as marking the end of the ‘low money’ period.”
On the contrary, we do not expect U.S. interest rates to slowly return to normal, but it appears that most of the levels that are still low are afraid of seismic shocks.
Still, we can't say they won't have any effect.
Based on past trends, the response that some areas of the economy can give is as follows:
As has been seen in the market in recent months, waiting for interest rates to rise can destabilize things for a while.
When the interest rate is increased, the effect is not so obvious.
In a new study of what will happen after the Fed’s increases, Deutsche Bank analysts said, “It is seen that the first 12-24 months after the increase in interest rates are a trend of stalling, which may reflect a stalemate in monetary policy.”
According to an up-to-date analysis shared by Bob Doll of Nuveen Asset Management analysts in Barron's, the market has more often recorded sharp increases in the last 35 years, and after around 14 percent, it has turned around 250 days to a normal increase of 2 percent, and after that, it has risen by 500 percent to a normal increase of 2 percent, and at the end of the line of 6 percent.
Deutsche said the effect on stocks is more pronounced in the next stages of the interest rate increase cycle and the yield is facing extinction.
Regressions are a fact of economic life, but interest increases also help them.
The Fed is currently facing some situations that have not existed before and that will accelerate the downturn.
Pay attention to the fact that the gross domestic product is at its lowest level to date for the Fed interest rate increase.
According to Deutsche Bank, the increase in the 118 percent rate since 1950 has fallen to less than four and a half times from nominal year to year by gross domestic product.
Although the second quarter of 2015 was at 3.6 percent, the Atlanta Fed expects very few to see the situation lasting, with the third quarter at 1.5 percent.
According to Deutsche, raising interest rates in such a sensitive economic environment could be risky and could lead to the question of “will it be different this time”.
The attention of market participants awaiting the Fed’s interest rate hike for a year this week at a meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which will end on Thursday.
While most strategists believe that the economist FOMC can approve an increase in this meeting, long-term trading points to only a 25 percent probability.
“In the research we have done since 1950, all of the growth cycles that have taken place to the present day are within a super-climbing trend cycle and reach peaks rapidly after recovery begins,” the report said.
On the contrary, this was an unprecedented slow recovery from the worst recession that occurred in an exemplary period.
The current cycle has been the longest cycle the Fed has been waiting for since the last recession – the longest cycle on record has been 35 months, and the cycle we are in is still in the 74th month.
The market comes steady with the expectation of interest growth, and it has become unstable, and the order resembles that of a nebula.
The real difference is that when the Fed changes the course of policy, the effect is seen faster than it is felt on bonds.
When the first increase/decrease of the cycle comes, bond yields do not immediately change direction.
At the end of the interest rate increase cycle, bond yields fall instantly,” Deutsche said.
According to Charles Schwab’s strategy experts, interest increases will flatten the trend by approximating returns between longer and shorter-term bonds.
Kathy Jones, from Schwab analysts who said that high yields in the analysis usually perform better in an environment like this, said, but "we are careful to achieve that yield."
Interestingly, Jones thinks that markets are already adapting to the Fed’s policy expectations.
“In addition to the decline in dollar strength and inflation expectations, there are various signals that the market is regulated according to stricter monetary policy,” he wrote.
Short-term interest rates are rising, yield curves are right, loan spreads have widened, and fluctuations have increased – all features that will be seen in the market when the Fed tightens policy.
From a broader perspective, companies doing most of their business in the U.S. will gain from rising interest rates and making local products more attractive.
The situation of multi-national companies that are heavily indebted will be worse, as rising dollar products will make the global market more expensive and their debts will be even more expensive.
In a report prepared by Goldman Sachs analysts for its customers, "History shows that 'quality' stocks may experience performance declines at the start of such an increase."
Companies with strong balance sheets exceeded those with weak balance sheets by an average of 5 per cent following increases in rates in 1994, 1999 and 2004.
Companies with high capital and low-wage stocks also outperformed low-quality competitors (4%) by an average of 3%.
Debt will be a big deal.
According to Goldman, companies that owe a high rate of fluctuation are likely to suffer the most damage.
Aside from pure stock market play, consumers are also expected to benefit from rising dollars.
While there are differing views on how fast the experts will hold, savers can also profit from high earnings.
Andrew Bingham said a copy of BBC Radio 3 Classic FM
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham urges station to 'disappear'
He argued that the radio became increasingly indistinguishable from commercial competitors
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards and accused him of stabbing the British Awards.
Damien Collins has accused The Voice of being unoriginal.
A forward-thinking deputy pressured the broadcaster to reveal his difference to other commercial stations, saying BBC Radio 3 was increasingly "converting" to Classic FM.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also said that the radio channel, which provides public service to BBC bosses, is "disagreing" and is still different from its commercial rivals.
"I don't like to use this feature, but Radio 3 has "disconnected", it's still turning into Classic FM," he said.
In addition, the first BBC Music Awards, held in December last year, was targeted.
The BBC Music Awards, launched last year, is another version of the British Awards.
Bingham said, “So if you’re trying to do something different, these are the first two examples that come to mind, while you’re copying the same thing that’s already on the market.”
The BBC's general manager rejected the push, arguing that BBC Radio 3 is clearly ahead of its commercial competitors in terms of live music or public education.
If I'm learning from Radio 3, I'm not going anywhere else to learn anything about classical music.
And this is a commitment to live music, and making music is incomparable with nothing else.
He also said that I think Radio 3’s effort to discover and promote new music is also very important.
Alan Davey, director of BBC Radio 3, said earlier this year that the radio needed to work harder to reach more audiences because the British were less educated in classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only component of the ballot at the meeting of the Committee on Culture, Media and Sport, as the BBC pushed into the queue of commercial competitors.
Tory Damien Collins de O Ses - the music talent contest that the BBC has received <0xC2><0xA3>22 million from the Dutch production company Talpa Media - has been sold to O Ses.
Can’t you see why the program makes so much noise, because it’s not original and there’s no special difference?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC1 Show, which was a jury of Paloma Faith and Boy George, was made "in a BBC style".
He said he wanted the organization to "find a hit from its own blood" before doing the entertainment program again.
Unfortunately, he did not accept the idea of further blocking the production of the O Voice program or spending the amount spent on the license fee in other formats in the future.
Is Black Friday the reason why internet sales experienced the lowest increase in history in August?
In the first three months of 2015, internet sales increased by seven percent.
It was the lowest growth since last month’s record-breaking record began in 2000.
Three years ago, when mobile devices began to be used in shopping, there was an explosion in internet sales.
Experts say that Black Friday in November may be the reason for the split in spending
Online shopping has been booming for more than a decade, turning Britain’s busiest shopping streets into a ghost town.
In the first three months of 2015, according to figures showing only a seven percent increase in internet sales, experts say that internet sales are showing ever-increasing signs of weakening.
Total spending in August was only a five percent increase from last year, and the record-breaking record has seen its lowest growth since 2000.
After figures showing that internet sales only increased by seven per cent in the first three months of 2015, experts report that internet sales are showing ever-increasing signs of weakening.
IMRG sales index editor Andy Mulcahy told the Guardian, “If you look at the growth levels of the previous years and especially 2000, you actually see that everything is back to normal over time.”
Consumers began using their mobile phones three years ago to buy the product, adding that they recorded a huge increase in internet sales.
This meant that more people were able to shop even while lying on the couch.
But right now it's going horizontal, you can see the (growth) landing.
The Black Friday phenomenon, a concept taken from America, is described as one of the reasons for the slowdown in sales.
Experts say that consumers may be waiting for this event, which took place on the last Friday of November, to buy something.
At last year’s event, many companies’ websites collapsed when they attacked companies’ websites to get five times more cheap products than the previous year.
Experts say Black Friday's shoppers, who show shoppers are fighting for a discount, may have been "currently" upset.
A study published by the British Retailers’ Association found that every <0xC2><0xA3>5 spent on shopping was spent on buying a product from the internet.
One-third of some products, such as TVs and washing machines, are now purchased from online stores.
In addition, more than a quarter of people buy their clothes and shoes from the Internet instead of luxury and deluxe shopping streets.
With bin Laden’s family being found guilty, Muslims succeed in their final journey to the deaths in a crane accident in Mecca
After the first funerals in Mecca, the bodies of 29 people who lost their lives were moved on the streets by Muslims.
The construction giant Saudi Binladin group was responsible for the crane accident in Saudi Arabia
The Ministry of Health reported that a total of 394 people were injured after the collapse of the crane.
Hundreds of Muslims came together to carry the remains of 29 people who lost their lives when a crutch fell to Mescid-i Haram.
Mostly the crowd within the whites closed their first graves to their last trips to the Muaysim Cemetery in Mecca.
A few days ago, the mourning crowd went through the sacred place where a cradle of the mosque had been demolished and the fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade had been smashed over the crusaders.
At the same time, when 394 people were injured, the remains of the dead were brought to be buried after the owner of the construction holding of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia held the Binladin family responsible.
The nails of 29 crusaders who lost their lives when a crane fell to Mescid-i Haram were carried on their shoulders along the way.
When the crane fell among the dead, he had four fathers, November Akram, from the Bolton area of Manchester, who was on the first hurdle.
Mr. Akram had come to Mescid-i Haram with his mother and father at the beginning of the annual Hajj worship.
Saudi leaders announced that the Hajj will continue with the participation of thousands of hajj who are on their way to Mecca.
In a statement released today, King Salman said Binladin Holding should not leave the crane arm open when it is out of use.
In the Arabic version of the farm prepared by the state-run Saudi Press Agency, the sole party to be charged with the incident was Binladin Group.
The English service of the news agency did not go through this detail, but the company said it was banned from entering the country.
At the beginning of the week, Salman vowed to find the cause of the overthrow of Mescid-i-Haram, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims came to Haqq at the end of the month.
Binladin’s group did not make any comments about the crane being turned, and their representatives were not allowed to comment.
The Royal Farm accused the group of not taking current security measures and not cooperating with meteorological authorities.
The Mescid-i Haram in Mecca is surrounded by dozens of cranes, most of which are maintained by the Binladin group.
Binladin's family has been in close relationships with Saudi Arabia's management family for decades, and most of the construction projects are named after him.
Al Qaeda's last leader, Osama bin Laden, was also the son of a pervert whose family had refused to adopt.
The accident occurred just a few days before millions flowed into Hajj land, where every adult Muslim must visit at least once in his life, during a time of severe wind and rain.
Authorities said 158 people were still undergoing treatment in the hospital.
Authorities ordered the families of the deceased and survivors of permanent disability to pay compensation of 1 million riyals (174,000 pounds).
The other injured will receive half of that amount.
B&Q boss says that Eastern European craftsmen working cheaply behind this trend
Veronique Laury Says Britons Hire More and More Masters
Behind this increase lies the number of East European master craftsmen
As a result, another 200 new Screwfix stores targeting craftsmen are opening
Kingfisher also closes 60 B&Q outlets across the country
Written by Rupert Steiner, Daily Mail City Reporter
The British are said to have started hiring skilled East European craftsmen to do their homework instead of leaving their hammers and paint brushes in their hands.
If you are skilled at using hammers or wall painting, that means you are in the minority these days.
Because, according to the boss of the company behind B&Q, the British are increasingly employing more and more masters to do DIY work in their homes.
Veronique Laury, the new general manager of Kingfisher’s home improvement chain, said that behind this trend is a huge increase in the number of skilled East European craftsmen offering low-priced services.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open another 200 new Screwfix stores for craftsmen while closing 60 B&Q outlets.
Ms. Laury said she wanted more women to be hired at B&Q stores because eight out of the ten purchase decisions in the store were given by women.
Most of the staff are men right now.
She said that there is a need to meet the growing demographic trends seen in the single women’s home, which has improved more homes than in the past.
Ms. Laury said: “Most of the time, men still work in our stores.
We need to strike more balance.
Basically, half of our customers are women and 80% of the decisions about the products purchased are made by women.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process.
One of the five women at the top of the FTSE100 index, Ms. Laury has restructured the top team to make up an equal number of male and female directors.
Kingfisher, including the general manager and chief financial officer, is almost alone in this field, with exactly 50 percent of its team consisting of women.
Ms. Laury said: “This was a conscious decision – diversity is an important issue here.
It wasn't hard to find good women to get into the board.
After installing the cost of the closed stores, Kingfisher announced a decline in both monthly profits and sales.
As a result of the trend, Screwfix and B&Q owner Kingfisher will open 200 new stores
U.S. Central Bank to Decide on Interest Rate Increase for the Fed
The two-day meetings of the U.S. Central Bank on Wednesday and Thursday are being monitored by the entire world, and a decision is expected to be made on whether interest rates will be raised ten years later.
In a Reuters poll, more than half of 80 economists said last week that the Fed would enforce this decision, but now they think it would suspend the decision and keep rates between 0 and 0.25 percent.
It’s been seven years since the Fed’s rates dropped to zero today, and this is a historic event.
Angel Ubide, senior researcher at the Peterson International Institute of Economics, said: “For the first time, we will see a large central bank emerging from zero and begin the process of normalizing interest rates.”
The U.S. economy performs relatively well, and trillions of dollars are added to the balance sheet in the process of reviving the economy, creating little inflation.
But the Fed cannot ignore the less promising global picture.
He warned the markets against an increase, but there are also signs that they believe that the situation will not allow such an increase.
The decision will be announced on Thursday at 8 p.m.
Delta left an apology letter in file for the murder at the State University
According to officials on Tuesday, Shannon Lamb left a note saying he was "sorry" for the first murder before he shot his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning, and a note saying he wished "if I could get it right" in the early hours of the same day.
The Mississippi Gautier police call 911 at 10:00 a.m. Lamb, an instructor in geography and social sciences education at Delta State University.
He said he said he shot and killed someone on Monday.
Lamb said he had to send police to the officer on the phone.
“I killed my wife last night,” Lamb said, adding that there was “a sweet dog at home that didn’t hurt anyone” and that he was probably sorry.
Even though the police asked him his name, he didn't say his name.
Lamb didn't say anything about the murder.
When the police went to the scene, the body of 41-year-old Amy Prentiss and a note written by 45-year-old Lamb said: "I'm so sorry, I wish I could have time back.
I loved Amy so much, and she was the only one who loved me to this day.
Lamb, after writing this note, went to the Delta State 300 miles away by car and killed history professor Ethan Schmidt; after which the police committed suicide.
University Dean William LaForge said he didn't know there was a problem between Lamb and Schmidt, but "Lamb was obviously having some things in mind."
Despite reports released on Monday that Lamb believed his girlfriend Prentiss had an emotional relationship with Schmidt, authorities said on Tuesday they had "no information or evidence" on her hands that she was a "love triangle."
Shawn O'Steen, who has been married to Prentiss for about seven years, describes Prentiss as "a good man."
The couple divorced 15 years ago, but they had a long relationship.
O'Steen said she had a 19-year-old daughter with Prentiss and that she was "broken".
O'Steen also stated that Prentiss and her daughter were "definitely each other's best friends".
According to Linsday Knowless, whom the Sun Herald described as a close friend of Parentiss, he was working online from Prentiss's home.
Knowles said Prentiss, who owns a hunting dog called Lightning, has been with Lamb for about three years.
Knowles said, “He always loved to help others.”
Police said on Monday Lamb's call to his relatives that he said "I'm not going to jail."
That same night, police approached him closely on Highway 1 near Greenville, pulling Lamb aside, jumping on foot, running towards the forest area, and shooting himself with a gun.
According to a CV published on the university’s website, Lamb received a PhD from Delta State University in spring 2015.
Stars who lost their old charm
The actor (left) who was seen with his son Redmond (right) spent quite a stressful few years.
In 2001, she struggled with leukemia, and in 2009, her life friend Farrah Fawcett died of cancer.
The actor, who is said to have been fighting drugs, was arrested in 2008 for possession of drugs.
All of this, of course, hurt him a lot.
Luke Shaw has been out of Manchester United for months with a double break.
Luke Shaw's right leg suffered two fractures in the match when Manchester United defeated PSV Eindhoven in the Champions League.
The event, which suffocates the defender, leaves him at least six months away from the pitches, while Louis van Gaal Shaw remains hopeful that he will return to the fields this season.
The fracture was caused by the imprudent entry of 20-year-old Shaw into the matchground in the 15th minute of the match with Héctor Moreno.
For nine minutes, the field was intercepted and then oxygen was needed before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "The pair broke off their leg and are in the hospital right now."
Maybe today or a day later it will be shipped out and operated on in Manchester.
It's a terrible situation - a young man who moved to Manchester at the age of 18 - to have a hard time first, then have a great game, and then let that happen.
He had an oxygen mask on his face when he was in the dressing room.
She was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a break from the double floor, that means at least six months and that means you won't be playing in the group stage.
I hope he can play again this season.
Moreno was lucky enough to get rid of the red card and the penalty shot.
Judge Nicola Rizzoli did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal argued that the Italian authorities made a mistake.
When I say this is a penalty and a red card, you can judge yourself.
It was a bad fight with two legs.
Shaw tweeted: "Thank you all for your messages, words are not enough to tell me how disappointed I am, my way of recovery is starting now, I will come back with strength."
Related: Luke Shaw's disability in Manchester United's PSV defeat is shocking
The Champions League, which will be held in France next July, will be morale for the recovery of the English defense player.
Phillip Cocu, chief technical officer of PSV, said: "It's a very bad injury."
If such an injury happens to any of the players, everyone will regret it.
The intention of our players is never to hurt their opponents.
Moreno suffered a broken leg at the 2014 World Cup when he played for Van Gaal against the Netherlands in Mexico.
Cocu finds this situation very difficult because his intention was never to hurt his opponent, and after hearing that it was a very bad break, he said, it was never good at all.
I couldn't see that moment in my head.
All I could see was the ball going in a different direction, as if Moreno had touched him, but I couldn't see Luke's theft.
In a statement to SBS 6, Moreno said: "I know what a feeling it is. I know how difficult such a thing can be.
I feel so bad about it, and I'm so sorry.
Andrés Guardado was taken to the hospital as a result of his fight with Chris Smalling.
David Cameron, of course, knows The Lorax better than that.
This is something every parent learns in a short time: When your child loves a book, you know that it won’t take much time for you to learn it almost immediately.
Looks like if you're not David Cameron.
When asked what his favorite children's book was by a holiday programmer provider for childcare, Prime Minister chose The Lorax, Dr. Seuss' 1971 environmental story.
In a message posted on the company's website, Cameron continues: "Because this book, which is a comical, impressive, creative and powerful message, contains an image or message that we always skip in it, I want to read to my children."
So far everything was going pretty well, until Cameron wrote something about the content of the book, but actually summarized the new character and details to inflate the content of the original storyline and the 2012 film version of the book, where he added the new character and details.
A child named Ted in Thneed-Ville, the city of Thneed-Ville, where all nature is gone, even the air is meta, wants to fulfill her dream of seeing a real tree in order to win the heart of the girl Audrey in her dreams.
If that doesn't seem suspicious enough to you, it's very similar to the short summary text of The Lora in the Internet Film Archive with one aspect of the text discussed by Cameron, which begins with the following: "In the guise of Auyen, in the guise of all things, in the guise of a meta, in the name of the city of Thneed, in the walls where the air is a meta."
According to the claims of his work as a manly parent, Cameron, despite the fact that the local environment of an unnamed young boy, who also gave his name to the book, is a stalk called Lorax, shriveled and ignorant of the objections of the creature, who is a native, ignorant of the fact that he is a "speaking in the name of the trees."
Most likely, such a weak public relations job has been handed over to an order-slave, who also seems to have read The Lorax 20 times less than a child.
A spokeswoman for the presidency said the text was thought to have come from Cameron’s election office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was provided by Cameron's staff, but did not comment on it.
Adam Lyth was clearly at risk of being kidnapped by England, but I'm still in trouble.
Playing with Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task but I don't think there's a replay of the 3-0 Test series defeats last time after seeing the English team selected for the tour.
And yet, I'm not giving up on the possibility of a relocation victory.
Alastair Cook’s team may be more inexperienced than it was three years ago, but there are well-turned players on the line and the collective gameplay is also strong; these don’t heal the wounds of 2012, only provide a bit of youthful optimism.
In the bulk game, Moeen Ali develops as a game-turner, and Fair Rashid represents an attack option even if the quality of the Trial level is not known.
Related: Adam Lyth left the UK Trial Team and was replaced by Alex Hales
The decision to remove Adam Lyth is difficult for me to analyze as head coach in Yorkshire.
The Seven Trials were against two good attacks under difficult conditions, and the simple but inevitable fact is that cricketers are judged according to the outcome.
For example, there was no question mark about Joe Root, it remained in the event of the announcement because – as I said before – the players were their best choices.
After a few fifty counts, Lyth could see her career extended, but she set her own destiny.
If he works more for Yorkshire, I hope he'll get another chance.
England head coach Trevor Bayliss praised the player’s attitude even though he didn’t show his best performance, which did not surprise me; he was a team man first and foremost.
It is difficult to answer the question of how long it will take for a Test shooter to score.
Lyth - like his predecessor Sam Robson - took seven tackles, Nick Compton on the other hand took nine.
Only Compton got the chance to win the match.
The only regret you can feel for Jonathan Trott may be that England went to the Caribbean first – while Lyth’s form was at its peak – but this wasted opportunity is now in the past.
Alex Hales is coming and I think he's a high-level shooter.
He was an X-factor cricketer, and we saw that at the beginning of this season, when he scored 236 against us on the Trent Bridge field, in Yorkshire.
It should at least be available for the same opportunity as before, but that depends, of course, on the formation of a team in the United Arab Emirates.
Moeen’s idea of Cook making an opening shot with Cook so that he could get the extra game spinner while holding the four quicks worked out, and I’m not against it.
I don’t understand why a shooter can’t shoot here, and this left-hander has already shown how good he is as a cricketer.
Moeen might not have done his job for the city of Worcestershire, but he saw a number three for them, and it didn't make much difference either.
My former teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 tries in the first drop before starting his 2001 outing.
He picked up the three-hundred series immediately and did not look back.
Zafar Ansari comes to the team as a backup game revolver and surprised me as an impressive young man in the limited conversations I had with him.
People can see their raw stats – 31 averages in the stroke and 35 averages in the total – and think it’s a detour but there aren’t too many game spinners that raise their hands and player choices have been made since they were young.
He'll learn a lot on this tour.
Away from the team, England seems to have made a few clever additions to their coaching team.
The appointment of Sri Lankan striker Mahela Jayawardene as an advisor for the Test matches could be a wise move.
He is one of the most beloved men of the game; he will bring with him a full experience acquired in every circumstance and against all attacks.
Paul Collingwood is coming for the white ball of the round and gives both the energy and the gameplay a merciless series.
I’ve always thought that he was born for the international cricket world, whether he’s a player or a coach, and he has an understanding that can be guided like Mahela.
Sometimes new sounds in the dressing room, even if previously said messages, can bring a novelty to the team.
Colly's teammate from Durham, Ben Stokes, is resting for a one-day game, Root was given a similar break against Australia, and I have no problem with that.
While not everyone agrees, plans, coaches, and players are not made by those who choose.
And you should remember that like the players, their work depends on the results.
Decisions like this can never be made easily.
Brexit camp could win if its economy is stagnant by 2017
David Cameron's half-cooked renegotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU is getting worse every day, and this is getting worse with Jeremy's "Yes or No?" remarks about Corbyn's election to the Labour Party leadership or the TUC's bidding for Europe on Tuesday.
Aliens have Corbyns and Nigel Farages.
Recently, a European diplomat friend of mine has been tired of the kind of crises in the EU that some member states have not entirely caused themselves, most of which they do not want, and Britain has only self-conceiting divisive privileges and temporary treaty changes.
The TUC had a decision in its annual meeting in Brighton that it would not want them if it harmed social protection.
We might even call it Dave and George's own agenda.
The Prime Minister and the Chancellor say that they are taking pictures of themselves in foreign capitals, attending summits or bilateral meetings, in front of the famous monuments there, and that they are gathering allies for reform.
It's all about me.
When Berlin said “Don’t leave us alone with France,” my European friend, who wanted a British outcast inside the EU tent, said that the increasingly short-sighted ministers and authorities in some capitals no longer care about whether we stay.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally who has been in power for 10 years and wants to step down from power, as in Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14 years) and Kohl (16 years ago), before things get worse.
Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande faces re-election or a change of power in France in 2017.
He's a left-handed force.
Soon a right-wing nationalist government in Poland and a left-wing government in Spain will come to power.
The selfie Britons, who need to use their energy to prevent Scotland from leaving the UK, are unlikely to make an effort by these countries because they don’t want it either because most of them have secessionist tendencies.
So some of those ministers, like the Scottish National Party, may plan to speed up the Brexit process by making deliberate statements that will not benefit this situation during the UK’s 2017 referendum campaign, my friend says.
"There would be no renegotiation" and "Britain has achieved nothing that would benefit from the renegotiation."
Europeans know from their previous experience how exploitative, oligarchic press barons of Fleet Street were, as they were not, in Tony Benn’s time, but they were the inspiration for the 1975 referendum that approved our initiative in 1973 at a rate of two to one.
In the early 1990s, the Brussels reporter Boris Johnson, who announced his name as "EU flat bananas", recalls as follows:
By the way, all his nonsense, Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were.
These included tax scoundrels, foreigners listening to illegal phones, and so-called outsiders who owned most of our big newspapers.
Tony Blair was basically thinking the same things about them, and he realized that when a gorilla was stuck in a cage, he had to distract him by giving him a banana so he wouldn’t eat at lunch and tea.
In fact, Miliband was also Blair’s opponent of Cameron’s brilliant referendum idea, since Blair had agreed on the principle of an EU constitution, which was repealed in 2005 by French and Dutch voters who gave him an exit card.
The press never forgave him about it.
But on Monday in Westminster, which has my back friendly – I told him he has no time left to lose to me – Jeremy Corbyn, Neil Kinnock, who is now a mistake, seems to be in danger of re-emerging Murdoch's boycott strategy like the 80s.
While it will take time, he needs to develop a consistent strategy to be in touch with Andrew Marr, who left the BBC seat on Sunday, not with me but with the media.
I am expressing Corbyn's official position in Europe in a generous way.
He says he wants us to stay in a reformed EU.
Most of the people who are left out of Ukip’s hostile tendencies and conservative Little Britain’s ardent supporters say yes to that.
That's what Hilary Benn, who's a Benn but not a Bennite, said this week on radio and television, as he naively forced himself to accept that it was a bad idea for Corbyn to name John McDonnell as shadow chancellor.
This reminded me of his father’s struggle for disloyalty to his colleagues in the workers’ cabinet in the 1970s, his failure to move forward, and his loss of office in the cabinet.
Hilary's fight was more appealing.
But with "Benn's statement - to fight to stay "in all conditions" was the same as what McDonnell said, nor did JC tell his Lords MPs at a special meeting on Monday night.
Given the fact that it touches me, Corbyn continues to maintain the importance of message discipline in the 7/24 television age, no matter what the detail, the illustrious image Corbyn is trying to convey, and in the social media, which is a bed of paranoia and betrayal.
As McDonnell said, it makes sense to challenge Europe, which ensures that Cameron gets the support of the Labour Party in the referendum.
That's what Simon Jenkins thinks.
But the transitions that are consistent with the Bennite siege economy and anti-capitalist past about the EU membership of McDonnell and Corbyn are no longer a specific issue among the left-wing opponents, who are only the cornerstones of the educational cycle of narcissism of small differences.
As with the transition on NATO – Tom Watson, determined that the JC won’t campaign to leave – foreign diplomats will have to try to take a look at it for their masters in their countries.
Why should Paris or Berlin lose political capital on the privileges to Britain, where they all have dubious constituents?
As I was told at the opening of the British Impact Security Forum on Monday, the U.S. is already quite disappointed by the British’s weak minimum performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, despite the cost-saving Conservative Party government in power.
Experts Criticize UK Public Health E-Cigarette Research
Researchers at a 12-person meeting of people connected to the tobacco industry, a government-funded agency, said e-cigarettes were 95% less harmful than smoking.
Experts writing in the British Journal of Medicine (BMJ) joined Lancet in criticising the evidence used in the UK Public Health (PHE) e-cigarette report.
PHE published its report last month, which it described as a "detailed examination of the evidence" as a "turn point".
But some researchers questioned the robustness of the data and drew attention to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
Last month's headline in Lancet's medical journal targeted the "extraordinarily rotten foundation" based on PHE's main conclusion.
Two other researchers, who wrote in the BMJ, questioned whether the claims were “built on a rock or on a rock.”
Martin McKee, professor of public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: “The basic principle of public health is that policies are based on evidence of efficacy.”
They said the public’s claims that PHE is “about 95% less harmful than e-cigarette smoking” would be expected to be based on a detailed review of the evidence and modeling.
In fact, this comes from a 12-person meeting that gathered to develop a very critical decision analysis (MCDA) model to create a synthesis of their views on the harms of various nicotine-containing products; the results of the meeting were summarized in a research paper.
McKee and Capewell said that one of the sponsors of the meeting, the CEO, was a company called EuroSwiss Health, which was previously reported to have received funding from British American Tobacco for an independent research.
He also said in a sustainability report that the BAT also approved the public health promotion document.
They also added that one of the 12 people at the meeting reported receiving funds from an e-cigarette maker, but that it was not previously reported to have received funds from Philip Morris International.
Panel members were not informed about how they were selected, but among these were some known giants of e-cigarettes, which some reported in the article as an industry fund.
Some other people present at the meeting are not recognized for their expertise in tobacco control.
The person responsible for tobacco at the PHE also attended the meeting.
McKee and Capewell wrote that the research paper the group wrote admitted that "in an ethical manner" "according to many criteria, there is a lack of concrete evidence about the harms of most products."
However, none of these links or restrictions are discussed in the PHE report.
Mckee and Capewell said that the allegations that e-cigarettes are a switch to smoking for children or non-smokers were too early.
Prof Kevin Fenton, Director of Health and Welfare at PHE, said the allegations at the UN have been answered in advance.
“E-cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking,” he said.
One of two people with a lifetime cigarette addiction dies from this addiction.
All the evidence points to the fact that the health risks caused by e-cigarettes are small compared to that of e-cigarettes, but we should continue to examine their long-term effects.
PHE has a clear duty: to inform the public, at a time when there is a lot of confusion about their harm, when compared to tobacco, about what the evidence shows and doesn’t show.
Nearly 80,000 people die a year from a cigarette-related illness, and smoking costs the NHS <0xC2><0xA3>2 billion a year.
We carry out our national responsibility by clearly exposing the available evidence – although e-cigarettes are not risk-free – to the extent that only a small part of the damage caused by smoking.
Previous Channel 4 boss says the BBC should leave EastEnders
Previous Channel 4 president Luke Johnson said the BBC should stop broadcasting programs such as EastEnders and The Voice, and that advertisers would be able to "give their right arms" for hit programs such as Albert Square series.
Johnson said the license fee should only be used to make types of programs that are not made by other British publishers.
He criticized the BBC for putting public service programs, which are likely to be watched by a smaller group of viewers, on channels such as BBC4, against its competitors' highest-rated programs at valuable intervals.
Tony Hall, CEO of the BBC, after saying the organization wanted to work more with other organizations, Johnson said in his time on Channel 4 that this had been unsuccessful for six years to establish a connection with the BBC.
Johnson told the House of Lords Communications Committee during a questioning about the future of the BBC, “I am struggling with the idea of the BBC ordering and broadcasting programs that can be clearly shown by unsubmissible competitors.”
If you continue to apply the license fee that I’m not sure is a good idea in the medium or long term, it should be reduced to programs that at least the output didn’t do or didn’t order from others.
They’re releasing The Voice in the primetime range because they want to provide as much support as possible in the future.
The main idea here is based on the idea that no one else will publish, which is ridiculous and clearly ridiculous.
Johnson said: “I don’t understand why programs that can be funded without help need to be funded with a reduced tax rate.
The Voice is one and EastEnders is the other, and it’s actually done within the company.
To be honest, the other channels give their right arms for this.
I'm trying to see what public service broadcasts are like.
I don't think this will ever ruin the BBC.
Johnson, a series of entrepreneurs who ran Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, accused the BBC of pursuing the ratings "for the dedication of the people who work here and for seeing this approach as the best way to guarantee long-term support."
The comments on the BBC's most popular programs echo the comments of former Sky administrator Tony Ball, who used the MacTaggart class in Edinburgh in 2003 to offer the BBC to sell their programs such as EastEnders.
Johnson said that the BBC's more appropriate public service programs went to BBC4 and could not be measured by the audience here, but that they met the tax exemption and showed that they were doing <0xC2><0xA3>4 billion in license fees to continue their religious duties.
They're putting them in gaps that no one will ever see.
Regarding the license fee, Johnson told the committee: “I invite you to find a more regressive system in terms of those who benefit from it.
Of course you all think, we all think, <0xC2><0xA3>150 a year is a great value, but I wonder why people don't watch too much BBC because <0xC2><0xA3>150 is too big for people with too much money.
At the same time, David Elstein, the previous Sky and Channel 5 administrator who provided evidence to the committee on Tuesday, said the BBC should revise its Reithian mission to "inform, educate and entertain".
Some of the BBC's output is now officially classified as education - that's 1% of the TV output and 0.1% of the radio - and public service broadcasts in Australia and Canada should be in the forefront of this and should be "informed, illuminated" and changed.
About the partnerships, Elstein said the BBC needed to do something about the Proms that were only shown on TV and collaborate with the ad broadcasters to ensure that they were all watched online, the BBC said.
‘Sonogenetics’ allows brain cells to be controlled by sound waves
The video shows how the wirewolves change direction when they are shot with sound vibrations.
Scientists have raised werewolves with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by sound wave bursts.
Small-threaded wolves change direction as soon as they are hit with sound vibrations that people can't hear.
The vibrations are triggered by switching on the genetically modified motor nerve cells to carry the coil channels that respond to sound beyond waves.
Related: Researchers are reading and writing brain activity with light
Researchers said wolves have proven the power of a new procedure called Sonogenetics, so ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain, heart and muscle cells outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that one day this procedure could replace the stimulation of the deep-brain stimulation, an interventional procedure that gives electrical vibrations into people’s brains to treat symptoms of Parkinson’s disease.
The yarn wolves usually don’t respond beyond sound, but Chalasani found they react when surrounded by a fluid containing microscopic bubbles.
The bubbles found amplify the waves beyond the sound and thus allow the werewolves to pass through.
The amplified sound beyond waves influences the structures found in the membranes of some werewolf cells and called TRP-4 ion channels.
According to a report published in Nature Communications, sound waves allow these ion channels to open and activate the cells they are connected to.
To create yarn-controlled werewolves beyond the sound, Chalasani genetically altered werewolves to allow some motor neurons to carry TRP-4 ion channels.
When it applied sound beyond to the altered creatures, the sound waves were amplified by micro-bubbles and transmitted into the werewolves, and there the altered motor neurons operated.
This procedure has similarities to optogenetics, an optogenetic tool that allows scientists to operate and shut down neurons with light vibrations.
But Chalasani says that sonogenesis may have some advantages over this technique.
Unlike light that needs to be sent to the desired point in the brain through an optical fiber, low-frequency ultrasound waves can pass unhinderedly through the tissue and thus be sent into the brain via the skull.
Chalasani said: “We believe that using gene therapy and a curative virus, human neurons targeted in the clinical setting for certain neurological treatments can be temporarily made sensitive to over-audio signals.”
He also added that other applications can be concentrated on muscle cells and insulin-inducing cells.

Advertisements Disgrace the UK’s arms trade
Watch the video of the International Anti-Weapon Fair.
Terrible killer drones!
The pranks that broke his ankle!
Part-sized bombs!
And electric shock couples that cause severe pain but leave no trace!
Produced for the International Af Organization, the British government’s ExCel Center in the London Stock Exchange is a thin sound and cartoon film designed to highlight the desire to sell weapons to oppressive regimes through the ExCel Defense and Security Equipment International.

However, a different campaign continues with posters on bus stops and subway trains and requires a double look.
On one, using the London Metro fonts and its brand, the DLR line turns into a tank saying, “Important announcement, will you travel in the DLR between September 15-18?”
This September, a bunch of arms dealers will attack the DLR... asking customers to help stop this weapons fair.
300 posters from artists exhibiting artwork at Bansky's Museum of Mali Designs in Dismaland.
A collective called the Private Patrol Group helped distribute the "Ad Field Strike Packages" using <0xC2><0xA3>6 and claiming that "about one-third of the bus stop advertising areas on the planet have access to it."
Transport for London was not pleased with this poster "vandalism".
One of the advertisements was created by a group of Private Patrols.
According to Malim Designs curator and Essex University faculty member Gavin Grindon, artists are becoming more questionable every day and looking for ways to move political affairs to the masses outside the galleries.
Many artists are working with activists in protest movements, and they are beginning to realize that their arts need to come into the real world in order to have an impact on society.
Another anti-weapon trade poster also stands in front of people traveling on the subway.
The International Af Organization’s video was watched over 100,000 times in 24 hours via Facebook, and was created by the freelance advertising agency VCCP, and created by the voice artist with the graphic designer for free.
Matt Lever, creative director of VCCP, was very surprised by the silence of the gun fairs over advertisements – with empty space on the ExCel calendar – and thought, “Let’s offer them a campaign they’re trying to escape from.”
They played with the idea of a more realistic, ingenious corporate advertising but "decorated it with bright colors and animation, it became more noticeable."
Tom Davies, of the Organization of the United Nations, said: “They have helped us a lot to build concerns about the sale of illegal torture equipment in the country.”
What we need now is to prevent the British government from illegally selling torture equipment in front of our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art at the gun fair comes from the ExCeL inside, where exhibitors sell fantastic cover products.
In a press release, Saab indicated the U.S. military's order to "throw the AT4CS RS from the ground".
It has “a unique warhead that strikes a major blow through armor and targets.”
Whatever he's doing, it won't be nice.
Eight Golden Rules for Living in Student Homes
An uninteresting 19-year-old has been relocating to student homes for 11 years and I still believe in fairies and moral relativity, but now I remember the grinning smiles I make—and countless lengthy complaints about others.
Most of what I've learned can be distilled into eight golden rules.
Moving around in the country can look from nervous disorder to completely terrifying.
The seductiveness of greed: where it belongs to people, where it hasn’t lost the year, where it insists on Corbyn and why you “obviously don’t love or hate Marmite because really guys that’s just yeast extract HAHAHAHAH I’ll be in my room.”
Take a breath.
And let others get one too - ask questions and show relevance.
It will guide this conversation and help you distinguish what you like from the people you don’t talk to, even if your lashes are burning and they’re a fire extinguisher.
Leave some room for people.
People’s rooms often turn into receptions for drinks, a cinema nightclub, and public places of rest, but these are also places where people wear and set up their underwear.
Related: Don’t even think about starting a relationship with a university
Introverts are being treated badly in college.
Your room may be an incubator, but many home corridors develop a culture of inter-room hangouts and are open to lively, social and lifelong friendships.
This could be hell for someone who is trying to store energy.
Nothing in culture will allow you to say, “I like you and I want our friendship to continue, but I need you to go a little bit so I can put the energy I spend in contact with you in place.”
Try to feel that a friend is tired of socializing and maybe text instead of knocking on the door.
When it comes to knocking on the door, do it.
A friend in the student’s home had made a policy as if he had been invited inside if the door was not locked.
He's seen a lot of things.
Don't make friends by cooking.
Since you started college at the peaks of the food contest madness, it's less strange to introduce yourself to people playing the doors with a plate of brownie and less of the 1950s "welcome to our restaurant, I've cooked something for you, now I'll be asking you personal questions."
It’s a great way to make friends by offering homemade offers to people.
Your homemates will feel compelled to talk and perhaps they will associate your face with a sweet surprise.
Clearly, this is about being your master chef.
A well-mixed ball ball is a dough, sugar and oil that will cause people to do the matching tricks when you knock on the door.
Stealing food is a common crime in student homes.
Obviously, it's a robbery to crawl someone's chicken but to steal a few drops of milk for your tea?
Check the owner of the milk twice.
He'll probably tell you to take care of yourself even if he's swimming inside.
It's very disturbing to steal someone's stuff, and I understand you - but try to deal with it more maturely than my fellow countryman. He put a liquid soap on his milk to punish the thief.
She's in prison now.
Do not make noise in a way that prevents people from sleeping or studying.
It doesn’t just mean being a decent person, but because you’re the units in the glass houses.
One of the girls in my hallway told me to press the neighbor on the side and cut the drums off because it's 3:00 p.m. and she's her morning exam.
His responses were even more open.
When they finally shut down at 5 a.m., the girl kindly let them sleep for two hours before going to her three-hour exam by opening her own music and locking the door.
Wouldn't it be very romantic for your future wife to move in the same corridor as you?
On the contrary, wouldn't it be so strange to have to misunderstand a friend in the hallway and think she's your future wife, hang up, get out and see her every day, and watch your comrades get taken prisoner?
Of course this is voluntary, but if your hot corridor neighbor is definitely not your future spouse, at least speak with a little bit and recommend common sense.
When you realize that someone has left their keys inside without locking the door in a joyful moment, know that the line between the joke and the abuse of someone is thinner than you think.
A good joke is fun, but it will take time to come back.
You can teach someone a valuable and fun lesson about safety by storing their belongings—but never contaminate someone’s room with shampoo and toothpaste.
Lock your doors and put your keys in the freezer in a glass of water, but do not glue your items to the ceiling more than twice.
President of the House of Commons of immigrants to the Netherlands
Arib, who received the highest vote in the fourth round of the election held yesterday, became the first migrant-origin assembly president of the Netherlands.
Arib, who is also a Fascist citizen, will assume this role until 2017."
Arib has been a member of parliament since 1998, but was not elected to the presidency in 2012.
A Surprise to the Cloud!
The last offer came from Eski<0xC5><0x9F>ehirspor to the Amut Cloud, which did not reconcile the star with its supporters and was suffering from moral disorder in the last matches of the tribunes.
He missed this position, wanted to get out of the game!
During Ryan Donk's transfer period, Eski<0xC5><0x9F>ehirspor made the last move for the national goalkeeper, whom Kasimpa<0xC5><0x9F>a also wanted to join in the squad.
However, the Reds were given a negative response by the G.Saray administration.
Her heart stopped when she was beautiful.
Raquel Santos (28), a mother of two children living in RIO DA JANEIRO, applied to her aesthetic doctor on Monday to erase the smiling marks on the edges of her mouth.
The filling material on the face was accelerated after a while for the woman who was injected to take heartbeats and breathe.
And then his heart-stopping, he lost his life.
Police are investigating whether the woman's daily use of the drug "Potenay" was involved in the death.
The real cause of death will be known after the autopsy.
Debora Azevedo, one of the model’s closest friends, told the Brazilian press that Santos, who has two 13-year-old sons, is obsessed with aesthetic surgery.
Santos was the second of Brazil's most important beauty contests to Musa do Brasil last December.
Oil companies have officially collapsed.
From 2014, when oil prices began to fall, investment of about $400 billion was delayed until the end of last year, while deep-sea (deepwater) oil exploration projects were suspended.
According to a study by consulting firm Wood Mackenzie, low oil prices, $380 billion in oil and gas exploration/production have led to the suspension of the project, while millions of barrels have been produced in a wide geography from the Gulf of Mexico to Africa.
As the biggest cause of cost cuts in the summer of 2014, the report, which showed oil prices falling to the lowest level in 12 years, lost 70 percent in 1.5 years, says the company's budgets were dramatically narrowed.
400 Billion Dollars for Ashida
Crude oil prices have fallen below $30, while new surprises are taking place every day, at the lowest level in the last 12 years.
"Is petrol going down to $15?"; "Is petrol now cheaper than water" debates sparked today, a study published by energy consulting firm Wood Mackenzie reveals how the sector is impacted by falling prices.
Lastly, Wood Mackenzie, who revealed that falling oil prices caused $200 billion in 46 major energy investments to be suspended, reveals in his new research that this figure has reached by 2015.
In the last six months of 2015, 22 major projects have been postponed, while a total of 68 major projects have been suspended since the start of the oil collapse in 2014.
The value of these projects is about $400 billion.
DAY 2.9 MILLION VARILS
The study, which emphasized that the impact of low oil prices on company plans is “harmless,” notes that the most affected projects are deep-sea development projects.
Suspended projects represent a total of 27 billion barrels of crude oil equivalent reserves, while 2.9 million barrels of oil production per day is thus delayed by 2025.
According to the study, while most of the projects in question are postponed to the final investment decision 2017 and beyond, the first production targets were also recorded between 2020 and 2023.
Of the 68 projects that have been postponed, the report noted that a potential investment of $170 billion is expected to take place over the next five years, “most of the $170 billion is deep-sea projects.”
This is because the cost of pre-investment is very high.
“70 percent of land sea spending is primarily oil-heavy projects in Nigeria, Angola and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico,” it said.
According to research, the countries with the most deferred oil project inventory are Canada, Angola, Kazakhstan, Nigeria, Norway and the United States.
These six countries have nearly 90 percent of deferred liquid (petrol) reserves.
Mozambique, Australia, Malaysia and Indonesia, the countries with the largest amount of deferred gas reserves, make up 85% of the total.
While most of the natural gas waiting to emerge here is located in the deep sea, it requires complex and expensive development solutions such as installing a liquefied natural gas (LNG) facility from scratch.
While the most endangered companies are oil giants, whose commitments are overseeing each other in the deep sea, Canadian oil sands and the Hazar Zone, it is also stated that the companies are trying to adapt to the "longer lower" oil prices scenario.
EYES IN IRAN
Not so much four years ago, there was a table like this: the US and Europe had brought an embargo on Iranian oil to stop Tehran’s nuclear program, the barrel price of oil was about $110, and Iran’s oil exports would shrink without causing a sudden jump in prices.
When we get back this week, we see a different scenario.
Oil prices saw $30 worth of gold for the first time since 2004, mainly due to an explosion in U.S. production and rising embargoes on Iran.
That's why our eyes are on Iran.
If Iran increases its oil exports, more oil will flow into the oil market, which is already said to be quite saturated.
This may cause prices to fall below the levels that surprise us today as well.
Some analysts say Saudi Arabia, which does not want to give Iran a market share, will pump more oil and there could be a price war between Iran and North Arabia.
The moves will not go away, Iran’s main goal is to record that Asia’s rapidly growing oil market is its former partners in India and Europe.
In their earlier statements, Iranian officials said they were aiming to increase exports by 500,000 barrels per day, and after a while to market that much more.
According to map data from Reuters, 22 very large crude carriers (VLCCs) are waiting outside Iran, with at least 13 of them fully or in large quantities.
Iran is the fourth-largest country in the world with proven oil reserves.
Thanks to the exceptions, Iran still exports about 1 million barrels of crude oil to some of the countries in which Turkey is located.
Before the attacks, Iran’s daily oil exports had increased to 3 million barrels per day.
Support Values Research Expert Aysun Göksu answers the question of whether oil will fall below $20: “While China-centered global growth concerns are increasing the downward pressure on commodity prices, the loss in oil prices is not deepening.”
With concerns about the economic slowdown in China, the world’s largest oil importer, and the decline in oil demand, we see oil losses reaching 20 percent since New Year’s Eve.
In addition, with the dollar gaining global value and the impact of the global over-supply problem, we can witness prices below $30 in oil in the coming days.
As long as we don’t see permanent pricing above the $32-$33 levels, the upward movement in oil can be limited and downward pressure can increase.
At this point, it can be said that seeing closures below the critical $30 level has a key role to play so that the declines can continue.
In such a case, it should not be surprising to see relaxations lasting until 23.30-25.60 on the lower side of the support zone.
Isham Sardouk: 'The Angelic Age is over!'
While Victoria’s Secret and WGSN, which determines the fashion trends of the world, take on the role of trend creativity, why did you turn the route to Turkey?
- I'm always in favor of change.
I was born in Paris, lived in London, then went to New York.
I took important positions there as well.
In the meantime, for the last two years, I've started giving advice to Koton.
And then I saw the potential in this geography and in the Cotton brand.
I realized that there was everything necessary to be a store chain in the world era.
Now I'm here to do it.
Will you be able to do it in a short time?
- I'm sure.
Although it is already a young brand, it is already sold in 50 countries.
We make 50 collections a year, we have 15 separate sections.
So there's everything a store chain needs to have.
We can meet the needs of consumers in different geographies from Dubai to Moscow.
Now we are opening a store in Paris in March, which is the beginning of a new and exciting period...
Do you need to open a store in Paris?
- Yes, sir.
It's not because Europe's economic situation is great.
But you open some stores for the imagination.
You have a shop in fashion capitals like Paris, London, and you win money from the Middle East.
One adds prestige to the brand, the other adds money, both are necessary for a brand that plays globality.
Let’s talk about trends...
- We have a very romantic, stylish season ahead.
Flying chiffon dresses, soft tones, pinks, whites, reds.
Drawings...
We are going through very difficult and ruthless times, and the fashion world is always trying to add happiness to life by bringing stylish, interior-opening designs to the podium in these difficult times.
That's what we do.
That's why in the new season, the "age of glory" is coming back.
Let's go back to your years at Victoria's Secret.
Who was the most legendary angel? - Karolina Kurkova.
I’m not just talking about her amazing physics: she’s so positive, she’s so good!
When I was working, they would sit next to me and say, "Honey, you're hungry."
I mean, it was so sweet.
You know what I'm talking about, and I've been researching and interviewing all Victoria's Secret models.
Caroline was beautiful, wasn't she?
But Adriana Lima has impressed me so much with her beauty.
- Oh, yes, that voice!
That speech, that tone...
After a while, you get excited, you say, "Sit by one side and look good, do nothing else!"
It's irritating.
That's right, that's what shocks happen.
I interviewed Candice Swanepoel.
She was the most beautiful girl I've ever seen, but I was horrified by the futility.
- Most of them are.
The new angels are not the same as before.
I remember Gisele's time...
It was hard to work with him, though.
The church came and smoked like a glass.
Not because it's Tiryaki.
No one drinks, only one can drink it.
The goal is to make a diva.
The Victoria's Secret show, which was released two months ago, received the lowest rating in history.
Why do you think?
- Like I said, the age of those legendary beautiful angels is over.
Excuse me, and who's gonna do Gigi Hadid?
What's good?
Kendall Jenner, for example, like wood...
No curves, nothing.
Kate Moss's curves are zero, but it's the biggest name in the fashion industry.
- Yeah, but how beautiful his face was.
I want to exercise my right to object here.
I did an interview last year, and his face was a little...
- So many cigarettes, drinks, of course, now it's ugly.
But he had such a beautiful face in his 90s.
Her lips were like Brigitte Bardot.
It was the end of that supermodel era.
Linda Evangelista, Naomi Campbell, Christy Turlington...
Christy was my next-door neighbor, and I saw her without makeup every morning.
Such a state of beauty, such an elegance can not be.
How about Delevingne?
- He's losing himself.
Not every campaign is included.
People are tired.
There's no hunger for happy models, celebrities like before.
People like themselves, they want to see real faces in campaigns.
We're going to go over that.
Because it's a trend.
A letter from 25 writers
According to BBC Türk<0xC3><0xA7>e, the authors, among whom the presidents of the International Writers’ Union (PEN) are also present in the UK, Wales and Scotland, are a common part of the lives of threats and physical attacks targeting colleagues, journalists and publishers in Turkey.
The letter included two attacks targeting the Hürriyet newspaper in Turkey, including the arrest of the Koza group and the arrest of Vice News reporters, as well as investigations and arrests of journalists.
The mother had a question about the right to work.
Turkish-Business "We believe that mothers have been given the right to work half in order to bring back bloody labor."
“This could be a Trojan horse,” TISK said, “we are concerned whether this regulation will prevent women from working in favor of women.”
The new rights, planned to be brought to employees by officers and workers after giving birth or adoption, went through the commission with full-day interviews.
The most common topic on the agenda in the commission talks of regulations that allow for part-time work or free leave until the child reaches the primary school age is "employment work".
The CHP’s Musa <0xC4><0xB0>zmir MP <0xC3><0x87>am, who stated that it was correct to do part-time work until the child went to primary school, said: “If you bring in the regulation of rent labor, we will be up to the end.”
Enis Bagdadio<0xC4><0x9F>lu, who took part in the commission’s talks on behalf of Turkish-Business, said that they had similar concerns, “We have doubts about how to fill the place of the female employee in part-time work.”
Ba<0xC4><0x9F>dadio<0xC4><0x9F>lu said that new problems will arise in case of re-employment of the rental workers with this condition, which will overwhelm the construction work several times, "We will therefore watch with concern the developments related to the private employment offices."
T<0xC4><0xB0>SK Secretary-General Bülent Pirler noted that part-time work was brought in by law for 5 years, "There is no such long-term part-time work in other countries."
And look at it like this.
"In places where there are 1 or 2 employees, you need to think about the results of this application," he said.
TOBB Consultant Ahmet <0xC5><0x9E>ag<0xC4><0x81>r also said that he would have trouble finding workers if the application came to life.
<0xC5><0x9E>ag<0xC4><0x81>r, who said that there is no legislation on rules to be applied in part-time work, said: "Regulations on private employment offices should be made, and agreement should be reached between the employer and the employer."
Text Feyzio<0xC4><0x9F>lu: We do not support
Feyzio<0xC4><0x9F>lu’s statement reads: “We do not agree with this announcement, it is not possible for us to join and support it.”
Because there is no criticism of the PKK.
You didn't say anything negative to the PKK, even a sentence to the separatist terrorist organization, you didn't put dust on it.
We do not take the heavy statements that are spent solely on the state seriously and do not find them sincere, taking into account those who spend them.
We're lawyers, we're lawyers.
If the state representatives, public officials, and security forces have any illegal behavior in this framework, we should follow it.
When we call the remnants of the period of sympathy for the dividers or the dividers, which romanticizes, "Do not destroy the state," they attack us as "dividers, fascists."
When we say, “This state must act in accordance with the law, it must always take precedence over the law,” they say, “You are divisive.”
We're the bridge.
We are always responsible for telling the truth.
Armored vehicle bombed in Van
The incident took place at 8:45 p.m. near the First and Secondary School of Akköprü, located in Akköprü District of central Tu<0xC5><0x9F>ba.
A handmade explosive left by PKK terrorists on the roadside was inflated by remote control during the passage of an armed police vehicle.
While there was no loss of life and injury in the incident, material damage occurred in the armored vehicle.
Police at the door: 30 arrests
QUESTION: Twenty-one people were arrested.
Prosecutor General Mustafa K<0xC5><0xAF><0xC5><0x9F><0xC4><0xB1>k said an investigation was opened into the offences of “propaganda of the terrorist organization” and “disgracing the spiritual personality of the state.”

Who is Bergen?
Her real name is Belgin Umluluder, Bergen was born on July 16, 1960 in Mersin.
With the divorce of his mother and father, Sebahat <0xC3><0x87>ak<0xC4><0xB1>r moved to Ankara in 1966.
After Yenimahalle Yunus Emre Primary School, Ankara State Conservatory entered the Piano division but left due to financial difficulties and worked for a while at PTT.
In 1979, he accepted an offer to work at the Feyman Night Club, where he went to have fun with his friends.
Together with the Group Locomotive Orchestra at the Feyman Night Club, he performed with repertoires of Turkish Art Music, Turkish Light Music and the fashionable interplays of the period.
After Ankara, Bergen went to Adana for work, where he met Halis Serbes and married a year later.
In 1982, he released his first feature, "I Have a Story," from Atlas Plak.
Bergen, who couldn’t stand her husband’s violence as his art life continued, escaped from his wife many times.
In October 1982, while working in <0xC4><0xB0>zmir, she was stabbed in the face by her husband's concubine.
Bergen, who lost a single eye in the attack and burned most of the body, was persuaded by the composer Gengiz <0xC3><0x96>z<0xC5><0x9F>eker and taken to the scene by the song "Who Knows?", which made Kibariye famous after the treatment.
Until 1985, the artist, who staged in <0xC3><0x96>z<0xC5><0x9F>eker's Pavyon, together with his boss, produced a demo tape called "Brotherly Destiny" and sent it to Ya<0xC5><0x9F>ar Kekeva.
Kekeva, who liked Bergen, invited the artist to Istanbul.
The artist, who produced the first professional longplay in the Istanbul music market, "Human Severse", was famous for his work "Woman of Pain" in late 1986 under music director Burhan Bayar.
She was awarded the Golden Plaque and Golden Cassette by the record company in April 1987 with the title "The Most Satanic Arab Female Artist of 1986".
In the same year, with the script and direction of <0xC3><0x9A>lkü Erakal, Yal<0xC4><0xB1>n Gülhan, Asuman Arsan and Meral Niron in the film "Woman of Pain" passed in front of the camera.
Bergen, who gained a huge fan base, escaped at last from the knife attack at Adana, where he went to the concert.
The artist and great masters Selami <0xC5><0x9E>ahin, <0xC3><0x96>zer <0xC5><0x9E>enay and Gengiz Tekin, who left the stage for a while, released their albums, respectively, "He's also a God of Love", "My Love's Cost" and "I don't want to".
Bergen, who officially divorced her husband in April 1989, returned to the scenes in June 1989 with her last album, "Years Can't Forgive".
The artist, who began the album's promotional tours with intense interest, was shot dead by his wife, who divorced at Adana Pozant<0xC4><0xB1> on the night of August 14, 1989.
The town was buried in Mersin.
Bergen had 5 longplays and 129 songs on 11 cassettes for his 29-year-old short life.
Claims that the artist's way of signing an Arabic signature with a different and powerful voice became legendary, with the release of the album "From Youth" which was released after his death, became true from day one.
Bergen's officially released studio albums include:
1982 - My Complaint is LP (reprinted as MC in 1986).
1983 - Brother Fate LP was reprinted as MC in 1985 and 1990.
1985 - Human Severse LP, MC (reprinted as CD in 1999).
1986 – Woman of Pain LP, MC (reprinted as CD in 1999)
1987 - It was reprinted as a CD by Yak Dev LP, MC in 1999.
1988 - The Cost of Love MC (reprinted as CD in 1999)
1988 - I Don't Want LP, MC (reprinted as CD in 1999.)
1989 - Years Without Forgiveness (Aslen's last album) MC (reprinted as a CD in 1999.)
1990 - My Going Youth MC (reprinted as CD in 1999.)
1990 - Garibin Chilesi at Cemetery Ender MC (reprinted as CD in 1999.)
1991 - My Last Cry MC, CD
Naz<0xC4><0xAB>m Wisdom is commemorated on its 114th birthday
Nazim Hikmet Ran, known as the Nazim Shari, was commemorated in the 114th year of his birth with the event "Good That You Were Born Nazim".
The event, organized by the Municipality of Konak, took place in the hall where the poet’s name was given at the Beautiful Cultural Center.
The poems of the famous poet, theatre and cinema actor R<0xC5><0xAB><0xC5><0x9F>tü Asia<0xC4><0xB1> were performed by the event by poetry and music listeners.
He also accompanied the Three Anatolian Music Community to Asia during the event with his remarks.
Naz<0xC4><0xAB>m accompanied the event of Wisdom with many arts in love.
Among these names were Ali Se<0xC3><0xA7>kiner Recipient, Erko<0xC3><0xA7> Torun, Nedim Y<0xC4><0xB1>ld<0xC4><0xB1>z and Zeynep Göknur Y<0xC4><0xB1>ld<0xC4><0xB1>z and Ziya <0xC3><0x96>zsözzz<0xC4><0xB1>m<0xC4><0xB1>m.
In Istanbul, the event was organized by the Nazim Hikmet Culture and Art Foundation.
Foundation President Rutkay Aziz and members, N<0xC3><0xA2>z<0xC4><0xB1>m Hikmet's wife Vera Tulyakova's daughter, stepdaughter and grandson, actor Tar<0xC4><0xB1>k Akan met in Tarabya for the event.
With the slogan "Living like a tree alone and swarming like a forest" his brother will read poems and leave carrots in the sea.
The event, organized with the contributions of the Municipality of Sar<0xC4><0xB1>yer, will be accompanied by the songs of the N<0xC3><0xA2>z<0xC4><0xB1>m Hikmet Choir.
Nazim Wisdom was born on January 15, 1902.
The poems of the world-famous poet Nazim Hikmet have been translated into more than 50 languages.
He has been repeatedly arrested for political thought and spent most of his adult life in prison or exile.
His poems have been translated into more than fifty languages and his works have received many awards.
He died on June 3, 1963.
The Municipality of Bursa Nilüfer has done special work on the 114th birthday of the world-famous poet Nazim Hikmet.
The municipality, which has worked for the documentary "Bursa's Nazim", which recounts Nazim's 11-year-old days in Bursa Prison, also made personal money for the poet for the first time in Turkey's history.
Thus, in cooperation with PTT, the first personal money in the history of Turkey was withdrawn in the name of Nazim Hikmet.
This special money and the first day envelopes, which are priced at 1.40 TL, will be donated to the guests on the night to be held at the Nazim Wisdom Culture on Thursday 14 January.
They will be deported by bicycle.
However, as no agreement is reached between the two countries, most Syrian refugees will have to return to Russia this time by turning the pedal down to less than 20 degrees.
In the summer months, because it was safer and cheaper, a group of refugees had flown to Russia and moved from Murmansk to Norway.
Since the agreement between the two countries did not grant permission to cross the border on foot, migrants crossed the border by bicycle.
Norway has now decided to send these refugees back.
For this reason, Norwegian security has instructed the repair of bicycles that have been abandoned when crossing the border.
The "3 billion euros" crisis in the EU
TURKEY is facing a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3 billion crisis committed to refugees.
European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker has criticised Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi for blocking the funds to be transferred to Turkey.
Noting that the mood between Italy and the rest of Europe was not good, Juncker drew the gold that the EU had to find 3 billion euros.
Juncker said, “This money is not for Turkey, but for Syrian refugees in Turkey.”
We haven't reached three billion yet.
"This is an issue with the credibility of the EU, which is why it is important," he said.
Juncker said he expects the money to be completed by January 26, a date previously given.
Italy is one of the countries that has a positive attitude when it comes to Turkey.
Diplomatic sources are of the view that Rome’s position on the financial package is not a direct move towards Turkey and is linked to the problems that have occurred between the EU Commission and Italy and some of the Union’s countries.
Tensions have been going on between Italy and the EU for some time.
At and after the recent EU summit on energy, banking and immigrants, Renzi continued to harshly criticize German Prime Minister Angela Merkel and the EU.
Criticizing Renzi's attitude at yesterday's press conference, Juncker said, "Renzi should stop blaming the EU."
"It is wrong for Renzi to humiliate the EU Commission at every opportunity that I love him so much," he said.
Juncker implied that Renzi was playing in public.
The <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3 billion promised to Turkey will be received from the EU budget.
<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2 billion will come from member states’ budgets.
Germany will contribute at least <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>427 million.
The Romanian administration, which announced that it would not transfer money to Turkey for political reasons, has agreed to transfer the 2.3 million euros of its share to the EU budget for support to Jordan and Lebanon.
The source is expected to be used in the 2016-2017 period.
When I saw Chalie Hebdo's caricature, I cried.
Father Abdullah Kurdi, speaking to Russian official news agency Sputnik, reacted harshly and "I cried for this cartoon if you want the truth."
He said, "I felt very bad."
After the armed attack, Kurdi's father, who became a symbol of freedom of expression, said that he expected positive things from French jihadist magazine Charlie Hebdo, said:
Unfortunately, they did a bad cartoon.
Everyone was very saddened by this cartoon.
A two-year-old boy died.
Aylan was supposed to respect me and my family Charlie Hebdo, but it was the opposite.
This magazine should respect people who have died.
They published disrespectful cartoons about our Lord.
They have also published a book about God.
It is a small thing that has been done to my son before Allah and the Prophet.
The Kurdish, who lived in Erbil, called: "I call on the whole world and the magazine of humor, everyone should respect all the children who die."
They should not add to the suffering of their families.
Aylan Kurdi's son-in-law Tima Kurdi, who lives in Canada, was also one of those who responded to the cartoon.
Laurent 'Riss' Sourisseau has the impression that the 3-year-old Syrian Kurd, who shot his body on the shores of Bodrum in a signed cartoon, could be 'one of the bullies in Germany' when he grew up.
Last year, after publishing the cartoons, the French humor magazine Charlie Hebdo, which was attacked by radicals who killed 12 people, became the focal point of controversy again over his cartoons on Aylan Kurdi.
The cartoon depicted, as in the early German city of Cologne, the female harassment that took place during the Christmas celebrations, pork-faced women chasing and calling on migrants.
The cartoon that triggers different reactions on social media is actually part of a 4-square column.
The column reads, “This is not France,” and many read, along with other lost values of France, the growing refugee hostility is being criticized.
The cartoon, on the other hand, led many people to accuse Charlie Hebdo of racism.
Charlie Hebdo magazine has criticized France’s unwillingness to open its doors to migrants while overtaking Germany, in a number published last year, which has accepted the admission of 800,000 refugees.
In the cartoon, "He was very close to his lover," the poster read, "Two children's menus for a price."
'Autopsy of Germans who died in 'Sultanahmet' in Germany'
According to a report on the website of the weekly magazine Der Spiegel, the German Federal Prosecutor’s Office has decided to bring the transport of 10 people who died in the attack to Germany.
The funerals of the dead will be held today or tomorrow in a plane belonging to the German Air Force at the country and at the airport.
In Germany, experts from the Identification Commission of the Federal Criminal Department (BKA), which conducts forensic operations, are traveling to countries where identification and autopsies are carried out for German citizens who have died in accidents or attacks under normal conditions.
But the magazine Der Spiegel wrote that this time the situation would be different.
According to the magazine, officials from the Federal Criminal Department appealed to the Turkish authorities for the identification of the deceased and the autopsy to be carried out in Istanbul, but the Turkish authorities did not accept the proposal.
After the attack in Istanbul, the Federal Criminal Department sent four specialists to Istanbul.
Seven German tourists injured in the attack are undergoing treatments at the hospital.
Ellen Meiksins Wood has lost her life.
Meiksins Wood, a well-known political theorist and socialist historian, was particularly prominent in his important work on the origins of capitalism.
New York-born Latvian-born Meiksins Wood also published in English: Escape from Class -- The Archaic Culture of Capitalism -- Against Capitalism Democracy -- The Roots of Capitalism -- The Empire of Capitalism -- Return to Marx
Prohibition of swimming pools for refugee men
According to the news in the German press, the municipality will lift the ban if it is notified that the message of the ban is understood by the refugees.
In a statement to the WDR, social circle official Markus Schnapka, who recorded that the municipality did not want to punish innocent people because of the conduct of several people, said they informed the residents of the villages in three languages about the values of importance in Germany.
Schnapka, who noted the value of gender equality that Germany attaches importance to, added that the municipality would punish all forms of assault and harassment.
On the other hand, the carnival in Rheinberg was cancelled due to the possibility of the upcoming carnival scandals in Cologne.
The municipality announced that the carnival gate had been cancelled because there was no guarantee that there would be no incidents of harassment.
What Are the Benefits of Cooking in Steam?
The technique of steaming, which is a technique that does not kill the vitamins and minerals in foods, is becoming increasingly popular.
For centuries, steaming, one of the most preferred cooking techniques in the Far East, has made the metabolism strong and facilitated digestion.
By this method, which completely eliminates problems such as indigestion, the bacteria and microbes found in the nutrients are also completely dead.
Substances such as protein, cellulose and starch in the food melt completely with this technique, which makes the food softer.
Baking in low-pressure steam is carried out in a pot with the help of a steamer or a steamer.
In high-pressure cooking, the amount of water used and the cooking time are small.
The best example of this is cooking in a frying pan.
To cook foods such as vegetables, especially on diet menus, it is necessary to wash the vegetables first thoroughly and then wait for them to be thoroughly filtered by placing them inside the filter.
A deep bowl is filled with water in a third proportion and steam is placed into the filter bowl.
The mouth of the pot is left to be semi-closed.
This ensures that the steam flows out of the pot comfortably.
The January heat is first brought to the highest level by boiling the water, then the furnace heat is brought to a lower level by obtaining a constant heat.
Vegetables and nutrients cooked in steam for about 10 - 15 minutes are controlled with the help of daisies after cooking thoroughly.
The cooked vegetables are taken from the oven and served by placing them on the plates.
In the technique of cooking in steam, the appearance, color and smell of the food does not change, so this method is healthy.
The taste of the food remains the same.
Thus, the quality and taste of the food will not be damaged.
At the same time, when cooking in steam, which is one of the most economical cooking methods, the loss of nutrients is also kept to a minimum.
Vegetables cooked in steam also offer a satisfying feast to eat with their more lively and lively appearance.
This method, which is often used especially in dietary foods, is also often preferred because it is light.
David Bowie - Blackstar: The "Last" Album of the Universe
Knowing you're going to die; making that last album without telling anyone, turning the deathbed into an artistic expression in the clip you're shooting...
Things like this; we may seem too "outside" for worldly fans.
I call them Earth fans because I am among those who sincerely believe that the man who did this is both immortal and alien.
He came from another corner of the universe to our Earth; now he has returned to his homeland; what is happening is this.
It came because only Kiss, Marilyn Manson or Lady Gaga had an inspiration to be given to all the world’s artists.
He's done his job with dignity.
David Bowie, Blackstar, iTunes price: 9.99 TL 5/5
It was probably fed by Warhol, Kubrick, from the same planet as him.
When Apollo 11 landed on the Moon, he decided to say, "Is this something I'm an alien?" and he got in the middle of us by saying, "Space Oddity."
He wasn’t really involved; he was always a few steps ahead.
A lot of people have found ways that they lost thanks to him.
Musicians and listeners...
It's not fair to say "just music" for his music if we're going to let him take care of the plastic arts, his acting, and so on.
The characters that flow from song to song and create themselves; their transmissions, their innovation, their taboo vigor, their discography express an artistic unity to me.
I can't call him the father of glam rock or the cousin of punk.
If I call it that, what about the magic that he's been hiding as love in those avant-garde electronic movements since he was a child?
David Bowie remembered what the word “icon” meant so far, when we chewed it in our mouths.
She was not a man, she was not a woman, she was not a man.
It was a body.
It seemed to us for a while because of a mission.
He left the world two days after the release of his 26th studio album, Blackstar.
He tried to rehearse the "Blackstar" and "Lazarus" we listened to before the album was released.
We thought, "He's getting old now, he's talking about death," and he was aware of everything.
Another last game...
The album has been released much earlier than the wonderful "Blackstar" and "Lazarus", which backed the message and emotional burden of the album, but we know the song "Sue (Or In A Season Of Crime)", "'Tis A Pity She Was A Whore" and "'Tis A Pity Was A Whore", which was re-recorded for this album.
I'd like to say that the rest of the songs like "Girl Loves Me", "I Can't Give Everything Away" and "Dollar Days" are also very good songs.
When we look at it all, it's built on a very powerful musical structure, but it's a "Blackstar" that's as sincere as it is with momentary feelings.
Neither death nor a "counting with the past" album...
It's just a real "last" album.
"The End" of a musical life that was masterpiece from beginning to end.
Turkey is targeted in Sultanahmet attack
German Federal Security Minister Holger Münch, in a program he attended on German channel ARD, said Tuesday about the attack on Sultanahmet Square that killed 10 German citizens.
Munich said the target of the attack was not German citizens, but Turkey.
“I’ve seen 400 people.”
But Munich said that the Sultanahmet attack did not change the threat of terror in Germany, “We are still under a threat that needs to be taken seriously.”
Munich, which said that the number of people who went to Syria from Germany to join ISIS was reduced, noted that a large number of people had returned from the war zones.
Münch, who said it was a major challenge in terms of security units, said: “There are almost 400 dangerous people that we need to keep under surveillance right now.”
Münch called for improved coordination between police agencies in Europe and for closer communication to be made.
Turkish officials said the live bomb, which carried out the Sultanahmet attack, was a Syrian citizen and a member of ISIS, while German Interior Minister Thomas de Maizi<0xC3><0xA8>re said the identity of the attacker had not yet been identified.
Say Goodbye to the Scenes
Decorating his 40th anniversary with a concert series, Sezen Aksu captivated his loved ones with his "Seven Years" concert at the Volkswagen Arena last night.
The first part of the concert series, which took place in July, was held at the Volkswagen Arena on January 15-16.
At the Aksu concert, he took all his listeners on a 40-year journey from yesterday to today.
In addition to the love songs that touch our personal lives, Aksu has voiced his songs on social issues that are of close concern to our country and our world.
Aksu, who said he would say goodbye to his stage life after performing the concerts he promised, saddened his fans.
At the "Seventy Years" concert, Sezen Aksu appeared in front of fans filling the Volkswagen Arena with a separate story in each piece.
Every story, show, light, and stage show has taken viewers to different periods.
In the final part of the unforgettable concert, there was also a video show where the paintings of the Revolution Erbil took place.
Aksu also invited them to the scene for the first time, placing them on the scene in the videos that his fans had previously recorded.
<0xC2><0xA3>25 for bread in Ankara and Istanbul
In Ankara, as of yesterday, 250 grams of bread was sold for 25 pounds, starting from 1 TL.
Earlier in the new year, and especially in December, the Minister of Customs and Trade, Faruk <0xC3><0x87>elik and Minister of Food, Agriculture and Livestock, Bülent Tüfenkci, made a statement in the form of "no money".
However, in the capital Ankara, 250 grams of bread was sold from 1 TL yesterday.
Halil <0xC4><0xB0>brahim Balc<0xC4><0xB1>, President of the Federation of Turkish Bakers, said about the 25-pound ration that came to the bread, "The ration was not made, the tariff decision started to apply 2 years ago," adding:
"This was a tariff decision made two years ago."
The Association of Chambers of Commerce established this tariff two years ago.
A price applied throughout Turkey.
I mean, there's been a new injunction, and it's not going to raise prices.
But because of the competition in Ankara, trade was selling for 75 kroner in some regions.
In some areas, it was already sold for 1 TL.
The tradesman who relied on his base, his bread, did not lower the price. They now have to apply 1 TL due to the competition.
There's no raise or raise.
They're applying an unenforced price.
"In the first half of 2016, the price of a kilogram of bread will definitely not exceed TL 5, and if we do not have a very big problem, we will complete this year with this price."
In some parts of Istanbul, the bread started to be sold for 1.25 TL.
This time, Burkina Faso was killed.
In the West African country of Burkina Faso, 23 people from 18 different countries have lost their lives in an attack on a luxury hotel that is known to be preferred by foreigners and United Nations officials.
The attack was carried out by Al Qaeda's North African arm.
The attack in Burkina Faso came four days after ISIS, with a population of 250 million, carried out a terrorist attack in the world's most populous Muslim country, Indonesia's capital, Cakarta.
Foreign embassies, luxury hotels, and shops in a busy street, Starbucks branch and police station, during the daytime bombing and armed attack; a Canadian and an Indonesian lost their lives.
Indonesian officials said the attackers were inspired by the Paris massacre on November 13.
Frank Garner, a security reporter for British BBC television, also noted that the move was part of a frightening trend that has recently emerged in many cities around the world.
The U.S. recently burned down by terrorists.
In early December, 14 people were killed in an armed attack by an ISIS sympathizer in the U.S. city of San Bernardino, California.
The San Bernardino attack on the U.S.
German Interior Minister Thomas de Maizi<0xC3><0xA8>re recalled that after the bombing of 10 German tourists in Sultanahmet, there were terrorist attacks in many parts of the world, "We have experienced two major attacks in Paris."
If we say that, then terror will win...
We used the phrase "no step back."
ISIS quits Whatsapp, talks with Alrawi app
According to a new report, the terrorist organization is using its own chat tool to communicate independently from chat apps such as ISIS, WhatsApp and Telegram.
According to Defense One’s report, the organization is taking advantage of a new messaging app to communicate with each other.
This Android app called "Alrawi" is distributed and installed via an APK file.
The application allows the organization to message and share media encrypted among themselves.
Flash move from ISIS to Iraq
The functionality of the app remains “primarily” against popular apps like WhatsApp and Telegram, according to the Ghost Security Group.
It is not yet known how powerful the encryption used is.
ISIS had previously been performing all of its communications through the Telegram app, which allowed it to send messages via an encrypted connection.
However, Telegram has revealed the channels that the ISIS members are talking about.
What’s more, the U.S. administration requires application developers to put backdoors to their applications.
That’s why the organization is now starting to use its own solutions instead of relying on WhatsApp and Telegram’s encryption.
UAE: Iran has agreed to a nuclear deal
Kerry, speaking at a press conference in Vienna, said Iran had complied with the requirements of the nuclear deal and that the United States had formally lifted the economic sanctions against Iran: The International Atomic Energy Agency (UAEA) is the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Iran’s nuclear arsenal.
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said in a tweet he welcomed the lifting of the post-nuclear sanctions signed between the six countries of the world and Tehran.

How should the semester holiday be assessed?
How should the students evaluate their semester vacation? we asked the question to the training expert-student coach Murat Ayd<0xC4><0xB1>n.
Semester vacations are only for students; rest, entertainment, television and computer should not be considered as spending time at the beginning.
The semester holiday is a very important opportunity to prepare for the new period of education and to review the past period.
The so-called half-year vacation is also an important opportunity for personal development, knowledge, skills and hobbies.
Make a half-time evaluation list.
Write down everything you’re going to do and try to implement it.
Be sure to enjoy it and you will have a very productive semester.
Now, first of all, let’s talk about what an efficient semester should be for students who are preparing for YGS-LYS.
Because the questions that come to us most often from the friends who have been preparing for the YGS-LYS exams are: "How should we evaluate this period, should we solve a lot of questions, or do we have missing issues, should we deal with them?"
In order to answer both these questions and to spend an efficient period, let’s start writing to friends who are prepared for the exam first.
While the exam preparation process should be a process starting from grade 9 under normal conditions, we are trying to complete it much more in the last 1 year, which makes it necessary for us to spend the last year more effectively, more efficiently and more accurately using the time.
In addition to the preparation of the final grade exam, the student must also carry out written schoolwork together.
Although the graduate student who has completed the school has entered the exam at least 1 times (YGS-LYS) and has experienced it, the year in which the graduate will be re-prepared for the exam is also critical for him.
Because most graduate students and their family see the ‘O’ year as their last chance, and that creates even greater stress.
Studying is the work that the student does just because he feels compelled to do, and therefore usually ends it all, but for students who do it regularly, who make it habitual, it is completely a task and it is always included in a plan of what to do.
Now we have a half-year holiday ahead and we should consider that in the best way.
There must be a plan that will allow us to manage our time well.
Studying on a half-year holiday:
Everyone should first and foremost make a plan according to their situation.
What has been accomplished, what has been missing, should be planned for the day, the week and the 15-day time.
Within this period, there should be repetitions of the topic and also solutions to the question.
At the same time, students who are not too short can also pass an average of 1-2 exams.
Research shows that 75 percent of what people learn in a week, 66 percent in a day, and 54 percent forget in an hour.
The best and most effective way to eliminate forgetting is to do repetitions.
Students who make too many mistakes, especially from past subjects, should emphasize their general recurrence of work.
Identify your missing issues first and plan for the day, place the topic every day, and be sure to deal with them.
This planning will relax you both academically and psychologically.
Make sure that there are the issues you make the most mistakes when you put them on your plan.
Because in the time ahead, you won’t have such a long vacation period.
Ask the solutions to the questions:
It’s as important to answer questions as it is to ask them again.
Because we can see how much we understand the work we do but through the feedback we get through the question we solve.
Do not forget to put a number of solutions to a specific question each day.
The number of questions you will solve may vary depending on the work you will do that day; you may not be able to solve too many questions on a day when you are working hard on the topic, but still, at least in terms of seeing how much we have learned on that day, we need to do a certain amount of question solving work.
Solve Testing Exams:
Another study that you will be doing on a six-year vacation should be to take the test exams.
Even though the subjects are not complete, you can at least take the course test solutions.
Let’s say you’ve done a great deal of the Turkish course; you can solve the tests of the Turkish course with 40 questions prepared.
And do it for a while while.
If you can solve the Turkish question in the first 60 minutes, then your next goal will be to solve it in less than a few minutes if possible.
Holidays and hobbies:
Vacation, of course, is not just about studying; you should also spend a few days on vacation, rest, and hobbies.
It will only prevent you from being discharged and resting during a vacation period that will be spent studying the lesson.
Therefore, there should also be special times for you to dedicate to yourself within your plans.
Reading a book, watching TV, surfing the internet can be part of your plans, most importantly how much time you’ll spend on it.
I'll have a little advice for friends who say I didn't spend my first period productively.
If my first period didn’t go very well, I didn’t work too much and if you say I have too many shortcomings, this half-year vacation is a great opportunity for you too.
But first you have to decide and believe it.
In the 2009–10 season, goals were scored between 76th and 90th minutes.
Now you answer the question you asked yourself is over the match and are you going to the dressing room, or is the match still going on and there are too many minutes to score?
I don’t think anyone wants to say, “We’ll look at the upcoming games anymore,” which is a classic comment from a defeated football team coach or players.
All you have to do now is leave the past and look ahead, not walk.
If we're going to collect what we're saying:
1) Make a half-year holiday plan first,
2) Do it again by going through the things you know,
3) Take care of your missing issues,
4) Solve the question by fixing the topic,
5) Resolve the test tests,
6) Read the book.
7) Set new goals for the new period,
8) Take time for yourself, for your hobbies, and for what you enjoy,
9) Spend time with your family and friends,
10) Spend time on social and cultural activities (cinema, sport, theater, concert, trip, picnic, etc.)
'Kervan' has come a long way
With an average of 1,000 square meters of 45 stores, one of the largest ‘home’ store chains in Turkey, Kervan’s founder Shinasi Demirel and his son Hasan have joined the cast of Kervan, Home Sweet Home, which has 17 stores abroad, and 25 stores in the country.
With the recent completion of the commercial asylum operations, Kervan has also owned 17 Home Sweet Home stores abroad.
Shinasi Demirel, who stated that there is still no Kervan store abroad, said, "Now with Kervan, we will continue the smaller store with Home Sweet Home."
He said, “The door will be opened abroad.”
With the merger of Kervan with Home Sweet Home, which was worth <0xC2><0xA3>50 million in 2015, a retail chain of <0xC2><0xA3>140 million, also producing <0xC2><0xA3>140 million, emerged.
The total sales area of Kervan, which has 45 caves in 35 years, is 45,000 square meters.
Twenty-five stores are owned by the parent company.
We have about 500 employees in Kervan.
Home Sweet Home has 17 stores in 25 countries abroad, with a total sales area of 6,500 square meters and 320 employees.
Kadir Kalayc<0xC4><0xB1>o<0xC4><0x9F>lu, Chairman of the Board of Home Sweet Home, which is engaged in production, export and marketing with his partner Flame Pact, said that they were very pleased with the merger with Kervan, "We are Mardinli and we entered this sector in 1998."
Since the beginning, we have created a brand with the support of Shinasi Gentlemen.
This is the "TRT" of the industry.
We learned a lot from him.
We even started our first step into the store with the fact that he gave us his Ak Central store.
Kervan and I were already working as a strategic partner, not as a competitor.
"Now a very serious synergy will emerge with this merger," he said.
Kalayc<0xC4><0xB1>o<0xC4><0x9F>lu announced that Home Sweet Home currently has 17 stores abroad, the weight of which is in the Middle East, and they started exporting to China last month.
Kalayc<0xC4><0xB1>o<0xC4><0x9F>lu, "We also opened our first corner in Shanghai."
We've agreed on a chain of 200 stores.
“From now on, as Kervan, we will develop our large-scale retail abroad with Home Sweet Home,” he said.
Poroshenko sells its factory in Russia
Roshen CEO Vyacheslav Moskalevsky, who interviewed the Liga.net news site on the subject, said the factory was sold for $200 million.
Moskalevsky said, "Yes, we sold the factory."
"As soon as it goes on sale, all the real buyers are suddenly gone," he said.
As for the price of the company's factory in Lipetsk, Russia, Moskalevsky said, "We have set about $ 200 million."
Roshen, who produces 450,000 tons of chocolate and candy per year, is one of the largest producers in the world and belongs to the President of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko.
Y<0xC4><0xB1>ld<0xC4><0xB1>z Holding became Pladis abroad
Y<0xC4><0xB1>ld<0xC4><0xB1>z Holding has merged global companies operating in the biscuit and chocolate sectors it purchased under the name "Pladis".
With the merger of De Met’s, Godiva, United Biscuits, and Lander brands, a $5.2 billion new food giant was born, employing 26,000 people.
Murat Ülker, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Y<0xC4><0xB1>ld<0xC4><0xB1>z Holding, who spoke at the meeting on the merger of global companies within Y<0xC4><0xB1>ld<0xC4><0xB1>z Holding, said, “Being a global company was our goal from the very beginning,” adding:
Murat Ülker has sold 335 million lira from Periscope.
Founded 72 years ago, the company now under the name Y<0xC4><0xB1>ld<0xC4><0xB1>z Holding is advancing to become a global brand, a global company in the world in the business of biscuits chocolate candy.
During this time, we developed in various industries from retail packaging to real estate, personal care and various industries, in addition to chocolate candy.
We have 77 factories operating in 14 countries, with 300 brands and thousands of points of sale.
Ülker, who says the entire Star Holding is "a family of over 50,000 people," said: "Now that we look back at the possibilities in our family, we want to focus on our main business and be global in this field, we want to be reorganized and reorganized for that."
Ülker's father Sabri Bey's life story
We are reevaluating our company construction, reorganizing.
We divide the world into regions.
And we shared these areas with our CEOs.
Mehmet, Muhammad and Jeff will be our regional CEOs.
Mehmet T<0xC5><0xAB>t<0xC4><0xAB>c<0xC4><0xB1> is responsible for Turkey’s Middle East, K.Africa and Turkish Republics.
Mohamed Elsarky is from the Americas and Japan, as well as our global Godiva business.
Jeff van der Eems will be responsible for the UK, continental Europe and Africa.
While I can call Ali Ülker a quality and innovation guru in his field, Cem Karaka<0xC5><0x9F> will help me manage the business.
China and Russia will be regions that we will partly re-establish and develop in Southeast Asia.
Murat Ülker sells shares in SAF GYO
Murat Ülker, who continued, “We promise happiness to the whole world at every bite,” said, “The name of our global company that we set up to do this is Pladis.”
“If you say where you invented Pladis, that name doesn’t really have a special meaning,” he added:
The Aztecs call it Maya.
Japanese Subaru, Pervin in Iran.
In Arabic, we were inspired by the name of the seven-star team star Pleiades in Latin, which came to Earth.
I mean, we've translated Ülker into the global.
Ali Ülker, Deputy Chairman of the Board of Directors of Y<0xC4><0xB1>ld<0xC4><0xB1>z Holding, in cooperation with laboratories in different countries, stressed that “we have started to create synergies in innovation” and added:
We have very valuable R&D teams, we have achieved certain synergies so far in our work on an R&D platform by bringing these teams together.
We have 27 R&D centers under Pladis.
The largest of these are in Turkey and England.
More than 300 of our AR-GE specialists work here.
Synergy studies have already begun to produce results.
Produced in Ülker and to start exporting to the UK, the Digestives Drake (Nibbles) is produced in Ülker's chocolate factory in Silivri.
Another example of synergy: The brands are different but the products are the same Land Krispi Crack.
A cracker technology developed in the UK, the Jacob's Crinklys product, we have recently adapted to Turkey, giving our country a nice taste under the name of Ülker Krispi T<0xC4><0xB1>r<0xC4><0xB1>kl<0xC4><0xB1>.
Laviva, which we all know very well, met with consumers in America today.
Call of Duty has exceeded the limit of 250 million.
Activision, Infinity Ward, Treyarch, and Sledgehammer Games have carved their name in gold letters into the game world, and it looks like it won’t be forgotten for years to come.
Particularly the newly announced sales numbers are in the direction of proof of how legendary we should find.
Activision, which holds the license rights to the series, had sold 250 million copies at the end of the year.
At the beginning of last year, the company, which shares the sales of the entire series, has sold 75 million Call of Duty games since then.
I’m pretty sure that’s a big part of Black Ops 3, but I’m not mistaken.
Kemal K<0xC4><0xB1>l<0xC4><0xB1><0xC3><0xA7>daro<0xC4><0x9F>lu was once again elected President
Kemal K<0xC4><0xB1>l<0xC4><0xB1><0xC3><0xA7>daro<0xC4><0x9F>lu was re-elected as general president in the Oleg<0xC4><0xB1>an Council.
K<0xC4><0xB1>l<0xC4><0xB1><0xC3><0xA7>daro<0xC4><0x9F>lu, who won the game of 990 of the thousand 238 delegates who used the vote, became the re-elected president.
248 of the votes cast were invalid.
After the announcement of the result, the parties were in a show of joy.
The CHP had a total of 275 thousand delegates.
The council completed its work to gather at 10 a.m. on Sunday.
At the Swordsman board, he summed it up:
We wanted games to be played here, turkeys to be said.
But the point where we're coming is not introverted.
There is an unmanageable truth.
The atmosphere is shading all of this.
The reason for the Karamsar table is those who rule the country.
As CHPs, no matter where the terror comes from, no matter how it comes, we are against it.
Terrorism is a crime of humanity and terrorists should never be forgiven.
The fight against terror is done wisely, it is done with knowledge, it is done with irfan.
Of course, let's fight, we want no one's nose to bleed.
What's the difference between the photos in Syria, the photos in Lebanon, the photos in the Southeast?
While sitting at the table, they made serious mistakes.
The blood, the tears, the power of all the dead.
In 2002, they surrendered the country with zero terror, and today there is a Turkey returning to the blood lake.
Who is responsible for these?
The taxi driver in Diyarbak<0xC4><0xB1>r, <0xC5><0x9E>ehmuz?
What is Turkey paying for?
We will attend the meetings sincerely on the change of the laws of strike, we will convey our thoughts.
We will not allow anyone to build a country on personal opinions.
I say, "Let's change the pulsating spirit."
The houses are being printed in the morning, and they are being held in custody because they have declared their thoughts.
There are aspects that we do not agree with, but people should be able to express their thoughts freely.
This dictatorial disorder says that "the one who eats the bread of the state and is hostile to the state".
And I want to ask him, why didn't those who ate the state's bread and took advantage of the state's full potential think about it when they robbed the state?
The CHP is the party that brought the biggest changes to this country.
We will all prepare for the Fourth Great Revolution together.
Whatever the cost, we will certainly bring a libertarian democracy to this country.
They can arrest us, they can arrest us, whatever they do, no matter how much it costs, the CHP will bring freedom to this country.
I'm making a clear call to you, Davutoglu.
Hiding behind the law of blows, the man who hides has not thrown the mind of blows out of his head.
You've given the man who needs you a medal of excellence.
What kind of blow are you talking about?
I'm totally fooling people.
The party authorities classified the other three revolutions as follows: the first great revolution was given to the end of the kingdom and the establishment of the Republic; the second major revolution in the time of the Revolution; the transition to a multi-party period from a single party period; the third revolution with Bülent Ecevit to social democracy...
The President has his responsibilities and responsibilities.
Article 103 has the oath of the President.
We know how important the concept of honor and honor is in this society.
If a person comes out and makes this promise, he will fulfill it to his death.
Because honor and honor are uncontroversial to us.
The man with the dictatorial disorder, what does honor and courtesy mean to you.
What do you understand by pride and honor, why did you take this oath?
What do you mean by honor and honor?
I want to know.
In a religious man, the notion of humility and honor is the crown of the head.
Their intention is not to abolish the law of coups, but to condemn the law of coups.
They don't want the presidential system.
How to be president; the bossed presidential system.
Why do you reject the Ottoman parliamentary system?
One person will do what he wants.
Does Parliamentary Health Work in Turkey?
No, it's not working.
If we bring libertarian democracy, the system works.
They call the strike strike, but they have strengthened the strike law.
Mustafa Balbay, an <0xC4><0xB0>zmir MP who declared his candidacy for the general presidency, failed to participate in the contest because he could not collect the signatures of the 128 delegates required for the nomination.
Balbay, who can collect 92 signatures, said, "I can't be a candidate under the current conditions."
In the council hall, the party assembly of MPs (PM), the central executive board (MYK) and the seats of the honorary board members were allotted seats, while the former CHP leader Deniz Baykal was sitting in the stands with the party members.
stanbul MP Gülay <0xC5><0x9E>äk<0xC4><0xB1><0xC4><0x9F><0xC4><0xB1>, instead of sitting on the seat left for the MPs, came early and sat next to the seat left for President K<0xC4><0xB1>l<0xC4><0xB1><0xC3><0xA7>daro<0xC4><0x9F>lu.
Yalova MP Muharrem <0xC4><0xB0>nce was also one of the topics discussed in the council meeting during the meeting with K<0xC4><0xB1>l<0xC3><0xA7>daro<0xC4><0x9F>lu.
He also said that he did not accept the PM’s offer of membership.
But from the general center sources, there was the claim that the request for the meeting came from <0xC4><0xB0>nce and that PM membership was not proposed.
S<0xC3><0xAD>nce shared on Twitter, “No one can learn from Ali <0xC3><0x96>zcan, the Istanbul MP, the content of these general center sources.”
He said, "How can I know about the meeting of two people?"
It's enough to say, "He's gone."
The Swordman often applauded his ba- press.
On the first day of the usual "Democracy, Change and Fraternity Council" party assembly (PM) marked the backdrop.
K<0xC4><0xB1>l<0xC4><0xB1><0xC3><0xA7>daro<0xC4><0x9F>lu, after speaking to the council, went home and started working for the PM list.
Yakup Akkaya, Sencer Ayata, Ercan Karaka<0xC5><0x9F>, and Ercan Karaka<0xC5><0x9F>, who once again had been nominated for the list of the key list of 100 persons, from the current members of the MYK, explaining that they did not want to take part in the administration.
It is stated that K<0xC4><0xB1>l<0xC4><0xB1><0xC3><0xA7>daro<0xC4><0x9F>lu can point to another narrowed list as well as the PM key list for 100 people.
The 21 articles unanimously adopted in the CHP Board of Directors report called for the removal of barriers to the European Local Governance Agreement, which is on the agenda of the DTK's autonomy debates, to increase local authority sharing.
The statement also included the goals of "the termination of the party state order", "the establishment of a legal state that can be accounted for and accountable."
Sel<0xC3><0xA7>uk <0xC3><0x96>zda<0xC4><0x9F>, Vice President of the Kurultay AK Party, <0xC4><0xB0>dris Baluken from HDP, and Ruhsar Demirel from MHP followed.
The AK Party <0xC3><0x96>zd<0xC3><0xA1>g and AK Party committee left the hall on the harsh criticism of President Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an.
He said, “I saw that he was missing his dose of criticism, and I couldn’t accept it.”
Journalists detained in the hall drew attention to the Kurdish, Turkish and English "Peace" banner with the banner "How if I don't burn you, I will not burn you out to the light" with photos of Can Dündar and Erdem Gül.
In the morning, the council began with Group Commentary and Ahmet Kaya songs.
Diyarbak<0xC4><0xB1>r Baro President Tahir El<0xC3><0xA7>i, who lost his life in the armed attack, sent a message to the establishment by his wife, Turkan El<0xC3><0xA7>i.
Berkin Elvan's mother Gülsüm and his father Sami Elvan also joined the board.
The section where K<0xC4><0xB1>l<0xC4><0xB1><0xC3><0xA7>daro<0xC4><0x9F>lu said that they would have democracy "death" if necessary, was the most applause section of the speech.
To date, the CHP, which has gathered 34 regular, 18 extraordinary boards, has gathered its 53rd largest board at yesterday’s Ankara Arena.
Participation was high.
There were more than 15,000 CHPs in the 12,000-seat hall.
However, there was no enthusiasm given by the crowd.
The most exciting moment was the moment when K<0xC4><0xB1>l<0xC4><0xB1><0xC3><0xA7>daro<0xC4><0x9F>lu’s wife Selvi K<0xC4><0xB1>l<0xC4><0xB1><0xC3><0xA7>daro<0xC4><0x9F>lu entered the hall.
Excitement continued as the Sworddaro<0xC4><0x9F>lu couple greeted the hall.
There was no evidence of the discipline seen in the AK Party councils in the hall.
Even as Swordsman spoke, there was a great deal of movement in the area on the field part of Arena.
Obviously, the CHP members who wanted to enter the Party Assembly preferred to seek support by telling party leaders and journalists themselves.
A CHP leader tried to tell us that “it is better for the figure parties, like party meetings in Korea or the Soviet Union, to sit down like ropes and sit still” than to say that this is not a bad situation.
There is another difference between the CHP board, AK Party or MHP boards.
In these parties, only general presidents speak.
In CHP, the board turns into a platform where party issues are also discussed.
As the number of parties who wanted to speak in the council increased yesterday, President Murat Karayal<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> had trouble adjusting the time.
In the faces and languages, there was also a distance against the commentary, "The country is going bad" and "you change the way you go with the picture that will come out of this hall."
While all CHPs were saying "something should be done," there was no consistent and strong answer to the question "what should be done."
This has had a huge impact on the fact that no elections will be made in the next four years.
When S<0xC4><0x83>l<0xC4><0x83><0xC3><0xA7>daro<0xC4><0x9F>lu came out, we journalists were waiting for him to answer the question “What to do”.
First, Swordsman answered the question “What’s going on?”
He drew attention to the issue of detained journalists, to what was done to academics, to what was happening in the Southeast, to the emergence of foreign policy.
The CHP has long responded to the "Anadolu legends" of the party, such as the "party of the elites", "supports the workers", and "the party of the elites".
When it came to the “what to do” phase, he tried to put forward a “strategic” instead of talking about concrete steps.
He stressed that he could deal with all these issues with more justice than with a stronger democracy.
He also made a promise on behalf of the CHP and said, "We will do whatever it takes until we bring democracy."
“We will fight to the death for democracy,” he said.
One last note is that the CHP has dealt with the issue of “organization” since the 53rd board, and is now able to gather it to the board without any problems.
Meanwhile, cards were printed for 900 journalists who were told to follow the establishment, but the journalist's attendance in the hall was not at that level.
Representatives of media organizations in Ankara were not as willing as they were on the AK Party boards to follow the establishment.
Self-government was more difficult
When the Prosecutor General of the Republic of Diyarbak<0xC4><0xB1>r prepared the allegation concerning 3 of the 7 detainees, the 4th Court of Severe Punishment was accepted.
In the allegation, on the instructions and calls of senior managers of the PKK/KCK terrorist organization, "government" in some districts and neighborhoods of Diyarbak<0xC4><0xB1>r, <0xC4><0xB0>stanbul, <0xC5><0x9E><0xC4><0xB1>rnak, Mardin, Mu<0xC5><0x9F>, Hakkari, Siirt, Bitlis, Batman, Van and A<0xC4><0x9F>r<0xC4><0xB1>.
In the allegation that there are calls for illegal actions of youth and women with the leaders of the organization, Diyarbak<0xC4><0xB1>r’s Sur, B<0xC4><0xB1>glar, Silvan, Bismil, Lice, Dicle and Hazro, to the security forces and agencies of the trade unions in the provinces of the provinces of <0xC5><0x9E>al<0xC4><0xB1>l<0xC4><0xB1>.
ISIS clashed with the rebels, our army was shot.
Conflicts between Düden, Black Mezra B<0xC4><0xB1>g<0xC4><0xB1>d<0xC4><0xB1>n and ISIS and opposition groups in Syria’s Düden, opposite the Yavuzlu Village of Kilis, continue to intensify in recent days.
The sound of weapons and airstrikes fired during the clashes between ISIS and the rebels near the border is also heard by Turkey.
The smoke rising from the areas where the frequent explosions occurred was seen naked by Turkey, while the security forces on the border took intensive precautions with armoured vehicles.
On the other hand, harassment fire broke out from the village of B<0xC4><0xB1>g<0xC4><0xB1>d<0xC4><0xB1>n, controlled by ISIS militants, near the village of Yavuzlu in Kilis.
Under the rules of engagement on this, the soldiers responded to the area where the harassment fire broke out with snipers and heavy weapons.
It is alleged that Russian warplanes attacked the village of Hameyin, 17 kilometers away from the Turkish border.
Six Syrians injured in the air bombing were taken to Kilis State Hospital for treatment by relatives.
Lotto has taken their checks
The Robinson couple, who lived in a small home worth $150,000 in Munford, Tennessee, chose to receive a single payment of $328 million (about TL1 billion) over a total of $528.8 million (TL1.6 billion) over a period of 29 years.
The couple said, "We don't have any guarantees tomorrow."
John Robinson, who works in a chain of stores, and his wife Lisa, who works as an assistant to a dermatologist, said they would be in business on Monday despite being a millionaire.
The couple primarily aims to pay off their home loan debt with the money they earn and to help their loved ones.
It was announced that the grand prize was divided into three.
iOS9: How to get the new iPhone operating system, Apple update released
By going to the Settings app for the new operating system, you can tap "Restore" and select "Software Update".
When you’re ready, your phone will offer you the option to download and install.
Some users encountered an issue after this installation and received an error message saying "Software update failed".
To overcome this problem, it is recommended that users wait for the system to load downwards or try iTunes and try to upgrade from there.
The phone will guide you for the rest of the process.
It might also be deleting apps to make room for it – but Apple has reduced the update to prevent this from happening and is using a special tool for reinstalling it when the process is over.
It’s worth making sure that your phone is charging or is next to a charger so that your battery doesn’t run out while you’re upgrading.
If the charge is too low, Apple won’t let you update, as the phone may stop halfway through the update.

At the same time, you need to make sure that you do everything you can before you start downloading; if something goes wrong, you should try to stop and protect it. iOS 9 is a smarter personal assistant and brings new production features to the iPad, which speeds up the operating system and fine-tunes it.
FedEx’s revenues are mixed, financial outlook will fall in 2016
FedEx has reported disappointing results over the past three months, and the cargo giant has lowered its year-round profit forecast due to the drop in demand for cargo services and rising costs in ground services.
The company also said it plans to hire around 55,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
Last year, FedEx announced it would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
In the pre-opening operations, about 2.5 per cent fell from Wednesday’s opening gong 45 minutes before the opening.
FedEx Corp. said earnings are expected to be between $10.40 and $10.90 in the fiscal year ending in May, which is 20 cents less than previous estimates.
Analysts were expecting $10.84 based on a survey conducted by FactSet.
The average increase of 4.9 per cent to be valid on January 4 seems likely, despite the high surcharges that will start in November in heavy or large parcels of land transportation.
According to the company, cost cuts are expected to be higher than in the previous year, and earnings from the growth of e-commerce are still expected to be higher than in the previous year.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said the company "shows solid performance, especially in manufacturing and global commerce, despite weak economic conditions expected".
The holiday plans were announced one day after rival UPS, according to which UPS plans to hire 90,000 to 95,000 additional workers in the same number as last year.
Over the three-month period ended August 31, FedEx earned $692 million in revenues by 6% compared to the previous year.
Earnings per share, Zacks Investment Research’s 12 analysts’ estimates stayed behind $2.44, at $2.42.
Revenue increased 5% to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts interviewed by Zacks were expecting $12.23 billion.
FedEx hit a decline in international priority shipping last year, which led to a stagnant revenue in the Express unit.
However, the explosion in online shopping has boosted the results of FedEx Ground Services.
In the last quarter, land services revenue increased by 29% but business revenues stopped mainly due to large packages and high costs in internal insurance.
The express unit saw high revenues due to high base rates while its high labour costs fell in the freight business.
In pre-opening transactions about an hour before the opening gong, FedEx shares fell to $150.15, down 3.85 or 2.5%.
They closed Tuesday by 11% for the year and by 17% below the record level on June 11.
At its most anticipated meetings for years, Federal Reserve politicians decided this week that it was time to raise the interest rate almost ten times over the last decade, spending two days around a 27-foot Honda maze this week.
The two-story meeting room, located on a wing of the central bank, will be a wall image of the United States.
A reminder that the Fed’s Women’s President Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues held the economic interests of the nation above everything else.
There are two tasks that the central bank takes over from Congress: to maximize U.S. employment and to keep prices here stable.
But since the Great Depression, Fed leaders have acknowledged that there is a third non-written mandate: financial balance.
And this third quarter, which will be announced on Thursday, could be a factor X in a decision too close to predicting whether the U.S. economy is ready to start cutting its unique stimulus support from a near-zero short-term interest rate since the end of 2008.
While most data shows that the economy is growing solidly, the latest turmoil in global financial markets could make cautious Fed officials shy of adding fragility by benchmarking federal fund interest rates—even at less than a quarter—increased.
“Obviously, the labour market and inflation will be the first and most important thing they see,” said Stifel Nicolaus & Co’s chief economist Lindsey M. Pigza.
"But I think if they're looking for an excuse not to increase the rate, the increasing uncertainty surrounding the global market will give them enough reason to wait a little longer," he said.
There is no consensus on what the Fed will do, and this in itself leads to fluctuations in the financial markets.
More recently, half of the economists Bloomberg has been expecting an interest rate hike this week.
However, the financial markets expect the Fed to remain waiting along with the main indicator, which shows a probability of an increase of only about 30%.
If the Fed increases the rate, policy makers may signal a decline in the stock market if they do not mitigate the effect by promising that another increase could be on the way.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industry index average rose by 228.89 points or 1.4% to 16,599.85.
John Lonski, chief economist at Moody’s Capital Markets Research Group, said: “The rate of the Fed policymakers is set to stay steady this week.
"It would be surprising if Fed were to increase rates right now," he said.
If Fed executives had decided in this direction, “they would have to take a long year to calm the financial markets so that they wouldn’t panic.”
Other experts have suggested that a rate increase could calm financial markets due to the rise of the Fed’s cloud curtain over when it will take action.
Just a month ago, the Fed appeared to be on track to increase the rate by 0.25% this month, which would be a small step towards a slower tightening of monetary conditions that would strengthen the U.S. recovery.
Yellen said that despite liberals' complaints about the need for a more economical process, he expects this year's rate to rise in the spring and early summer.
Although the rate of job creation declined in August, growth in the labor market has stabilized this year.
Last month, the unemployment rate fell to its lowest level of 5.1% in seven years and came close to the Fed’s full-time employment level.
Salary increases showed signs of improvement.
And even though the inflation central bank continues to watch below its annual target of 2%, Fed politicians said the temporary effect of sharply falling oil prices was a major cause.
Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the economy “can cope with higher rates and needs it despite the scarcity in the labor market.”
However, the world’s financial markets began to shake after China’s currency devaluation at the end of last month.
The Dow Jones industrial index average fell below 16% of the May record due to fears that a slowing Chinese economy will slow down global growth.
The market jumped back somehow when the Dow was now below its May high of nearly 10 percent.
For Fed policy makers, the market shake makes it even more complicated to calculate the time the interest rate will increase.
Stephen D. Oliner, a senior research associate at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate, and former Fed official, said: “The lack of knowledge of the financial markets in the Chinese economy over the past few weeks and the lack of news of economic weakening may have narrowed down at this meeting.
He now predicts they will wait at least another month to better manage these effects.
“There is a lot of uncertainty about what will be the impact on the U.S. economy, and they have hardly any data to rely on China’s advances to date,” Oliner said.
The health of the global economy is not one of the Fed’s top concerns, so it should not have an impact on the technical blackout process.
In fact, the Fed has become the world’s monetary authority.
The central bank has had a huge impact in recent years.
Until then, President Ben S. Bernanke’s only hint was that the Fed could “reduce” the monetary expansion triggered by global market turmoil in 2013.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly revolving around each other, Fed officials can be expected to not only follow developments elsewhere, but also consult other central bank managers and experts to better read the global economy.
Zachary Karabell, head of global strategy for asset management firm Investnet Inc., said the decision-making process was “a lot more talented than science.”
The Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Vice President Jeffrey Lacker noted this month that “the Fed has overreacted in the past to financial market movements that are invisible to economic foundations.”
For example, Lacker, who is a member of the policy-making Federal Open Markets Committee that has the right to vote and is pushing for a rate increase, referred to decisions 1998-99.
“Despite limited identifiable advice for U.S. growth,” Lacker said, “the financial crisis in Asia caused the Fed to cut the index by 0.75% over the course of three meetings.”
A year later, Fed officials took back these cuts.
Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England’s rate-setting committee, said “The Fed should only put its financial balance concerns ahead during major crises, as in the 2008 market meltdown.”
He said the final shake wasn't approaching that level.
You really don’t want to stay in case you’re afraid of going to a rate increase because the markets are sluggish, said Peterson, President of the International Institute of Economics Posen.
The Central Bank Act still has two powers and does not mention financial equilibrium, and I do not think they should act in this direction until this changes.

Rio Grande Pediatric Society of Brazil Promotes Healthy Nutrition During Breastfeeding
The Brazilian pediatrics organization SPRS has applied a shocking method to describe the importance of healthy nutrition in women’s breastfeeding processes by placing pictures of the unhealthy diet pictured in a child’s milk.
Human milk is made up of many types of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates, which provides babies with all the nutrients they need to develop a healthy immune system.
Pregnant women and new mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake to around 500 calories because of their energy requirements.
However, according to new research, the food supplement that mothers need to take isn’t just limited to calorie intake.
According to a new study led by Robert Waterland, Professor of Texas Baylor College of Medicine, the healthy nutrition of pregnant women has protected them from tumor development by influencing the genetic expression of their babies.
Unfortunately, unhealthy eating has been found to negatively affect the child’s immune system.
Seven's Sunrise Remains Leading in Ratings Despite Nine's Efforts to Take Leadership in Today Show
The moves Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson made to Canberra to overthrow the leadership of the Liberals have failed to provide a rating increase for Today.
After Tony Abbott's fall of Malcolm Turnbull, Nine's breakfast show was staged in the national capital.
Hosted by David Koch and Samantha Armytage in London, Rival Sunrise is among the weekly international series including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
As the distance problem doesn’t make much difference to Australian viewers, Sunrise has an average of 397,000 viewers in five capitals, up from today’s 339,000.
Compared to Tuesday (283,000) on Monday (317,000) today, it recorded a slight increase in ratings, but the figure was still behind last Thursday (343,000).
He's been shutting down Sunrise for the last few months.
In August, the Sunrise averaged 318,000, compared to 330,000 today.
At the beginning of the year, the difference was between 40,000 and 50,000.
As of September, the Sunrise average is 349,000, up from today’s 314,000.
That's the most interesting thing about all mornings.
The winds of change are affecting the party more than the parliament this morning!
Karl and Lisa are good, thank you for asking!

The big news for Seven was the breathtaking beginning of the 800 Words by former Packed to the Rafters star Erik Thomson.
The new drama about a newly wedded father and his two children’s decision to move to the seaside in New Zealand has reached a very impressive average with 1,219 million.
Critics have questioned whether Thomson could perform a solo show without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
Last night's result was a blatant "yes" answer.
Seven's X Factor retained its power with 1,136 million viewers, easily defeating Block (838,000) and the TBL Families (726,000).
Seven Two Tracks- He mixed his luck with Australia.
The first half-hour of the new information contest hosted by Andrew O'Keefe (17:00-17:30) reached an average of 446,000 viewers.
In the second half of the hour (17:30-18:00) the figure jumped to 623,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Eddie McGuire's Hot Seat (613,000).
Monday Night Follow-Australia's first half-hour averaged 520,000 viewers, rising to 720,000 per second half-hour.
The hot seat had an average of 620,000.
Following Australia's second night rating decline, Nine thought the Hot Seat would give him an edge at 5.30.
Following Australia was a change made to the Million Dollar Minute that didn't catch a tooth on McGuire's show.

The last three people think Single Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose?
Has the secret come out?
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay, and Snezana Markoski may have revealed who will win the Prize without realizing it.
At the end of Sam Wood's single show, the woman he chose was in great secrecy.
And the other three girls are doing their best not to tell you who the last rose area is.
But if we check out Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski the day before the three men fell in love, they may have given a clue as to who the winner will be.
Sam Wood sealed his mouth until Thursday's final.
The three women also explained why Wood was perfect in a lyrical language, emphasizing his humorous ability, ambition, family values, and positive attitude, and why they wanted to be his partner.
But the answers to the question, “If not you, who should get Wood’s last rose?” may contain information about who will win The Bachelor’s heart.
Both the Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski quickly named Mackay the best candidate for Wood except themselves.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have been very close since day one.
Jeavons-Fellows said: "From the moment I got home, I felt like they were right for each other by reading [Sarah's] energy and Sam's energy, and that's what I thought throughout the show."
Markoski added, “Sarah is a very practical person, it’s fun to be around her.”
I saw them together, and there was a chemistry between them.
They feel so good and comfortable sitting next to each other.
Sarah Mackay thinks she and Sam Wood will be a very well-understanding couple.
Mackay said last week's home visits made him think Wood was the "right person".
“When I saw him with my friends and family, I realized it was definitely not just a game – I’m totally attached to him now,” he said.
Otherwise, when asked who Wood could choose, it was a mystery.
"I don't know if I can say that," he said.
"I love other girls equally - Snezana and Lana are equal."
The Bachelor will air on the Ten channel on Wednesday at 7.30 p.m.
First post: Is Sarah the best choice for Sam Wood?
Jarryd Hayne had a variety of options in terms of where to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle themselves showed a lot of interest in him after moving to the U.S. and after last year’s impressive open training day, many other teams approached him.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula, which seems like a very wise decision.
Some coaches put Hayne back on the bench as he lost his performance in the Australian rugby league, as in a 20-3 win over Minnesota on Tuesday.
But Tomsula believed this man and gave Hayne another chance to play in a game after Reggie Bush's disability.
After the game, Tomsula continued to show her true color to the dressing room.
Instead of humiliating them in front of the whole team, he gave them courage.
Tomsula also clearly supported Hayne at the post-match press conference.
49ers team reporter Cam Inman said Hayne also took courage from special team coordinator Thomas McGaughey and was advised to forget this fall and think about the next game.
Jarryd Hayne caused the Minnesota Vikings to score in the first quarter and dropped the ball
This was not what Hayne and his wide Australian fan base dreamed of for the first game in the NFL.
Hayne was spotted scoffing as he stepped out of the field after dropping the ball, and later told Australian radio duo Hamish and Andy that he could not think of a worse start for his NFL career in 2DayFM 104.1.
Hayne said, "It was just one of those things, you're going to regret the next game, and that's it."
Hayne also recalled the first match of Origin in 2007 with his back-to-back score for Queensland.
It was a great experience for the 27-year-old.
Hayne posted a pose taken after the game while holding an Australian flag with fans on Instagram.

Police say four people have died as a result of a plastic bullet in protesters in Nepal
An official said on Wednesday that four people, including a four-year-old boy, were killed as police opened fire on a crowd protesting against the country’s proposed new constitution.
The incident took place on Tuesday evening in the city of Rupandehi, 175 miles west of the capital, Kathmandu.
District chief official Bishnu Prasad Dhakal said more than 1,000 phase protesters gathered outside a police station and some dropped stone and fire bombs.
Mr. Dhakal said that the police used pepper gas before using plastic bullets and fired into the air.
He said twenty policemen and five civilians were injured.
It’s not clear why the plastic bullets used are known to kill, but usually because they’re a less deadly alternative, resulting in such a high mortality rate.
The conflict has been the latest in weeks of violent protests across the southern plains of Nepal, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group argue that the regions created by the proposed new constitution will mirror their own political influence.
The Tharus ethnic group, which wants to establish its own states, is also holding protests in western Nepal.
In the violent clashes that have continued since August 10, at least 40 people have lost their lives, including 11 police officers.
At that time, the four major political parties had agreed to divide the country into regions – an important but creative step in the preparation of a new constitution in Nepal, which has been governed by the central state for centuries.
Work on a new constitution has been ongoing since 2008, but lawmakers accelerated this period following the devastating earthquake that occurred in April and killed thousands of people.
Lawmakers have been working on draft constitutional provisions in Kathmandu this week, and officials have said the new text will be put in place until Sunday.
NHC Says 60 Percent Possibility of Hurricanes in South Cape Verde Islands
On Tuesday, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said the Cape Verde Islands south end of a vast low-pressure system of 350 miles (560 km) south is 60 percent likely to turn into a tropical hurricane in the next 48 hours.
Another well-defined low-pressure system was also seen between the Cape Verde Islands and the Little Antilles, and the Miami-based weather forecast center said there was a 60 percent chance of a tropical storm occurring within the next two days.
Google launches donation matching campaign to raise $11 million for refugees
Google Inc. (GOOGL.O) has announced a donation campaign aimed at raising $11 million for humanitarian organizations that have helped thousands of refugees who have fled their war-damaged and impoverished countries to Europe.
Google announced on its blog a donation attempt with an unexpected personal approach.
Instead of an executive making this statement, Rita Masoud, a Google employee who escaped from Kabul with her family when she was seven years old, wrote her own personal experience.
“There were plenty of dark bus and train trips on our journey, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and fear,” he wrote.
I was lucky.
But because the refugee and migrant crisis in Europe is growing, many families, like my family, need help.
Donations will go to four non-profit organizations that help refugees and migrants: Doctors Without Borders, the International Rescue Committee, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said it would match the first $5.5 million donation to google.com/refugeelief until it raised $11 million.
Europe is facing the worst refugee crisis since World War II, the biggest cause of this year’s four-year Syrian civil war, which has displaced more than 4 million people.
Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya, which have been damaged by many wars, are also fleeing.

Weight loss surgery can help in diabetic patients who are moderately obese
According to a new study, it may take at least five years to see the benefits of obesity surgery in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
But it’s still too early to say whether moderately obese diabetic patients lived longer compared to non-surgical patients after obesity surgery.
According to Dr. Robin Blackstone, who wrote an article in a new study on JAMA surgery and who specializes in obesity surgery, “it takes a long time for death rates to manifest themselves.”
Weight loss surgery, or bariatric surgery, uses a variety of methods to reduce the diameter of the stomach.
These reduce hunger and limit the body’s ability to digest food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has been proven to be effective in treating type 2 diabetes, but most of the research was done on advanced-grade obese people with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or over.
Measured by the kilogram size ratio, a BMI of between 18.5 and 24.9 is considered normal.
A BMI of 25 or more indicates that a person is overweight, while a BMI of 30 or more is considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI from the following link: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
In the new study, Taiwan's full-fledged Min-Sheng Hospital has been using two types of bariatric surgery that have been used to treat patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus since 2007 - gastric bowel and tube abdominal surgery.
From the end of the fifth year of the study, the average BMI of those who had surgery decreased from 31 to 24.5.
The BMIs of those who have undergone surgical treatment for non-diabetes remained stable at around 29.
Diabetes has been partially resolved in 36% of those undergoing surgery and in 28% of those undergoing surgery.
In the medically-treated group, diabetes was only partially resolved in 1% and only in 2%, compared to that.
Also, according to the authors, blood pressure control, triglycerides and “bad” LDL cholesterol were generally better in the “surgical intervention group.”
Researchers have also shown blood levels of A1c hemoglobin, which reflects blood sugar levels in patients over time.
According to the researchers, it is best to keep A1c haemoglobin below 7%.
Post-surgery A1c haemoglobin decreased from an average of 9% to about 6%.
In the group that received medical treatment, it remained stable at around 8 percent.
However, with corrected A1c hemoglobin levels, this better “glycemic control” did not reduce the mortality rate within these five years, according to Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his teammates conducting the study.
The research team compared the findings obtained with these two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, the group who had surgery on the abdominal cavity lost more weight (18.7 to 14.2 kg), had a higher decrease in BMI (7.4 to 5.1) and A1c haemoglobin (3.1% to 2.1%) and had a higher risk of declining than the group who had surgery on the stomach, and had a higher chance of 16% (over 7%, with a higher risk of declination than the whole of their diabetes).
While the research did not indicate a clear benefit for survival after the fifth year, Dr. Blackstone, from the Arizona College of Medicine-Phoenix, said that according to a study conducted in weightier patients in Sweden, the surgery extended the lifespan.
In this Swedish study, the probability of dying in 15 years of obese patients who had bariatric surgery was 29 percent lower compared to another group who had received more traditional treatment.
While this new study has not shown what the benefits of survival of patients with surgery are, it is a refreshing condition for people with the subject and under BMI 35, according to Blackstone.
The most heartbreaking part of the article is here too, because in a group with a low BMI, it says that this surgery is safe, there has been no increase in the risk of death or kidney problems, he said.
Blackstone added that people and doctors should start taking the issue of weight gain seriously with the patient’s BMI falling below 27 to 30.
“I think we waited long enough for people to take this matter seriously,” he said.
I think it's really hard to reverse it after you've collected these genetic changes that make your bodies associated with obesity and diabetes.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
The Dalai Lama, who said Europe could not host all refugees, added that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader called for an end to violence in the refugee countries.
At the start of his 10-day visit to the United Kingdom, the Dalai Lama pointed to the ongoing refugee crisis during the opening speech of the Dalai Lama Centre for Ethical Affairs in Oxford.
Under the present circumstances, he argued that the interests of nations or continents should be put at the forefront of the interests of humanity.
At the same time, although appreciated, he also stressed that the responses of countries in Western Europe to the refugee crisis are inadequate in this regard.
In his speech, he said, “It’s impossible for everyone to come to Europe.”
Although he appreciates the efforts of Germany and Austria to deal with the crisis, the Dalai Lama has said that these are only a temporary solution.
“It’s great to care for a few thousand refugees, but you also have to think about long-term solutions; you have to think about how you can bring lasting peace and sustainable development to these Muslim countries through education,” he said.
We need to think about how to reduce deaths in our country.
We must reduce the use of force.
“The use of force has never solved the problems,” he added.
Referring to the issue of violence, the Dalai Lama also pointed out what George Bush did after the 9/11 attacks, and said that the U.S. is launching an uncontrollable chain of events involving violence.
In my letter to President Bush after September 11th, I sent out my health wishes and stated that the way to solve this problem was through non-violent methods.
“I know his songs are well-intentioned, but he used force and caused unexpected results,” the Dalai Lama said.
4-fold increase in ingestion of hand antiseptics seen in children in the last 4 years
Toxic control centers in the United States have reported an increase of nearly 400 percent in alcohol-containing wet wipe intakes in children under the age of 12 since 2010.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Center, the number of cases of hand-swallowing antiseptics reported to the center in children under 12 years of age rose from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
Lopez told CNN: “Children have become more susceptible to such products, and unfortunately, there are percentages among them that need to be removed from the emergency.”
Some children said they drank hand antiseptics knowingly, while others did so in influencing their friends or claiming to be on social media.
Videos on YouTube show teens taking antiseptics for low-cost intoxication.
Some adolescents have been reported to mix the antiseptic mixture with alcohol-containing mouthwash to get a harder intake.
Young children can be attracted to their attractive antiseptic odors.
Lopez said, "The kid doesn't think it's a bad thing."
Most of the more attractive ones (hand antiseptics) are smelly ones.
There are hand antiseptics with strawberries, grapes and orange aromas that are extremely appealing to children.
Hand antiseptics contain between 45 and 95 percent alcohol, regardless of where they are.
Especially in young children, it can cause only a few rushes of alcohol to be poisoned.
According to Dr. Stephen Thornton, president of the University of Kansas Hospital poisoning center, it is “highly concentrated alcohol.”
You don’t leave a few glasses of whiskey around, but people leave these hand-held antiseptics high, and this is an easy way for kids to get a lot of alcohol.
Recently, six-year-old Nhaijah Russell, who swallowed only four strawberry-scented hand antiseptics at school, was urgently removed for treatment.
According to Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency care doctor at the Gwinnett Medical Center outside of Atlanta, the rate of alcohol in his blood was 0.179 times the legal alcohol limit accepted in an adult.
Nhaijah could not pronounce the words and could not walk when he came to the emergency room.
According to Rithey, as alcohol caused the little girl to fall and hit her head, doctors kept her under observation at a separate children's hospital overnight despite any symptom of brain trauma.
In a statement to CNN, Mother Ortoria Scott said it was “very scary.”
It could have been deadly for my child.
Lopez advised parents and teachers to use non-alcoholic products or keep the skin-skinned contact of antiseptic wipes brief and remove them to places where children could not reach.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some antiseptics were found to be associated with deaths.
In 2013, two women from Ontario died from swallowing a hand antiseptic containing a toxic substance that was not named in its contents.
Health officials argued that the substance in question could be methyl alcohol, not ethyl alcohol, as stated in the list of ingredients, but with a lethal effect.
In January, four-year-old students from northern New York City had conspired to "place antibacterial products around the classroom" to poison their "bad-hearted" teachers, according to police reports.
The teacher banned it in the classroom because he was highly allergic to hand antiseptics.
The plan, which was passed before the police, described it as "a futile attempt" and proposed disciplinary punishment to the school administration.
Come to Samantha, too.

He said, "I'm waiting for you at Samantha."
Kahpe Peaks are innocuous
I am a humanist today.
I want no deaths.
But what is possible!
This world is cruel.
You'll love the hood.
There is death in fate.
It's painful.
It's a space invasion.
And lightning strikes.
Sometimes it's a space shuttle.
Maybe a meteor.
I'm not saying there's no death.
I'm not saying let's drop our signature.
Let's get our reaction.
Let's say, you bastards, don't you bastards!
You're our humanist.
Shame on the community.
But he's not embarrassed, damn it!
Two weeks ago, they killed Miray <0xC4><0xB0>nce in <0xC5><0x9E><0xC4><0xB1>rnak's Sur Neighborhood.
It's only been three months.
His grandfather was with him.
They killed him, too.
What can we say, what a terrible disaster! On January 3, they killed Yusuf the Nazarite in Silopi.
I think he was running away from aliens.
They were searching for a safe place for him.
He had his wife with him.
One day later, in Diyarbak<0xC4><0xB1>r, on Little Moved Street, they killed Angel Alpayd<0xC4><0xB1>n at the breakfast table.

Who's the culprit?
Felek, of course.
Kahpe fellas.
No, it's not a disaster.
Kahpe is innocent!
The killer's out there, shakes his arm and looks at our face and smiles.
Some people are trying to get their attention in a different direction.
While the killer is in front of our eyes, the killer creates opportunities for him to escape instead of pointing at him.
The killer's getting smarter.
He's hiding it.
Even after he's lost his sight, he tells her that what he's up to is not actually his fault.
The sides of the fight we've been having in the last 10 years are very clear.
Somebody narrows the circle of fire around us and wants us to burn.
And someone's trying to stop it, to put out the fire around us.
It's about breaking someone down, it's about raining.
To make someone, to produce.
We have people who have seen all kinds of wars in our region.
The Civil War.
The interstate war.
Battle of the Mezzeps.
The War of the Vecals.
And they've got transporters.
Dirty terrorist organizations.
Hand-blooded legends.
In different names, in different formats.
Turkey has no choice but to fight with each of these.
He's fighting, and that's why he's in a position to be in charge of everyone's shit.
Keep fighting until you're sure of your lines...
There were no traitors, they took refuge in white robes.
Members of the terrorist organization PKK, which is stuck in the corner between the neighborhood, find the solution mixing with white flags and fleeing among the citizens.
The security forces are implementing GBT to prevent infiltration.
The activism of the organization, which has suffered a major blow in the countryside and abroad, which began on July 23, is also breaking the power of action in the districts that are unable to act.
According to information obtained from sources in the region, the organization's weapons and ammunition depot in Silopi was seized and rendered ineffective.
Some of the citizens fleeing PKK attacks are moving away from the checkpoints of police and soldiers with white flags in their hands.
The terrorists, stuck between the streets and unable to find a point of escape, began to confuse the citizens with a white flag.
The security units are conducting a General Information Gathering (GBT) interrogation of suspects.
In Silopi, it was reported that a PKK terrorist was interfering with the public with the white flag, but when he realized that he would be caught during the GBT interrogation, he tried to escape and was rendered ineffective.
COMMANDOLS MAY BE PROVIDED
From the carefully monitored districts in the region, soldiers and police also struck a major blow to the terrorist organization in Cizre.
The Yafes neighborhood, where the militias were housed, is reportedly largely cleaned up.
Teams consisting of police and gendarmes special operations units, completed their duties and left their places to the commanders.
Commanders in the Yafes District are also taking precautions to prevent terrorists from re-infiltrating.
In other districts, it was stated that security in neighborhoods where teams have cleared from terrorists will be left to the commandos.
Police and soldiers 1 ton baklava
The Municipality of Kilis sent 1 ton of copper to special operations police and soldiers, who served in difficult conditions in Cizre, Sur and Silopi.
Mayor Hassan Kara said: "May the Lord give strength and strength to our security forces who protect their homeland and their nation by serving in difficult conditions."
He said, "We pray for God's mercy to our people, and for our people to be healed."
The squirrels told us the night of horror
The squirrels reacted strongly to the attack.
Most of the houses around the lodges where the explosion occurred became uninhabitable.
Emin Altun<0xC3><0xA7>, a resident of the neighborhood, said: “My son was injured, but we couldn’t leave the house because there were gunfire.
Within an hour, I was able to take my son to the hospital.”
Sabiha <0xC3><0x96>zcan, who said his wife was injured, said: “My wife was injured in the explosion while sleeping in the room.
He came by dragging me to the door.”
It was in the blood.
“I’m damned for this,” he said.
Fourteen people died on the road.
A bus carrying skiers from Japan's ski areas in Karuizawa was wrecked, losing control.
Twenty-seven people were injured in the crash, including 14 people.

The 50-kilometer concrete road has been demolished and sold!
Alexander Protopopov, the head of a prison in Russia’s Koni region, was arrested on charges of selling a 50-kilometer concrete road on the highway.
Between 2010 and 2015, it was announced that Protopopov had earned $80,000 (243,000 TL) in this method, by removing and selling some of the concrete laid on the highway using its position.
7,750 euros for 15 million lire
A woman named Viola Colombo, who lives in Venice, Italy, has earned the right to convert the 15 million lire she found in an old box she bought from e-bay, a promotional website on the Internet.
Colombo, who bought a few euros in 2014, had been turned back by the Central Bank for wanting to convert the former Italian currency into euros.
Colombo will receive 7,750 euros (about 26,000 TL), which the court finds justified.
Apply to UNESCO for an island that does not enter women
Japan has applied for the Okinoshima Island, which is only allowed to be trampled by men due to its temples, to be included in the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2017.
However, the island’s pastoral class opposes this decision with concern for the ‘Tourist future’.
Saudi Arabia has not given up on TUBITAK
The Minister of Science, Industry and Technology I<0xC5><0x9F><0xC4><0xB1>k, Turkey Scientific and Technical Research Institute (TUB<0xC4><0xB0>TAK) has signed a new agreement for the sale of the Ballistic Image Analysis and Recognition System (BALISTIKA) to Saudi Arabia, which will be issued by the Ministry of Science, Industry and Technology.
Light was found in the descriptions of BALISTAK, developed by the Institute for Space Technologies Research.
The Light, which explains that the system’s ballistic examinations of weapons, bullet cores and buckets captured in the incidents provide a comparison with the data in the central database, so that the problems encountered by ballistic experts while studying the bucket and the bullet cores have been eliminated.
The light expressed that the data and accompanying information obtained from different geographic locations can be stored together by means of BALISTAK.
Bearing in mind that one of the most important features of BALISTIKA is the ability to obtain and display more detailed and less error-producing three-dimensional data, the Light is able to quickly influence the decisions of the ballistics expert thanks to the innovations brought by the system and increase its success rate.
Ballistics exported under the "SUBA-1 Project"
I<0xC5><0x9F><0xC4><0xB1>k noted that BALISTIKA met all the criteria in its performance metrics and received full grades from the Directorate-General for Security, and that the system established in 10 separate regions, including Ankara, covers all of Turkey.
Recalling that the system was opened abroad as a result of the success of the system, I<0xC5><0x9F><0xC4><0xB1>k recalled that BALISTA was exported within the scope of the "SUBA-1 Project" carried out by Saudi Arabia and that it was successfully completed in 6 regions in 2013.
The light indicates that BALISTAKA has made another new agreement for the sale of a second party to Saudi Arabia, indicating that the SUBA-2, which is a continuation of the SUBA-1, has been signed, will be released from the agreement, which covers the development and installation of an additional 8 systems.
Bus-sized crocodile fossil found
The prehistoric sea crocodile was reported to have found 10 meters in length and 3 tons in weight.
The length of the skull was only measured as 1.6 meters.
The researchers named the species "Machimosaurus rex" and published the findings in the journal Cretaceous Research.
Federico Fanti of the University of Bologna, the author of the paper, said the fossil, which is thought to be 130 million years old, is “almost the size of a bus.”
Speaking to the Washington Post, Fanti said the giant saltwater crocodile "was at least at the top of a certain area of the food chain at that time."
Paleontologists have revealed that M. rex, believed to be the largest sea turtle in the world, was hunted by poaching in lagoons.
The largest freshwater crocodile in history is believed to be the Sarcosuchus emperor, who lived in Africa and South America 110 million years ago and could reach 12 meters in length and weigh 8 tons.
They're all so fucked up!
The author Ece Temelkuran's first book from 1996, 'All Women's Head Is Confused', was adapted into the theater by the Aysa Production Theatre of the same name.
Sea <0xC3><0x87>ak<0xC4><0xB1>r, Zeynep Kankonde, Silk Turktan Bronk, Kadir <0xC3><0x87>ermik and <0xC5><0x9E>ebnem Sönmez direct the play Selen U<0xC3><0xA7>er.
The game, where U<0xC3><0xA7>er, who continues to play 'Poz' and 'Dry Hard' for the first time, has had the experience of writing and directing, questions the confusion in women's minds.
The game met with an audience at the Trump Show Center last week.
The play begins with the radio theater.
In the dark, a voice that takes us to the past years...
Then the curtain opens.
A woman standing by the window, jumping down.
It is understood that who he is and why he is committing suicide is interfering with his neighbours.
ONE MEKTUP BURACKES
'Ebru Uysal', which is animated by Sea Chakra, is a popular writer.
She was abandoned by her husband, but that's not the only reason.
There have been things in it since he was a child.
His lack of fatherly love, his exclusion from his student life, his lonely childhood, his misunderstanding of relationships, brought him to this point.
He decided to commit suicide by leaving a letter behind, but he can't jump out the window.
Because the mysterious woman 'Perran' (Sebnem Sönmez), who sits in the apartment opposite the toilet and the cleaner 'Aysel' (Zeynep Kankonde), is ridiculed.
They're getting closer to the normal, normal process.
She's getting more backwards and can't concentrate.
The conversation between the three of them, when the famous singer "Meltem Kaya" who cleaned his house, (Ipek Türktan Kayanak) joins the event, turns into a full curcumin.
Approaching the situation in a na<0xC3><0xAF>ve and intimate way, 'Meltem' can't sing himself when he sees the crowd below.
This interesting suicide attempt gains a different dimension when the landlord enters the girl’s house with the spare key ‘Murat’ (Kadir Cermik).
Singer 'Meltem's lying to the press is getting out of the way.
In the game, Nazan Precel's song 'The Street Girl' is also used.
BUNALIM GOLDEN TURKEY
The first-time director, U<0xC3><0xA7>er, managed to ensure the pace and fluency of the game.
The comedy load of the game is drawn from Silk Turktan Source with Zeynep Kankonde.
The types of cartoons that the two relive; the necessary mimics, the necessary replicas, manage to make the audience laugh.
While <0xC5><0x9E>ebnem Sönnem brings the experience of the years to the stage very well, Mariz <0xC3><0x87>ak<0xC4><0xB1>r also exhibits a convincing performance in reflecting the depressive mood of 'Ebru Uysal'.
Kadir <0xC3><0x87>ermik, who spoke of Tolga <0xC3><0x87>elik’s award-winning film with her performance in Sarma<0xC5><0x9F><0xC4><0xB1>k, also successfully accompanies these four women.
The one-liner game, described as a comedy, encourages you to laugh without being confused.
Most of the good things I remember from the mouth of 'Perran' played by <0xC5><0x9E>ebnem Sönmez are: They read the script; they see the live of the script.
All the children thought of dying once to punish their mothers and fathers, and for some reason they were always crying at the end of the day.
She hangs in the air like an incomprehensible joke.
She's always looking for a funny story where she forgets her most important place.
In fact, every story begins with a kind of abandonment.
Sometimes I have to put my hands in my pocket; I can't stand pocketless things.
It's amazing where you put your hands.
When we are surprised, our hands multiply.
People who don’t understand what they are talking about, they invent and they invent.
A misunderstanding is real.
All women's heads are confused because they're confused.
Since you can't die, you have a chance to live.
‘Live long for the infidel consumption’
Can be consumed safely at any age
The main ingredient that does not end up counting the health benefits is milk, but more beneficial than milk, which indicates that the miracle nutrient kefir is one of the nutrients that can safely consume at any age, because it is more nutritious than yogurt.
It is also rich in vitamins B1, B12 and K.
Thanks to its calcium and magnesium content, it forms the basis of a healthy nervous system.
It is also a good source of phosphorus.
Kefir, which is also found as a toxin retention feature, also does not lose weight.
"The nutritional value is quite high and will be an easy drink for digestion," he said.
The Third Deva
Expert Dietitian P<0xC4><0xB1>nar Rule En<0xC3><0xA7>, who tells children, the elderly, pregnant women and women who enter menopause can consume kefir without hesitation, "Kefir,essaen will be a local drink made in the Caucasus."
But now he has begun to proclaim his name to the Earth.
The secret of youth is kefir, which has a long and healthy life expectancy, which is huge in almost every problem.
One of the most natural ways to keep babies away from metabolic diseases is kefir.
Friend of the intestines
This unique drink, which does not end up counting the benefits, is a friend of your guts.
Our intestines contain 1.5-2 kilograms of bacteria and fungi.
Microorganisms in the digestive system are also divided into two groups so that they are useful and harmful.
Beneficial microorganisms are called probiotic microorganisms.
The activities of probiotics have as important an effect as our liver, and when consumed enough, it prevents the adhesion and spread of harmful microorganisms in the intestines to the intestinal wall.
Deterioration of the balance of healthy microorganisms in the intestine causes many diseases.
The health of the digestive tract should be maintained in the right way of nutrition.
For this, we should certainly consume enough of the probiotics.
It eliminates these problems in the intestines
Kefir is the most effective nutrient containing probiotic bacteria, and the beneficial bacteria in it have a huge effect on strengthening the intestinal system.
It ensures that the beneficial bacteria and fungi in the intestine can reproduce and be healthy.
With regular use of kefir, the intestines work, intestinal disorders are eliminated, swellings are reduced, and a healthier digestion is achieved.
A healthy gut system means a healthy and disease-free body.
“Insomnia, insomnia, upper respiratory infections and allergies, which are also good for conditions such as kefir, helps to get more quality vitamins and minerals that babies get from nutrients, so it also plays an important role in baby nutrition,” he said.
He wants to move on from where he is.

Mersin <0xC4><0xB0>dmanyurdud, after Nurullah Sa<0xC4><0x9F>lam, will face Be<0xC5><0x9F>ikta<0xC5><0x9F> without a technical director because he has not yet reached an agreement with a new name.
Emotional Letters from Small Students
Diyarbak<0xC4><0xB1>r’s central district of Sur received letters from children in the west to police and soldiers carrying out terrorist operations in the region for morale.
In the beginning, 75.
Students of Istanbul West Ata<0xC5><0x9F>ehir High School of Natural Sciences and Eski<0xC5><0x9F>ehir Ata<0xC3><0xA7>a<0xC4><0x9F> Middle School, including Primary School of the Republic of the Year, started their studies in a coordinated manner.
As a result of these studies, the students in the schools printed the choreography that they created the moon star shape on chocolate, and then made very close letters of poetry and painting.
The children then sent their work to the Diyarbak<0xC4><0xB1>r Security Directorate.
The Diyarbak<0xC4><0xB1>r Security Directorate set up an exhibition table on the work coordinated by children in the west.
At the exhibition, which was set up in the new Security Directorate building, students were involved in the work.
The exhibition was first visited by police officers and citizens who served in the Security Directorate building.
With meaningful writings and letters from each other, the poems were written to inspire the readers of the paintings.
A student who wrote a letter about operations in central Sur province said in his letter, "Our dear policemen are grateful to you for the sacrifice you have made to protect innocent people in Diyarbak<0xC4><0xB1>r."
It has been learned that the exhibition will run until next week.
She named her daughter Angela Merkel.
German Prime Minister Angela Merkel, who has been criticized from time to time for her policies on refugees, was given the name of another refugee baby.
The 26-year-old Memun El Hamza and his 21-year-old wife Tema El Havar, who managed to escape the war in Syria, named their first children "Angela Merkel".
Speaking to the German press Tema El Havar "We are grateful that we are here.
We have named our daughter Angela Merkel to show it.”
Father Memun El Hamza said, “Germany has become like a mother to us.”
This is the second "Merkel"
The baby Angela Merkel was born on December 27.
According to reports in the German press, the health of the little Angela Merkel, born at 3 kilograms 300 grams and 55 centimeters in length, is good.
Last year, a Ghanaian refugee named his daughter Angela Merkel, some of whom had opened "Merkel Mother" banners to support Merkel.
Consumer confidence in the U.S. at its peak of 7 months
According to university data, UMICH increased by 0.7 points from the end of December to 93.3.
As a result, the market outlook for the index, which recorded its highest level since June 2015, was set at 92.9.
Richard Curtin, Director of Consumer Research, Michigan, said in a written statement: “Consumer confidence has been on the rise for the fourth month with the improvement of expectations for future economic growth.”
“Individual financing expectations have also maintained the highest level of this policy since 2007 because of the overall weakness in inflation,” he said.
The statement also speculated that consumer optimism will now depend on the fact that inflation will continue to remain exceptionally low.
Recording its best annual performance since last year’s average of 92.9 to 2004, UMICH is determined by the results of a 50-question survey of at least 500 people each month.

Putin says he's spitting
While Russia is preparing to grant Turkish companies the status of "business with Russia" in the event that the services offered by Turkey are not met by other means, the Russian Tour Operators Union has said that "Russian citizens are not giving up on Turkey".
The Russian Ministry of Economic Development, which calculates that the disengagement of existing economic ties with Turkey will bring additional costs to Russia, has prepared and published a new draft "Economic Situations" concerning Turkey to the Russian government.
According to the draft published in the Federal Regulations section of Russia, it is envisaged that Turkish companies and companies will be allowed to do business with Russia even if they enter the penal zone.
According to the draft, it will be possible to benefit from products and services of Turkish companies and companies in cases where it is impossible to provide other resources outside of Turkey or where domestic production in Russia will lead to serious additional costs.
In this category, the joint commission to be established jointly with other relevant ministries within the Ministry of Economic Development of Russia will determine which of the goods and services of Turkish origin will be included.
Thus, it will be possible to decide which Turkish company can work with Russia by electing bureaucrats.
Again, according to the same document, private companies with state institutions in Russia will have to prove to the Commission that what they will do with Turkish partners is not a substitute.
In case the draft is approved by the Russian government, a registration of privileged Turkish companies will also be established in Russia.
The Association of Russian Tour Operators also said in a statement yesterday that Russian citizens did not give up on Turkey.
"Despite the ban on tour sales and the advice of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs not to go to Turkey, our citizens have started to look for the formula to organize their holidays on their own."
The number of posts on social networks on the Internet titled 'the most practical and cheapest way to vacation in Turkey' is growing like a cry.
The most common advice is to book a hotel online and fly with it.
Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev has described the price of oil falling below $30 as a "dramatic" development from Russia's point of view.
Medvedev said: “It was a very bad surprise for our government as no one would think that the oil would fall to $30.
With this move, it seems that it will not be possible to implement the budget as it is now.”
The last month of 2015 we left behind.
After the plane crash crisis, Russian President Vladimir Putin has announced that economic sanctions will deepen further.
In those days, our businessmen, who tried to go to Russia in order, we were officially pulling our THY personnel at the border gates.
Turkish goods are dumped in customs and subject to unwise controls.
It's only been a month, says Nerdun Hacioglu from Moscow yesterday.
In one way or another, the punishment is softening.
But why?
The reason is simple.
In an era where the economy has become so globalized, your efforts to close the frontiers with the methods of a century ago are no longer taking away from it.
Look, we're still writing news about Iran and how the economic embargo that has been implemented for years has been going on.
Two neighbouring countries, which seem to be friendly like Russia and Turkey, but which are not at all that much, actually need each other.
It's not technically possible for you to break these two countries, with your businessman, with your entrepreneur, with your client, on a night like that.
If you close the doors, the people of these two countries will step into each other’s country.
It is best to have a political debate on the table and calculate it there without creating the new Reza Zarrabs (R<0xC4><0xAB>za Sarraf).
Without infecting the economy...
Hotel attack in Burkina Faso: 20 dead
Burkina Faso's capital, Ouagadougou, has reportedly killed at least 20 people in an attack on the Splendid Hotel in Ouagadougou.
Burkina Faso Interior Ministry officials said some of the security forces found 20 bodies in the hotel lobby and some in the hotel's cafe.
The operation, which was supported by French special forces, included the rescue of 63 hostages, including the Burkina Faso Labour Minister, of which 33 were wounded.
The number of hostages and assailants in the 147-room hotel is unknown.
Eyewitnesses said two bomb-loaded vehicles were injected just outside the Splendid Hotel, more preferred by U.N. personnel and foreigners, masked 3-4 people entered the hotel.
Sad news from Sur: 1 martyr
The 46th day of the ban on access to the street continued in Sur province, despite all the interventions carried out by the terrorists, Ali Found the police officer, who was seriously injured as a result of the explosion of a handmade explosives yesterday, and was sent to Diyarbak<0xC4><0xB1>r Soldier Hospital.
It was found that the city was registered with the population of Adana.
The Diyarbak<0xC4><0xB1>r did not support the act of terror!
According to the information obtained, at 5 p.m. in Diyarbak<0xC4><0xB1>r Yeni<0xC5><0x9F>ehir district Office headquarters was planned to voice action against operations in front of AZC Plaza located on Farmers Street.
No one participated at the level requested by the citizens to make the call with the brochures and invitations.
Thousands of people were taking part in actions that had previously been organized, but recently, they drew attention to the fact that the citizens did not support the actions.
The group, unable to secure a sufficient majority in front of AZC Plaza, disbanded because it did not see support from Diyarbak<0xC4><0xB1>r citizens.
Terrorists set fire to school in Diyarbak<0xC4><0xB1>r
According to the information obtained, the incident took place on 1007th Street in the Yunus Emre District of Central Bohemia.
A group of masked terrorists who entered the Nuri Zekiye Has High School at 7.30 p.m. fled after setting the building on fire by throwing molotov cocktails.
Citizens in the surrounding area reported the status of the building to the fire department.
The firefighter also called the police and asked that security measures be taken to allow them to enter the area.
A large number of police teams were dispatched to the area with armored vehicles.
Firefighters who came to the school on receipt of security extinguished the fire without wrapping up the entire building.
Then, while police teams were investigating the scene, a multi-faceted effort was launched to arrest the fleeing terrorists.
On the other hand, some of the police at the scene were helping journalists to take pictures, while one policeman tried to block journalists who wanted to take pictures.
ATM Thieves Handle the Catch
Police teams related to the <0xC4><0xB0>zmir Security have started work on the complaint that some people’s bank card information is being copied from their accounts except their information and is being spent.
The police, who identified the files of the incident as M.M.G (43) and R.O (32), said that the suspects copied the card information they placed on ATMs in different regions of Turkey with the help of the “mini camera”.
The suspects who learned their card passwords were found to be dealing with these cards.
The suspects were arrested in connection with the operation.
Teams investigating the knee-top computer used by M.M.G. and R.O. seized a large number of video recordings of the mini-camera system set up to capture the passwords of citizens who trade at ATMs, so that the suspects could not be caught.
It was also revealed that the accused earned <0xC2><0xA3>50,000 in ineligible gains by copying their actions on 15 different ATMs in Izmir.
The suspects, who were sent to the judiciary after their security operations, were arrested.
Authorities warned citizens to regularly check account movements against such incidents and to do hand-stitching at ATMs during password entry.
Netherlands: Assad to be tried in Lahey
Dutch Foreign Minister Bert Koenders said Syrian President Bashar al-Assad should be tried at the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague.
Speaking at a conference in The Hague, Koenders said that Assad was responsible for the refugee flow.
Koenders, who pointed out that it would not be possible for peace to come to Syria as long as Assad was in power, noted:
Assad needs to be tried at the UCM in The Hague.
Someone with so much blood in their hands should be held accountable to the court.
Assad is also solely responsible for the refugee flow we face right now.
However, I am aware that Assad will not be leaving his mission any time soon.
This issue needs to be discussed first, and Russia also needs help in this regard.
Protests against Burak Y<0xC4><0xB1>lmaz
In the 59th minute of the match against Medicana Sivasspor, when Burak Y<0xC4><0xB1>lmaz failed to reach Sneijder's goal, the protest sparked a rise.
Then he turned his back on those who were in the back of his hand.
Then the reactions increased, and when each ball came to the player’s feet, protest murmurs were heard.
Then some tribunes supported Burak Y<0xC4><0xB1>lmaz and protested against his own players who made no sense.
Then a large part of the Tribune supported Burak Y<0xC4><0xB1>lmaz.
Winner of the rumor: There is no incompatibility in Celtic
While Deila admits that the Hoops are in the wrong place and that they'll get over it, Griffith doesn't care about the incompatibility in Celtic.
The struggle of hearts, the SFA's punishment for Neilson and the team's January signatures, with Warburton's attraction
Leader Don's Celtic score five points with Celtic
Adam Rooney's penalty in the first half gave Aberdeen a fair victory against the Dons at Pittodrie in Hamilton, and gave the Dons a chance to make a five-point difference between themselves and Celtic.
Griffith doesn't care about incompatibility
The rumors of incompatibility at Celtic push Griffith’s hand in reverse and mean that he and his teammates are in no way forced under an increased sense of observation as they prepare to meet the Dutch League Leaders.
“I don’t think we feel under pressure, I’m in the mood for players to be impatient for it.
The absence of a title race for the Scots upsets the Dutch de Boer
The former midfielder of the Rangers and former international player of Dutch football, Ronald de Boer, says that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic because of their lack of competition with the Rangers.
De Boer, who is currently an Ajax ambassador, said: “They don’t give a summary of Celtic matches in the Netherlands anymore, why?”
The Rangers are no longer there.
People don't just talk about Rangers making a comeback.
They're talking about the old team.
When they talk about teams, they talk together, they care about it.
The tension was high in the old team’s matches and those who wanted to watch those matches were not just Scots.
I swear I'll fix it, Deila.
RONNY agreed that Deila Celtic was fighting but the Norwegian boss said the move would be reversed.
The defeat against Malmö and then the Champions League farewell immediately followed the game lost to 10-man Aberdeen, who are now in the lead position with five points in the scoreboard.
But Deila said, "Celtic's had bad days in the past, and we're going to make a comeback."
Now we want to show ourselves as soon as possible.
I know it's very imaginative and I know you're angry or sad about what a lot of people have been through.
We're in the same situation - but we have to keep going.
We really, really need the support of Celtic because it makes these players feel a lot better.
It's so important to be together now.
Warburton's January Transfers
Just a couple of weeks ago, despite remarks that he set some January transfer targets, Rangers boss Mark Warburton is afraid to sign, insisting that Ibrox would not want to disrupt the team's union.
The former Brentford teacher said, “The January transfer window is very different from the summer window.”
For summer players, there’s a pre-season period where you’ll get used to them, we’ve seen that in our own group this season.
The team is in really good shape.
Sometimes adding unnecessary players to what you really need will do more harm.
Celtic Michu's Retirement Target
From Swansea's forks, Michu was connected to Celtic at the transfer window and emptied his predictions that he could retire when his contract with the Cows ended.
When she was 29 years old, she suffered unbearable pain from a troubled ankle for two years and couldn’t find a way to leave Wales in the summer.
Hearts prepare for SFA battle on Neilson's comments
When Paterson was thrown out of the game, the Hearts were ahead 2-1 and then lost 3-2, reversing everything after the defender's red card—Collum's third red card to be cancelled in eight months.
Neilson does not give up on what he says, he insists: “I have never questioned the union, I have not commented on the performance.”
Griffiths tried to stop Tynecastle.
Hibee was punished when he sang a song containing offensive words about former Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident occurred in March 2014 at a bar in the Roseburn area of Edinburgh, just before the Edinburgh Derby in Tynecastle.
"It was a derby match and there was a temperature at that moment," the attacker said, adding, "I can definitely say that from now on I'm not going to Tynecastle except to play with Celtic.
Tannadice board trusts Dundee United management - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly still has confidence that the board of directors of Dundee United will fix things – but they recognize that the downfall on the pitch should end.
I think Stephen Thompson trusts us.
We're going to get the kids ready to be put on the road again," Donnely said.
Mclness is pleased with the "ugly win" against Hamilton
Derek Mclness admits that thanks to Aberdeen's Adam Rooney's penalty in the first half, they have to hold desperately against the Hamilton Accies to see Celtic's top seventh win, which takes them to the top five points in the league.
Mclnnes said: "There is no team that wins anything in the middle of either the cups or the leagues without winning the game in this way."
Unemployment rates in the UK remained the same among Scots
Unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 164,000 between May and July, while the number of unemployed across the UK increased by 10,000 to 1.82 million.
According to figures from the National Bureau of Statistics (ONS), the unemployment rate in Scotland was 5.9 percent higher than the 5.5 percent in the UK.
Employment in Scotland, on the other hand, fell by 12,000 in three months, and the number of people currently employed has fallen by 2,612,000.
The employment rate for Scotland fell to 74.0 percent – up from the average of 73.5 percent in the UK.
David Mundell, the Scottish Minister of State, commented on the latest figures: “The government’s long-term plan laid the foundation for a stronger economy.”
It’s been almost a full year since Scotland decided to stay as part of Britain.
Over the past 12 months, we have seen growth in employment in the Scottish labour market and a decline in unemployment.
Why I Witnessed an Execution in Oklahoma
I'm going to watch the murder of a man in the early hours of today due to a legal intervention.
I hope not, but if it does, I'll be sitting in the gallery watching the death chamber at Oklahoma State Prison while Richard Glossip is being executed with a lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death.
The invitation was first made through his best friend in January, and although I was shocked, I accepted it.
As I approached that day, I began to fear it.
So why am I doing this?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way to tell the whole story about a death penalty.
It will offer a unique perspective.
True, journalists are allowed to watch executions in America, and since there are more applications than available places, a terrible lottery emerges when it comes to deciding who to choose.
Oklahoma has reduced its media seats from 12 to 5.
Whoever is elected will follow his feelings without being touched.
I can't do that.
I will sit next to Richard Glossip’s closest friends and have developed a relationship with him as a result of phone calls and a two-and-a-half-hour visit over the past few months.
I love that guy.
We laugh a lot when we talk.
The prison officials said I couldn’t be a witness or a journalist, so I won’t be given a pencil or notebook to record what I saw.
I'll try to remember all the details.
An Oklahoman journalist accused me of being neutral on Twitter, accusing me of being neutral.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story as he likes, gain access.
I complained to him.
He also admitted that he could "make it better" but he still thinks what I'm doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip doesn’t agree with me on some of the things I’ve said and written.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and if he did, I wouldn't accept it.
I told him you could get me out of the witness list when he wanted me to.
But an international reporter wants to be there and write them down.
If he dies, he thinks that spreading it to the public would help the anti-death movement.
A reporter from the Huffington Post, Kim Bellware, will be with me.
If you want to learn more about this, please listen to the podcast series I have prepared.
I'm not going to retell all the details here.
I have no idea Richard Glossip is innocent.
What they did after Barry Van Treese's death is enough to make him an accomplice.
But I still believe he's not guilty of the murder.
I don't think there's enough evidence to justify a death penalty.
I think his execution was wrong.
And I'm going to watch his death from this perspective.
I can't claim to be objective.
You can check out the other reporters there.
The impressions you'll get from me will be impressions you'll get from watching the death of a man you like killed unnecessarily.
After the police hunt, the man was convinced of the Canning River.
The Canning Vale police officer stayed dry while convincing the man to leave the Canning River.
The claim to escape from a police car behind a man in Perth ended with an attempt by a police officer to "convince him to gently return to shore" in shallow and muddy water.
Canning Vale police were called in on Tuesday because of an incident of unauthorized entry in Beckenham.
When they saw the suspect, the man tried to escape the police by entering the Canning River.
But it didn't go too far.
"Second Deputy Commissioner Shandell Castledine was standing in the water and saying, 'I'm not going out, 'Get me.'
Police Officer Lachlan Perhavec did not want to wet his uniform and used a safer tactic - "good police negotiation".
Senior deputy commissioner Castledine said “sometimes people try funny things to try to escape.”
Champion footballer Ben Cousins provides a lasting example in his mind.
In 2006, Cousins left his car to escape the control of alcohol by a policeman and attempted to swim across the Swan River.
Their efforts were unsuccessful, but the locals were the inspiration for planning a Ben Cousins biathlon.
Peter Moody claimed that the hawks spyed on him and threatened to quit the race
Peter Moody claimed that last year the Racing Victorians tried to prepare a sortie in their warehouses and threatened to leave the race immediately.
Racing targeted the Victorian hawks and unit department and said they had run a personal campaign against her in the final feeding for the race on Wednesday before the race.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he was always trying to do his best in the races, and told Lidari that when the job gave him a positive result in the cobalt, he found himself in conditions of power he couldn't explain.
In response to the allegations, Espion said he didn’t want to “look like unhealthy grapes” that he had been biting his tongue for 18 months.
“I wasn’t going to say that, and I’ve been shutting down for a long time, but sometimes you get very angry and everything happens all of a sudden,” Moody said.
They know it's going on.
Sometimes you show a reaction and you tolerate its consequences, and I will tolerate the consequences of what I say.
When I go home tonight, I'll sleep comfortably.
I want to walk my head upright and let my bosses know that I'm trying to do my best for them.
When they start to think I'm not doing it, it means I shouldn't be an operator anymore.
If so, I'd think about what I'd do with my license.
Earlier in a racing.com interview, Moody had exploded a bomb accusing his unit of spying in his own warehouse.
"Sixteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr Brian Stewart were sitting in a room with a man - I'll call him - and they offered him a job in my warehouses in exchange for telling them what I did in my warehouses," Moody told Racing.com.
They clearly believe I'm a three-pointer.
If that's the case, they all have to return their letters because they weren't capable enough to catch me.
Former RVL president Robert Roulston, new RVL president David Moodie and current CEO of RVL knew that back then and now they know it.
Is that supposed to make me think that it's starting to be personal?
RVL has a number of balls and maybe wants to make people outside of the operators accountable for what's going on in the industry?
Am I bad for the industry?
Am I that bad for the industry?
Maybe the people out there think I am.
Maybe they need to get my license and throw me out, but I have no doubt what I'm saying will make them think.
But when I get there, I can't do anything, and that makes me sad.
I'm really sorry about that.
I will put pressure on them, I will charge them with the responsibility of decision-making.
I have my family's support and I'll walk.
The operator's long-standing cobalt investigation into Lidari and his disappointment with the next scratch incident led him to call it "put my license at the end of the table."
The undefeated champion, famous for preparing the Black Havyar, described the Moody's rule of day care as "ridiculous," stating that throwing a mud or clay fox at the horse's feet was against the rules.
This is against the rules of the race.
I have to take all the responsibility for that.”
One of my men accidentally put the mud on his foot.
He could have taken it last night.
He could have taken it yesterday, which is what happened.
He took the race day.
Moody may face a three-month prison sentence for using the lapa in the day-to-day running as a result of an investigation opened by the managers.
This is a joke.
Those who make these rules don't know anything about horses.
“We understand that we need rules, but this has gone a long way,” Moody said.
The driver who crashed into Cobram has been arrested.
Police arrested a man who ran away on a bicycle in Cobram over the weekend.
The cyclist was taken from the air to the Royal Melbourne Hospital on Saturday morning after a car hit him on the Murray Valley Highway due to serious injuries.
Police said the crash driver escaped the scene without assisting the injured.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia surrendered to a police station in Shepparton.
He is expected to be accused of not stopping in an accident, not helping, and other traffic offences.
The 40-year-old cyclist from Cobram remains in stable condition at the hospital.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has responded harshly to rivals’ claims about the fight
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy described the criticism targeting his own team as an effort to "create the day" for NRL's two favorites.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said Friday that in the semi-finals in Sydney, Storm allowed the referees to "fight" with their own team.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett called the team's Saturday night win over the North Queensland Cowboys by sending Storm an undefeated post-match message that the match was a great "event" for the rugby league, and two Oueensland's were a big "match".
Bellamy defended the team's struggle and said they were only focused on "themes" while fighting.
Bellamy said it gained strength from the criticisms of the team from two leading mentors because it meant they were worried that Storm would beat them.
“This development is going on — I didn’t hear Trent Robinson talking about wrestling when they beat us 24-2,” Bellamy said Wednesday.
I guarantee that throughout the year we have not changed anything in our defense systems or techniques, we have only made a real emphasis on our fighting contacts in the last six weeks, and this has been a turning point for us.
Trent has been there for three years, and obviously he has a big team he coaches and he’s probably not used to losing with a little shock for himself.
It’s funny that this happened at this time of year.
Bellamy opposed Bennett's idea of "exciting football," recalling Bennett's winning 2010 St. George-Illawarra Dragons championship by playing "boring" football.
Wayne's talking about exciting football.
"It was about comparing our game on Friday night with their own matches on Saturday night and how exciting their match was," Bellamy said.
I remember being criticized for being a boring team in 2010, and Wayne said he wouldn't even give a rat ass.
But now they have an exciting football team that we can call football, and especially young halves with their speeds.
This is the football you want to play when you have these types of players.
He put that point in 2010, now everyone wants to play football that way – every team doesn’t have halves like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt so they can’t play that way.
This gives me more confidence because even they talk like that because they're a little afraid of playing.
When they went to the big games six weeks ago, they probably wouldn't have thought of us.
Bellamy also noted that the Storm and Roosters match had a higher score than the Broncos and Cowboys match.
The Broncos match was probably a good match, I haven't watched it yet, but what was the score? 16-12?
Our match is 20 - 18, the score of both sides in our match is more but is it exciting football?
Or is it exciting to cut off the attacks but not to make a scoring attack?
To me, that's my day.
If they're talking about us, that means we'll meet them here at a later stage.
The Storm, North Queensland Cowboys or one of the Cronulla Sharks have no weekends this weekend as tickets won weighting rights at AAMI Park on Saturday night in the first final game that went on sale on Tuesday.
Serb man was released on bail for drug offence of $200,000
The man who was caught over 40 kilograms of cocaine in Queensland and faced a possible jail sentence was released on bail for $200,000.
The 29-year-old Marko Maksimovic was one of five people arrested last month by federal police from a 100-pound Solay yacht from South America via Vanuatu and landed in the port of Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was seen at a meeting with his partners in the marina during the morning, and later met them at the Coomera Roadhouse, where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug inside a Toyota Echo.
Despite the possibility of facing a potential fine due to the presence of commercial amounts of cocaine, Maksimovic's lawyer said there was no evidence that he had attempted to possess all of the drugs himself, and that he could be in the cafeteria for an innocent purpose.
Supreme Court Justice Peter Flanagan Maksimovic was concerned that there was a risk of escape.
They have open links to Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia,” he told the court on Wednesday.
He lied about where the police were staying in his public case.
Maksimovic's mother and stepfather offered $200,000 to be released on bail.
Judge Flanagan said, "It is clear that after reading the sworn statements of both people, the $200,000 bail fee actually creates a financial burden on them."
But he warned that this alone was not enough to keep him from going to trial.
Maksimovic was released on bail in exchange for handing over passports to both Australia and Serbia, as well as complying with a ban on going to the police station every day from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m.
Stevan Hogg Uses Girls' Phone to Attract Pedophiles to Send Images
A paedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to ask for child abuse videos.
Stevan Hogg picked up the girl’s phone while she was sleeping, logging in to an online messaging service and providing him with a series of inappropriate child vision sent to him by another user.
The girl then woke up and realized she didn’t have her phone and found her phone in Hogg’s sleeping hand.
He looked at her and immediately noticed disturbing messages before warning his mother.
The police were interested and saw five pictures, then analyzed the computers located at the address, and discovered the "relevant" web searches made using terms to find inappropriate child pictures.
Hogg later claimed to officers that the reason for doing so was to “manage pedophiles on the internet” to “behave like a policeman and intimidate him.”
Financial adviser Eilidh Robertson told the Dundee Sheriff's Court: "It's an addiction - it's an addiction that scares people.
He admitted that the searches were made by the computer, but said he did so to act like a police officer to intimidate paedophiles.
Questions were asked about the interviews with the unknown person who sent the pictures to him, who asked him to send more pictures from them.
He said he did it to seduce them.
When he drank, he said he got sick ideas and wanted to watch rape and murder footage.
Ms. Robertson added: “When she found the messages on her phone, she screamed at her mother and she was shaking and crying.
The mother saw the inappropriate pictures on the phone and came after the accusations.
He met the girl and she said she used a computer and a Playstation to look younger than the defendant.
The 23-year-old Hogg, who lives in Dundee, was found guilty of taking or producing inappropriate child pictures on June 14 last year, violating bail on January 25 this year, and failing to attend court on March 24 this year.
Defense lawyer Gregor Sim said Hogg could be questioned as not being included in the sexual offence category, as there was no "certain sexual element" in the crime.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed the case to October, where a report on his social work past will be issued.
Hogg was released on bail in this case but was held in jail for other unusual cases.

Mr. Mugabe, the oldest leader in Africa, fell off a podium earlier this year.
She wasn't hurt, but the video of the fall went viral on social media.
The opening of parliament was tainted by allegations by opposition MPs that they received anonymous death threats if they were to swallow him during Mr Mugabe’s speech.
Last month, his nation in parliament smeared him in a silent speech and repeatedly cut off his speech — he repeated the same speech on Tuesday.
Innocent Gonese, the leader of the Democratic Change Movement (MDC), announced that seven opposition politicians had been texting their cell phones so they wouldn’t disturb him during Mr Mugabe’s speech.
“After Mr. Mugabe’s speech is over, it comes from an invisible number to reporters, but the headline is ‘death’,” he said.
He tells members that their intactness is valid in parliament and that when they leave parliament, intactness is not working.
The chief spokesperson said he was "concerned" about threats to the party's politicians, led by Morgan Tsvangirai.
Hewlett-Packard to cut 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard will put an end to 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in corporate service reorganization and cost reduction efforts.
HP will be split into two listed companies later this year, separating the faster-growing computer and printer business from the company’s hardware and service operations.
In a statement, HP said expected job cuts would result in a cost of around $2.7 billion at the beginning of the fourth quarter.
Meg Whitman, HP’s president and CEO, said: “These restructuring activities will provide a more competitive and sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Company.
“Whitman, the Hewlett Packard Company will be smaller and more focused than today’s HP, and we will have a broad and deep portfolio that will help companies transition to a new business style,” he said.
As a separate company, we are in a much better position than ever to meet the evolving needs of our customers around the world.
According to a statement from the company, the annual revenue of the Hewlett Packard Company will be more than $50 billion and will focus on delivering seamless integrated technology solutions for companies.
His garages in Palo Alto are called the "Birthplace of Silicon Valley" and in the 1930s Stanford University graduates split the company into two to make electrical equipment by Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard.
HP is undergoing a major reorganization to deal with the transition from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
This move by HP, the world’s largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest technology companies in the U.S., is one of the last moves in the industry that firms with a strong focus on better performance.
Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says his teammates are having problems with his injury to Dinamo Zagreb before the match
Wenger stressed that Wilshere's disability occurred in September and that his treatment was planned, and that there was no reason for him not to play at Christmas.
The best scenario already means that Wilshere will definitely miss at least four matches in England, and looking back on his past, it is unclear as to whether he will appear to be participating in the European Championships next summer.
The most embarrassing part of the latter problem is that after Wilshere was injured in a separate ankle, he ended last season strong and then looked for his old pre-season sharpness.
This type of disability career is not threatening, Wenger said.
It's a completely unhealed bone.
It's not a big deal.
It was just an accident.
It has nothing to do with his wrists or his previous disability.
From a medical perspective, this may be true, but there is also the risk of further injury to a player making a mid-season comeback, as Wenger will accept.
There's also an awkward pattern that develops.
According to a study by Pr<0xC3><0xA8>miyer Injuries Ltd, there have been 23 different disorders recorded by Wilshere since its inception six years ago.
In the last five seasons, Arsenal have played in just 65 of 157 league games.
In the big picture, Arsenal is one of two First League teams that have lost most of the time due to disability in eight out of six seasons since 2007-08.
Wenger acknowledges the potential for a vicious cycle but believes that Arsenal will recover from last season’s disability record.
“Sometimes when you come back from a disability, you have an open period of injury, a process where you want to strengthen your body and win the fight,” Wenger said.
Jack's young enough to get out of it.
I hope his body stabilizes, I trust him, and I believe he will do the career he deserves.
There are Tottenham Hotspur matches to be played at Arsenal on Saturday, which will start Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb and Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday, Wenger is preparing the team for them.
Héctor Beller<0xC3><0xAD>n and Aaron Ramsey did not go to Croatia, so it makes sense that Mathieu Debuchy will play Arteta.
Wenger could also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
“I strive to maintain the balance and give the players the breath they need,” Wenger said.
Despite Arsenal being one of the open favourites of the F Group, Maximir Stadium in Zagreb is among the most crowded stadiums in Europe.
Dinamo has not lost 41 matches since he produced his own "Nama<0xC4><0x9F>lup" campaign last season.
The stadium was rocked by a 3.2 magnitude earthquake on Tuesday night, according to the Richter scale.
This was the 10th earthquake in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes Arsenal has taken the necessary lesson from last season’s defeat to Monaco in the Champions League, and continues to be motivated by the distant goal of achieving the club’s first European Cup victory.
“This motivation is huge,” Wenger says.
This was never the case at Arsenal.
We were very close in 2006, but I have enough experience to be realistic on the other hand.
We are passionate, but not imaginative.
FriendsFest: a comedy program that gives us serious lessons about men’s friendship
The absence of similar portals in programs is striking; especially at a time when men need to open up more, and suicide rates among young men are at the peak of 15 years.
In 2013, it was the largest cause of male deaths between the ages of 20 and 45; and it was three times more in men than in women.
To draw attention to this problem, the Anti-Self-Existence Campaign (CALM) has declared 2015 as the Year of Men and aims to counter a culture that prevents men from asking for help when they need it.
Friendship is at the center of the struggle to accomplish this difficult task.
A study of more than 2,000 high school students with depressive symptoms showed that if a high number of people suffer from this condition have “healthy mode” friends, their chances of recovery are doubled.
Similarly, for those who are not depressed, it halves the mental difficulties that can arise in a circle of mentally healthy friends.
But, of course, it needs to be accessible first for friendship to work.
In an age where social media is a priority, it’s more important to respond urgently instead of meaningfully with a focus on content rather than style.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to look like strong, fun-loving and successful people; even if in reality everything is isolated.
Artificial success is spent under the domination of money, image, social status, what psychologists call external values; in pursuit of these, the inner values that have a deeper impact on our mental health—our inner longing for personal development and friendship.
As the creator of a billionaire video game recently explained, money doesn’t buy more happiness.
The beauty of the Friends series was that it turned this focus downwards.
Characters were defined not by their work, but by their personalities; and they revealed this by their interactions with their friends.
Joey and Chandler’s frequent hugs, the moments they watched football in comfortable chairs, Ross’s relationship with Rachel all came from the knowledge that they could actually relate to them, even if they were backstage to explain exactly the feelings of the men.
A helpful employee told me: “...when I listened to people who were depressed and suicidal, I saw how even the slightest interactions between friends could make a difference.”
Most of the men who come in contact with us can't talk to their friends.
A feeling like "getting away" is very strong, and the idea that opening up to others is also a sign of weakness."
One of the programs that comes to mind when suggesting long-term coping mechanisms is the Friends series.
He emphasized the small moments of his friendship.
According to my goal, a foreign status on the phone helps people in times of distress, but long-term support comes from family and friends with close personal networks.
And if you join FriendsFest at Comedy Central this weekend, why not take your friends to Central Perk for a drink in this beautiful setting where the scenes are redesigned for celebration?
Or, better yet, if you see someone on Starbucks alone, smile and say hello.
You don’t know how your friendship will make a difference.
Friends, from start to finish in Comedy Central - all 236 episodes - released for <0x23>FriendsFest
Di Maria's goal made it easier for PSG to beat Malmö
Angel Di Maria celebrated with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after his goal in Malmö.
Angel Di Maria made it easier for the Swedish team to pass PSG's goal to Malmö on Tuesday at the start of the Champions League.
Here's the match report and the match response.
In the match between Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani, Paris Saint-Germain began the Champions League fight Tuesday with a very comfortable and clear 2-0 win against Malmö at the Parc des Princes stadium.
Di Maria became a PSG player who allowed the French champion to continue on his way to the Champions League in less than four minutes, but in the 61st minute they could not assess the opportunities until the second goal Cavani scored.
Group A had to make a strong start against the Swedish champions of Paris with Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk, who needed it not only to get out of the squad, but also to improve their quarter-final performance in the last three championships.
But the game they played while scoring was not the best game of the revolution for Laurent Blanc's team, Zlatan Ibrahimovic spent a lot of positions around the penalty area and was later sidelined against his hometown team, where he started his magnificent career in 1999.
“It’s not easy to win out in the Champions League, but it’s going to be a problem for our opponents to win 2-0, and while there are some things we need to improve in the season, it’s a good start to give a comfortable look back,” Blanc said.
That's a good sign.
We wanted to win, and we won, despite the fact that we didn’t score more than one or two goals.
After Ibrahimovic's handicap, he returned to the Paris team with one of three player changes in the 2-2 game played in the 1st League with Bordeaux over the weekend, but remained in Di Maria's shadow in the fourth minute.
When the Argentine wingman was transferred from Manchester United last month, he was seen as the player who would take PSG to a higher level in Europe, thinking that Marco Veratti was running behind Malmö's defense and sending Johan Wiland away with a nice shot.
However, everyone was disappointed while waiting for PSG to win a big victory.
Malmö was lined up on the pitch with nine international players who beat Celtic in the playoffs, with a five-man defense and two players in the middle depth of the field, a heavy competitor.
In the 34th minute, Nikola Djurdjic made very few strikes except for the shot that pulled the pole of the corner where Kevin Trapp was guarding.
PSG, on the other hand, gave them the opportunity to slow down the game with unnecessary rusts and inefficient final blows, Ibrahimovic failed to make the final move in at least five strikes in the first half, and was disappointed by Cavani's failure to keep up with the game when the second half began.
However, he showed more mastery when he came to organise his colleagues, Ibrahimovic, who in the 52nd minute gave the bluff that Di Maria sent to Wiland's castle.
The second goal came thanks to Cavani after a full hour, the Uruguayan player recorded the sixth goal of the season after Ibrahimovic's pass, with Maxwell revealing from the left wing.
The idea of Malmö's return to the match was exhausted and after the gold that Ezequiel Lavezzi, who later entered the game, did not count as throwing in the wrong order, Wiland perfectly saved David Luiz's vacancy and did not allow the score to change.
Malmö coach Age Hareide later admitted that PSG was a class superior to his own team, Norway said: "Our last Champions League match was in December last year."
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish League, which is not on the same level with him.
The equipment in the unit is not enough.
He's wearing a hat to Paris.
It was a great match for them.
Glencore earns $2.5 billion in stock sales
Swiss-based mining giant Glencore hit back from falling prices of processed goods and earned $2.5 billion by selling its shares on Wednesday as part of a plan to divide their debts.
Glencore, listed in London, has announced that it has sold new shares worth <0xC2><0xA3>1.6 billion to pay off its debt.
The company, which has lost 57 percent of market value this year, was seriously affected by its commodity prices, which fell due to China’s economic slowdown in demand and caused confusion in the markets.
The share issue caused Glencore's stock prices to rise early on Wednesday morning on the London Stock Exchange.
Shares jumped 131.60 seconds, up 0.69% in the FTSE 100 index, up 2.77 percent.
Last week, Glencore announced a $2.5 billion share sale plan, which was part of its plans to reduce the $30 billion debt pile by as much as a third, last week.
The company sold its new assets for <0xC2><0xA3>125 per share, which was 2.4 percent off Tuesday’s closing.
It sold 1.3 billion shares equivalent to 9.99 percent of the group.
Concerns about China's long-standing growth have halved iron ore prices, while coal, copper and other commodities have fallen by 20 to 40 percent.
White House confirms Xi Jinping's visit to Washington
The White House said on Tuesday that Chinese President Xi Jinping would make an official visit to the United States by the end of the month.
Xi’s first official visit to Washington will take place on September 25 and will be a return visit to Barack Obama, who arrived in Beijing last November.
After the dual talks between the two presidents, U.S. President and First Lady Michelle Obama will have dinner with Xi’s wife Peng Liyuan.
“President Xi’s visit will allow us to expand US-China cooperation on both regional and global issues, as well as allow us to deal constructively with issues that are at issue with President Obama,” the statement said.
Xi's first visit to Washington in February is expected to meet with some U.S. technology leaders before arriving in Seattle, and then move to New York City to attend the U.N. General Assembly in September.
Obama and Xi are also expected to address some controversial issues, including Washington’s concerns about allegations of China conducting cyber-espionage activities and China’s claims of dominance in the South China Sea.
Matt Damon Makes Variety in Filmmaking Unimportant
Matt Damon spoke out against African-American filmmaker Effie Brown, saying there was no need to be behind the camera during a debate about diversity.
In the Sunday night episode of Project Greenlight, published on HBO, Brown highlighted the need for alternative perspectives on the black main character in the selected screenplay of the project.
Damon, when we talk about diversity, you do it in the cast of the show, not in the cast of the movie, he claimed.
Shocked, Brown continued to comment on the actor's Martian film with comments such as "Wow! Wow. Okay," and he reacted against it.
Damon and Brown were brought together by the brothers Ben Affleck and Farrelly to discuss the show's finalists.
Brown first said, “I wanted to think about how people — whoever the director is — would behave to the Compatibility character.”
A single black character is a whore shot by a white talking wire.
The publisher of Dear White People insisted on finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for the rights to direct the film. Damon responded to the assignments in the form of "unintended outcomes".
After the debate was published, there was an outburst of dissatisfaction with Damon's comments on social media.
Twitter user MrPooni expressed his anger to cut off, writing in the form of "Matt Damon can explain his diversity about this person because he speaks about the only black person in the room."
After the tweet was sent, he received 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes.
Damon's comments came at a time when true racial expression in the media was at the forefront of social debate.
After being killed by a young white police officer named Michael Brown in 2014, the Black Life Important movement effectively encouraged lawmakers and officials to stop anti-discrimination against people of color across the country.
In February, the singer Prince spoke top-secretly of the movement when the Grammy Awards were presented to the Album of the Year nominees.
The albums are still important, he said.
Albums like books and black lives are still important.
Recently, the leaders of the Black Life Important movement released a statement in response to the question of whether Elisabeth Hasselbeck, a prominent personality on Fox News, should be considered a hate group.
Leaders say Black Life is Important Network is a love group.
Recently, it was announced that Damon was included in the list of show artists, producers and media bosses who were invited to visit the Pope to discuss the definition of the Catholic Church in the West.
It is not yet clear whether he accepted the invitation or whether he met the Pope.
"American Ninja Warrior" wins first championship
Professional rock climber and comi Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete to win a $1 million prize by winning his American Ninja Warrior program on Monday night.
This competition, entering the 7th season, had never seen a competitor who could complete all stages of the obstacle park before.
In the season finale, Caldiero and Geoff Britten managed to stay in the final round.
The last task was to climb a rope about 20 meters in 30 seconds.
Britten became the first person to complete the park in time and thus managed to be the first athlete to complete the challenging 4th stage of the American Ninja Warrior; however, Caldiero won the park by finishing three seconds earlier.
Following this difficult victory, Caldiero spoke to E!News shockingly for winning the $1 million grand prize.
Isaac told E! about his salary, saying, “I think it’s great to even think about it, I’ve never made or passed more than $10,000 a year.”
I can’t even imagine what it will be like...I don’t know what will happen.
Producer Kent Weed also interviewed The Hollywood Reporter for the final and explained why Britten was the first competitor to finish the park, although no awards would be given.
According to the rules, money is given the fastest.
Weed said, “If there’s more than one finisher, he’ll win the prize that makes it the fastest.”
Even though money is a great reward and life changes, he also won a big reward.
I don't think you have a bad idea about it.
I'm so glad he did what he did.
He received tons of praise from his fans.
He's a great man and a family father.
He's a hero to his children and his wife.
Geoff told me, "If someone beats me, I'm glad it's Isaac."
I think if the roles had changed, Isaac would have thought the same thing.
American Ninja Warrior has renewed its contract for the eighth season and shooting will begin in spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers beat the Minnesota Twins. <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
MINNEAPOLIS -- The second half of the season didn't have much fun for the Detroit Tigers.
The Tigers, once one of the best in baseball, are now in the final of the American Central League.
The Tigers, who put their game into ruin, managed to beat the Minnesota Twins 5-4 at Target Field by making a perfect game on Tuesday.
The Twins lost their chance of climbing to the U.S. Second League wildcard by breaking the half-point gap between the Houston Astros.
For Detroit, the situation was a return to a good game that wasn’t much seen in most of the second half of the season, even for one night.
The Tigers manager, Brad Ausmus, said, “The victories are all enjoyable in whatever way.”
The Tigers' pitcher Alfredo Simon managed to score a number in the sixth and ninth shots, showing Detroit's early strike support three times in the first two shots.
Simon (13-9) made 6 3/1 shots in a row, three of which were runners.
This was only the third quality start in the last nine rounds.
“I just want to close the year strong,” said Simon.
It’s hard for the backups to squander every game, so I wanted to dive deep into the game.
Victor Martinez, the Tigers' chosen shooter, made three shots and two runs, which was the first RBI he has won since mid-August.
This was Martinez's first three-stroke night of four wins against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He shook the stool tightly," Ausmus said.
He looked good (in shooting practice), he was already noticeably better at BP, which he continued in the game as well.
At the end of the seventh round, the Twins, who captured the right to three runs, seized the best chance to re-enter the game.
Middlefielder Byron Buxton doubled on the left field line and started the line of shots.
Right-fielder Aaron Hicks was only able to take a slow shot, and Simon caught second goalkeeper Brian Dozier for the left-handed Blaine Hardy before kicking the shot.
Mauer stepped forward with courage as the only player who could resist Miguel Sano, who crossed right-wing player Drew VerHagen in the race.
With a double runner in the second tie, VerHagen managed to draw third goalkeeper Trevor Plouffe into the doubles.
Plouffe's hit on the DP was the 27th time this season in the major leagues.
After struggling for the run to guarantee Detroit's ninth place, Mauer passed the RBI and made a call with the Tigers and approached Bruce Rondon 5-4.
However, Sano was caught in three shots for the right-hand fifty-fifth rescue.
Detroit took advantage of the early exit of the losing Phil Hughes.
The Tigers won three runs in their first two shots against the experienced right-hander who has been away from the field for more than a month due to a burn in the back.
"Obviously this is not the game I want to play," Hughes said, "but I felt more comfortable in the end and managed to make pretty good shots in the third shot."
After a successful first shot, Hushes took second keeper Ian Kinsler out of the game.
Right-fielder J.D. Martinez's two-time outplay left Victor Martinez alone in the first run of the match.
Victor Martinez competed with the runners to pass the 0-21 band in the numbering position.
Third goalkeeper Nick Castellanos watched with one shot to the right, earning another run but Victor Martinez was thrown away while he wanted to make the third, so the threats ended.
The Tigers made the addition in the second, scoring a 3-0 win from catcher James McCann, an outside pair and midfielder Anthony Gose.
Twins manager Paul Molitor said, “It was a big hit.”
It didn't hit very well, but it hit the right spot.
Hughes made three unnumbered shots until he was replaced by fifty right-handed rescuer A.J. Achter.
Hughes was charged with three runs in six strokes and four unsuccessful strokes.
NOTES: Tigers RHP Anibal Sanchez was out of the game due to the shoulder pain he used to throw.
She will be examined by Dr. James Andrews, who performed Sanchez's shoulder surgery in 2007.
Since mid-August, Sanchez, who is on the disability list due to shoulder pain, is scheduled to start work on Wednesday.
In Sanchez's absence, LHP will start against the Twins with Daniel Norris DL.
The Tigers have been 1-1 in four games with Norris since the match for David Price's transfer on July 30.
He has not played since August 20 due to pain on his right side.
The Tigers and Twins will end their three-match series at Target Field on Wednesday.
Norris (2-2, 4.43 ERA), Minnesota RHP will fight Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA).
Xi wants to open up the economy to the world
On Tuesday, a group tasked with managing reforms, President Xi Jinping said the economy needed to be opened up more to accelerate growth.
At the 16th Central Front Group Meeting to Strengthen General Reforms, the President said, “China should develop opening policies by drawing on foreign investment expertise.”
Xi said that while encouraging opening up, making new reforms will create a new space for economic growth by bringing new energy and vitality.
The leader group adopted a number of proposals, such as a negative list regulating market access, relaxation in border control policies, encouraging the inclusion of state-owned institutions (SOE) into private capital, and a review of the settlements’ registration system.
According to the statement, a negative list will be prepared that defines the prohibited sector and business branches for investment.
The system will be phase-tested and developed with trial programs.
This is an important move, as it will play a greater role in allocating resources to the market and make the market more transparent by providing a legal business environment.
The government will also allow companies to carry out their own business by loosening their controls on companies.
The statement also said that China will review new models of cross-border economic cooperation in border regions and that new mechanisms will be put in place to encourage regional growth.
More space will be opened for private investment to open up government-controlled sectors.
“The government will not change its foreign investment policy, and will provide better services to them by protecting the interests of foreign-funded companies,” the statement said.
In addition, the requirements for foreigners to obtain permanent residence permits or "green cards" will be optimized and the application processes will be simplified by setting up a path.
The meeting also discussed the guarantee of the rights of lawyers to practice and the training of professional judges and prosecutors.
According to a statement released after the meeting, Prime Minister Li Keqiang and senior leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli also attended the meeting.
Miniature bag is now very fashionable-Time Newspaper Friday Eki
In the fashion world, roads turn around and come in handbags.
The current trend has recently been for those who are miniature...
It is possible to say that the small bags attached to the large ones also attracted attention.
They say that everything is small.
I think that’s also true for bags.
When he was almost unable to walk the streets with bags in suitcase sizes, the wind suddenly began to blow in the opposite direction, and the bags tended to shrink.
There were small bags already, but this time they came up to us with smaller cases of large sleeve bags.
Only your phone, credit card, and key can fit into these mini bags.
The stream, which began with Céline and Herm<0xC3><0xA8>s, spread with Prada.
The transformation of bag admiration into miniature curiosity also influenced the newly emerging models.
Loewe presented the fun bags he made this season with two-size cases.
Panda, polar bear and elephant-shaped bags are the most elephant-looking ones.
The mini-sizes of the big bags that luxury brands offer with phenomenal names seem to appeal to the red carpet celebrities again.
Hermes's bag of "Birkin" that Jane Birkin's made at the end of the day is one of the most preferred.
Although Jane Birkin said in a press release that she didn't want her name to be remembered with a purse, but that's how it's in her memories.
The fashion weeks have made the mini bag flow more widespread.
There are also mini bags in the pods.
It is not possible to put them on your arm because they are quite small.
They can be used with long suspensions in cross cases.
But in the podiums, we saw those long hangings more like they were wrapped around the wrists of the models.
Fendi is one of those who carry the mini bag issue to an advanced point.
There's a suggestion for those who don't fit in the mini bag but can't give up on them either.
Big bags of friends, mini bags.
How's that?
Turning mini bags into one type of bag that can be attached to your size.
This presentation, which is featured in the podiums, is quickly found in the street.
Let's see what else we'll see!
Skin changes in the tooth
Turkey will compete with world brands on denim.
This experience gained in the production is now enriched by the design.
Loft is one of them.
We see that black models that used to have several are now starting to take their place on the shelves every season.
In the season when blacks are so high, the denims have found their closest friend.
Leather parts and detailed leather designs stand out as the rebel friend of denim.
In general, short models with zippers called "motorbikes" are on the agenda.
The strong air of the depth is complemented by black pieces, while the chiffon long blouses and sleek sweaters give a sporty look.
Young people used to want to wear denim and disappear in the crowd.
It was supposed to save the day.
Now young people want to carry on a piece that emphasizes elegance as much as they are comfortable.
From this point of view, it is possible to say that Loft correctly understands the target audience with collections and complementary parts
Small, big step for “global” for Banksy
The world premiere of the collection "The Art of Banksy", which brings together the works of mysterious street artist Banksy, was held in Istanbul.
The artist is the first exhibition of the Global Karaköy building, the product of his 15 years of work and the first time that 85 original works have come together.
The first exhibition of mysterious street artist Bansky in Istanbul opened the day before in Global Karaköy (R<0xC4><0xB1>ht<0xC4><0xB1>m Street).
Of course, the world-famous artist who hid his identity and used a mysterious name was not at the opening.
We don't know if he's in Istanbul.
But according to exhibition curator Steve Lazaridas, Bansky is not even aware of this exhibition.
There's no way he's gonna have to be allowed to.
Because the way of Bansky and Lazaridas, an old friend, is gone after 12 years.
Some of the works on display are collected from Lazaridas and some from the collectors.
But there are issues that Bansky's followers are interested in.
What would Banksy think about the exhibition "The Art of Banksy" where 85 works were brought together?
For example, how would he accept admission with a ticket (35 TL)? What if he saw the small store that was set up at the end of the 800-square-foot gallery area?
Would the Red Balloon Girl, Cleaner, Rose Now make the noise that their artifacts were printed on canvas bags, wallets, necklaces, paying attention to the issues that are the wounds of the world?
The fact that the exhibition of an artist with an anarchist spirit that hides his identity has become so much of a consumable is a disappointment for Banksy's followers.
It's not Banksy's style.
But you still get a limited number of tickets without running out!
The big exhibition for the small, globalizing world for Banksy "The Art of Banksy" can be seen until April.
They are low, evil.
If they go, they'll dig a pit.
President Recep Tayyip Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an continued his reaction to the academics who signed the note.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an said, “These are the wrongdoers, these are the low ones.”
Indeed, those who are with the wrong-doers are the wrong-doers.
He said, "They have committed the same crime because they were with those who committed murder."
Recep Tayyip Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an, who replaced the explosion in Sultanahmet, said: "In this action on Sultanahmet Square, which smells of history and civilization, there are ten German friends who have died in such a region, even in the immediate vicinity of the German Mosque, with the need for a <0xC5><0x9E>u<0xC5><0x9F>l<0xC4><0xB1>m<0xC4><0xB1>n<0xC4><0xB1>n<0xC4><0xB1>n<0xC4><0xB1>n<0xC4><0xB1>, as well as many other German friends.
I would like to extend my condolences to the entire German people, first of all, to the families of those who died."
"Our fight against terrorism will continue with determination," he said.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an, who continued to respond to the academics who signed the statement, said: “I am particularly reprimanding and violently insulting the academics who have signed the killings in the face of all these terrorist incidents and issued a covert statement.”
It is not clear to anyone that our nation understands who it is much more closely, that is, to be a professor, a lecturer in front of it.
These are dark people.
These are the wrongdoers, and these are the low ones.
They have committed the same crime because they are with those who have committed murder.
Where are those puppies, the three-year-old Mevlude, who is a martyr with his father, going to put this gloomy academic?
How do they fit into their consciences to sit next to their killers?
I invite all the judiciary, the Senates of the universities, to the office because of these movements, contrary to our constitution and our laws.
Yesterday, I said that the steps to be taken should be taken quickly.
Whatever they do, let them do it there.
Those who want to do politics should do politics in parliament.
But if they can't do it in parliament, let them go dig a pit or go up the mountain.
I speak so clearly and clear.
The TEOG results have been announced

The results of the test on November 25-26 were finally clear.
Weighted Common Exam Score: Within the scope of the Common Exams, the scores taken from the courses taken are multiplied by their own weight coefficients.
The value obtained from the total of the collisions is obtained periodically weighted common test scores for each period, with the assurance that the lessons are divided into the sum of the weight coefficients.
The arithmetic average of the weighted common test scores constitutes the weighted common test score.
The score is based on a total of 700 points.
Key points to place: 6th, 7th and 8th grade end-of-year success scores are collected with 8th grade weighted common test scores.
The resulting total is divided into two by placing the basic points.
The score is made up of 500 full points.
The doors of the teaching staff are marked.

"I found 26 people looking for two fighting children"
The second documentary by Mete Gümürhan, "Young Pehlivan", 66.
The Berlin Film Festival (11-21 February) became the first Turkish documentary to be selected for the "Generation Lplus" section.
Originally based in Edirne, but based in the Netherlands, Gümürhan explained why and how he filmed the documentary he completed in the summer of 2014.
The documentary "Young Pahlivans", which tells the story of a six-seater Amasya who aims to become a world champion in the field of wrestling, will compete in the "Generation Kplus" section of the Berlin Film Festival.
Young Pehlivans, the first Turkish documentary to be selected for this section, is one of the candidates for the Crystal Bear Award.
Although he grew up in the Netherlands, he was originally an Edirneian director, Mete Gümürhan.
When he was a child, he listened to his grandfather’s oily fight stories and watched the competitions.
“There are not just political issues in Turkey.”
I wanted to tell the world what else happened in Anatolia.
"Unfortunately, we don't know much about horse racing," he wants to come up with six directors to prepare a documentary project.
This project remains inconclusive, but one day the magazine he reads on the plane opens the door to another project for Gümürhan.
"We stayed at the sugar factory."
A 10- to 11-year-old wrestler who follows the story of two younger brothers, Mete Gümürhan, goes to Samsun, where his family lives.
The father of the children does not allow documentary filming.
Gümürhan explains how he overcame this challenge: “I thought about what I could do all day.
It could have been withdrawn from the Ministry of Culture.”
In the interview, the father was talking about a boarding school in Amasya where the children would go.
I came to think of it.
When I was looking for two kids, I met 26 kids who were interested in wrestling at school.
Within a week, we started shooting preparations and finished the permits.
We didn't even have a place to stay.
"We stayed in the bedroom of the sugar factory."
The filming, completed in three weeks, was the biggest challenge for the director.
Gümürhan, who said that three different languages were spoken in the set where the foreign film director and speaker worked, said, "I didn't know what I was going to face while I was shooting."
“They didn’t speak Turkish,” he said.
Young Pehlivans focuses on the story of six of the 26 children wrestlers.
Growing up by his grandfather and having a weight problem, Baran, Harun, an ambitious but health-affected Beytullah, who is unable to participate in training because of his broken arm, is the school's cute son <0xC3><0x9A>mit, the youngest champion Ahmet, and Muhammad, who holds the group together.
Mete Gümürhan tells us about his work with the children: “I left them completely natural.”
I just tried to use Muhammad everywhere.
I was shooting for the first week and a half.
I wanted the kids to act like they didn't have a camera.
"Fortunately, they got used to it quickly."
It was a surprise to be in Berlin.
Mete Gümürhan, who said he didn’t expect the Young Pehlivans to be selected for the Berlin Film Festival, said: “We had the preparation but it was a surprise to be chosen for Berlin.”
Young Pehlivans is not a sports documentary, but a production that tells about children’s struggles and cuts from their lives.
“I wanted to bring to the fore the forefront the stories of children with family problems trying to find identities and being able to deal with their problems,” he says.
Supporting academics from the art world
Following the announcement of the “Academic Initiative for Peace” the storm that erupted yesterday led to investigations and arrests of academics, while on the one hand, there are post-war support statements.
The first support came from a number of well-known writers.
The day before, the filmmakers announced their support, and yesterday the theatrical support.
In a statement signed by 138 theatre artists, "We stand by this honorable meeting of academics who are called for peace as artists in the field of theatrical and theatrical arts, in which freedom of expression, equality, the right to life and the condition of freedom of expression."
"We share our conscience and with all our hearts our voice in the academics' call for negotiation and peace."
Among them are Atilla <0xC3><0x96>zdemiro<0xC4><0x9F>lu, Radir Sar<0xC4><0xB1>bacak, <0xC3><0x96>zcan Alper, Serra Y<0xC4><0xB1>lmaz, Honor Famous, Ye<0xC5><0x9F>im Ustao<0xC4><0x9F>lu, Pelin Esmer, Tolga Kara<0xC3><0xA7>elik and more than 400 filmmakers.
But without but without: "We will not be partners in this crime!"
“We are with the Academics Initiative for Peace,” he said, supporting the academics.
The Association of Cinema Writers (S<0xC4><0xB0>YAD) said in a statement: "We are with the academics who have become the target of the Lin<0xC3><0xA7> campaign."
On January 11, the Academics for Peace Initiative issued a statement titled “We are not in common with this crime,” calling on the government for peace and negotiation with simultaneous declarations held in Ankara and Istanbul.
The 1,128 academics at Metne 89 University, as well as their theories and books, were also signed by world-renowned thinkers such as Noam Chomsky, David Harvey, Immanuel Wallerstein, Judith Butler, and Etienne Balibar.
President Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an and Prime Minister Davuto<0xC4><0x9F>lu harshly criticized the announcement of the academics in the form of "terrorist support", calling on the institutions to "do their part".
Following this call, some universities were putting an end to academic work, while the prosecutor’s office had launched a residual investigation.
A large number of academics were arrested yesterday.
I'm a fan, please help!
Hurrem Sultan's red hair, Beren's nose, Justin's hair...
While working as a celebrity is considered normal to some extent, it is seen as a psychological disorder after the point where life begins to affect it completely.
‘Celebrity worship syndrome’, another ‘celebrity worship syndrome’, has become an academic topic in the world, and we have a new topic.
Running to the hair salons with famous photos of ladies can be considered as normal as somewhere.
But we must not forget the year of 'Hürrem Sultan', where all teenagers roamed Ireland with red hair.
In the aesthetic operations we left behind in 2015, it was already news that 'Beren's nose was headed.
On the other hand, gentlemen, things are not very different.
Once upon a time, it was decided to dress like Polat Alemdar.
And now, it's just the opposite wind that's sweeping the environment.
Justin Bieber's copy is filled with boys.
So much so that we cite this unnecessary information on the internet thousands of times: "First, when you go to the barber, cut the side of your hair, that is, the ear and the surroundings, to the top of your head."
Only the sides will be short.
After the cutting process is finished, you should give your hair a mild form with water.
After finishing the shaping process, fix your hair with the help of a spray.
"You just have to shape it when you're wet to get the hair."
All this, which has already become an academic topic in the world, brings to mind the newly spoken ‘Celebrity Worship Syndrome’, the other ‘celebrity worship syndrome’.
Fans of celebrities seem to be falling in love with us.
Artists stand up and boast of their fan numbers, how much it impacts them.
Fortunately, the psychological state is not so simple.
It is a matter of fact that teenagers decide on what to eat and drink, what to listen to, what to wear, according to celebrities.
Excessive attachment to the names presented as inaccessible is defined as a mental disorder to take on the role model.
Psychologist Sümeyye Demir admits that Turkey is behind in the work in this area.
But he does not overlook the fact that families are slowly becoming aware: "One of the fundamental issues of the science of psychology is that a person is at peace with himself, that he is at peace within his identity."
At first, filling the children's room with posters, dressing someone up would not be taken very seriously.
That's changing now.
He feels the need to interfere with his parent's situation.
"Commitment to someone with passion is a sign that something goes wrong in a young person's life."
Fans on the Emotional Speed Train
Interest in celebrities is harmless, as long as they don't overdo it.
Not wanting to get married, jealous of his wife, suggests paying attention to signs such as preferring his bird of clothing.
We're talking about famous people by name.
It’s normal to care about them, to be related to their lives.
But when the expert psychologist says, “Young people who miss the canter’s ball often say, ‘I am worthy of a child in the family or surroundings, when there are no names to represent at the point of good behavior, that gap certainly fills.”
There are not always good examples.
"He's copying the negatives, too, kid."
When we talk to them about how to approach Sümeyye Demir, it begins by reminding him that the celebrity passion syndrome is seen more in adolescence.
Considering that adolescents may be self-inflicted, the problem becomes more comfortable.
On the one hand, while complaining about the limitations of their families, we are faced with young people who are waiting for support and compassion: "We have to consider their emotional landings."
New research reveals that they are forced because of the changes that occur in their brains.
"A young man who rides an emotional speed train must also be naturally welcomed, with a gentle approach."
It is possible to change behaviors
Psychologist Sümeyye Imir reminds his parents of the tasks to overcome celebrity worship syndrome:
Acknowledge his emotional distress, make sure you are calm before you get into the matter.
Don’t ever let them suppress their emotions.
Indicate that you respect her admiration for her independence in order to promote her independence.
Show a good example instead of teaching by arbitrariness, discuss names that will be role models for him.
Try to take the place of celebrities together in our daily lives.
It will be useful to read books together that tell the real world of celebrities.
Turn your communication into an adult-to-adult form.
Remember that addiction and motivation use the same ways in the brain.
Share with your child that mistakes are an opportunity for change, accept him as he is.
Be sure to get expert support on fanfare.
And the one who is angry, the one who is amazed, is amazed.
On the basis of Celebrity Worship Syndrome, he needs to get help and hope from someone else.
Unhindered love is actually a call for help.
Unfortunately, it is not perceived that way.
Moreover, this problem is so widespread that it is not possible to limit it to a country or continent.
Dr. Recai Yahyao<0xC4><0x9F>lu points out that there are certain names that occupy television in every country.
The syndrome shows itself more by connecting to these celebrities: "They are extraordinary."
The vast majority of people do not have their options.
Those who have it will not live by acting like them.
Either because they didn't accept it or because they didn't dare.
"But those who don't have the opportunity, or who don't have the opportunity, continue to watch with nerves that don't live like them."
It doesn't really matter who's sneezing or sneezing at the nerve.
Both of them are intrigued by the inside.
They make money effortlessly, they're on the magazine's agenda.
It's enough to even know it to increase fanfare.
Another advice of expert psychologist Sümeyye Iron is to question the reality of those lives at this very point.
It should not be overlooked that sexual lives are involved.
The support of the environment for the person who is passionate about fame comes into play here.
But he insists on admitting that the celebrity he is a fan of is just as troublesome as he is.

Should I have gallbladder surgery? - Family - Health News - Zaman Gazetesi
Dr. Fevzi <0xC3><0x96>zgönül answers the questions in the corner of the Meydan Gazetesi..
I have stones in my gallbladder, and every morning when I get up, I go to the bathroom 2 or more times a day with stomach pain after meals.
Could that prevent me from losing weight?
I've started using alkaline right now, but my appetite is not decreasing, I can't lose any weight.
It's been like this since I was a kid.
What am I supposed to do?
Do you think I should have gallbladder surgery?
Cevap: The gallbladder stone is often accompanied by an infection.
This abdominal pain that develops immediately after eating is also a sign that when you eat, you empty the gallbladder muscle and inflammatory gallbladder into the intestines.
The intestines, which are disturbed by the intestinal bile, quickly try to expel this bile.
That’s why you go to the bathroom often.
Because you go to the bathroom often, what you eat is thrown away without digestion, and your weight loss is slow.
I think you need to treat this situation.
If you go to a gastroenterologist and the condition I'm saying is diagnosed, you can get rid of this condition by using antibiotics.
But eventually you may also need to have gallbladder surgery.
Alkaline probiotics can reduce these complaints a little, but they are not permeable.
No matter what, I say, keep using alkaline probiotics.
Because this probiotic powder is the biggest help for you to lose weight.
I eat too much when I'm stressed.
My teacher gives me food when I’m stressed and nervous and gaining weight.
How can I deal with this?
Cevap: Excessive desire to eat actually means that the need for energy is not fully met.
This may be due to being less eaten or skipping their morning and afternoon meals.
Another reason is that you can’t spoil the foods you eat.
To do this, your digestive system needs to work healthy.
If you don’t have ulcers, reflux or a similar problem, the easiest way is to use a good probiotic.
You will see much benefit.
I can’t lose weight, doctors don’t know why.
You usually have information on the weakening in your corner.
It all makes sense to me, but my situation is a little different.
I can't weigh anything.
Most importantly, I don't know why.
Doctors say nothing.
CEVAP: The techniques we apply are not only to lose weight, but to return the physiological work of the body to its ideal dimensions.
Obesity and weakness are the same kind of ailments.
Without losing weight in obesity, not gaining weight in weakness is treated with the same technique.
You will also become weaker when you eat sweet and pasta-based foods.
I think you've understood that so far.
You can also be stimulated by carboxypuncture and gain weight with a healthy diet.
So you've gotten away from your ideal body by weakening.
Our other patients have gone away from their ideal bodies by getting fat.
You will reach your ideal body by gaining weight, and they will reach by losing weight.
If the system problem goes away, you gain weight, and they lose weight.
First of all, the system needs to work properly.

A child who feels worthless is obsessed with 'hate'
There are some emotions that are born in the world of feeling.
Fear, sadness, happiness, shock, anger, anxiety...
But feelings of hate, anger, revenge appear in children over time and as a result of some misconceptions.
Every person needs to be an individual, including the period of his childhood.
This means that you need to respect your parent’s or social environment’s decisions, ask questions about matters that concern you, and feel valued.
Ensuring these forms the basis for building a healthy personality.
Behaviors such as deciding instead of the child (what to wear, what to eat), not caring for the child's wishes, and instead deferring their own rights (the person who wants to be sent to the football course).
Because the child who is disrespectful of his or her self and existence has lost his or her freedom to 'be yourself', the defense mechanism reveals a sense of anger and hatred to protect him or her.
"Because it's actually the opposite of accepting anger and hate," says psychologist Hilal Arslan, who says that the child does not accept what is done to him, and tries to tell him and his surroundings that he is valuable.
The expert psychologist, who notes that the child does not accept the situation and reacts in this way is a positive development in terms of his personality development, "Hate here means 'I am too', serving the purpose of protecting the child's respect for himself."
“If a child is allowed to be an individual, hatred will disappear,” he says.
The child tries to protect himself by taking refuge in anger and hatred
Arslan, who says that at a young age, both physically and mentally most vulnerable times, the parents of children can cause negative emotions in the child by verbal and emotional violence by their surroundings, lives in which the presence of the child is negligent, unnoticed, invisible protection.
Arslan goes on to say: "Sometimes it's just not meeting their emotional needs (not shaving their hair, not hugging them, not kissing them, not caring for their school or other needs), and sometimes it can be against their physical needs (eating, drinking, sheltering, etc.) as well."
It’s an attitude of upbringing that opens the door to anger and hatred.
Emotional and verbal violence includes behaviors such as humiliation, insult, humiliation, punishment, unnecessary and severe punishment, feelings of degradation, shouting.
These behaviors touch a deep place as it is directed towards the child’s personality.
“The child either loses the respect he has for himself by accepting them and spends his life struggling with the feeling that he is unworthy, unworthy of being loved and inadequate, or he tries to protect himself by taking refuge in anger and hatred.”
His teacher gave Boyko to Be<0xC5><0x9F>ikta<0xC5><0x9F>!
Dnipro, where Be<0xC5><0x9F>ikta<0xC5><0x9F> wants to take two players, is preparing for the second half in Antalya Belek.

Markevych praised the national file guard, saying, "If two clubs understand, Boyko Be<0xC5><0x9F>ikta<0xC5><0x9F> will go and make him a champion."

The football club will go to the Constitutional Court for the deleted score
Denizlisport will seek its right by individual application to the Constitutional Court on the grounds that the Turkish Football Federation (TFF) Board of Arbitration does not meet the financial criteria.
Sea Sports President Mustafa Shavluk said the decision of the Board of Arbitration will be taken to the Constitutional Court because it is clear.
Shawluk said, "The way of judgment is now exhausted."
Superficial people can also apply.
The Board of Arbitration had to decide within three months.
According to the Arbitration Board Working Instruction, the reasoned decision had to be announced within three months.
It's been four months since our application.
If the Constitutional Court says, "There is a violation of the right here," the situation may turn in our favor.
"We won't leave behind," he said.
Shawluk added that his applications could be a first in the sports community.
Hope couldn't even stop the storm
The 118 fugitives, Turkish and Greek Coastal Security teams from Bodrum, Syria and Pakistan, who embarked on a voyage of hope by boat and fishing boat, were rescued.
The 105 Syrians, including women and children, who tried to cross the Greek island of Kilimni (Kalimnos Island) by a 15-metre fishing boat from Kudur Mevkii on their way from Yalikavak District, were hard times when they hit the cliffs of Karg<0xC4><0xB1> Island at 04.00 today.

The boats, which were in danger of sinking under water, were spotted by the Greek Coastal Security teams on patrol at 7 a.m.
Some of the refugees who had fallen into the sea were rescued and taken to Kilimli Island.
At Least 20 Dead, 15 Injured - World News
In Burkina Faso, the capital of West Africa, Ouagadougou, a hotel popular with foreigners, and a nearby cafeteria, at least 20 people were killed and 15 injured.
The attack was carried out by a local Maghreb group linked to Al Qaeda.
The 147-room Splendid Hotel reportedly held some hostages.
The operation is being carried out by security forces five hours after the attack on the hotel.
There's explosions and loud gunshots coming from the building where no one's approached.
Part of the fire that broke out at the hotel due to the explosives is continuing.
It is not yet known how many people were held hostage.
The hotel in question has been found to be particularly preferred by foreigners and United Nations (UN) officials.
Robert Sangare, director of the Yalgado Ouedraogo Hospital, noted that 20 people died during the siege, 15 people injured with bullets were seriously injured, and that they were concerned about the increase in the number of deaths.
In a coup attempt in Burkina Faso last September, the interim President was briefly detained for a while.
Burkina Faso’s Prime Minister Paul Kaba Thieba announced his new cabinet three days ago, while President Roch Marc Christian Kabore was also in charge of the Ministry of Defense.
Romania Is Going To Be Transparent In Election Spending
A new draft law is being prepared in Romania to fully determine the source of the money used and bring an upper limit to spending.
The government wants the person who sponsors the politicians in the election and the companies to make their money aid more transparent.
The bill envisages that the ‘decision money’ used in the elections will be avoided.
The bill requires each party or person to spend their money on election propaganda through a bank account.
All money spent in this way will be more transparently and regularly controlled by the Romanian Electoral Commission (AEP).
In addition, the plan also plans to introduce a ceiling on spending.

Attacks on journalists in Turkey have become commonplace
Ahead of Prime Minister Davuto<0xC4><0x9F>lu’s visit to London next week, 25 famous writers sent a joint letter to British Prime Minister Cameron to Turkey.
The PEN members asked Cameron in a meeting with Davuto<0xC4><0x9F>lu to bring to the agenda the decline in freedom of press and expression in Turkey.
Britain’s leading writers, sending a letter to Prime Minister David Cameron, asked his deputy Ahmet Davuto<0xC4><0x9F>lu to make a comeback on the issues of freedom of the press and expression in Turkey during his visit to London next week.
Twenty-five writers, including the presidents of the International Writers' Union (PEN) in England, Wales and Scotland, expressed serious concerns about "unprecedented pressures on freedom of expression in Turkey."
Journalists, writers and publishers point out that threats and physical attacks have now become commonplace; the attack on Hürriyet Gazetesi offices, as an example, commemorated the oppression and harassment of the Koza Silk Media Group.
Among them were Tom Stoppard, Ali Smith, Ian Rankin, and famous British writers, including Elif Shafak, a PEN member, in a letter to journalists who worked for the Vice News organization, where three journalists were arrested, other journalists were sued, and arrests were made against journalists.
Authors who stated that the arrest of Can Dündar and Erdem Gül in the investigative phase in the case of the MIT TIR also raise concerns, "the fact that journalists in Turkey carry out their original duties in society, restrict their public opinion and avoid censorship".
He noted that attacks on journalists, writers and publishers have undermined all the freedoms of Turkish society.
Due to the widespread "culture of inviolability", journalists and writers are exposed to the methods of scrutiny that exist up to physical attacks.
The authors noted that the number of Turkish citizens suing the president for "infringement" has increased, and after Erdogan was elected in 2014, that his predecessors have filed more infringement cases than in total.
The words of David were spoken.
Six of Prime Minister Ahmet Davuto<0xC4><0x9F>lu, who will be visiting London next week, were drawn to be one of several members of the government who expressed his support for freedom of the press, it was said that these words did not turn into action.
"Therefore, Davuto<0xC4><0x9F>lu's visit to London represents an important opportunity for Turkey to make a clear commitment to freedom of expression," the letter said.
The authors asked Cameron to call on Prime Minister Davuto<0xC4><0x9F>lu to ensure that the government respects Turkey’s obligations to freedom of expression.
25 writers signed in the letter:
Monica Ali, Alan Bissett, William Boyd, Chris Brookmyre, Gillian Clarke, Drew Campbell (President of PEN Scotland), Fflur Dafydd, Stevie Davies, Menna Water Elfyn (President of PEN Wales), Moris Farhi, Maureen Sherman, Ilman Sherman, Ilman Sherman, Minkson, Minh Mink, E.
