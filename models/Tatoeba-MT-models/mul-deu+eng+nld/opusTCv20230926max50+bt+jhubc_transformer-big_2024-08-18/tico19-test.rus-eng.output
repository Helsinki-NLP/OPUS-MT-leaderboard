The rapidly growing rate of cumulative coronavirus infection disease (COVID-19) in the European Union and the United Kingdom between 1 January and 15 March 2020.
The cumulative incidence of coronavirus infection (COVID-19) has similar trends in the countries of the European Union / European Economic Area and in the UK, thus confirming that, despite the different stages of its development in different countries, the COV-19 pandemic is rampant in all countries.
Taking into account the experience of Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care units, it is necessary to increase the level of preparedness for the influx of COVID-19 patients who will need treatment and, in particular, intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, several cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology were recorded in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.
On January 9, 2020, the Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the cause of the infection is a new type of coronavirus, now known as severe acute respiratory syndrome type 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 has been called a coronavirus infection (COVID-19).
According to the data available today, approximately 80% of people with COVID-19 have the disease in a mild form, i.e. in the form of a respiratory infection with or without pneumonia, with the majority of patients recovering.
Approximately 14% of COVID-19 cases develop into a more severe form of the disease with the need for hospitalization, while the remaining 6% take a critical form when intensive care is required.
The mortality rate of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 is approximately 4%.
This study analyzes trends of cumulative COVID-19 disease in each country of the European Union (EU) / European Economic Area (EEA) and in the UK and compares them with trends in the Chinese province of Hubei.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and the UK with data for Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and the UK
After the outbreak in China, COVID-19 has spread to other countries, and now in the rest of the world, the COVID-19 pandemic is developing according to the same dynamics as in China.
On March 11, 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the COVID-19 pandemic.
In a March 5, 2020 issue of the journal Eurosurveillance, Mr. Spiteri and his colleagues reported the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe, which met the criteria by which the WHO determines the presence of the disease.
The first three confirmed cases in the EU/EEA were registered in France on January 24, 2020 — all three of them returned from Wuhan, China’s Hubei province.
As of 15 March 2020, cases of COVID-19 infection have been detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and in the United Kingdom, with 39,768 cases of infection and 1,727 deaths recorded for the period from 31 December 2019 to that date, of which 17,750 have died, including 44.
Determination of the cumulative number and the cumulative morbidity of COVID-19
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) updates daily at 8:00 a.m. data on the number of registered COVID-19 cases in each country of the world, obtained from official sources such as the health ministries of these countries, national and regional health authorities.
This data is used to analyse trends in the spread of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK and to compare them with data in Italy.
As an indicator of the level of prevalence of active COVID-19 cases, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 was calculated over 14 days, taking into account the normal trend of COVID-19 in each EU/EEA country and in the UK for the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also presented the cumulative number of cases recorded in each country at 8:00 on March 15, 2020, compared with data for Italy for the period from January 31 to March 15, 2020.
COVID-19 development trends in the EU/EEA countries and the UK
Trends in the development of the detected cumulative COVID-19 disease over a 14-day period in the EU/EEA countries and the UK as a whole corresponded to trends observed in the Chinese province of Hubei (Figure 1).
The cumulative spread of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK as a whole began to grow around February 21, and on February 28, 2020 there was a sharp jump in this indicator (additional material).
This was mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of recorded cases of the disease in Italy, but similar trends to the growth of cumulative COVID-19 disease (additional material) were observed in all other EU/EEA countries and in the UK.
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and in the United Kingdom compared with a similar figure for Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
According to these data, the total number of cases already registered as of 8:00 on March 15 in the other 15 EU/EEA countries and in the UK, compared to the number recorded in Italy only about 3 weeks before.
Our results indicate a rapid increase in the number of registered COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The observed trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 suggest that the pandemic is developing at a comparable rate in all countries.
And this despite the different stages in different countries, the differences in response measures taken by national public health authorities, and perhaps different criteria for the recognition of cases of the disease and different rules of selection of patients for COVID-19 testing, including the “overwhelming test.”
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy reported that about 10% of patients with COVID-19 require intensive care, and the media noted that the hospitals and intensive care departments in these regions are already as full as possible.
At present, data on the admission of COVID-19 patients to hospitals and/or intensive care units in the EU/EEA are only available for 6% and 1% of cases respectively (data not provided).
However, it is necessary to systematically collect such information in order to supplement the current monitoring data, which is the number of recorded cases and the number of deaths.
According to the results of a study conducted in 2010-2011, there is a significant spread in the number of cocks in intensive care and intensive care departments in Europe: from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 cocks per 100,000 people in Portugal.
This means that other countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 beds in intensive care and intensive care units per 100,000 population in the 2010-2011 period).
The ECDC’s sixth updated report on the results of an express risk assessment of COVID-19 presents scenarios for loading resources of healthcare systems with estimates of hospitalization of COVID-19-infected patients in each EU/EEA country over 90% of the pre-existing population and in the UK when not at risk.
Since at the moment cases are grouped according to certain regions of the EU/EEA and the UK, and hospitals and intensive care units usually serve the population of a particular territorial group, there is information about possible cases of infection and the number of cocci in the departments.
Italy’s experience and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is developing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Therefore, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should be prepared for the SARS-CoV-2 contact infection scenario, which has not been debilitating for a long time, and for the increase in the number of patients with COVID-19 in the region that may have been in need of medical care and, in particular,
As reported in the last report of the ECDC, the results of the express risk assessment will be of great importance for the prevention of the spread of SARS-COV-2, if it has an operative, preventive and comprehensive approach with the subsequent transition from the prevention to the minimization of the consequences will be possible.
The report on the results of the express risk assessment also lists measures in the field of public health to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
Countries have only a short period of time during which they can intensify their control efforts to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the burden on their health systems.
If not, in the coming days or weeks, healthcare systems in other EU/EEA countries will face an influx of patients who will need intensive care.
The 2019 outbreak of coronavirus infection (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) type 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has become a tragedy for humanity: at present, 80,000 cases have been reported in China and other countries, more than 3,000 people have died.
Similar to the homologous SARS-CoV virus, which caused the development of severe acute respiratory syndrome in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also be transmitted from bats and cause similar symptoms using a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has a lower severity of the disease and a lower mortality rate than SARS, but it is much more contagious and affects older people more often than young people and men more often than women.
In response to the rapid increase in the number of publications on the new disease, this article proposes an up-to-date and comprehensive review of the rapidly developing subject of the study.
We will consider the basic aspects of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis of further course and prevention of this disease.
While the answers to many questions still remain to be found, we hope that this review will help to understand and eradicate a dangerous disease.
The spring holiday (Chinese New Year), which fell on January 25, 2020, has become an unprecedented and unforgettable event for all Chinese, who, due to the outbreak of a new viral infection, were urged to stay at home for the rest of the day.
Given the high degree of similarity to the coronavirus (CoV), which caused the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, the World Health Organization (WHO) on February 11, 2020 called the virus a COVID-19 infection (COV-19) and a conjunctivitis.
The epidemic began in the Chinese city of Wuhan and spread rapidly across the country, and then to nearly 50 other countries of the world.
As of March 2, 2020, more than 80,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases were identified, more than 40,000 patients recovered, more than 3,000 patients died.
The WHO warns that COVID-19 is “the number one enemy to society” and potentially more dangerous than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months there have been more than 200 publications on COVID-19, including articles on its virology, epidemiology, etiology, sequencing of the patient's diagnosis and treatment.
This review is an attempt to summarize the results of research in a new and rapidly developing subject area.
As far as possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another coronavirus-causing disease – the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus, which occurred in 2012.
We will also discuss the currently known facts on the prevention and prediction of the course of the disease, as well as some other not less pressing issues.
Coronaviruses have traditionally been considered among the pathogens that are not fatal to humans and mainly cause about 15% of all respiratory diseases.
However, in this century, we have encountered two cases of highly pathogenic human coronaviruses, i.e. the coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) and the coronavirus of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV).
Therefore, the current COVID-19 is the third outbreak of a coronavirus infection in the history of mankind.
As shown in Fig. 1.1, the report on clusters of cases of pneumonia of unknown origin first came to the National Health Commission of China from Wuhan on December 31, 2019.
Seven days later, the genetic sequence of the virus was released.
On January 15, 2020, the first death was recorded in Wuhan.
Meanwhile, the epidemic has spread rapidly to neighboring cities, provinces and countries.
On January 20, it became known about the infection of health workers, which allowed to suggest the possibility of transmission of the virus from person to person.
On January 23, the city of Wuhan was quarantined and public transport ceased.
On January 24, according to the first clinical study of this disease, it was noted that 21 of 41 patients with confirmed coronavirus infection had direct contact with the seafood market in Wuhan, which was considered the starting point for the spread of infection from an unknown stomach.
On January 30, the WHO announced that the coronavirus outbreak is a global emergency in the field of public health.
At the time of the preparation of this report, the disease had spread throughout China and had already spread to approximately 50 other countries around the world (Figure 2).
In view of the rapid development of the situation, the final scale and degree of danger of the outbreak is yet to be determined.
On February 11, 2020, the results of a multi-centre clinical trial involving 8,866 patients, including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients, presented the following updated picture of the development of the epidemic (https://mp.weibhxin.qq.com/s/H2HBi_XX).
All age groups were exposed to SARS-CoV-2 infection, but mostly people between the ages of 30 and 65 were ill.
Nearly half (47.7%) of those infected were over the age of 50, very few were younger than 20, and only 14 were under the age of 10.
SARS-CoV-2 infection among men is higher (0.31/100 000) than among women (0.27/100 000).
COVID-19 has spread to clusters mainly in the province of Hubei and nearby regions.
On average, 5 (2-9) days have passed since the onset of COVID-19 symptoms before diagnosis.
The incubation period was an average of 4.8 (3.0–7.2) days.
From the time of symptoms to the onset of death, an average of 9.5 (4.8–13) days were spent.
The baseline reproduction rate (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51–4.05), and the adjusted R0 was 2.23–4.82.
By January 23, 2020, there was an exponential increase in the number of infected, which coincided with large-scale transportation on the eve of the Chinese New Year celebration.
Mortality among patients with confirmed diagnosis was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10–1.86%), and the adjusted mortality rate among patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02–4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 infection were: gender (male), age (<0xE2><0x89><0xA5>60) and severe cases of pneumonia.
Coronaviruses are a subfamily of large shell viruses containing one strand of meaningful RNA.
They can be divided into four species, i.e. alpha, beta, gamma and delta, of which alpha and beta-coronaviruses are known to affect humans.
In case of SARS and MERS-type corona viruses, the shell-type protein (S) binds to the cell receptors of the angiotensin-transforming enzyme type 2 (ACE2) and procetosynthetic protease-4 (DPP4).
In the cytoplasm, the viral RNA gene is released; after replication of the viral genome, the genomic RNA together with the shell glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins generates virion-containing vesicles, which then merge with the membrane.
The first reports of the genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 appeared on January 10, 2020.
It was found that SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of beta-coronavirus, the gene of which 99.98% coincides with 10 consecutive samples collected in the first wave of outbreaks of the disease, on the seafood market of Juanan in Wuhan.
Genetically SARS-CoV-2 is closer to SARS-CoV than to MERS-CoV.
Using an illuminating electron microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 particles were detected in ultra-thin incisions of the human respiratory epithelium.
The human enzyme ACE2 has been found to be a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, as well as for SARS-CoV.
However, the S-protein SARS-CoV-2 binds to the human enzyme ACE2 weaker than in the case of SARS-CoV, which explains the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes the disease to be less severe in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 may also generate a previously unknown short-lived protein, encoded orf3b, and a secreted protein, encoded orf8.
The orf3b protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus may play some role in terms of pathogenicity of the virus and suppress IFN<0xCE><0xB2> expression; however, orf8 does not contain any known functional domain or motif.
On February 18, 2020, a team of authors led by Zhou presented reports on cryo-electronic tomography of the structure of the full-size human ACE2 enzyme with a resolution of 2.9 <0xC3><0x85> in combination with the amino acid transporter B0AT1.
They found that this complex, which included open and closed conformations, was assembled as a dimer and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex could bind two S-proteins, which serves as evidence in identifying the coronavirus and infecting it.
B0AT1 may be a therapeutic target for drug screening to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Origin and Intermediate Hosts
It is known that the source of both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were bats, from which the virus was transmitted to humans through a civit and camels respectively.
By phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronaviruses, it was found that the first hosts of SARS-CoV-2 are bats, since the new virus is 96% identical to the flightZV and we are similar to SARS-CoV-21, namely SARS-CoV-X.
However, it remains unknown what species became the intermediate host, thanks to which the virus was able to overcome the species barrier and infect a person; the route of transmission is also yet to be determined.
Mr. Ji (Ji) and his colleagues suggested that the carriers of the virus from bats to humans became snakes, in the process of which there was a homologous recombination in the S-protein.
According to the results of their study, the Chinese scientists from Guangzhou2 have suggested that pangolins are long-tailed mammals, which feed on ants and are often used in traditional Chinese medicine, are the predominant corpus and the predominant-corpus-likes are the potential intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
However, the difference of 1% distributed between the two genomes is still very large, so it is believed that the final results with concrete evidence have not yet been obtained (Figure 33).
The physical and chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are largely unknown.
In laboratory conditions, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days at temperatures below 20 <0xC2><0xB0>C and 40-50% humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
It is known that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet and heating up to 56 <0xC2><0xB0>C for 30 minutes; effectively blocking the activity of the virus can be ether, 75 percent ethyl alcohol, chloro-containing non-chloroethers, non-residue disinfectants, chloroacetic acid, and chloroform.
The human population in general does not have immunity to SARS-CoV-2, so people are susceptible to the new virus.
There are currently no data on detailed studies of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.
Thus, we can only refer to earlier studies of other coronaviruses, primarily SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Figure 4).
As a rule, the host virus first recognizes the innate immune system through image-recognition receptors (ORRs), including lectin C-type receptors, Toll-like receptors, NOD-like receptors, and RIG-like receptors.
Through various mechanisms, the virus provokes the expression of inflammation factors, the maturation of dendritic cells and the synthesis of type I interferons, which inhibit the spread of the virus and accelerate the phagocytosis of macrophages against viral antigens.
However, thanks to the N-protein SARS-CoV can avoid an immune response.
Soon, an adaptive immune response will be included in the fight against the virus.
T-lymphocytes, including CD4<0x2B> and CD8<0x2B> T-cells, play an important role in protecting the body.
CD4<0x2B> T cells stimulate the generation of virus-specific antibodies in B cells, and CD8<0x2B> T cells directly kill virus-affected cells.
T-helpers produce anti-inflammatory cytokines that help protect cells.
However, the coronavirus can inhibit the functions of T cells, causing their programmed death.
Humoral immunity, including components such as C3a and C5a, and antibodies, also plays an important role in fighting viral infection.
For example, antibodies released from the recovered patient neutralized MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, a hyperreaction of the immune system entails the local formation of a large number of free radicals, which can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs, and in the worst-case scenario lead to polyorgan insufficiency and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is characterized by cluster manifestation, is more likely to affect elderly people with associated pathologies and pregnant women.
The likelihood of infection is higher for those people who are exposed to a large number of viruses or have disorders of the immune system.
According to the results of the study of the first 425 cases of infection in Wuhan, the calculated average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is from 1 to 14 days, mainly 3 to 7 days.
However, the study of 1,099 cases showed that the incubation period lasted on average 3 days, while the spread ranged from 0 to 24 days.
A study based on the demographic data of 8,866 cases described above showed that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0–7.2) days.
For health authorities, it is very important to adjust the time limits of the quarantine measures introduced taking into account the most accurate calculations of the duration of the incubation period, which will prevent the spread of the virus by those infected with the disease is asymptomatic.
A common practice was a 14-day quarantine for persons who had contact with the virus or were infected with the virus.
Should the quarantine period be extended to 24 days?
The main and first symptom of COVID-19 is often high fever, which can be the only manifestation or accompanied by other symptoms, such as dry cough, difficulty breathing, muscle soreness, dizziness, headache, sore throat, nausea.
Some patients experienced shortness of breath and/or hypoxia within a week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, the disease progressed rapidly, and patients developed acute respiratory disease, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy.
Patients with high fever and (or) symptoms of respiratory disease and acute fever should be screened for the virus in order to make an early diagnosis even in the absence of pathologies on chest images.
A demographic study conducted at the end of December 2019 found the following symptom prevalence indicators: 98% - high fever, 76% - dry cough, 55% - vomiting and 3% - diarrhea; 8% of patients required artificial ventilation of the lungs.
Similar results were obtained as a result of the last two studies of cases of infection in the family and transmission of the virus from asymptomatic infected.
Comparable results were obtained in 2012 in a study of patients with MERS-CoV, whose main symptoms were also high fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and shortness of breath (55%).
However, 80% of them required artificial ventilation of the lungs, this figure is much higher than among COVID-19 patients, and it corresponds to a higher mortality rate from MERS than from COVID-19.
Patients with MERS also experienced diarrhea (26%) and sore throat (21%).
The main symptoms of SARS patients are high fever (99–100%), dry cough (29–75%), shortness of breath (40–42%), diarrhea (20–25%), and sore throat (13–25%), and artificial lung ventilation is required in 14–20% of patients.
As of 14 February, COVID-19 mortality was 2% and the total number of confirmed cases worldwide reached 66,576.
Compared to this, SARS mortality by November 2002 was 10 per cent of the 8,096 confirmed cases.
In the case of MERS, a demographic study conducted in June 2012 showed mortality at 37% of the 2,494 confirmed cases.
According to the results of an earlier study, the baseline reproduction rate (R0) for SARS-CoV-2 was determined at 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) between 5.71 and 7.23, while R0 for SARS-CoV was only between 2 and 4.
The comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV in terms of symptoms, mortality and R0 is given in Table 1.1.
The above indicators indicate a higher SARS-CoV-2 ability to spread compared to MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but the mortality rate in case of infection with the new virus is lower than the last two.
Thus, holding back the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic will be much more difficult than the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV epidemics.
Cluster manifestation often occurs when an infection occurs within a single family or group of people who have gathered for any reason or have been together on any transport, such as a cruise liner.
Patients often traveled to Wuhan or other affected regions, lived there, or contacted infected or ill people during the last two weeks prior to the onset of the disease.
However, according to the reports, people can be carriers of the virus without any symptoms for more than two weeks, and cured patients, having been discharged from the hospital, can again be carriers of the virus, and this is an alarming signal to prolong the quarantine period.
In the early stages, patients have a normal or decreased number of leukocytes (especially lymphocytes) in peripheral blood.
For example, 1,099 patients with COVID-19 had lymphopenia with leukocyte levels <0x3C> 4<0xC3><0x97>109/L, including leukocyte levels <0x3C> 1<0xC3><0x97>109/L, as well as elevated levels of asparagine aminotransferase and viruses.
In the blood of some patients, elevated levels of liver enzymes, muscle enzymes and myoglobin were found, and in most patients, elevated levels of C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation were observed.
In patients with a severe course of the disease, the level of D-dimer, a product of the breakdown of fibrin present in the blood, was increased, and the number of lymphocytes was constantly reduced.
Most patients with COVID-19 during an X-ray examination of the breast cell have been diagnosed with pathologies characterized by uneven eclipses on both sides or eclipses of the “matte glass” type in the lungs.
Patients often develop atypical pneumonia, acute lung damage and acute respiratory disease (ARD).
With the development of OCD, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation and progressive fibrosis lead to a significant disruption of gas exchange.
Pneumocytic dysfunction of types I and II reduces the level of surface-active compounds and increases the surface tension, thereby reducing the ability of the lungs to expand and increasing the risk of lung decay.
Thus, the worst results of an X-ray study often coincide with the most severe cases of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 SARS demonstrated pneumocytic detachment, the formation of hyalin membranes and interstitial lymphocytic infiltration, and multinuclear infeeding and otocytes in patients with lung disease.
The main criterion in the diagnosis of COVID-19 was the method of detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by means of polymerase chain reaction with reverse transcriptase (PCR with reverse transcriptase).
However, given the high level of false-negative results that could accelerate the pace of the epidemic, since February 13, 2020, China has begun to make a diagnosis based on clinical manifestations (no longer relying solely on reverse transcriptase PCR).
The same was true with the diagnosis of SARS.
Thus, for effective diagnosis, it is critical and necessary to combine the data history of the disease, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and the results of the X-ray study.

This new technique, if successfully tested on clinical drugs, can significantly increase the sensitivity of the tests and the convenience of their conduct.
Due to the lack of experience of counteracting the previously unknown coronavirus, doctors can mainly provide patients with COVID-19 only supportive therapy, at the same time trying to apply any therapeutic methods as well.Therapeutic methods are also used and offered (V-Comer-Comer-viruses, SA-Comer-viruses).
These therapeutic methods include the current or potential use of antiviral drugs, immunosupplements, steroids, plasma of recovered patients, traditional Chinese medicine, and the provision of psychological support.
For the treatment, it was suggested to use even the plasma of recovered patients.
Pharmaceutical companies are in a hurry to develop antibodies and vaccines to fight the virus.
In the initial stages, SARS-CoV-2 attacks mainly the lungs, and may also affect to a lesser extent other organs expressing ACE2, such as the gastrointestinal tract and kidneys.
However, malfunctioning and respiratory failure are the main threat and cause of death of patients.
Thus, to alleviate symptoms and save lives, it is critical to support respiratory function, including general oxygen therapy, supply of high concentration of oxygen, non-invasive artificial ventilation, and invasive mechanical ventilation.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms need support in the form of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a modified method of extrapulmonary circulation, used to treat the conditions that pose a threat to the life of the heart or non-breath.
In addition, the most important importance for patients with SARS-CoV-2 is the maintenance of water-salt balance, prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shock, as well as the protection of the functions of vital organs.
It is known that a cytokine storm is a result of a hyperreaction of the immune system of patients infected with SARS and MERS viruses.
A cytokine storm is a form of systemic inflammatory process that develops in response to a series of cytokines, including TNF<0xCE><0xB1>, IL-1<0xCE><0xB2>, IL-2, IL-6, IFN<0xCE><0xB1>, IFN<0xCE><0xB2>, IFN<0xCE><0xB3>, and MCP-1.
These cytokines provocate immune cells to release a huge amount of free radicals, which become the main cause of OCD development and polyorgan insufficiency.
In the treatment of a cytokine storm, especially in patients in a severe condition, suppression of immunity is of the utmost importance.
For the treatment of cytokine storm, corticosteroids and tocilizumab, monoclonal antibodies serving as interleukin-6 inhibitors, were used.
Other methods of treatment of cytokine storm based on suppression of immunity include modulation of the immune response aimed at control of T cells; blocking the production of cytokines of IFN-c, IL-1, and TNF cypresonous gynaetopenia; suppression of janus kinase; blinosis.
To reduce the severity of the consequences of inflammatory processes in the treatment of SARS viruses, steroids are widely used as immunosuppressants.
However, steroids in large doses do not benefit in the treatment of severe lung damage in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
On the contrary, they can cause serious side effects, especially avascular osteonecrosis, which significantly worsen the prognosis.
However, short courses of corticosteroids in small and medium doses are recommended for use with caution in the treatment of patients with COVID-19 in a critical condition.
At the time of drafting this document, there is no confirmed effective antiviral therapy.
However, intravenous administration of remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue, proved to be an effective treatment for an American patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a recently developed antiviral drug originally developed by Gilead to treat diseases caused by Ebola viruses and the Marburg virus.
Later, remdesivir also demonstrated the ability to suppress other single-stranded RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS viruses.
Based on this data, Gilead has provided this drug to China to conduct peer-to-peer studies in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results of these studies are eagerly awaiting.
In addition, baricitinib, <0xCE><0xB1>-interferon, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin were proposed as possible treatment options for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir may be accompanied by diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other side effects.
The interaction of these drugs with other medicinal products prescribed to patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma of recovered patients and the production of antibodies
Blood clotting in patients who have been cured of an infectious disease, to treat other patients suffering from the same disease, or to protect a healthy population has been used for a very long time.
And in fact, the blood of recovered patients often contains a relatively high amount of antibodies to fight the pathogen.
Antibodies are found in immunoglobulins produced by B-lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other foreign objects; they recognize individual pathogen molecules and address neutralize them.
Based on this premise, plasma was extracted from the blood samples of a group of patients who had recovered from COVID-19, which was then administered to 10 seriously ill patients.
Within 24 hours, their symptoms improved, the severity of inflammation and viral load decreased, and blood oxygen saturation increased.
However, in order to propose that this method be applied in mass prior to a specific therapy, no verification and no explanations are required.
In addition, taking into account the therapeutic effect, some drawbacks associated with the use of plasma should be carefully studied.
For example, antibodies can overstimulate the immune system and cause cytokine release syndrome, which, given its toxicity, poses a potential threat to life.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and plasma to treat patients in a critical condition requires a lot.
It is not easy to develop and produce specific antibodies quickly enough to counter a global epidemic.
Thus, it is more important and practical to identify the B-cells of the recovered patients and identify the genetic code of the effective antibodies or conduct a screening to find the effective antibodies against the critically important proteins of the virus.
So we can immediately move on to mass production of antibodies.
The Chinese have been using traditional medicine for thousands of years to treat various diseases.
However, its effectiveness largely depends on the combination of many components of the formula, the composition of which differs depending on the diagnosis of the disease, based on theories of traditional Chinese medicine.
Most effective components are still unknown or have an undetermined effect, as it seems difficult to identify and check for these components or their optimal combination.
At present, due to the lack of effective specific therapy of COVID-19, traditional Chinese medicine has become one of the main alternative methods of treating patients with mild and moderate severity of symptoms or for patients recovering from severe post-existence.
For example, the capsules Shu Feng Jie Du (Shu Feng Jie Du) and Lian Hua Qing Wen (Lian Hua Qing Wen) were found to be effective in the treatment of COVID-19.
The largest percentage of recovered patients with COVID-19 were in a number of provinces of China, where traditional Chinese medicine was used in the treatment of 87% of patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%) respectively).
However, this is a rather rough comparison, as the assessment should be made taking into account many other influence factors, such as the number of patients and the severity of their illness.
On February 18, 2020, Mr. Boli Zhang and his colleagues published the study materials, in which a comparison of the treatment was made exclusively on the methods of Western medicine and the combined treatment on the methods of Western medicine and Chinese traditional medicine.
They found that the duration of normalization of body temperature, elimination of symptoms, and medical care in the hospital were significantly lower in patients who used a combination of Western and Chinese methods of traditional medicine for treatment than in patients who were only treated for the treatment.
The most surprising is the fact that the proportion of 46% of patients who started to worsen symptoms (from mild to severe) was noticeably lower in the group treated with a combination of methods only in the Western and Chinese traditional medicine, compared to the group that started to worsen.
However, the effectiveness and safety of traditional Chinese medicine still requires more closely monitored research conducted on a larger scale and in a larger number of regions.
It is also of particular interest to obtain, as far as possible, a description of the mechanism of action and an explanation of the effectiveness aspects of the components used in the techniques of traditional Chinese medicine, or a combination thereof.
Patients who suspect or have confirmed the presence of COVID-19 generally experience a strong fear of osteoarthritis and even fatal disease, and people who are quarantined also experience boredom, loneliness and extreme irritation.
In addition, symptoms of infection such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as side effects of treatment, such as insomnia from corticosteroids, can cause even greater anxiety and psychological stress.
In the early stages of the outbreak of the disease caused by the SARS virus, have been reported the manifestations of a number of psychiatric diseases, including chronic depression, increased anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor agitation, psychotic symptoms.
Compulsory monitoring of contacts and quarantine, as part of the measures taken by health authorities to contain the COVID-19 epidemic, may increase anxiety and guilt in people associated with the spread of infection, quarantine and social labels on their labels.
In this regard, psychological and psychiatric assistance should be provided to COVID-19 patients, persons suspected and in contact with them, as well as to all other persons in need.
Within the framework of psychological support, multi-profile psychiatric care brigades should be formed, clear information should be set up with regular and accurate updates on the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and treatment plans and use professional electronic devices and appliances.
Effective vaccines play an important role in disrupting the chain of transmission from infected animals and infected people to susceptible hosts and are often used in addition to antiviral therapy used to curb epidemics caused by new viruses.
Work has been done to create vaccines based on S-protein, the aim of which is the production of long-lived and highly active neutralizing antibodies and (or) protective immunity to SARS-CoV.
In animal studies, live attenuated vaccines against SARS viruses were developed.
However, prior to the start of clinical trials, it is still necessary to determine the efficacy of these possible vaccines in natural conditions when used in elderly patients, the model of infection with lethal doses and the degree of protection against infection with zoonotic viruses.
Perhaps the reason is that the SARS virus disappeared 17 years ago, and no new cases have been reported since.
At the same time, sporadic cases and clusters of disease caused by the MERS virus that originate in the Middle East and spread to other regions continue to manifest thanks to the preservation of zoonotic sources in endemic habitat areas.
To combat MERS, vaccination strategies have been developed using inactivated viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and recombinant protein elements, and some of these strategies have been evaluated in animals.
Developing a safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine for people who do not have immunity is an urgent and critically important task that requires a solution to curb a booming epidemic.
However, there are serious difficulties due to the long-term (average 18 months) needed to develop the vaccine, and the dynamic change in the dose of coronaviruses.
As a previously unknown disease, COVID-19 is only beginning to show a complete picture of the clinical course of the disease at the expense of thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients are able to recover gradually without complications.
However, COVID-19, similar to SARS and MERS, is also associated with a high incidence of complications and high mortality among patients with severe course of the disease.
In this regard, it is critical for health authorities to develop a prognostic model of the disease in order to prioritize the measures they take, especially in areas where there is a shortage of resources.
Based on the clinical studies presented at the moment, the following factors may affect or be associated with the prediction of the course of the disease in COVID-19 patients (Table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor in predicting the course of the disease caused by the SARS virus, which is also true in the case of COVID-19.
COVID-19 mainly affects patients between the ages of 30 and 65, 47.7% of whom are over 50, according to the above-mentioned study of 8,866 cases.
Patients who required intensive care were more likely to have underlying diseases and complications, and they were significantly older than those patients who did not require such therapy (on average 66 years vs. 51 years of age), which is a factor in patients with a COV of 19 in favor of age.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 infection among men is higher than among women (0.31/100 000 vs. 0.27/100 000), as mentioned above.
Diseases and complications: In patients with COVID-19, who require intensive care, there is a higher chance of developing acute myocardial damage and arrhythmia.
Cardiological phenomena were also the leading cause of death in patients with SARS.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can also bind to ACE2-positive cholangiocytes, which can cause liver dysfunction in COVID-19 patients.
It is worth noting that the age and the underlying diseases are closely related and can distort the results.
Deviations detected in laboratory studies: the level of C-reactive protein in the blood reflects the degree of severity of the inflammatory process or tissue damage, and it is proposed to be considered as a potential prognostic factor of the course of the disease, response to therapy and final outcome.
It was also proposed to take into account the correlation between the level of C-reactive protein, the severity of the disease and the prognosis for COVID-19.
In addition, the result can also be predicted by increased levels of lactate dehydrogenase, asparagine-aminotransferase, alanine-aminotransferase and creatinine kinase.
These enzymes are excreted in large quantities by different organs, especially the heart and liver, and their release occurs when tissues are damaged.
Therefore, they are traditionally markers of cardiac or hepatic dysfunction.
Main clinical symptoms: To predict outcomes and complications in the treatment of COVID-19, along with other factors, data from chest X-rays and the development of clinical symptoms over time should be taken into account.
Steroid Usage: As already described above, steroids are immune suppressants that are widely used in infectious diseases as an additional therapy in order to reduce the severity of the inflammatory process.
Since corticosteroids were widely used to treat patients with severe forms of SARS, many of the survivors of the disease developed avascular osteonecrosis, causing lifelong disability and low quality of life.
Thus, if steroids are needed for the treatment of patients with COVID-19, these drugs should be prescribed in small doses and short courses.
Psychological stress: As described above, against the background of the COVID-19 epidemic, many patients suffer from unforeseen severe stress, as they often have to endure long periods of quarantine, cope with the high degree of uncertainty and mortality of other patients.
In order to relieve the stress of such patients and help them return to normal life, psychological consultations and long-term support must be carried out with them.
According to current demographic studies, the COVID-19 epidemic appears to be different in its characteristics from the SARS epidemic.
In addition to replication in the lower respiratory tract, the SARS-CoV-2 virus, like other coronaviruses that cause common colds, can successfully reproduce in the upper respiratory tract and cause weak symptoms of indigestion or do not cause a cold at all.
For this reason, those patients who have an early stage of the disease or have not yet finished the incubation period, can, by living their normal life, spread the virus on a significant scale, which significantly complicates epidemiological control.
However, it was believed that transmission of the SARS-CoV virus occurs when patients are seriously ill, with most cases not occurring at an early stage of infection.
Thus, today’s COVID-19 epidemic is much more serious than the SARS epidemic, and it is more difficult to control it.
There is currently much work underway in China to declare universal quarantine in Wuhan and neighbouring cities, as well as an extended quarantine regime for virtually the entire population, introduced to disrupt the SARS-CoV-2 chain.
While these measures are causing enormous damage to the country’s economy and other areas of life, the number of new patients identified is shrinking, suggesting a slowdown in the spread of the epidemic.
According to the most optimistic calculations, the outbreak of the disease will end by March, and the thawing phase will last 3-4 months.
However, some experts are not so optimistic.
Mr. Paul Hunter and colleagues have calculated that the COVID-19 outbreak, which looks much more contagious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Researchers from the group, led by Ira Longini, developed a model to predict the end of the epidemic and suggested that the SARS-CoV-2 virus could affect two-thirds of the world's population.
A group of Canadian experts reported that the SARS-CoV-2 virus was found in nasal and throat stains taken from patients who had recovered and been discharged from hospitals two weeks earlier, indicating that the new virus could become a cyclic gum disease.
However, the reduction in the number of new cases in China is encouraging, pointing out that the strategies currently in use may have taken effect.
According to initial forecasts, Ebola fever should have affected up to a million people and caused the deaths of half a million patients.
But due to strict quarantine and isolation, the disease eventually managed to take control.
There is a chance that, like the SARS-CoV virus, the infecting ability of the SARS-CoV-2 virus may weaken, and over time it will disappear or become a less pathogenic virus coexisting with a person.
Below is a comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with the SARS and MERS epidemics (Figure 55).
The SARS-CoV-2 virus is characterized by a high rate of transmission through coughing or sneezing, as well as possibly through direct contact with materials contaminated with the virus.
The virus has also been found in the stool, which means that an oral-fecal method of transmission is also possible.
According to one recent study, 41% of the 138 cases studied may have been the result of an infection in the hospital, including 17 patients with other previously diagnosed diseases and 40 medical personnel.
Therefore, serious precautionary measures should be taken to protect the population, especially health workers, social workers, their relatives, colleagues and even strangers who are in contact with patients or those who are infected.
The first line of defense in the fight to reduce the risk of infection is wearing face masks; and surgical masks, and N95-class respirators (series No 1860s) help control the spread of viruses.
Surgical masks do not give microdrops of fluid from potentially infected to disperse in the air and settle on the surfaces from which they can be transmitted to others.
However, only N95-class masks (series No 1860s) can protect against inhalation of virions ranging in size from 10 to 80 nm, they only pass 5% of virions; SARS-CoV-2 virus of the same size as SARS-CoV, and they are both approximately 85 nm in size.
Since the particles can penetrate even through five surgical masks folded together, medical workers who are in direct contact with patients must wear N95-class masks (series No. 1860s), rather than surgical masks.
In addition to masks, medical professionals should wear a protective coat adapted to the figure, in order to further reduce the possibility of contact with viruses.
Viruses can also enter the body through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, the doctor became infected with SARS-CoV-2 despite wearing an N95-class mask; the virus may have entered his body through inflamed eyes.
Therefore, medical professionals should also wear transparent face shields or closed-type eyeglasses.
The entire population of affected or potentially endangered regions is strongly advised to wash their hands more often than usual with disinfectant detergents, to try not to leave the house while respecting self-isolation, and to limit contact with potentially infected people.
The acceptable distance to the patient is the distance of about a meter.
These measures effectively reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although the SARS-CoV-2 virus was previously unknown to humanity, the high degree of its similarity to SARS-CoV, reported on January 7, 2020, should have become a worrying signal for China, taking into account the experience it acquired during the 2003 SARS season.
However, it was only after January 19, 2020 that the director of the Centers for Disease Control in Wuhan reassured citizens, saying that the new virus has low contagiosity and limited reproductive capacity when transmitted from person to person and that prevention and control of the disease will not be a problem.
This statement significantly reduced social tensions, especially during a period when the entire country was preparing to celebrate the Chinese New Year, and a critical time was missed when the disease could be restrained within Wuhan with minimal losses.
China’s health authorities can take this tough lesson and make significant improvements in the future.
For example, there is a need for the health authorities to be able to make a more careful public statement, because each word is taken into account by the citizens and may affect their attitude and decisions; (2) to follow and respond more closely to the unusual information received from the clinic, and not before.
The COVID-19 outbreak, caused by a previously unstudied coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome of the second type (SARS-CoV-2), began in late December 2019.
In less than two months, the disease covered all of China and, at the time of writing, it spread to 50 countries around the world.
Because the virus is very similar to the coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) and the symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to the symptoms of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), with the outbreak of COVID-19 there was a sense of relief.
However, there are some significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are significant in terms of deterrence of the epidemic and treatment of patients.
COVID-19 affects older people to a greater extent than youth, and men to a greater extent than women; the proportion of severe cases and mortality rates among older people are also higher than among young people.
SARS mortality is higher than in COVID-19 (10.91% compared to 1.44%).
Patients with COVID-19 spread the virus even in the asymptomatic course of the disease, while patients with SARS usually infect others only in severe cases of the disease, so it is more difficult to curb the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This partly explains why SARS-CoV-2 spreads much faster and more extensively than SARS-CoV.
Some patients with COVID-19 may have negative conventional tests for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA.
On the other hand, cured patients may again show positive tests for the virus.
All this significantly increases the risk of the virus spreading.
Against the background of such rapid progress in COVID-19 studies, some key issues remain unresolved, namely:
What is the origin of the SARS-CoV-2 virus?
Despite the discovery of a 96% homologue between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-like coronaviruses in bats, we still can’t claim that SARS-CoV-2 infection came from bats.
What animal has become an intermediate species that has transmitted the virus from its original host, such as bats, to humans?
Without knowing the answers to the first and second questions, we cannot reliably interrupt the transmission path, and the epidemiological situation can worsen at any time.
Molecular-level modeling and biochemical tests have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, but how exactly is the virus inserted into the airway cells and provokes subsequent pathological changes?
Is the virus also linked to ACE2 producing cells in other organs?
Without a clear answer to these questions, we can’t provide a quick and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does the virus genetically evolve in the process of human-to-human transmission?
Will it cause a global pandemic, will it also disappear as SARS, or will it periodically recur like the flu?
These aspects are of paramount importance, but it will take time to find answers to these and many other questions.
However, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and return to normal life, whatever it may be worth.
Zoonosous origin of human coronaviruses
Mutation and adaptation have stimulated co-evolution of coronaviruses (CoVs) and their carriers, including humans, for millennia.
Until 2003, it was known that two human coronaviruses (HCoVs) cause a mild illness, such as a common cold.
The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have changed our perception of how catastrophic and life-threatening human coronavirus infection can be.
The emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome of the second type (SARS-CoV-2) in central China at the end of 2019 again drew attention to the coronaviruses and surprised us with the high transmittance of the virus, but less pronounced by the pathogenicity of this virus.
A human coronavirus infection is zoonosis, and understanding its zoonotic origin will be very useful.
Most human coronaviruses come from bats, for which they are not pathogenic.
Also known are intermediate reservoirs-carriers of some human coronaviruses.
The definition of carrier animals directly affects the prevention of the spread of human diseases.
Studying the interactions of animals that are carriers of coronaviruses can also shed light on the pathogenesis of the coronavirus in humans.
In this review, we present the available data on the seven human coronaviruses, focusing on the history of their discovery, as well as their zoonotic origin and methods of interspecies transmission.
It is important to note that we are comparing and comparing different human coronaviruses in terms of viral evolution and genomic recombination.
In this context, the current epidemic of the disease caused by the coronavirus detected in 2019 (COVID-19) is also considered.
In addition, the conditions necessary for a successful change of carriers are noted, and the effect of the evolution of the virus on the severity of the course of the disease.
Coronaviruses belong to the family Coronaviridae, which is a group of shell viruses with one positive-polar strand of RNA.
These viruses with the largest genome of RNA-containing viruses, containing between 26 and 32 thousand nucleotides, were named because of their shape, which when viewed under an electron microscope resembles a crown.
From a structure point of view, coronaviruses contain unsegmented genomes with identical organization.
Approximately two-thirds of the genome contains two large open partially overlapping reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b) that are transmitted into the replication polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab.
These polyproteins are further processed to generate 16 unstructured proteins, referred to as nsp1<0x7E>16.
The rest of the genome contains open reading frames for structured proteins, including spicy protein (S), shell protein (E), membrane protein (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
Other lines of coronaviruses also encode a number of line-specific accessory proteins.
Based on the differences in protein sequences, the coronaviruses are divided into four species (alpha-, beta-, gamma- and delta-coronaviruses), while the beta-coronavirus type includes most human coronaviruses and is divided into four lines (A, B, C and D).
There is phylogenetic evidence that the genetic source of most alpha and beta-coronaviruses are bats and rodents, while birds are the main reservoir for gamma and delta-coronaviruses.
For millennia, coronaviruses have constantly overcome interspecies barriers, and some of them have evolved into human-dangerous pathogens.
To date, seven human coronaviruses are known.
These include human alphacoronaviruses HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63.
The remaining five beta-coronaviruses include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV).
Human coronaviruses HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms such as cold and/or diarrhea.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the recently discovered SARS-CoV-2 viruses are extremely pathogenic, causing severe infectious diseases of the lower respiratory tract in the lungs and the lungs of the lungs in a relatively higher number of patients with a higher likelihood of development.
The first strand of the human coronavirus HCoV-229E, B814, was obtained from a sample of patients with a cold in the 1960s.
Since then, extensive studies have accumulated more detailed knowledge about the HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 viruses that cause symptoms of local infection.
Indeed, prior to the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), there was a generally accepted concept that infection with the human coronavirus was generally considered harmless.
The 2003 SARS outbreak was one of the most catastrophic epidemics in current history; more than 8,000 people were affected, and the overall mortality rate was about 10%.
Ten years later, the outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) led to a prolonged epidemic on the Arabian Peninsula, with the disease sporadicly spreading to the rest of the world.
The novel human coronavirus (2019-nCoV) discovered in 2019, which was later renamed SARS-CoV-2, is the cause of the current coronavirus infection epidemic 2019 (COVID-19), which has caused more than 1,000 human infections as of March 3, 2020.
An alarming signal has been received, and the world must prepare for the upcoming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All seven human coronaviruses have a zoonotic origin, their sources being bats, mice, or pets.
Numerous data sets indicate in favor of the evolutionary nature of the origin of all human coronaviruses from bats, whose organisms have adapted well and in which viruses do not exhibit pathogenic properties, but demonstrate a wide genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic has left China and the world with a severe challenge from a medical, scientific, social and moral standpoint.
The study of the zoonotic mechanism of the origin of human coronaviruses will allow us to understand their natural history, the driving forces of their evolution and the factors limiting interspecies transmission.
It may also prompt or accelerate the search for a reservoir, an intermediate and amplifying carrier of SARS-CoV-2, which is very important to prevent the disease from spreading again in the future.
This review contains general information on the zoonotic origin, interspecies transmission and pathogenesis of human coronaviruses.
In particular, we designate and consider the following common feature: the original viruses from which the human coronaviruses originated are usually not pathogenic to their reservoir carriers, but acquire a pathogenic character after interspecies transmission to a new carrier.
We also analyze the trend of evolution of human coronaviruses, according to which an increase in transmittance is often accompanied by a weakening of pathogenic properties.
In the same context, the result of the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is considered.
Animal coronaviruses have been known since the late 1930s.
Before strain B814 of the HCoV-229E virus was first obtained from a sample of patients who had a cold, various coronaviruses were found in various infected animals, including deer, mice, cows, pigs, and cats.
Seven human coronaviruses have been detected in the last few decades.
Table 1 informatively and clearly presents a brief history of the detection of human coronaviruses in a chronological order.
The first strain of the HCoV-229E virus was obtained from samples taken from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract infection in 1966; this virus subsequently adapted to the reproduction in the lines of lung cells WI-38.
Patients infected with the HCoV-229E virus had cold symptoms, including headache, itching, general discomfort and sore throat, with high fever and cough being observed in 10-20% of cases.
Later, in 1967, the HCoV-OC43 virus was isolated from organ culture and subsequent serial passage into the brains of mice.
Clinical signs of HCoV-OC43 infection appear to be similar manifestations of HCoV-229E infection, the symptoms of which are indistinguishable from other respiratory pathogens, such as influenza A viruses and rhinoviruses.
Both the HCoV-229E virus and the HCoV-OC43 virus are widespread around the world and are usually transmitted in winter at moderate latitudes.
Basically, the incubation period of these two viruses lasts less than a week, followed by an approximately two-week illness.
According to the results of the study in volunteers, healthy people infected with the HCoV-229E virus developed a common mild cold.
Only a few patients with weakened immunity had a severe infection of the lower respiratory tract.
The SARS outbreak, also known as the “epidemic of atypical pneumonia”, became the first in human history to be well documented by a pandemic caused by the human coronavirus, and the disease was caused by the SARS-CoV virus, the third of the human roots.
The first case of SARS was detected in late 2002 in the Chinese province of Guangdong.
During the SARS epidemic, 8,096 cases of the disease and 774 deaths were documented, and the disease spread to many countries and to different continents.
Without taking into account the superactive dispensers, it was calculated that each patient could infect approximately two more people; the incubation period was from 4 to 7 days, and the peak viral load was on the 10th day of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially had muscle pain, headaches, high fever, general malaise and numbness, and later symptoms included shortness of breath, cough, and respiratory failure.
Common deviations of laboratory parameters from the norm in SARS are lymphopenia, violations in liver tests, and increased levels of creatinine kinase.
Patients with SARS also have diffuse alveolar damage, epithelial cell proliferation and increased levels of macrophages.
Approximately 20-30% of patients subsequently require intensive care and mechanical ventilation of the lungs.
In such severe cases, other organs, including the organs of the gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidneys, can be infected in addition to the lower respiratory tract, which is usually accompanied by a cytokine storm, which can be fatal, especially for patients with dyspepsia.
For the first time, the virus was isolated from an open biopsy of a lung relative of a patient who came to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, huge efforts have been directed towards the study of human coronaviruses.
At the end of 2004, HCoV-NL63 was separated from a 7-month-old child from the Netherlands.
At first, it was found that it mainly affects younger children, older people and patients with weakened immunity and respiratory diseases.
The disease caused by HCoV-NL63 is characterized by such manifestations as constipation, conjunctivitis, high fever and bronchiolitis.
Another independent study described the release of the same virus from nasal material taken from an 8-month-old boy from the Netherlands suffering from pneumonia.
The virus has been found in the Netherlands, but it is actually widespread everywhere.
According to estimates, HCoV-NL63 is the cause of approximately 4.7% of widespread respiratory diseases, and the peak of the diseases caused by it occurs in early summer, spring and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, which is also called croup.
HCoV-HKU1 was isolated in Hong Kong in the same year from a 71-year-old man hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolitis.
In addition to extra-hospital pneumonia and bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 is associated with an exacerbation of asthmatic diseases.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, the HCoV-HKU1 virus, which causes mild respiratory diseases, has been detected worldwide.
All these four human coronaviruses, which cause extra-hospital infections, were well adapted to humans, and their mutation, which entails highly pathogenic diseases, is generally unlikely to occur, although the incidents were not known, as in the rare case of H.
Typically, by acquiring the ability to effectively transmit and retain in the human body, these human coronaviruses become less virulent or pathogenic.
Coronavirus Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) was first isolated in 2012 in Saudi Arabia from a mild 60-year-old patient with acute pneumonia and renal insufficiency.
Most of the laboratory-confirmed cases occurred in the Middle East, but in various European countries and Tunisia, import cases and the spread through episodic secondary cases of infection with close contact have been recorded.
Another secondary outbreak, with 186 confirmed cases, occurred in South Korea in 2015.
Clinical manifestations of Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) resemble symptoms of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) — both infections are characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also developed acute renal failure, which still distinguishes MERS from other diseases caused by coronaviruses that are transmitted to humans.
More than 30% of patients experience gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of February 14, 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory-confirmed cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome with a high mortality rate (34.4%) have been reported, so MERS-CoV is considered one of the most deadly viruses known to man.
In the period from mid to late December 2019, clusters of patients with pneumonia were detected in Wuhan, China’s province of Hubei, which, looking back in the past, are now linked to an infection caused by a severe coronavirus 2-RS.
The World Health Organization has announced that the ongoing outbreak of lower respiratory tract infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 is a global public health emergency, and the disease itself has been dubbed “coronavirus infection COVID-19” (COV-19).
As of March 3, 2020, there have been 90,053 confirmed cases worldwide, with an estimated mortality rate of 3.4%.
It should be noted that the death rate in the Chinese province of Hubei is 4.2%, and outside it - 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2, like the SARS and MERS coronaviruses, causes a severe respiratory infection characterized by an increase in temperature, cough and breathing.
Some patients also have diarrhea.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and is able to quickly switch to acute respiratory failure syndrome.
Despite the similarity of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, given the high homology of nucleotide sequences (82%), these viruses, however, form different branches of the phylogenetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 is obviously less pathogenic, but has a greater transmission capacity compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Cases of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection have been reported, indicating the ability of this virus to spread rapidly around the world.
The comparison and comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with the other six human coronaviruses reveals important similarities and differences.
First, the coronaviruses transmitted to a person have a similar incubation period and the duration of the course of the diseases caused by them.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 demonstrates the same trend as the other six human coronaviruses.
Second, the severity of the symptoms of COVID-19 is between SARS-CoV and the four human coronaviruses that cause extra-hospital infections (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-HKU1).
On the one hand, the manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection are similar to that most often observed with human coronavirus infection, causing extra-hospital infections, including non-specific manifestations, lung symptoms, or even absence of symptoms.
On the other hand, as with SARS-CoV infection, a small subset of severe COVID-19 cases can be identified, although the ratio here is slightly lower.
Thirdly, in terms of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, interesting patterns are also noted, characteristic of both human coronaviruses that cause extra-hospital infections, and of SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as in human coronaviruses that cause extra-hospital infections.
On the other hand, it is still to be checked whether the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 decreases with each subsequent transmission of the virus (i.e. infection of each subsequent person), as in the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, like other human coronaviruses that cause extra-hospital infections, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in samples of feces.
We still have to answer the question of whether the fecal-oral pathway of SARS-CoV-2 transmission is as significant (at least in some circumstances) as in the case of SARS-CoV.
The question of the possible seasonality of SARS-CoV-2, characteristic of human coronaviruses causing extra-hospital infections, is also of particular interest.
However, the future development of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak will depend on the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including transmission, pathogenicity and sustainable post-human transmission.
All four human coronaviruses that cause extra-hospital infections with mild-form symptoms have been well-adapted to humans.
On the other hand, it is possible that these people have adapted well to these four human coronaviruses.
In other words, both of these and others could be called the only survivors of human coronavirus pandemics in the past.
Human coronaviruses, which cause serious diseases in humans, and people in whom human coronaviruses cause serious diseases, simply did not survive.
In order for this to happen, human coronaviruses must replicate in the human body sufficiently to accumulate adaptive mutations that counteract carrier-limiting factors.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak lasts and the more people are infected, the more likely the virus is to fully adapt to the person.
If it adapts well, its transmission among people will be difficult to stop with the help of quarantine or other infectious disease control measures.
For many years, four non-hospital coronaviruses have been circulating among the population, causing the common cold in people with healthy immunity.
These viruses do not require an animal reservoir.
The highly pathogenic coronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not adapted well enough to humans, and their transmission among humans cannot be sustained.
They need to be preserved and propagated in their zoonotic reservoirs and look for cases of getting into susceptible human targets, possibly through one or more intermediate or intensifying carriers.
SARS-CoV-2 has features similar to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV, and four extra-hospital HCoV viruses.
It is very easily transmitted as out-of-hospital HCoV, at least at the moment.
But it is more pathogenic than non-hospital HCoV, and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether it is fully adapted to the human being and whether it will circulate in the human environment without a reservoir or with an intermediate carrier animal.
Before discussing the animal origin of HCoV viruses, it would be helpful to discuss the definitions and characteristics of evolutionary, natural, intermediate, amplifying and reservoir carriers of HCoV viruses.
An animal serves as an evolutionary carrier of HCoV if it carries a closely related ancestor with the same high homology at the level of nucleotide sequence.
The precursor virus is usually well adapted and non-pathogenic in this carrier.
Similarly, the reservoir carrier constantly carries HCoV over a long period of time.
In both cases, carriers are naturally infected and are natural carriers of HCoV or its parental virus.
In contrast, if HCoV was only introduced into the intermediate carrier just before or around the time it was introduced to the human, it was not well adapted to the new carrier and was often pathogenic.
This intermediate carrier can serve as a zoonotic source of human infection and play the role of an intensifying carrier, allowing the virus to flash replicate, and then passing it on to humans, increasing the extent of human infection.
HCoV can carry a dormant infection if it is unable to withstand transmission within the intermediate carrier.
On the contrary, HCoV viruses can also adapt to the intermediate carrier and even establish long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate carrier becomes a natural reservoir carrier.
Epidemiological data retrospectively showed that the patient with zero SARS had a history of contact with hunting-industrial animals (wild).
Further seroprevalence studies have shown that in animal traffickers the prevalence of IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV is higher compared to the general population.
The Himalayan cyvets (Paguma larvata) and the enotyped dog on the live animal markets became the first established carriers of viruses, similar and almost identical to SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly confirmed by the fact that, after the destruction of all civics in the markets, cases of SARS were no longer reported.
At the same time, it was reported that in Himalayan cyvets living in nature or on farms and not on the market, in most cases SARS-CoV was not determined, which allows to conclude that Himalayan cyvets could only serve as an intermediate enhancing carrier SARS-Co.
It is noteworthy that since 80% of the different animals in the Guangzhou markets have antibodies to SARS-CoV, it cannot be ruled out the possibility that intermediate enhancer carriers can also serve numerous species of small mammals.
They all appear to be carriers of the SARS-CoV virus.
A subsequent search for a natural animal carrier SARS-CoV found a closely related CoV of bats, which was named associated with atypical pneumonia of subspecies bats HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3) and which is present in the subspecies.
These mice are positive for antibodies to SARS-CoV and the SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 genomic sequence.
These and other bat coronaviruses have 88-92% the same homology of nucleotide sequences as SARS-CoV.
These studies laid the foundation for a new concept that bats became carriers of new human pathogens.
In bats, several SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-CoV) have also been identified, but none of them, other than one that identifies WIV1, can be isolated as a live virus.
The SARS-CoV receptor is known to be the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).
It was shown that WIV1, obtained from a faeces sample of bats, uses ACE2 bats, a civit and a human as a receptor for entry into the cell.
Interestingly, the serums of SARS-healing patients could neutralize WIV1.
To date, WIV1 represents the closest related ancestor of SARS-CoV in bats, dividing 95% of the homology of nucleotide sequences.
Despite the high homology between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not a direct parent SARS-CoV virus, and bats are not a direct reservoir carrier of SARS-CoV.
The phylogenetic analysis relates MERS-CoV to the same group as both CoV-HKU4 bats and CoV-HKU5 bats.
CoV-HKU4 bats and MERS-CoV use the same carrier receptor, dipeptyldipeptidease-4 (DPP4), to penetrate viruses.
The sequences of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of the MERS-CoV virus are phylogenetically closer to the sequences of beta-coronaviruses of bats detected in Europe and Africa.
To date, no live MERS-CoV virus has been found in wild bats.
The homology of the nucleotide sequences of MERS-CoV and its closest relative CoV-HKU25 of bats is only 87%.
That is, bats may not be a direct reservoir carrier of the MERS-CoV virus.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that single-hearing camels are seropositive to neutralizing antibodies specific to MERS-CoV, as well as camels of Middle Eastern origin in many African countries.
Live MERS-CoV, an identical virus found in humans, has been isolated from the nasal patches of single-mounted camels, which further confirms the role of camels as true reservoir carriers of MERS-CoV.
It is also worth noting that camels, experimentally infected with MERS-CoV, had minor symptoms, but massive viral distribution.
It is noteworthy that infected camels secreted the virus not only by the respiratory, but also by the fecal-oral route, which is also the main route of virus secretion in bats.
However, there are still questions, as many confirmed cases of Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome did not have a history of contact with camels before the onset of symptoms and are believed to be related to the account of human-to-human transmission or transmission by unknown channels.
The homology of SARS-CoV-2 nucleotides by 96.2% coincides with the CoV of RaTG13 bats isolated in Asian subspecies Rhinolophus affinis.
As with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the divergence of sequences between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too large to attribute parental relationships to them.
That is, bats may not be a direct reservoir carrier of SARS-CoV-2 unless almost identical bat coronaviruses are found in the future.
Presumably, the direct carriers of the SARS-CoV-2 virus should be among the wild species that are sold and killed on the Wuhan wholesale seafood market, which has been linked to many of the initial human cases of COVID-19, which indicates a probable case of animal transmission.
Several recent studies based on metagenomic sequencing have concluded that a group of endangered small mammals known as pangolins (Manis javanica) could also carry the parent beta-coronavirus, a strain related to SARS-Co2.
The homology of the nucleotide sequences of these new genomes of the pangolin coronavirus by 85-92% coincides with SARS-CoV-2.
But they are also closely related to RaTG13, with a nucleotide sequence identity of about 90%.
They are clustered into two sub-divisions of differentiation of viruses similar to SARS-CoV-2 in a phylogenetic tree, one of which has a receptor-binding domain (RSD) closer to SARS-CoV-2 with an identity of 4% amino acid sequences at the level 97.
On the contrary, RSDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 strains are more divergent, despite a higher degree of homology of sequences across the genome.
An earlier study of patients with pangolins also reported determining viral contingents in lung samples that were similarly related to SARS-CoV-2.
In this study, other methods of assembly and manual processing were used to obtain the genome sequence, which included about 86.3% of the full-size viral genome.
It cannot be excluded that pangolin has become one of the intermediate carriers of SARS-CoV-2.
However, due to the divergence of sequences between SARS-CoV-2 and Pangolin beta-coronaviruses related to SARS-CoV-2, there is currently no evidence to support the direct origin of SARS-CoV-2 from Pangolin.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even shorter than between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-coronavirus pangolins associated with SARS-CoV-2.
The evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammals has not yet been established.
While the highest homology of sequences was found in the RSD between SARS-CoV-2 and the beta-coronavirus pangolines related to SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 have the highest homology of sequences within the entire genome.
Very theoretically, the high degree of similarity between beta-coronaviruses of pangolins related to SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 is associated with parallel evolution through selectivity.
The opposite proposal is for a recombination between beta-coronavirus pangolins, related to SARS-CoV-2, and RaTG13 in the third form of wild animals.
As the driving force of evolution, recombination is widespread among beta-coronaviruses.
There is still no definitive decision on the direct zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCoV viruses, the zoonotic origin of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 viruses is also studied.
Phylogenetic evidence shows that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may originate from bat coronaviruses, while parent HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 strains have been detected in rodents.
It was reported that the bat coronavirus, named ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) and detected in the North American three-coloured succulent, demonstrates close affinity with HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E is genetically linked to another coronavirus of bats called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was discovered in Ghana, although there was suspicion that its intermediate carrier may have been camels.
For clarity, modern knowledge of the animal origin of known coronaviruses is summarized in Figure 1 and in Table 2.
The phylogenetic analysis provided evidence of the events of interspecies transmission of HCoV in the history.
When, around 1890, an interspecies transmission of the HCoV-OC43 virus occurred and people became infected with pets, a pandemic of respiratory infection was recorded.
The history of HCoV-229E interspecies transmission is not so clear.
Alphacoronaviruses of bats, closely related to HCoV-229E, have been found.
Between them is alpha-coronavirus alpacas.
Some data support the direct transmission of the virus from bats to humans.
First, it was humans, not alpacas, who were able to contact bats in a common ecological niche.
At the same time, people are in close contact with the Alps.
Second, bat alphacoronaviruses, related to HCoV-229E, in bats are diverse and non-pathogenic, while alpaca alphacoronavirus caused an attack of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, alpha-coronavirus has not been detected in wild animals.
Thus, it cannot be ruled out the possibility that the alpacas received the alphacoronavirus, related to HCoV-229E, from humans.
In fact, bats are a direct source of human pathogenic viruses, including the rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus, and the Hender virus.
Therefore, it is not surprising that bats could directly transmit HCoV-229E to humans.
On the other hand, while bat alphacoronaviruses could serve as a gene pool for HCoV-229E, alpacas and single-mounted camels could become intermediate carriers that transmit the viruses to humans, just as in the case of the MERS-CoV virus.
MERS-CoV serves as an excellent example of interspecies transmission from bats to single-hearing camels and from single-hearing camels to humans.
The evolutionary origin of the MERS-CoV virus from bats is known for its initial identification and was then confirmed by subsequent studies.
It’s obvious that bats give a rich pool of viruses for interspecies genetic exchange and interspecies transmission.
Longevity, densely populated colonies, close social interaction, and the ability to fly make bats “ideal spreaders.”
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV virus was introduced to single-horned camels decades ago.
It has adapted well to these camels, which from the intermediate carrier have become a stable and natural reservoir carrier.
In these animals, the MERS-CoV virus causes a very mild disease and is characterized by a relatively low frequency of mutations.
Its episodic transmission to a person is an accident, and the person remains a dormant carrier of MERS-CoV, as its transmission is not supported.
Unlike the role of camels in the transmission of MERS-CoV, the role of pangolins, if any, in the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is different.
In particular, beta-coronaviruses of pangolins are highly pathogenic in pangolins.
They may be carriers of beta-coronaviruses related to SARS-CoV-2, as well as civettes in the case of SARS-CoV.
In future studies, it is necessary to confirm or exclude several possibilities of interspecies transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus from animals to humans.
First, bats may be a reservoir carrier for a virus related to SARS-CoV-2, an almost identical SARS-CoV-2.
Humans can share an ecological niche with bats thanks to the charcoal or cleavage of these animals.
Secondly, pangolins may be one of the intermediate enhancing carriers that the SARS-CoV-2 related virus has recently entered.
Humans are infected with the virus through cutting cough and eating meat from wild animals.
It is possible that many animals, including pets, are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
The examination of domestic and wild animals for antibodies is justified.
Thirdly, as indicated above, recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 could occur in the third form, which contacted both bats and pangolins.
The search for animal origins of SARS-CoV-2 continues.
In addition to the different types of carrier animals, the three main factors on the part of the viruses also contributed to the crossing of interspecies barriers.
First of all, their relatively high rate of mutations in RNA replication.
Compared to other single-stranded RNA viruses, the calculated rate of coronavirus mutations can be considered "moderate-high" with an average rate of replacement of approximately 10-4 replacements per year at one site 2 depending on the phase of adaptation of the coronavirus to new outbreaks.
Coronaviruses have corrective exoribonuclease, the removal of which leads to an extremely high rate of mutation and weakening or even malviability.
Interestingly, the nucleotide analogue of Remdesivir suppresses the replication of coronaviruses thanks to the inhibition of this exoribonuclease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs that needs to be tested in clinical trials.
However, the frequency of coronavirus mutations is almost a million times higher than that of their carriers.
In addition, the frequency of mutation can often be even higher if the coronaviruses are not well adapted to the carrier.
Compared to SARS-CoV with a high mutation rate, the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 mutations is noticeably lower, suggesting a higher level of adaptation to humans.
Presumably, this virus has already adapted to another carrier, close to the human.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to single-horned camels.
Theoretically, vaccines and antiviral drugs from SARS-CoV-2 are unlikely to quickly lose their effectiveness as a result of genetic drift.
Second, the large genome of RNA in coronaviruses leads to greater plasticity in genomic modification in relation to mutations and recombination, thus increasing the likelihood of interspecies co-evolution favorable for the emergence of new coronaviruses in the presence of co-existence.
This is supported by numerous unique open reading frames and protein functions encoded in the direction of the 3<0xE2><0x80><0xB2>-end of the genome.
Third, thanks to the unique matrix selection mechanism, coronaviruses randomly and often switch the matrixes during RNA replication.
During the transcription of the DNA of the coronavirus in the carrier, which serves as a mixing vessel, there is often a switch of threads.
High-comological full-size and subgenomic RNAs can recombine and create new coronaviruses.
Phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination was found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as in animal coronaviruses such as SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9 in bat mice.
Interaction of the virus-carrier in relation to transmission
In addition to the three above-mentioned viral factors, another key factor important for interspecies transmission is the interaction of the virus with the carrier receptor.
In this article, as a typical example, which also demonstrates evidence of positive selection in interspecies transmission events, a recombination of SARS-CoV is presented.
Based on a comparative analysis between human SARS-CoV strains and cyvites, it is believed that SARS-CoV is undergoing rapid adaptation in different carriers, especially with regard to the mutations on the S-protein RSD.
In general, the RSD protein S of the coronavirus interacts with the cellular receptor, and the carrier’s antibody response intensively selects it.
SARS-CoV RSDs are amino acids, from 318th to 510th, on the S1 fragment, which binds to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (APF2), as well as its correceptors, to insert the virus into the cell.
The SARS-CoV RSD is able to recognize the APF2 receptors of different animals, including bats, cyvets, mice, and enotoid dogs, making it possible to transmit the virus interspecies.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues were found in RSD, which differ from human and civitate virus strains, with 4 of them in the receptor-binding motif for interaction with the APF2 receptor.
The SARS-CoV civette has the K479N and S487T mutations in RSD, which may increase the affinity of the spicy protein interaction with the human APF2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutes can be particularly important for adapting the virus to a person.
It is worth noting that SARS-CoV-2 has the same cellular receptor as SARS-CoV.
The 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 segment of the S protein leads to the fact that the affinity of the S protein to human APF2 may have changed.
Indeed, a cryo-electron microscope study suggests that the affinity of this link is 10-20 times higher than between human APF2 and the SARS-CoV S protein.
It would also be interesting to determine whether any other correceptors are required for SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
Surprisingly, HCoV-NL63 also binds to APF2, but to another segment of the S protein.
There are many other HCoV receptors, such as aminopeptidease N for HCoV-229E and 9-O-acetylcylic acid for HCoV-OC43.
They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of these coronaviruses in humans after interspecies transmission from carrier animals.
In addition to cellular receptors, the result of interspecies transmission of HCoV is also controlled by other factors of dependence and restriction of the carrier.
The divergence of these carrier proteins between humans and natural reservoir carriers of HCoVs, such as bats, unicorn camels, and rodents, can be a barrier to interspecies transmission.
For the successful interspecies transmission of HCoV viruses, it is necessary to usurp dependency factors and subject itself to carrier restriction factors.
In this regard, molecular determinants in this important area of interaction between the virus and the carrier still need to be defined and categorized.
Good results can be given by unbiased full-genome screening of carrier dependency and restriction factors for SARS-CoV-2 using the latest CRISPR technology.
The emergence of new HCoV: back to zero
The variety of coronaviruses in bats creates ample opportunities for the emergence of new HCoVs.
In this sense, bat coronaviruses serve as a genetic pool for HCoV.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination are also the driving force of HCoV evolution and serve two important stages in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new genes encoding proteins has the potential to radically modify virus phenotypes.
Among the accessory SARS-CoV proteins important for human adaptation is considered ORF8, since bat viruses related to SARS-CoV have been isolated, but have been found to encode divergent ORF8 proteins.
In strains isolated at the beginning of the human epidemic, a 29-nucleotide deletion characteristic of SARS-CoV coronaviruses was found.
This deletion breaks ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and it is considered an adaptive mutation that accelerates the change of carriers.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a history of possible recombinations with alpha and gamma-coronavirus lines, where a large number of smaller recombinant sites were identified in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Recombination localizations have also been determined in nonstructural nsp9 proteins, most nsp10 and parts of nsp14.
Similarly, it has been shown that the MERS-CoV epidemic has undergone recombinant events between different lines, which occurred in single-mountain camels in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombinant events were also observed in other HCoVs, in which HCoVs were recombined with other animal coronaviruses in their nonstructural genes.
It is also necessary to warn that artificial selection may contribute to unintentional changes in viral genomes, which is most likely due to the elimination of the virus from the selection pressures exerted, for example, by the carrier immune system.
An example of such effects is the loss of full-scale ORF4 in the prototype strain HCoV-229E thanks to the dual-nucleotide deletion.
While the intact open reading frame of ORF4 can be observed in bat and camel viruses related to HCoV-229E, alphacoronavirus alpaca demonstrates a mononucleotide insertion, which leads to a shift in the frame.
Finally, the evolution of the new HCoVs is also due to the pressure of selection on their tank carriers.
Infecting bats with coronaviruses, poorly expressed symptoms or their absence were recorded, suggesting reciprocal adaptation between coronaviruses and bats.
It turned out that bats are anatomically and physiologically well adapted to coronaviruses.
For example, defects in the activation of the proinflammatory response in bats effectively reduce the pathology caused by coronaviruses.
In addition, the natural activity of killer cells in bats is suppressed due to the apregulation of the inhibitory receptor of natural killer cells NKG2/CD94 and the low level of expression of molecules of the main class I histocompatibility complex.
Moreover, the high level of active forms of oxygen, which is provided by the high metabolic activity of bats, can suppress the replication of the coronavirus, while affecting the reading of the exoribonuclease that is carried in the progenitors, thus creating the pressure of selection for the generation of vivos.
More pathogenic strains of the coronavirus may also evolve as a result of recombination, leading to the acquisition of new proteins or protein properties for carrier adaptation.
Thus, it is no coincidence that in the last twenty years three new human coronaviruses have emerged.
Coronaviruses are non-pathogenic or cause mild symptoms in their reservoir carriers, such as bats or camels.
They are reliably replicated without causing a strong immune response to the carrier.
This is the secret of why we see asymptomatic carriers, and what causes severe cases of human infection.
Severe symptoms are mainly associated with hyperactivation of the immune response and a cytokine storm, in which the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lung damage.
On the contrary, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response is not associated with the replication of the coronavirus.
The same strategy of non-binding the immune response can have beneficial effects in anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
In bats, the interferon response is particularly strong.
Thus, taking interferon type I, at least in the initial phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans, should have a favorable effect.
In addition, in bats the activation of NLRP3-inflammasome is impaired.
Based on this, inhibition of the NLRP3-inflammasome with MCC950 may be beneficial in the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general scheme by which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV emerged.
While bat betacoronavirus has been found, the nucleotide homology of which 95% coincides with SARS-CoV, there is also bat coronavirus, the nucleotide homology of which coincides 96% with SARS-CoV-2.
Although it has been found that civites and other animals on the market carry viruses identical to SARS-CoV, direct intermediate carriers for SARS-CoV-2 have not been established.
Pangolin beta-coronaviruses, astoundingly homologous SARS-CoV-2, have been found, suggesting that the pangolins could serve as one of the intermediate carriers or that fragments of the beta-coronavirus genes of the pangolins could enter the final SARS-Co2 version.
Despite the remaining questions, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was intentionally or accidentally created by humans.
Coronaviruses have attracted widespread attention due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
The study of coronaviruses in bats and other animals radically changed our perception of the importance of zoonotic origin and HCoV reservoirs in human transmission.
Conclusive evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originate from bats and have been transmitted to humans through intermediate carriers.
If the SARS-CoV infection comes from contact between people and civics in the markets, the closure of the wild markets and the destruction of civics on them could effectively put an end to the SARS epidemic.
For the same reason, in the light of the discovery of various lines of beta-coronavirus pangolins, closely related to SARS-CoV-2, to prevent zoonotic transmission of infection from food markets, pangolins should be removed.
However, whether SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through pangolins and other mammals and how this can occur remains a challenge for future research.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV virus has been around for a long time in single-horned camels.
These camels serve as an important vehicle, as well as a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool products for the local population.
They are widespread in the Middle East and in Africa.
Therefore, it is not possible to donate all camels for control of MERS, as was done in the wild animal markets of China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop periodic MERS outbreaks, a comprehensive approach is needed to develop an effective MERS-CoV vaccine for camels in combination with other infectious control measures.
Since we can’t eliminate these viruses, new genotypes can appear that cause outbreaks of the disease.
Various zoonotic coronaviruses are circulating around the world.
In particular, the coronaviruses of bats with zoonotic potential are extremely diverse.
There are a huge number of possibilities for the evolution and recombination of these zoonotic coronaviruses, which will lead to the emergence of new coronaviruses in the future, which are more easily transmitted and (or) more deadly to humans.
In order to reduce the number of unnecessary contacts between humans and animals, it is necessary to abandon the culture of consumption of wild animals in some areas of China.
After severe tests such as SARS, MERS and COVID-19, better preparedness and a plan to respond to such situations are needed.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a very long time.
They remain in their natural reservoirs until the possibility of capturing new territories arises.
Although many properties of bats are conducive to spreading viruses, if you teach people to stay away from them, you can minimize the likelihood of human contact with bats and other species of wild animals.
To better understand the ecology of coronaviruses and their natural carriers, constant epidemiological surveillance of mammals is needed, which will be useful in preventing the transmission of coronaviruses from animals to humans and future outbreaks of diseases.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonosis is to keep people away from environmental niches of natural reservoirs of zoonotic viruses.
In the puzzle of zoonotic origin, SARS-CoV-2 still lacks some fragments.
First, if bats have passed the precursor virus SARS-CoV-2 to pangolins, it is interesting to see under what circumstances bats and pangolins share the same ecological niche.
Secondly, if bats play a more direct role in transmitting to humans, it is necessary to determine how humans came into contact with bats.
Third, if the third mammal plays the role of a true intermediate carrier, then it is necessary to find out how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats, and pangolins.
Finally, since many mammals, including pets, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both epidemiological surveillance and experimental infection should be carried out.
Whether it is a bat, pangolin or other mammalian, it is expected that in the future SARS-CoV-2 or its predecessor viruses will be identified by their natural carriers.
Further research in this area will shed light on the evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, which will have important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
Diagnostic criteria need to be updated for “suspicious cases” and “confirmed cases” of COVID-19
On February 6, 2020, our group published a brief guide on the diagnosis and treatment of new coronavirus infection 2019 (2019-nCoV), which provides information about the experience we have gained and gives outlined recommendations on the fight against this world.
However, 2019 coronavirus infection (COVID-19) is a new disease, so our understanding and knowledge have gradually increased based on current research and clinical experience; thus, diagnostic strategy and therapeutic practice have also been continuously updated.
In this letter, we have responded to one comment on our recommendations and provide the latest diagnostic criteria for “suspicions of the disease” and “confirmed cases” in accordance with the document “Recommendations on Diagnosis and Therapy for COVID-19” (ed.
In December 2019, the outbreak of the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV), now officially named coronavirus infection 2019 (COVID-19), and the viral disease itself was called “severe acute respiratory syndrome 2” (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, the WHO classified COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In order to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team has developed a short guideline and published it online on the website of Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
This publication has attracted a lot of attention.
It should be noted that COVID-19 is a new disease, so our understanding and knowledge have gradually increased based on current research and clinical experience; thus, diagnostic strategy and therapeutic practice have also been continuously updated.
For example, from January 16 to March 3, 2020, there were seven issues of the document “Recommendations on Diagnosis and Therapy for COVID-19”, published by the National Committee on Health of the People’s Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), and its contents are inconsistent.
Recently, a paper prepared by Zhou (Zhou) with the co-authors provided comments on our recommendations. They contained simple diagnostic suggestions based on the already available clinical experience.
This work has added new practical evidence to our recommendations, and it has also provided valuable reference information on this pandemic that spans the world.
We reaffirm the high importance of their work and express our gratitude.
However, according to the latest edition of the “Recommendations on Diagnosis and Therapy for COVID-19” (trial seventh version) and the results of current research, and their work needs to be updated.
According to the seventh edition of this document (from March 3, 2020), for a comprehensive analysis to confirm the case of suspicion of the disease, it is necessary to combine any one element of the characteristics of the epidemiological history with two clinical manifestations of the disease:

It can also be noted that in the second (January 18, 2020) and third (January 22, 2020) editions of this document, a real-time PCR test for nucleic acids in the respiratory tract or blood samples was added.
Pathogenetic diagnosis of blood samples was added in the fourth (January 27, 2020) and fifth (February 8, 2020) editions; and then in the seventh edition the need for serological evidence was added.
These changes are based on the results of continuous work of researchers engaged in the search for the optimal set for the detection of nucleic acids at the time of the rapid diagnosis, as well as for the analysis of the samples taken in the blood vessels in the blood vessels and for the analysis of the blood samples taken from the respiratory tract, including the selection of blood samples, which increases the availability of differentials.
At the same time, there is increasing evidence of the need to exercise caution in the treatment of patients with atypical symptoms and patients without expressed symptoms.
Thus, the itinerary presented in Zhou’s work, etc., should be updated, since in it persons without clinical symptoms are classified as a “low-risk” group.
The evaluation system also requires clarification when conducting further clinical practice and studies.
In conclusion, we hope to get more direct evidence, and we encourage readers to leave their comments.
When it comes to diagnosing “suspicious cases” and “confirmed cases,” we offer readers to follow up and strictly follow up on the latest recommendations given in the countries where they live.
Our group will also update its recommendations in a timely manner in order to provide effective assistance.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths as a result of Covid-19 - daily maximum
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new COVID-19 deaths per day.
This is the highest number of deaths from the virus per day.
As of yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute of Epidemiology, Control and Disease Research (IEDCR) reported that the number of recorded cases of infection included 114 current cases, as well as 33 recovered patients who were at home.
A total of 17 deaths were recorded.
In an online briefing, IEDCR Director Dr. Mirjabi Sabrina Flora said that four men and one woman were victims.
According to Dr. Mirjabi, two of the deceased were over the age of 60, two were between 51 and 60, and one was between 41 and 50.
She also reported that two of the dead were from Dhaka.
On March 11, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a COVID-19 pandemic.
The clinic employee told local news agency Anadolu that one of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bengal Anti-Corruption Commission, who was on treatment at the Kuwaiti Maitri clinic.
In an online video on Saturday, Bangladesh’s Minister of Road Transport and Bridges, Obaidul Quader, said that the public transport operation would be stopped for a longer period than originally planned until next Saturday.
Public transport has been suspended since March 26 and was due to resume on Saturday, April 4.
Transportation of essential goods – medicines, fuels and foodstuffs – was still allowed.
The first cases of COVID-19 infection were recorded in Bangladesh on March 8 in two people who returned from Italy, as well as in the wife of one of them.
As of March 19, these three people have already recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 has crossed the line of one million cases of infection worldwide
According to Johns Hopkins University, the total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection worldwide exceeded one million on Thursday.
At least 52,000 people have died from the COVID-19 coronavirus.
The outbreak occurred on the same day that the first case of infection was confirmed in Malawi, and the first case of death from the coronavirus was recorded in Zambia.
North Korea has claimed that as of Thursday it was one of the few countries in which no cases of coronavirus infection have been recorded.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases of infection, including 79,332 cases in the twenty-four hours preceding 10:00 Central European Time (0800 UTC) on April 4.
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases of coronavirus infection have been reported, of which at least 5,900 have been fatal.
CBS News, citing data from the Johns Hopkins University, reported that more than 1,000 deaths caused by coronavirus infection were recorded in the United States on Wednesday.
Countries around the world have announced tightening measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, the mayor of Moscow Sergei Sobyanin extended the self-isolation regime of the citizens of the city until May 1.
Earlier, President Vladimir Putin said that Russians across the country, despite self-isolation, will receive salaries until April 30.
The Portuguese Parliament voted in favour of extending the state of emergency by 15 days; the vote results: 215 votes in favour, ten abstentions and one vote in favour.
Saudi Arabia extended the command time in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina for a full day, while the previous command time lasted only from 3 a.m. to 6 a.m.
Thailand planned to introduce a Commander’s Hour from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m.
Ohio Governor Mike Deweyne has announced that the state’s domestic self-isolation regime has been extended by order until May 1.
Stores in Australia are limiting the number of toilet paper packaging that can be purchased at one time
On Sunday and Saturday evening, Australian chain stores Woolworths and Coles reduced the number of toilet paper packages that can be purchased at once in all stores in the country to two and one packages, respectively.
On Monday, ALDI also introduced a one-pack limit.
These restrictions were reported in the ads on the cash registers, as well as on the network page on Facebook.
It is reported that citizens have started making emergency reserves because of fears that COVID-19 could lead to the introduction of a regime of general self-isolation.
On Wednesday, the Woolworths network also limited the amount of toilet paper purchased to one package.
Earlier, on March 4 and 5, respectively, Woolworths and Coles had already limited this quantity to 4 packages.
In its March 8 press release, the Coles retail network reported that with the introduction of a four-pack restriction “in many stores toilet paper is still being bought out too quickly – one delivery in an hour is being shipped in a pre-order”, and called such a demand “unprecedented” by Facebook at the time.
According to a spokesperson for Woolworths, there was a sharp increase in sales last week.
The Costco store in Canberra last week also limited this number to two packs.
To compensate for the deficit, Coles began ordering larger batches from suppliers and increasing the frequency of deliveries, Woolworths ordered additional batches, while ALDI made stocks for a special early sale stock on Wednesday.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said that retailers are trying to replenish stocks, but this is made more difficult due to local authorities’ restrictions on the timetable for trucks.
It expects an increase in the cost of products, as suppliers try to meet demand, but at the same time less and less profitable offers are available.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that due to depletion of stocks, some stores are not able to hold promotions on Wednesday.
In a report on News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail expert at Queensland University of Technology, said that stores replenish supplies every night.
He noted that toilet paper is a bulky commodity, so the amount of stock is small, and after the sale of the entire volume of the goods, long rows of shelves remain empty, increasing the feeling of lack of stock.
“Coles and Woolworths believe that if shelves could be filled, and goods such as toilet rolls and hand sanitizers could be placed on these shelves in large quantities, buyers probably wouldn’t panic so much,” says Russell Tsim.
On Wednesday, the producer of recycled toilet paper Who Gives a Crap reported that stocks have run out.
According to News.com.au, Kimberly-Clark, the toilet paper company Kleenex and Solaris Paper, which also produces Sorbent products, said they are working around the clock to ensure a sufficient number of products.
Domain.com, a real estate website, said that when the number of auctions in Melbourne fell due to the absence of buyers on Labor Day week, some real estate sellers began offering free toilet paper to the first bidders.
The Thursday edition of the daily NT News, which is printed in Darwin, included an eight-page tab designed for cutting and using as toilet paper.
According to ABC Australia’s March 3 report, stores initially reluctantly imposed restrictions on the quantity of goods purchased, stating that they do not plan to do so.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products are also in high demand, including medical masks, hand sanitizers, galleries, hand-washing and flour.
Similarly, in addition to the events in Australia, on Sunday evening it was noticed that the online store of the British supermarket Ocado also limited the sale of Andres toilet paper to two packs of 12 rolls.
World Health Organization Announces COVID-19 Pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the pandemic of the infectious disease COVID-19, caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
Despite the fact that the term “pandemic” characterizes only the extent of the disease, and not the danger of specific cases, WHO notes that country governments need to take action:
“All countries together are still able to influence the progress of the pandemic.”
This is possible if countries are engaged in the identification, testing, treatment, isolation of the sick, monitoring the occurrence of the disease, as well as the mobilization of their citizens,” said WHO Director-General Mr. Tedros Adan Gebreisus.
“We are deeply concerned by both the alarming level of the spread and severity of the disease and the alarming level of inactivity.”
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic is “unprecedented.”
He said in an interview broadcast on CNN in February that “no respiratory virus other than the flu has been traced since its onset to a continual global spread.”
Mr. Gebreisus expressed a similar view, saying that “we have never seen a pandemic caused by the coronavirus.
We also have never seen a pandemic that can be controlled before.”
First, in January, the WHO declared the outbreak of the disease an emergency in the field of public health of international importance, and then granted it a new status — a pandemic.
The director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, responded to the outbreak: “This is only the beginning, it will be worse.”
According to the Associated Press, there were at least 126,000 COVID-19 cases worldwide on Thursday, with more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019–2020 coronavirus pandemic is the current time of the 2019 coronavirus disease pandemic (COVID-19), caused by the coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome<0xE2><0x80><0x90>2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was detected in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, and on January 30, 2020, an emergency of international importance in the field of public health was declared, which was subsequently recognized by the pandemic on March 11, 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 210 countries and regions, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people have recovered.
The death rate in China is 4%, while in the world it varies from 13.04% in Algeria to 0.08% in New Zealand.
The most common symptoms include fever, coughing, and difficulty breathing.
Possible complications include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time from the first manifestation of symptoms to the peak of the disease is usually about five days, but it can also vary from two to fourteen days.
At the moment, no vaccine or specific treatment has been found.
The main treatment has a symptomatic and supportive nature. The recommended preventive measures include washing hands, covering the mouth when coughing, observing the distance between people, identifying and ensuring self-isolation of people suspected of their infection.
Authorities around the world have responded to the situation by imposing travel restrictions, quarantine measures, command time, workplace risk control, and the closure of various facilities.
The pandemic has led to serious global socio-economic consequences, the transfer or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, as well as a widespread shortage of goods aggravated by panicked purchases.
Schools and universities have been closed at national or regional levels in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4% of students worldwide.
On the Internet, misinformation about the virus began to spread, there were cases of xenophobia and discrimination against citizens of China, other citizens of East and South-East Asia, or people who are reminiscent of their evictions abroad, as well as against other groups of people living in the area.
As a result of the reduction in the number of trips and closures of heavy industry enterprises, the level of air pollution and carbon emissions decreased.
On December 31, 2019, the health authorities of Wuhan (Hubei Province), China, reported cases of pneumonia with an unknown cause, and an investigation into the situation began in early January 2020.
Cases of infection were mainly related to the wholesale market of seafood, so the virus is believed to have a zoonotic origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak of the disease is known as SARS-CoV-2. It is a recently discovered virus that has a great resemblance to bat coronaviruses, Pangolin coronaviruses and SARS-CoV. It was later discovered that the first case of the disease was not caused by this disease in 2019.
Two-thirds of the infections recorded in December 2019 were related to this market.
On March 13, 2020, in the publication of the South China Newspaper, the Kyrgyzstan Newspaper and the Kyrgyzstan Newspaper, which has not been verified, the inference was made that the first case of the infection occurred with a 55-year-old resident of the province of Hubei on November 17, 2019. On February 26, 2020, the WHO reported that the volume of the disease was
The number of cases of the onset of the disease can be significantly reduced, in particular, due to the number of cases with poorly expressed symptoms.
By February 26, there were relatively few cases of infection among young people, and patients aged 19 years and younger accounted for less than 2.4% of cases worldwide. United Kingdom's chief scientific adviser Patrick Wallans estimated that 60% of the British population would be infected.
The statistics include cases of infections of people who have been tested for COVID-19, and whose test was positive according to official protocols.
As of 23 March, no country has been able to check more than 3% of its population, and in many countries, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland, an official policy has been adopted that requires testing not to be carried out with only minor symptoms.
A study published on March 16 found that 86% of COVID-19 cases were undetected in China by January 23, and that such unregistered patients became the source of infection for 79% of the cases registered.
A statistical analysis, published on March 30, showed that the number of cases of actual infection in Italy significantly exceeded the number of recorded cases.
Initial estimates of the baseline reproductive number of COVID-19 infection (R0) ranged from 1.4 to 2.4.
In a study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, this figure is estimated to be 5.7.
Most of the patients with COVID-19 are recovering safely.
In other, more complex cases, the time from the onset of symptoms to the time of death was 6 to 41 days, with the most frequent period being 14 days.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths have been linked to COVID-19.
In China, as of February 5, about 80% of deaths occurred in persons over 60 years of age, and 75% of the deaths had associated diseases, including cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. Patients with COPD are contagious. Official data on deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic usually include deaths
The actual number of deaths from COVID-19 may be much higher, as official figures may not include people who died without testing — for example, in the case of death at home, in the homes of the elderly, etc.
Incomplete data on Italy indicate that the actual number of deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official COVID indicators by 4-5 times.
The press secretary of the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of the year, Perepa, admits: "We know that [the reported number of deaths] is lower than actual". His words are confirmed by reports of such cases in the United States.
The first death outside mainland China was recorded on February 1 in the Philippines, and outside of Asia — in France on February 14.
As of February 28, more than a dozen deaths have been reported outside mainland China: in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
By March 13, more than forty countries and regions on all continents except Antarctica had reported deaths. Several methods are usually used to quantify mortality.
All indicators vary depending on the region and time of the spread of the disease; they are also affected by the volume of testing, the quality of the health systems used treatment regimens, the time since the onset of the outbreak of the disease, the time of the disease and the parameters of the population, such as age, sex and general health.
According to statistics from Johns Hopkins University, as of April 10, 2020, the global number of deaths and infections is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204).
Data for different regions differs.
In China, the protease ratio of infective and infectious diseases of the patients has decreased from 17.3% (for those with symptoms appeared on January 1-10, 2020) to 0.7% (for those with symptoms appeared after February 1, 2020). Other methods include the determination of the rate of death in the outcome.
These statistics are not tied to a specific time and reflect the indicators of certain groups of the population from the moment of infection to the end of the course of the disease.
Some scientists have tried to calculate these indicators for specific groups of people.
According to estimates from the Center for Evidence Medicine at the University of Oxford, the overall mortality rate from this pandemic is from 0.1 to 0.39%.
The top figure of this range is consistent with the results of the first randomized COVID-19 test in Germany, as well as with a statistical study analyzing the impact of testing on CFR assessments.
The World Health Organization (WHO) says the current pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and exact duration of the flare cannot be determined and may vary depending on the location.
Macey Bonnie, an employee at the University of Pennsylvania, claims that “uncontrollable infectious outbreaks usually go off the plateau, and then when the number of available carriers of the disease ends, they begin to fade.
However, in the current situation, it is almost impossible to make any reasonable predictions as to when this will happen.”
Zhong Nanshan, a senior medical adviser to the Chinese government, said that “everything could end by June” if all countries were able to mobilize and comply with WHO recommendations on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said that SARS-CoV-2 “will probably circulate in a year or two.”
According to a study conducted by the Imperial College under the leadership of Neil Ferguson, “until the vaccine is created (possibly 18 months or more),” physical distancing measures and other measures will be required.
William Schaffner, an employee at Vanderbilt University, said: “I don’t think this coronavirus will ever go away at all, because it’s so easily transmitted,” and that it “could turn into a seasonal disease by erupting every year.”
The virulence of new outbreaks will depend on the collective immunity and degree of mutation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 can be relatively nonspecific, and some infected people can tolerate the disease without symptoms.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, the formation of mucus in the respiratory tract (slip), loss of smell, breathing, pain in the muscles and joints, pain in the throat, headaches, diarrhea, vomiting, diarrhea, cyanosis.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists such urgent symptoms as difficulty breathing, constant pain or a feeling of depression in the chest, a sudden sensation of confusion in the chest, a sudden sensation of confusion of consciousness, difficulty with waking or blinking of the face.
In some infected people, the disease can develop asymptomatic, without any clinical manifestations, but at the same time, the results of the tests confirm the fact of the infection, so doctors recommend placing persons who are in close contact with the inguinea and whose diagnosis is confirmed.
According to Chinese scientists, the number of cases of asymptomatic course of the disease varies from several units to 44% of all cases.
The usual incubation period (the time between infection and the onset of symptoms) varies from one to 14 days; usually it is five days. There is still no complete clarity on the symptom of loss of odor: it is estimated that 30% of patients with COVID-19 have developed.
Some details of how the disease is spread are still unknown.
It is believed that the disease is mainly transmitted during close contact, as well as by means of small drops, excreted in the air along with a cough, itching or during a conversation; under close contact is meant contact within a radius of 1 to 2 meters (from 3 to 6 ft).
According to some studies with an open cough, drops can spread at a distance from 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
There are assumptions that the virus can also be transmitted through small droplets thrown into the air during a conversation that are able to stay in the air for a longer period of time. Respiratory droplets can also be formed in the air during exhalation.
Drops can get into the mouth or nose of people nearby, as well as into the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), can lead to the spraying of exhalation products and, therefore, the spread of the virus in the air.
It can also penetrate the body if a person touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, with subsequent contact with his eyes, nose, or mouth.
There are also concerns that the virus may be transmitted through feces, but the risk of this method of transmission is considered low.
The Chinese government denies the possibility of oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is most contagious within the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although its spread can occur both before the onset of symptoms and in the later stages of the disease.
There have been cases when the tests were positive when tested three days before the onset of symptoms, and this suggests the possibility of transmitting the virus until the symptoms are pronounced.
There are only a few reports of laboratory-confirmed cases of asymptomatic course of the disease, but in some countries, cases of transmission of the disease from asymptomatic carriers have also been identified in the course of contact tracking studies.
Officials of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) claim that it is not yet clear how easily the virus spreads, however, it is known that one patient usually infects 2-3 other people. The virus is able to survive on surfaces from a few hours to a few hours.
In particular, it was found that on a plastic surface (polypropylene) and on stainless steel (304) the virus is able to live up to three days, on a cardboard surface - for one day, and on copper surfaces - for up to 4 hours.
These data, however, vary depending on the humidity and temperature. In domestic and other animals, a positive result for COVID-19 was obtained.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, although British authorities advise washing their hands after contact with animals, just as, for example, after contact with other surfaces that could be touched by infected people.
Severe acute respiratory coronavirus syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus first detected in three people with pneumonia from a group with acute respiratory diseases registered in Wuhan.
All signs of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus occur naturally in related coronaviruses. Outside of the human body, the virus can be destroyed with the help of household soap, which dissolves its protective shell. SARS-CoV-2 has a great resemblance to the original SARS-Co virus.
It is believed to have a zoonotic origin.
Genetic analysis of the coronavirus has shown that it is genetically clustered with the genus Betacoronavirus, a subgenus of Sarbecovirus (cell line B) along with two other strains of bat viruses.
On a holistic-genomic level, it is 96% identical to other samples of bat-like virus (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there is only one difference in amino acids in certain parts of the genome sequences of pangolin and human viruses.
A comprehensive-genomic comparison to date has shown that the highest percentage of similarities (92%) exists between the Pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, but this is not enough to prove that Pangolins are intermediate hosts of the virus.
Infection with the virus can be pre-diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, although it should ultimately be confirmed by an analysis of a polymerase chain reaction with reverse transcription (RT-PCR) of an infected secret or computer tomography.
The results of a study comparing PCR and CT methods used in Wuhan showed that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, since many of its visualization functions coincide with other pneumonias and flow processes.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology has issued a recommendation “not to use CT for screening or as a first-line testing method in the diagnosis of COVID-19.”
The WHO has published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, and the first of them was published on January 17.
Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing is carried out.
It can be performed on respiratory tests and on blood samples.
The results are usually prepared within a period of several hours to several days.
Usually, a nasal smear is used for the test, although a smear can also be used. A number of laboratories and companies are developing serological tests to detect antibodies.
As of April 6, 2020, none of them proved to be accurate enough to obtain approval for universal use.
In the U.S., a serological test developed by Cellex has been approved for emergency use only by certified laboratories.
Characteristic features of the visualization of symptoms on X-rays and computed tomography (CT) include asymmetrical peripheral turbulence of the type of matt glass and the absence of pleural sweating.
An international database of photographs of confirmed cases of infection is being compiled by the Italian Radiological Society.
Due to the similarity with other infections, such as adenovirus, in the identification of COVID-19 images, not confirmed by PCR tests, have limited clinical specificity.
In China, a large study was conducted in which chest CT results and PCR testing were compared, and it was found that although the images are less specific in the case of infection, they can be deciphered in the sputum and the sputum is faster; moreover, they are more sensitive, and, consequently, they are more specific in the case of infection.
To diagnose the virus using X-rays and computed tomography, vertebral neural networks based on artificial intelligence were developed.
Strategies to prevent the transmission of the disease include maintaining general personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding contact with eyes, nose or mouth with dirty hands, use when coughing or sneezing napkins, which should be discarded immediately after use.
Those who may already have been infected should wear a medical mask in crowded places.
In order to prevent the transmission of the disease, it is also recommended to physically distance oneself from people. Many Governments recommend refraining from any unintended trips to countries and areas affected by the outbreak and limiting the movement of citizens.
However, the virus has been able to spread in most regions of the world.
This means that the virus spreads to the pre-infected population, some members of which do not know where and how they have been infected. It is also recommended that medical professionals who care for patients who may be infected use other precautionary measures, as well as precautionary measures when contacting.
The use by Governments of data on the location of citizens using their mobile phones for this purpose has raised concerns about privacy, and organizations such as Amnesty International (International Amnesty), as well as more than 100 other organizations, have made statements demanding this restriction.
Various mobile applications have been developed and proposed for voluntary use; as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups have worked on the development of solutions that ensure the confidentiality of personal data – for example, the registration of the user’s proximity to other mobile phones.
If the user of a mobile phone was in close contact with a person whose COVID-19 test was positive, he receives a corresponding notification. There are also unfounded versions on how to prevent infection - for example, a nose and mouth rinsing.
There is currently no COVID-19 vaccine, although many organizations are working to create it.
In order to prevent the spread of the disease, it is recommended to wash hands.
The CDC (Center for Disease Control and Prevention) also recommends washing hands more often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after visiting the toilet or with severe hand contamination, as well as before eating, after sneezing, coughing or sneezing.
This is necessary because, being outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which opens its protective shell.
In addition, if soap and water are not available, the CDC recommends using alcohol-based hand sanitizers with an alcohol content of at least 60%.
The WHO recommends that people avoid touching their eyes, nose or mouth with dirty hands.
The surfaces can be disinfected by a number of solutions (on the surface of stainless steel the disinfectant begins to act a minute after application) with the content of 62-71% ethanol, 50-100% isodehyde and 7% isopranol, 0.1% hypochlorite, sodium, 0.5% trans.
Other components, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that in case of suspicion of COVID or its confirmation in an institution, such as an office or a day care facility, all spaces of such a room, including cabinets, toilets, toilets, toilets, utility rooms, electronic equipment, such as tablets, sensors, etc.
Medical organizations recommend covering the mouth and nose with the back of the elbow or napkin when coughing or sneezing and discarding used hygiene items immediately.
For those who may have been infected, it is recommended to use medical masks, as the use of masks can limit the volume and range of spread of exhalation products that are dispersed in the air when talking, sneezing, and coughing.
The WHO has issued instructions on when and how to use medical masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, “the use of a medical mask can reduce people’s tendency to touch their face, and touching the face with dirty hands is the main way of infection.” Masks that can also be recommended for use by those who care for people.
The WHO recommends that healthy people wear medical masks only if they are at high risk, for example, for people who care for a person with COVID-19, although it also recognizes that wearing a mask does reduce the number of face contacts.
Several countries have begun to call for the use of medical masks in public places.
The CDC, U.S., recommends wearing non-medical tissue face masks. China has separately emphasized the importance of using disposable medical masks by healthy people, especially if they are in close contact (1 meter (3 feet) or less) with other people.
In Hong Kong, it is recommended to wear a medical mask in public transport or crowded places.
Health officials in Thailand are calling on people to make face masks in their homes and to wash them on a daily basis.
In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, citizens are prohibited from going outside without masks, covering their noses and mouths.
On March 16, the Vietnamese government appealed to all citizens to wear masks in public places in order to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has obliged all visitors to food stores to wear medical masks.
The Government of Israel also appealed to citizens to wear masks in public places.
On April 1, Taiwan, where 10 million medical masks have been produced per day since mid-March, was ordered to use medical masks for all passengers on trains and long-distance buses.
In Panama, residents are required to wear a medical mask when going out; those residents who are unable to purchase masks were advised to sew them themselves at home.
Medical masks are also widely used by residents of Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) is a measure to combat infection, aimed at slowing the spread of the disease by minimizing close contact between people.
Protection measures include quarantine, travel restrictions, closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theaters and shopping centres.
People can use social distancing measures while staying at home, restricting travel, avoiding crowded places, using contactless greetings, and physically distancing themselves from others.
Many regional governments, especially those severely affected by the outbreak, are currently prescribing or recommending social distancing.
The maximum number of people that can be gathered in one place according to the recommendations of the U.S. government authorities and health organizations was quickly reduced, starting with 250 people (in regions where there were no data on the spread of COVID-19), up to 50 people, and later up to 10 people.
On March 22, 2020, in the past, Germany has banned the so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called so-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-
The use of the term "social distancing" has been understood in such a way that people should subject themselves to complete social isolation, rather than staying in contact with other people in alternative ways. Some authorities have published guidelines on the sexes in the past.
Among other things, it has been recommended to engage in sexual intercourse only with your permanent partners, with whom you live, and who you are sure that he does not have the virus and its symptoms.
For people diagnosed with COVID-19 and those who suspect they are infected, self-isolation at home is recommended.
Detailed self-isolation guidelines have been published by the health authorities, and many countries have also made mandatory or recommended that the entire population of the affected areas be self-quarantineed.
Individuals in high-risk groups were prescribed the strictest quarantine.
Individuals who may have been in contact with COVID-19-infected people, or who have recently visited a country or region, significantly affected by the epidemic, were recommended to be in quarantine for 14 days after the last possible contact.
Strategies to combat the outbreak include restraining the spread of the disease, suppressing it, or mitigating it.
Preventing the spread of the disease is carried out in the early stages and is aimed at tracking and isolating the infected, and also involves other measures of infection control and vaccination to stop the spread of the disease among the rest of the population.
At a stage when the spread of the disease is no longer possible, efforts are being made to mitigate the consequences: measures are being taken to slow the spread and mitigate the impact of the epidemic on the health system and society.
Measures to prevent and mitigate the consequences of the spread of the disease can be taken simultaneously.
The suppression of the infection requires more extreme measures to reverse the pandemic, reducing the baseline number of infections to below level 1. Part of the effort to manage the outbreak of the infectious disease is aimed at reducing the peak of the epidemic, known as the eclipse.
Such efforts reduce the risk of overloading health services and provide more time for developing vaccines and treatments.
The non-pharmaceutical interventions of those who are in a position to help with the outbreak include measures of personal prevention, such as hygiene of the hands, the use of medical masks and self-isolation; social measures aimed at physical distancing, such as the closure of schools and the abolition of masses.
Other countries have also taken a number of measures aimed at curbing the spread of the virus.
In South Korea, mass screening and localized quarantines were introduced, as well as a system for alerting the movements of infected persons.
In Singapore, they provided financial support to infected individuals who were self-isolating and imposed heavy fines on those who did not.
In Taiwan increased the production of medical masks and fined for the accumulation of excess stockpiles of drugs. Modeling in the UK and the US showed that in terms of mitigation (deceleration, but not stopping the spread of the epidemic) and suppression (stop the growth of the epidemic).
Optimal policies to mitigate the effects of the spread of the disease can reduce the peak load on the health system by 2/3, and mortality by double, but still lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths and the collapse of the health systems.
Suppression may be a preferred method, but it should be used as long as the virus circulates among the population (or until a vaccine is developed if it occurs earlier), otherwise the spread of the disease will quickly resume when measures are weakened.
Long-term intervention to repress the pandemic has led to social and economic costs.
Antiviral drugs approved for the treatment of COVID-19 do not currently exist, but efforts are being made to develop them, including testing of existing drugs.
Taking over-the-counter cold medications, drinking enough fluids, and resting can help relieve symptoms.
Depending on the severity of the disease, the patient may need oxygen therapy, intravenous fluid introduction and support of breathing.
The use of steroids can only be harmful.
Several compounds that have previously been approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are also being considered for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
The WHO has also reported that some “traditional and home remedies” can alleviate symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
The WHO considers increasing the capacity and adaptation of health care to the needs of COVID-19 patients as the main measure of response to the outbreak of the disease.
The European Centre for Prophylaxis and Disease Control (ECDC) and the European Regional Office of the WHO have issued guidelines for clinics and primary health care services in order to assist in the redistribution of resources and resources in several levels of resources in the field.
There are various theories about where the very first case of infection could occur - the so-called "zero patient".
The first known case of infection with a new coronavirus infection probably took place on December 1, 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
During the month, the number of cases of coronavirus infection in the province of Hubei gradually increased.
They were mainly associated with the mass market of probabilistic probabilistic probabilistic probabilistic probabilistic probabilistic probabilistic probabilistic probabilistic probabilistic probabilistic probabilistic probabilistic probabilistic probabilistic probabilistic probabilistic probabilistic probabilistic probabilistic probabilistic probabilistic probabilistic probabilistic probabilistic probabilistic probabilistic probabilistic probabilistic probabilistic probabilistic probabilistic probabilistic probabilistic probabilistic probabilistic probabilistic probabilistic probabilistic probabilistic probabilistic probabilistic probabilistic probabilistic probabilistic probabilistic probabilistic probabilistic probabilistic probabilistic probabilistic probabilistic probaistic probabilistic probabilistic probabilistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic probaistic proba
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan’s central clinic warned their colleagues about a “coronavirus similar to SARS”.

WHO Director-General Tedros Adan said the PHEIC announcement was due to “the risk of global proliferation, especially in low- and middle-income countries that do not have reliable health systems.
Commenting on the travel restrictions, Mr. Tedros said that “there is no reason for measures that excessively impede international movement and trade” and that “the WHO does not recommend restricting trade and movement.”
On February 5, the WHO appealed to the world community to allocate $675 million to ensure strategic preparedness for the epidemic in low-income countries, noting the need to provide urgent assistance to those countries that “do not have systems for identifying people”.
Mr. Tedros also stated that “the indicator of our readiness is the level of readiness for the epidemic of our weakest link”, and called on the international community “to make a choice: to invest today or to pay for the future.” At the inaugural COID19 press conference, held on 11 February.

This virus may already be on its way to your country, and you need to be prepared,” he said, adding that proper responses could help the world avoid “the worst-case scenario.”
Ryan also said the current data did not serve as a basis for declaring the global pandemic as official representatives of the public health sector, and added that the announcement of the pandemic would mean that “we essentially recognize the fact that every person on the planet will be at risk.”
On March 11, the WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic.
The WHO Director-General has stated that the WHO is "deeply concerned about both the alarming high level of the spread and the severity of the disease, and not least the alarming level of inactivity in connection with this problem".

A number of leaders of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) level provinces have been fired for the quarantine measures they have taken in central China, and these layoffs have shown dissatisfaction with these regional responses to the political establishment.
Some commentators believe that the move was intended to protect Chinese Communist Party Secretary-General Xi Jinping from the public’s anger over the coronavirus outbreak.
Some Chinese officials, such as Zhao Lijiang, disagreed with the earlier statement that the coronavirus outbreak began in Wuhan, but sided with the conspiracy theory that COVID-19 originated in the United States or Italy.
The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump called the coronavirus "the Chinese virus" or "the Wuhan virus", saying that "censorship in China only aggravates the situation with the virus, which is now a presiding officer and is not a cowardly side of a global pandemic", and this statement in turn was not subject to screams.
The Daily Beast has accessed a U.S. government telegram that contains a communications strategy trick apparently devised by the National Security Council; there are such references to the strategy: “It’s all about China.
We are asked to disseminate this information in any way possible, including press conferences and television speeches.” Organizations such as Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg, said that China’s efforts to provide sexual assistance to countries suffering from the virus are “part of it.”
The head of the European Union’s foreign policy department, Joseph Borrell, warned of the presence of “a geopolitical component that includes the struggle for influence through pier and the so-called policy of generosity.”

China has also called on the U.S. to lift sanctions against Syria, Venezuela and Iran, with some reports sending aid to the last two countries.
Jack Ma’s donation of 100,000 Cuban medical masks has been banned due to U.S. sanctions imposed on April 3.

The source accused Russia of seeking to make a favorable impression on the global public at the “geopolitical and diplomatic” level.
Lombardy’s President Attilio Fontana and Italy’s Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio rejected the media attacks and thanked them for their help.
Russia has also sent a cargo plane with medical assistance to the United States.

On March 14, 2020, the President of Iran, Hasan Rouhani, sent a letter to the world leaders asking for help, stating that his country is experiencing difficulties in the fight against the epidemic due to the lack of access to the international markets in the country, sodden in connection with the sanctions imposed by the United States against Iran.
Politicians expected that this could negatively affect Donald Trump’s chances of re-election in the 2020 presidential election. Due to the pandemic, diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea have worsened.
South Korea has criticised Japan’s “ambiguous and passive quarantine measures” after Japan announced that any citizen arriving from South Korea would be placed in a two-week quarantine in places specifically designated by the government.
South Korean society was initially split due to President Moon Jae-in's reaction to the crisis.
Many Koreans have signed petitions that either praised the president's actions or called for Mr. Moon to be impeached for the government's inadequate response to the outbreak of the disease. The pandemic has forced countries to adopt emergency laws in response.
Some commentators have expressed concern that this step will allow governments to strengthen their powers.
In Hungary, parliament voted in favour of granting Prime Minister Victor Orban the indefinite right to govern through decrees, to suspend the work of parliament, as well as to hold elections and punish those who will be accused of spreading fake information about the virus and government crises.
The coronavirus outbreak has been named the cause of several cases of supply shortages due to the global increase in the use of equipment to combat the epidemic, the purchase of goods in panic and the breakdown of production and logistics operations.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s Quality Control Administration has issued a warning of shortages of medicines and medical equipment, which is due to increased consumer demand and disruption of suppliers.
Panic shopping also took place in several settlements; this led to a situation where essential goods such as food, toilet paper and bottled water disappeared from the shelves of stores, which in turn led to a shortage of stocks.
In particular, the technology industry warns of delays in the delivery of electronic goods.
According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adanom, the demand for individual protection funds has increased by 100 times.
This jump has led to a twenty-fold increase in prices compared to the regular price, as well as a four- to six-month delay in the delivery of medical devices.
It has also caused a shortage of personal protective equipment around the world, and WHO has warned that health workers will be hit for this reason.
In Australia, due to the pandemic, buyers of the daigo system have been given a new opportunity to sell Australian goods to China.
This activity has led to a shortage of baby food in some supermarkets and has since been banned by the Australian government. Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in Northern Italy and the Wuhan region, there is no shortage of food, as well as high demand for food in both regions.
Measures taken by China and Italy against the accumulation of stocks and illegal trade in critically important products, which have proved successful, have helped to avoid the acute food shortages that were expected in Europe as well as in North America.
Northern Italy, whose agricultural production is small in size, has not experienced significant declines, but, according to industry representatives, prices for agricultural products may increase.
Shelves of grocery stores remained empty only temporarily, even in the city of Wuhan, while Chinese government officials provided access to pork stocks to provide full-fledged food for the population.
Similar laws requiring food producers to conserve foodstuffs in the event of emergencies exist in Italy as well.
The damage inflicted on the world economy affected China: according to media reports of March 16, China’s economy suffered heavily in the first two months of 2020 due to measures taken by the government to combat the spread of the virus, as a result of which the volume of retail sales decreased by 20 percent.
Mainland China is a major economic and manufacturing hub; therefore, the virus outbreak is believed to pose a serious destabilizing threat to the world economy.
According to forecasts by Agate Demaray, an employee of the Economist Intelligence Unit, the volatility in the markets will continue until a clearer understanding of the potential outcomes appears.
In January 2020, some analysts calculated that the economic consequences of the current epidemic in terms of global growth could outweigh the consequences of the 2002-2004 atypical pneumonia epidemic.
According to an estimate made by an expert from the University of Washington in St. Louis, the damage to the global supply chain could exceed $300 billion, and the negative impact could last up to two years.
It is reported that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) began to take “immediate measures” after a sharp drop in oil prices due to a drop in demand from China.
On February 24, the world stock markets collapsed due to a significant increase in the number of people infected with COVID-19 outside mainland China.
On February 27, due to growing fears about the coronavirus outbreak, various U.S. stock indices, including NASDAQ-100, S&P 500 and Dow-Jones index for industrial stocks, were down on the day after the financial crisis of 2007.
At the end of the week, all three indices showed more than a 10 percent decline.
On February 28, Scope Ratings GmbH confirmed China’s sovereign credit rating, but maintained a negative outlook.
Shares fell again due to concerns about the spread of the coronavirus, and the biggest fall occurred on March 16.
Many believe that there is a possibility of an economic recession.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian praised the timely emergency measures taken by central banks and states.
Central banks are responding more quickly than during the financial crisis of 2008.
Tourism is one of the most affected sectors due to traffic bans, the closure of public places, including tourist attractions, and government recommendations not to take any trips.
As a result of all these measures, numerous airlines cancelled flights due to a sharp drop in demand for flights, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, and the UK regional airline Flybe ceased to exist.
The negative impact on the cruise line industry has been as strong as ever.
Several railway stations and ports of the ferry crossing were also closed.
The epidemic coincided with Chun-jun, the main tourist season of Chinese New Year celebrations.
National and regional governments have cancelled a number of events involving a large number of people, including annual New Year's festivals; private companies have also independently closed their stores and tourist attractions such as Hong Kong and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many New Year’s events have been cancelled, and tourist attractions have been closed to prevent mass gatherings of people; for example, the Forbidden City has been closed in Beijing and traditional temple fairs have been cancelled.
In 24 of China’s 31 provinces, municipalities and districts, the authorities extended the New Year’s holidays until February 10, prompting most businesses not to open until that date.
These regions accounted for 80% of the country’s GDP and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong authorities raised the level of response to infectious diseases to its highest and declared an emergency, closing the school until March and canceling the celebration of the New Year. The retail sector was affected by the delays on a global scale.The hours of shops were not reduced.
Visits to retail outlets in Europe and Latin America decreased by 40%.
Retail companies in North America and the Middle East cut sales by 50–60%.
As a result, in March, the attendance of shopping malls fell by 33-43% compared to February.
The operators of shopping malls around the world have put in place additional measures, such as improving sanitary conditions, installation of equipment for checking the temperature of visitors and cancellation of the events. According to the evaluation of the Economic Commission of the United Nations, it is possible to do so 14, the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the recession in Latin America.
In January and February 2020, at the height of the Wuhan epidemic, about 5 million people lost their jobs in China.
Many of China’s 300 million migrant rural workers have been housed in their country’s provinces or locked up in Hubei province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and sought help from the government.
According to estimates by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, in the United States of America, with a total of 4 per cent of cases, the outbreak of the coronavirus can deprive 47 million people, and the level of unemployment can reach 32%. The measures of self-isolation introduced in India, will leave the mines without work.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefit, and 1 million British workers applied for a single social payment. The number of workers in the labour force was not exceeded by half a million companies in Germany. The employees of their employees were transferred to employees.
The German scheme of pay for part-time work was also introduced in France and the United Kingdom.
The fields of art and cultural heritage have also been severely affected by the pandemic, which has affected the activities of organizations, as well as individuals, whether officially employed or independent, around the world.
Cultural and arts organizations have sought to support their (often state-funded) mission to ensure access to cultural heritage for society, ensuring the safety of their employees and the public, and, where possible, supporting the people of art.
By March 2020, museums, libraries, concert halls and other cultural institutions were closed worldwide for an indefinite period, or access to them was limited to a different extent, and exhibitions, events and performances were cancelled or postponed to other dates.
In return, active efforts were made to provide alternative services using digital platforms. Another recent and increasing consequence of the spread of the virus – the cancellation of religious services, the promotions of large sports events and confés , and other public events, such as musies.
The film industry has also collapsed. The Vatican has announced the cancellation of the events of the Passion Week in Rome, which are held on the last week of the Christian period of repentance – the Great Fast.
Many dioceses recommend that older Christians stay at home and do not attend Sunday services; in some churches, church services have begun to be broadcast on radio, live or television, while church leaders offer to attend church services.
The Roman Catholic Diocese of Rome closed to visit its church, chapel and St. Peter's Square, where Christian pilgrims no longer appear, and later other religious organizations also canceled worships and shrines and restricted access to public worships, church services.
Iran’s health ministry announced Friday prayers in areas affected by the coronavirus outbreak were canceled, and shrines were later closed; Saudi Arabia banned foreign pilgrims and its own residents from entering the holy sites of Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has led to the most significant changes in the calendar of world sporting events since the Second World War.
Most major sporting events have been cancelled or postponed, including the 2019–20 UEFA Champions League, the 2019–20 Premier League, UEFA Euro 2020, the 2019–20 NBA season and the 2019–20 NHL season.
The coronavirus outbreak also destroyed the plans to host the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were to start in late July; on 24 March the International Olympic Committee also announced that the event will be “relayed for the period after 2020, but not later than the summer of 2021.” Kazino
This has led to many players switching to online mode, and many gambling sites report a significant increase in the number of new subscribers. The entertainment industry has also been affected by the tour as various music groups have been suspended or suspended.
Many major theatres, such as Broadway, have also cancelled all of their performances.
As an alternative to traditional offline events, some artists and musicians have begun to study the options of continuing their activities and sharing their results over the Internet, to organize live broadcasts of online concerts or web-festivals; this helps people to continue their work.
There are many Internet memes on the topic of the coronavirus, many of which are humorous and smooth out the alarming moods characteristic of periods of uncertainty.
Since the advent of COVID-19, there has been an escalation of bias, xenophobia and racism towards Chinese and people of East Asian descent, as well as to the population of hotspots in Europe, the United States and other countries.
Cases of fear, suspicion and hostility have been observed in many countries, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
In the February briefings (when most cases of infection were still confined to China) the racist sentiments expressed in various groups around the world against Chinese citizens who allegedly deserved the virus or received fair retaliation for anything.
In some African countries, anti-Chinese sentiment has also increased.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei reported discrimination on the basis of their regional origin.
Citizens of China, as well as its residents who live in the virus-affected areas, have been supported both offline and online.
The epidemiology of Eurasia has begun to spread in the new countries, in particular in Italy - the first in Europe country with a serious outbreak of COVID-19; in this connection citizens of such regions can also begin to feel the influence of Eurasia and such suspicion, xenophobia.
In Japan, the hashtag <0x23>ChineseDontComeToJapan (<0x23>ChineseNoTravelJapan) held leading positions on Twitter.
Citizens of China, as well as other Asians living in the United Kingdom and the United States of America, report rising levels of racist sentiments and even attacks.
U.S. President Donald Trump has faced criticism for calling the coronavirus a “Chinese virus”; critics consider this view racist and anti-Chinese.
In Ukraine, protesters attacked buses carrying Ukrainian and foreign nationals evacuated from Ukhan to New Sanjara.
Students arriving from China’s border with northeastern India and studying in India’s major cities have reported cases of harassment related to the coronavirus outbreak.
Dilip Ghosh, president of the Bharatiya Janata Party’s state unit in West Bengal, said that the Chinese destroyed nature and “that’s why God avenged them.”
Later, these statements received condemnation from the Chinese consulate in Calcutta, calling them "misguided". In China, due to the pandemic, xenophobia and racism again erupted. "Mushrooms" were sub-nationals, "non-nationals" of China: a foreign state.
Many newspapers with paid access to information have removed such restrictions for some or all areas affected by the coronavirus.
Many scientific publishers have made their scientific articles about the coronavirus outbreak available to the public.
Some scientists have decided to give short-term access to their research results on preprint publishing servers such as bioRxiv.

The smuggling of wild animals and diseases transmitted from the animal to humans are health risks associated with the trade in exotic animals.
Laboratory testing for the 2019 respiratory coronavirus (COVID-19) and associated SARS-CoV-2 virus includes methods to detect the presence of the virus, and methods for detecting antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of viruses in the samples is confirmed by OT-PCR, which recognizes the RNA of the coronavirus.
This test is specific and is intended only for the detection of RNA of SARS-CoV-2 virus.
It is used to confirm fairly recent or active infections.
Detection of antibodies (serology) can be used for both diagnostics and population control purposes.
Antibody tests reveal the number of people who have had the disease, including those whose symptoms were too small to be treated in the hospital, or were absent at all.
The exact level of mortality from this disease and the level of collective immunity can be determined by the results of such a test.
As of March 2020, due to limited testing capabilities, there were no reliable data on the prevalence of the virus among the population in any country.
By March 23, no country had been able to verify more than 3% of its population, and the information on the number of tests carried out in different countries was very contradictory.
It is likely that such differences in data have a significant impact on recorded mortality rates, which in some countries may be significantly exaggerated.
Using a polymerase chain reaction of real-time reverse transcription (rRT-PCR) the test can be performed on airway samples obtained in a variety of ways, including nasal smear or wet sample.
The results are usually available over a period of several hours to 2 days.
The OT-PCR test performed on smears taken from the throat is valid only during the first week of the disease.
Later, the virus can disappear from the throat, continuing, however, to multiply in the lungs.
Infected patients tested during the second week of the disease can alternatively be taken from the lower respiratory tract using a suction catheter, or can use defecation products (moisture).
One of the early PCR tests was developed at the Charite Clinic, Berlin, in January 2020 using a polymerase chain reaction with real-time reverse transcription (rRT-PCR) and was based on 250,000 sets of data that were subsequently distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
By January 23, 2020, the United Kingdom also developed its test. On January 28, 2020, the South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a set for detection of SARS-CoV-2 based on clinical-level PCR (PowerChek Coronavirus).

One of the three genetic tests from older versions of the test kits produced incomplete results due to missing reagents and a narrow test area conducted by the CDC in Atlanta; as a result, fewer than 100 samples were successfully processed on average throughout February 2020.
Two-component tests were not considered reliable until February 28, 2020, and only after that date, state and local laboratories were allowed to start testing.
The testing was approved by the Food and Drug Quality Authority as part of an emergency approval for use. U.S. Commercial Laboratories began testing in early March 2020.
On March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the possibility of testing for COVID-19 infection based on RT-PCR across the country.
Quest Diagnostics has been testing for COVID-19 across the country since March 9, 2020.
No quantitative restrictions have been declared; the enclosing and processing of the tests must be carried out in accordance with CDC requirements.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the State Research Center for Virology and Biotechnology “VEKTOR”.
On February 11, 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Health Surveillance Service. It was reported that on March 12, 2020, the Mayo Clinic developed a test for the detection of COVID-19 infection. On March 13, 2020, the Roche Diagnostics around 24 hours had received FDA approval for the use of the test, which can be carried out in the course of 3,
On March 19, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use (EUA) permit to Abbott labs for testing the Abbott m2000 system; previously, the FDA issued a similar permit to Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also receives the USA from the FDA for a 45-minute test.
The FDA has also approved a test that uses the technology of amplification of isothermal nucleic acids instead of PCR.
Since this test does not require a series of cycles of varying temperatures, this method can detect positive results in just five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 such machines in the United States, and Abbott plans to increase production to 50,000 tests per day. Currently in Taiwan, a test is being developed using a monoclonal antibody, which is possible by means of a corpuscorpus, and by means of a new imitation method, a corpuscorpus 20, is linked to a nucleocapsid protein.
A review of the specialized literature for March 2020 concludes that “ chest x-rays have little diagnostic value in the early stages, while CT [computed tomography] results may have such value even before the appearance of the symptom.”
Typical signs detected during CT include bilateral multi-length subpleural sealing focusses of the "matt glass" type with peripheral, asymmetric and aposterial distribution.
Subpleural dominance, a symptom of bulge bridge and consolidation develop as the disease progresses.
The results of a study comparing PCR and CT techniques used in Wuhan at the time of the current pandemic have shown that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although less specific than PCR, since many of its visualization functions and processes coincide with others.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology has issued a recommendation “not to use CT for screening or as a first-line testing method in the diagnosis of COVID-19”. As of March 2020, the CDC recommends using the PCR method for initial screening.
Partially immune response to infection is expressed in the production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
These antibodies can be used to detect infection in humans after day 7 of the presence of symptoms, to determine immunity and for the purpose of population control. Tests can be carried out in central laboratories (CLT) or by on-site diagnosis (PoCT)
In many clinical laboratories, these tests will be able to perform high-performance automated systems, but their availability will depend on the speed of production of each such system.
A single sample of peripheral blood is usually used in CLT, although serial samples may be used to track the immune response.
With PoCT, one blood sample is usually obtained by piercing the skin.
Unlike PCR methods, a blood-collection stage is not required for a screening test. On March 26, 2020, the FDA named 29 organizations that have passed all the necessary registration procedures and can now spread their tests to antibodies.
As of April 7, 2020, the FDA has approved only one emergency approval test. At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European approvals for the use of their test kits with borosity, which can detect in blood samples of I, I and I.
The performance of the test is several hundred samples over a few hours and, therefore, this method works much faster than normal PCR analysis of viral RNA.
Antibodies can usually be detected 14 days after infection. In early April, the UK found that none of the antibody test kits it acquired gave satisfactory results.
In Hong Kong, there was developed a scheme for the treatment of patients with the suspicion of the virus, the patients with the suspicion of the virus, the patients with the disease, the patient with the emergency department, the patient gives the sample, the patient spits in it, gives back to the patient and after a while receives the results of the test. The British NHS announces
Express-testing centers helped South Korea organize one of the fastest and most extensive testing procedures than in any other country. On 2 March in Germany, the National Association of Doctors did not make a day of mandatory health insurance. The 10th day of non-compulsory medical insurance said that it was ready to carry out about 12,000 tests.
If the examination is prescribed by a doctor, the expenses are covered by medical insurance.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany’s overall performance in terms of testing is 160,000 tests per week.
As of March 19, it was proposed to conduct express testing in several major cities.
As of March 26, 2020, the total number of tests submitted in Germany was unknown, as only positive results are recorded.

The construction of this laboratory was organized by the founder of BGI Van Jiang and completed in just 5 days; the modelling showed that if this laboratory had not been put into operation at such an accelerated rate, there would have been an increase in the incidence of the disease in Hubee, which would have increased by 47%, and
After the opening of the Wuhan laboratory, Huo Yan laboratories were immediately opened in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai – a total of 12 cities in China.
As of March 4, 2020, the total daily capacity of the robotic chips was 50,000 tests per day. Open multiplex schemes Origami Assays were released, which can test up to 1,122 tests of patients required for COVID-19 malabortion with the use of only 93 test tubes. Such unbalanced.
By March, due to the lack and lack of reagents, it was problematic to conduct mass testing in the EU, the UK and the US.
As a result, some authors have referred to the protocols of processing test samples, which provide heating of the samples at 98<0xC2><0xB0>C (208<0xC2><0xB0>F) for 5 minutes in order to release the genomes of the RNA to the cortex for further testing. On March 31, the volume of the test was announced.
This was due to the possibility of express testing, along with the acquisition of a mass population testing laboratory from Group 42 and BGI (created on the basis of their Huo Yan Emergency Detection Laboratory in China).
This laboratory, deployed in 14 days, is able to conduct tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests a day and is the world’s first such a large-scale laboratory operating outside of China.
Various testing options aimed at different parts of the genetic profile of the coronavirus have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has adopted a German variant of the production of test kits, which are shipped to low-income countries that do not have the resources to develop their own kits.
The German version was published by the Awstach and Awstach, on January 17, 2020; the protocol, developed by the sanitary and epidemiological centers of the United States, was not available until January 28, which led to the lack of samples and test kits in the United States. At the very beginning, the outbreaks in China and the United States caused problems.
But in South Korea, as experts say, the widespread availability of testing has helped to reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
For several years, the Government of South Korea has been working to provide testing facilities, mainly in private laboratories.
On March 16, the World Health Organization called for increased development of testing programs as the best way to slow down the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of the increase in the demand for testing, which arose due to the rapid spread of the virus, there have been a number of outbreaks of vaccines, many private laboratories in the United States, which have come from
In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of its test kits.
U.S. test kits developed by the CDC had "deficiencies" and for this reason the government removed bureaucratic barriers that hindered private test development. Spain acquired test kits from Chinese firms Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but these have been used to find that the results
The company explained that the cause of the inaccuracy of the results may be a failed sample fence or misuse of the sets.
The Spanish Ministry said it would recall sets that give inaccurate results, and replace them with other sets — sets by Shenzhen Bioeasy company. 80% of the test sets that the Czech Republic purchased in China were also acknowledged to have given incorrect results. 1.2 million test sets, add-ons.
Prime Minister Matovi<0xC4><0x87> proposed to throw them in the Danube. Atesh Kara, an employee of the Ministry of Health of Turkey, claimed that the test kits acquired in China in 2020 had a “high level of errors” of the year. The skeletons were not in the first place, and the Ministry “did not use them”.
Quarantine measures for those who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, as well as monitoring of people with whom such patients were contacted, had positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vo, where a person died of COVID-19 for the first time in Italy, conducted two cycles of testing of the entire population of about 3,400 people, with an interval of about ten days.
About half of the people with a positive outcome had no symptoms, and all patients with confirmed cases of the disease were placed in quarantine.
Entrance to the territory of the settlement was closed, and this measure completely stopped the spread of the infection.
Under the conditions of intensive monitoring of contacts, restrictions on entry, testing and quarantine measures, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore has been much less tense than in other developed countries, and there has been no need to impose such extreme restrictions as in the past.
Many of the events there were canceled, and on March 28, Singapore began to urge residents to stay at home, but schools, which ended on March 23, opened on schedule.
Several other countries, such as Iceland and South Korea, also coped with the pandemic through intensive contact tracking, entry restrictions, testing and quarantine measures, but the restrictions were less aggressive.
A statistical study showed that in countries where more tests were conducted compared to the number of deaths, mortality rates were much lower, probably because those countries were able to identify more patients with poorly expressed symptoms or lack of symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries that do not have the resources for mass testing, as well as national laboratories with limited experience of working with COVID-19, send their first five positive and the first ten negative results of COVID-19 tests to one of the 16 control laboratories of the WHO.
Seven of these 16 control laboratories are located in Asia, five in Europe, two in Africa, one in North America and one in Australia.
In the following chart, the percentage of positive results in the column depends on the testing policy adopted in a particular country.
The country in which only hospitalized patients are tested will have a higher positive result in percentages compared to the country in which all citizens are tested, regardless of the presence of symptoms of the virus, under other equal conditions.
Handwashing, also known as hand hygiene, is the process of cleaning hands to remove contamination, fat, microorganisms, or other harmful substances.
Regular hand washing with soap at certain “critical moments” during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted by the faeces and mouth.
A person may also become infected with respiratory diseases such as flu or a common cold, for example, if he touches the eyes, nose, or mouth (i.e., the mucous membranes) with unwashed hands.
Five critical points during the day, after which you should wash your hands with soap: before and after defecation, after washing the baby's buttocks or changing diapers, before feeding the baby, before eating, as well as before and after cooking or processing raw meat, fish and poultry.
If water and soap are not available, your hands can be cleaned with ash. The World Health Organization recommends washing your hands:
Before, during and after cooking.
Before and after the treatment of a sick person.
After changing diapers or washing a child who went to the toilet.
After sneezing, coughing or sneezing.
After contact with animals, feed or waste of animal origin.
Medical hygiene of the hands refers to the hygienic actions associated with medical procedures.
Washing your hands before taking medications or medical procedures will help prevent or minimize the spread of the disease.
The main medical goal of washing hands is to cleanse hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms capable of causing diseases), as well as of chemicals that can be harmful or cause certain diseases.
This procedure is especially important for people who are engaged in cooking or working in the medical field, but it is also important for all other people.
Hand washing is very beneficial for health: for example, it minimizes the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases, prevents infectious types of diarrhea, reduces the spread of respiratory infections,
and also reduces the level of infant mortality at home births.
A 2013 study found that better hand washing could lead to a slight acceleration in the growth of children under the age of five.
In developing countries, child mortality rates associated with respiratory and diarrhoeal diseases can be reduced by assimilating simple habits, such as washing hands with soap.
This elementary procedure is able to reduce the mortality rate from these diseases by almost 50%.
Regular reminders of the benefits of handwashing can reduce the number of diarrhea cases by about a third, and this is comparable to the benefit of providing low-income regions with clean water.
A reduction in the number of cases of diarrhea by 48% can be associated with washing hands with soap. Hand washing with soap is the only most effective and inexpensive way to prevent diarrhea and acute diseases of the general respiratory tract and other respiratory tract diseases (OSIs) with the condition of soap production.
Pneumonia, one of the major complications of ORI, is the leading cause of mortality among children under the age of five, which takes the lives of approximately 1.8 million children a year.
About 3.5 million children die each year from diarrhea and pneumonia.
The United Nations Children’s Fund reports that washing your hands with soap before and after a hard habit can save more lives than any individual taking a vaccine or medical intervention, and reduce the mortality from diarrhea in adolescence.
Handwashing is usually combined with other sanitation activities carried out within the framework of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) programs.
Hand washing also prevents the appearance of impetus - a disease that is transmitted by direct physical contact.
A small negative consequence of frequent hand washing is that it can lead to drying of the skin, and consequently, to its damage.
A 2012 Danish study showed that too frequent hand washing can lead to itching and scaling of the skin – a disease known as eczema or hand dermatitis, which is especially common among healthcare professionals.
Too frequent hand washing can also be considered one of the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five so-called "critical moments" during the day, when washing hands with soap is important to reduce the risk of fecal-oral transmission of the disease: after emptying (urination, defecation), after feeding or breastfeeding, after washing the baby's buttocks (change of diapers), before feeding.
Some other cases when it is necessary to wash your hands in order to prevent the transmission of the disease: before or after the treatment of a cut or wound, after sneezing, coughing or sneezing, after touching animal waste or animals, after touching the garbage.
In many countries, the procedure of washing hands with soap is quite uncommon.
The study, which is dedicated to the study of the study of the number of people in the case of the washing of hands in the second half of 2015 in 54 countries, showed that on average for 38.7% of families washing the hands with soap is a common practice. The study of 2014 showed that the highest rate, 97%, was recorded in Saudi Arabia; the United States in this study.
The “Emergency Healthcare Programme” implemented by the Ministry of Education of the Philippines is an example of large-scale activities to strengthen children’s health and improve children’s education.
The basis of this national program is degelmintization, which is carried out twice a year, as well as daily hand washing with soap and daily teeth cleaning with fluoride.
The same programme has been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
Removal of microorganisms from skin coverings is more effective if soap or detergents are added during the washing process.
The main action of soap and detergents is to remove barriers to solubility and increase its level.
Water itself is not considered an effective skin cleanser, as fats and proteins, which are components of organic contamination, dissolve poorly in water.
A sufficient amount of water, however, contributes to the purification process.
Solid soap, due to repeated use, may also contain bacteria that may get on it during previous use.
A small number of studies devoted to getting bacteria on the skin from a contaminated piece of solid soap suggests a low probability of getting it, as the bacteria are washed off with foam.
The CDC still claims that “liquid soap with hand dispenser is the preferred option for hand washing.”
Antibacterial soap is actively advertised in communities that care about their health.
To date, there is no evidence that the use of the recommended antiseptics or disinfectants has a selective effect on organisms that are resistant to antibiotics by nature.
However, antibacterial soap contains common antibacterial agents, such as triclosan, to which many resistant strains of organisms are resistant.
Thus, even if strains resistant to antibiotics are not selective in relation to the antibacterial soap, their effectiveness may not match the advertised one.
In addition to the progesterone and progesterone, progesterone and progesterone, complex compounds can contain acids (saccharine, ascorbine, milky) as a regulator of pH, as well as antimicrobial active benzoic acid, and other depressants (aloe vera, vitamins).
Hot water, which is comfortable for human skin at a temperature, is still not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria multiply much faster at a body temperature of 37<0xC2><0xB0>C.
However, for removing natural fats that contain contamination and bacteria, warm soapy water is more effective than cold water.
Contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that the use of warm water does not affect the reduction of the microbial load on the hands.
Hand sanitizer or hand sanitizer is a hand sanitizer that does not contain any water.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, alcohol-free hand sanitizers (also known as alcohol-based hand sanitizers, antiseptics or hand sanitizers) became popular.
Most of these products are made on the basis of isopropyl alcohol or ethanol with the addition of thickeners, such as a carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) in the form of a gel, or humidifiers, such as glycerin in the liquid or foam form of effluent coatings, providing the convenience of using these products.
Addition of diluted hydrogen peroxide further increases antimicrobial activity. Disinfectants containing at least 60-95% alcohol effectively destroy the microbes.
Alcohol-based disinfectants kill bacteria, including bacteria with multiple drug resistance (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis rod, as well as some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, and vaccine).
Disinfectants containing 70% alcohol kill 99.97% of bacteria (logarithm of reduction 3.5 similar to a reduction of 35 decibels) on the hands 30 seconds after application and 99.99% – 99.999% of the anti-emetic anti-emetics are anti-emetic and 99.999% of the bacteria (logarithm of reduction 4–5) on the hands after 1 minute.
Alcohol-based disinfectants are almost ineffective against viruses of the noroviral (or Norwalk) type, the most common cause of infectious gastroenteritis. It is necessary to use a sufficient amount of antiseptic or alcohol-containing agent to avoid it.
The face and back surface of both hands, as well as the space between the fingers along the entire length, are rubbed for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel is fully absorbed.
Fingertips on both hands should also be washed thoroughly. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends making a choice in favor of washing hands rather than using disinfectants, especially if your hands are heavily contaminated.
The increase in popularity of such disinfectants is due to the simplicity of their use and the rapid destruction of microorganisms, however, they should not serve as a substitute for full hand washing, if there is an opportunity to use water and soap.
Frequent use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers can cause dry skin if their composition does not contain softeners and (or) skin moisturizers.
The effect of drying the skin with alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and (or) other softeners to the composition of the remedy.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing softening components caused significantly less skin irritation and dryness than soap or antimicrobial detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome, or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives present in disinfectants, practically do not occur.
A lower probability of the occurrence of irritating contact dermatitis has become a factor in favor of the choice of disinfectants compared to soap and water.
Despite its effectiveness, water-free remedies do not cleanse the hands of organic substances, but simply disinfect them.
It is for this reason that hand sanitizers are not as effective in preventing the spread of many pathogenic microorganisms, such as soap and water, since pathogenic microorganisms are still in the hands of such agents.
The effectiveness of an alcohol-free hand disinfectant largely depends on the components and composition, and has historically been significantly lower than that of alcohol or alcohol-containing agents.
It has recently been proven that drugs that use benzalkonium chloride have a stable and cumulative antimicrobial activity unlike alcohol, which has been shown to lose the effectiveness of skin after repeated use, probably due to overheating.
Many people in low-income communities cannot afford soap and replace it with gold or clay.
Salt or clay may be more effective than just water, but they will always be less effective than soap.
One of the problems with this method is that if clay or ash is contaminated with microorganisms, it can, on the contrary, increase the spread of the disease.
Like soap, ash is a disinfectant, as it forms an alkaline solution when in contact with water.
If soap is not available, the WHO recommends using ash or sand as an alternative.
To prevent infection, the Centers for Disease Control in the United States recommends the use of a handwashing technique that includes the following steps:
Rinse your hands under warm or cold running water.
It is recommended that running water, because standing water can be contaminated, but the temperature of the water does not matter.
Wash your hands by wiping them with a large amount of soap, including the back of your palms, as well as the area between your fingers and under your nails.
Soap removes microbes from the skin, and studies show that when using soap (and not just one water) people tend to wash their hands more thoroughly.
Hold your hands for at least 20 seconds.
Friction helps remove microbes from the skin, and the longer you get a third of your hands, the more microbes are removed.
Carefully rinse your hands under running water.
Rinseing your hands in standing water can cause re-infection.
Wipe your hands with a clean towel, or let them dry on their own.
Wet and damp hands are more easily contaminated. Most often people leave out areas such as the thumb, wrist, area between the fingers and under the nails.
Artificial nails and cracked nail polish can contain a lot of microorganisms.
It is often recommended to use a moisturizing lotion to prevent drying of the skin of the hands, which can cause skin damage and increase the risk of infection.
If the flow of water and soap are not available to the sewers, there are many different inexpensive ways to wash your hands: pouring water from a hanging canister or a bottle pump with made holes and (or) use of ash in the sewers, if necessary, such as in the developing countries.
A crane with a foot pedal is a simple construction consisting of a capacity suspended on a rope, and a foot lever, which should be pressed to pour water on the hands; at the same time, a piece of soap should be used.
Effective hand drying is an integral part of the process of hand hygiene, however, there is some controversy about the most effective form of drying in public toilets.
The growing volume of research shows that paper towels are much more hygienic than electric hand dryers that are installed in many toilets.
In 2008, the University of Westminster in London conducted a study, sponsored by the European symposium on the production of paper napkins and towels; the subject of this study was a comparison of the level of hygiene of paper towels, hand dryers with warmer towels.
It was found that after washing and drying the hands in a dryer with warm air, the total number of bacteria on the finger pads on average increases by 194%, and on the hands - by 254%.
It was also found that after washing and drying the hands in a dryer with air flow, the total number of bacteria on the finger pads increases by 42%, and on the hands - by 15%.
After washing and drying hands with a paper towel, the total number of bacteria on the pillows of the fingers on average decreases to 76%, and on the hands – to 77%. Scientists also conducted tests to determine the possibility of cross-infection of each tipene of several visitors to the toilets and tone of the environment.
The air dryer, which emits air at declared speeds of 180 m/s (650 km/h, 400 miles/h), is able to blow microorganisms from the hands and from the own unit and potentially infect other users of the toilet and bathroom in a radius of 2
The use of hand dryers with warm air distributes microorganisms within a radius of up to 0.25 meters from the dryer.
When using paper towels, no significant spread of microorganisms was detected. In 2005, TÜV Produkt und Umwelt conducted a study evaluating various methods of hand drying.
The following changes in the number of bacteria are observed depending on the method of drying hands:
There are many different manufacturers of hand dryers, and hand dryers are compared to dry paper towels.
Cleaning your hands using disinfectant wipes can be an alternative solution during travel in the absence of soap and water.
The alcohol-based hand disinfectant should contain at least 60% alcohol.
The medical method of handwashing became mandatory long after the Hungarian physician Ignaz Zemmelweis discovered its high effectiveness (in 1846) in the prevention of diseases in a hospital setting.
There are electronic devices that remind hospital employees of the need to wash their hands if they forget about it.
According to one study, the use of such devices, indeed, helps to reduce the level of infection.
Medical handwashing lasts at least 15 seconds, using a large amount of soap, water or gel to wash and rub each part of the hands.
Hands should be carefully rubbed against each other, crossing fingers.
If there is dirt under the nails, you can use a brush to remove it.
Since microbes can remain in the water present on the hands, it is important to wash them well and wipe them dry with a clean towel.
After drying the hands, closing the tap, as well as, if necessary, closing and opening any doors, you should use a paper towel.
This allows to avoid re-contamination of the hands from these surfaces.
The goal of washing hands in medical institutions is to remove pathogenic microorganisms (“microbes”) and prevent their spread.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the order of handwashing remains unacceptable in most medical institutions: a large number of doctors and nurses regularly forget to wash their hands before touching patients, and thus spread microorganisms.
According to one study, proper handwashing and other elementary procedures can reduce the level of blood flow infections associated with the use of a catheter by 66%. The World Health Organization has published a leaflet with the image of a healthy handkerchief in a standard handwashing and treatment procedure.
The WHO draft manual on hand hygiene is also available on its website and is open for public discussion.
The review was co-authored by Whitby.
If confirmation of compliance with the regulatory requirements is required, commercial devices can be used to measure the indicators and check the hygiene of the hands.
The World Health Organization (WHO) defines “five moments” when it is necessary to wash your hands:
after contact with blood or biological fluids,
before the use of antiseptics, as well as
after patient care procedures. The addition of antiseptic chemicals to the soap when washing hands ("medical" or "antimicrobial" soap) helps to destroy bacteria.
Such antibacterial properties of sorghum may be necessary before surgical operations or in an environment with high content of organisms resistant to antibiotics. To "clean" the hands before surgical operation requires a crane for sorghum, which can be turned on and off without touching his hands; should also be washed
All decorations must be removed.
This procedure requires washing your hands and forearms to the elbow usually within 2-6 minutes.
You don’t have to shake your hands for too long, for example, 10 minutes.
During rinsing, the water with the forearm should not fall back on the brushes of the hands.
After finishing washing, the hands are dried with a sterile cloth and put on a surgical bathrobe.
To reduce the spread of microbes, it is better to wash your hands or use an antiseptic for hands before and after care procedures for a sick person.
To combat staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it was found that the greatest benefit of washing hands was the first 20%, and that very few additional benefits were obtained when the frequency of washing hands was increased by more than 35%.

However, the soap and water rushes are still more effective than alcohol solutions for the hands, in terms of reducing on the hands the amount of the influenza virus A H1N1 and the spora Clostridium difficile. The rushes of the soap and water rushes are still more effective than the rushes of the hands.
Further research on the most effective types of measures in the various medical institutions is required.
In developing countries, handwashing with soap has been recognized as an economical and important means of improving health and even digestion.
However, the lack of a stable supply of water, soap or hand-washing products in homes, schools and workplaces makes it difficult to get vaccinated regularly.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, not every private or public toilet has hand-washing taps, although there are also cheap ways to organize hand-washing in such places.
However, insufficient hand hygiene can also be caused by rooted habits, rather than a lack of soap or water.
Propagandizing and stimulating handwashing with soap can affect political decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of handwashing and lead to long-term changes in population behavior.
In order to ensure the effectiveness of such measures, results need to be monitored and evaluated.
In the course of a systematic analysis of 70 studies, the results of the studies of the students of the Department of Approaches found that in order to improve the situation of the hygiene of the hands in the countries with incomes below the average level, we are effective sanitary and epidemiological supervision at the level of the community, while we campaigns of public marketing are less effective. One of the examples of the propane
By ensuring that the minimum standards are met, schools can increase their level from one to three stars.
The installation of hand sanitizers is one of the possible measures implemented within the framework of information campaigns on hand hygiene in order to reduce the level of morbidity and child mortality.
World Hand Washing Day is another example of an information campaign aimed at changing behaviour. As a result of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, the United Nations Children’s Fund is promoting the use of emojis that symbolize washing.
In some studies, the overall effectiveness of handwashing in developing countries compared to the DALYs (saved years of life without disability) was considered.
However, one study suggests that stimulating handwashing with soap is a much more economical solution compared to other sanitary measures.
The importance of handwashing for human health – especially for vulnerable categories of people, such as young mothers or wounded soldiers in hospitals – was first recognized in the mid-19th century

At the time, most people still believed that infections were caused by rotten odors called myasmas.
In the 1980s, due to outbreaks of diseases spreading through the digestive tract, and infections associated with medical care, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States began to more actively promote infections of hand hygiene as an important step forward.
As a result of the swine flu outbreak in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, people in many countries have begun to better understand how important it is to wash hands with soap to protect the body from such infectious diseases.
For example, in Germany, posters with “the right hand washing techniques” were hung in public toilets, as well as in the toilets of office buildings and airports.
The phrase “washing your hands” means showing your unwillingness to take responsibility for anything or to be a participant in anything.
It comes from the Bible, the Gospel of Matthew: Pontius Pilate "wash his hands" when making the decision on the crucifixion of Jesus Christ; this phrase subsequently became more widely used in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's "Macbeth," Lady Macbeth begins to involuntarily wash her hands in an attempt to clear herself of the imaginary stain that symbolizes an impure conscience, in connection with the crimes she committed herself and induced her husband to commit.
It has also been found that people who have recalled or observed any unethical act tend to wash their hands more often than other people, and for them handcuffs are more important.
Also, it is less likely that people who had the opportunity to wash their hands after what was seen will participate in any other “cleaning” compensatory activities, such as volunteering.
In religions, washing hands has both a hygienic purpose and a symbolic meaning. Symbolic washing of hands with water, but without soap, is part of the ritual prescribed by the <0xE1><0xB8><0xA4>i<0xE1><0xB9><0xA3><0xE1><0xB9><0x87>e<0xE1><0xB9><0x87>a in many religions as well as the <0xE1><0xB8><0xA4>i<0xE1><0xB9><0xAD><0xE1><0xB9><0xAD><0xE1><0xB9><0xAD><0xE1><0xB9><0xAD><0xE1><0xB9><0xAD><0xE1><0xB9><0xAD><0xE1><0xB9><0xAD><0xE1><0xB9><0xAD><0xE1><0xB9><0xAD><0xE1><0xB9><0xAD>a.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam prescribe obligatory hand washing after visiting the toilet.
In Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism and Islam, it is considered necessary to wash hands before and after each meal.
Control of production factors in connection with COVID-19
Control of production factors in connection with COVID-19 involves the application of occupational safety and health protection techniques for the purpose of risk control and fight against the 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19).
Appropriate workplace risk control depends on the workplace and the task, based on an assessment of the risks, the severity of the epidemic situation in the community and the risk factors for individual workers who may be vulnerable in connection with COVID-19.
The U.S. Office of Labor Protection and Industrial Hygiene (OSHA) reported that low-risk positions have minimal professional contacts with the public and colleagues, and in such cases the admissions of sophomores require basic measures to combat infection, including hand washing.
Duties with an average risk require frequent or close contact with people who do not have a confirmed or suspected diagnosis of COVID-19, but are likely to be infected due to the current spread of the disease in society or during international travel.
This category may include workers who are in contact with the public, for example, in schools, a working environment with a high population density and in some large retail stores.
Risk control measures for such a group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures, include ventilation using high-efficiency air filters, the use of protective screens and available personal protective equipment in case of contact with a person infected with COVID-19.
OSHA believes that employees of medical institutions and morgues who have been in contact with a person with a confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19 infection are classified as high-risk persons; at the same time, the degree of risk of sub-emergence increases to very high when carrying out such procedures.
Risk control measures suitable for such employees include the use of engineering and technical security measures, such as negative-pressure ventilation rooms, as well as personnel protection measures appropriate for the relevant task.
The COVID-19 outbreak can have different types of impacts in the workplace.
Workers may be absent in the workplace due to their own illness, the need to take care of others or due to fear of possible infection.
Commercial patterns may vary with respect to both the types of goods that are in demand and the ways of purchasing such goods (e.g., making purchases during peak periods with delivery or service without leaving the machine).
Finally, disruptions to the delivery of goods from the geographic regions affected by COVID-19 are possible. The Plan to ensure preparedness for the epidemic and to carry out response measures can be used in the organization of the protection.
The plans address risks related to various workplaces and tasks, including sources of infection, risk factors arising at home and in communities, as well as risk factors for individual workers, such as old age or the presence of chronic diseases.
The plans also outline the means of control necessary to address the problems with such risks, as well as plans for emergency measures for situations that may arise as a result of the epidemic.
Plans to prepare for the epidemic and to respond may be subject to recommendations at the national or state level.
Some of the goals of ensuring responses to the epidemic: reducing the spread of the virus among staff, protecting people at higher risk of serious health complications, maintaining business operations, and minimizing the negative consequences for other organizations in their chain.
The extent of the disease in the community where the business is located is affected by the response measures.
The hierarchy of risk control means a structure that is widely used in ensuring occupational safety and hygiene, to group such means according to efficiency.
If it is not possible to eliminate the risk of COVID-19, the most effective engineering and technical security means, then the administrative measures and, finally, the means of personal protection.
Engineering and safety means isolating employees from workplace hazards and not relying on the employee’s behavior, which may be the most cost-effective solution.
Administrative measures involve changes in working policies or procedures that require action from an employee or an employee.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered to be less effective compared to engineering, technical or administrative measures, but can help to eliminate some of the risks.
All types of personal protective equipment should be selected depending on the threat to the employee, suited to size (e.g., respirators), used constantly and properly, checked regularly, maintained in good condition or replaced as needed, as well as properly removed and removed.
The U.S. Department of Labor and Industrial Hygiene (OSHA) believes that the positions with the lowest risk have minimal contact with the public and their colleagues.
The basic measures of the anti-epidemic and anti-epidemic measures recommended for all workplaces include frequent and thorough washing of hands, recommendations for sick workers to stay at home, adherence to the respiratory label, including closing of the mouth with the hand when coughing and itching, providing napkins
Rapidly identifying and isolating people who can potentially be infected is a critical step in protecting employees, customers, visitors, and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends employees with symptoms of acute respiratory diseases to stay at home until the end of the heat, the absence of elevated body temperature or many other symptoms, the absence of measles for at least 24 hours.
According to OSHA, positions with a moderate level of risk require frequent and close contact at a distance of no more than six feet (1.8 m) with people in relation to whom there are no confirmed data or suspicions of covid-19 infection, but there is a possibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

In rare cases, workers in such a risk group may need to wear respirators.
If a person is ill on the plane, then to ensure the proper safety of workers and other passengers, such measures as isolation of the sick person from other people at a distance of 6 feet, appointment of any crew member to take care of the sick person or to take care of the sick person or to take care of the sick person, to provide the sick person with a mask or to treat such a person.
Secondary crew members should wear disposable medical gloves when approaching a sick traveler or when in contact with physiological fluids or potentially contaminated surfaces and, possibly, with additional means of personal protection, if the patient has a fever, regularly.
The used safety gloves and other disposable items should be placed in a biologically safe bag, and the infected surfaces should then be cleaned and disinfected. In cases of commercial shipping, and in the case of mezosim, the mezosim are centered, including cruise liners and other passengers.
Ideally, medical examination should take place in an isolated cabin of such a person. In the case of schools and childcare institutions, the CDC recommends short-term closure for cleaning or disinfection, if the infected person was in the school building, regardless of race.

At significant rates of spread in the local community, in addition to social distancing strategies, measures for long-term absence from school may be considered. For law enforcement officers performing daily duties, the direct health risk to DC is considered to be low.
Law enforcement officers who are required to contact persons with a confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19 infection are advised to follow the same instructions that are prescribed to the field ambulance, including the use of appropriate means of personal protection.
In the event of close contact during detention, workers should clean and disinfect their formed belts and equipment before re-use with household cleaning aerosols or by wiping, also follow standard operating procedures to prevent the spread of disease and disease.
OSHA believes that some categories of health care workers and morgues are at high or very high risk.
High-risk positions include health care, support, laboratory and medical transport staff, who are in contact with patients with a confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19 infection.
They have a very high risk of infection when performing procedures accompanied by aerosol formation, or when collecting/processing samples from people with a confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19 infection.
Procedures accompanied by the formation of aerosol include probing, procedures causing cough, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and examinations or collection of samples by invasive methods.
The employees of morgues with high risk include the personnel involved in the treatment of the bodies of people with confirmed disease or suspicion of infection with COVID-19 at the time of their death. If such personnel conduct an opening, they are transferred to the category of very high risk.
In some health institutions and morgues, the use of special ventilation with negative pressure may be an effective measure.
The samples should be treated with respect to the precautionary measures provided for the level of biological safety 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the distribution of incoming patients into delimited waiting zones depending on the presence of suspicions of COVID-19 infection. In addition to other means of personal protection, OSHA recommends the use of respirators for the workers.
In the U.S., NIOSH approved respirators for people with an N95 filter or higher class must be used as part of a comprehensive written program on respiratory protection, which specifies requirements for individual selection of products and medical examinations.
Other types of respirators can provide more effective protection and comfort for the employee. WHO does not recommend the use of special clothing, because COVID-19 is a disease that is transmitted respiratoryly rather than through physiological fluids.
The WHO recommends that only surgical masks be used for personnel performing screening at the patient’s receiving point.
For those who collect respiratory samples from COVID-19 patients or those who carry the disease without aerosol-accompanied procedures, WHO recommends wearing a surgical mask, protective glasses or a protective face shield, coat and gloves.
When performing procedures accompanied by the formation of aerosol, instead of a surgical mask should wear a respirator N95 or FFP2.
In view of the inadequacy of the provisions of the provisions of the provisions of the provisions of the provisions of the provisions of the individual protection worldwide, the WHO recommends to minimize the need for such means of protection by the use of the possibilities of distance medicine, physical barriers, such transparent windows, the provision of access to the patient, infected with COVID-19.

Topic: [Covid-19] Easing the burden and preparing for the future
DATE/TIME OF CLOSED: 14 March 2020, 00:24 UTC
RESOLUTION: CC0: No Rights Responsible
This month, we are living in unusual circumstances.
The COVID-19 epidemic is a phenomenon that sheds light on the interconnectedness of people around the world and our responsibility to each other.
We have had no precedent for such problems, but we know that the effectiveness of our actions depends on the ability to empathize, cooperate and develop communities around the world, which is the basis of such an organization.
We observed the friendly and caring relationship between all of our colleagues, which was reflected in emails, calls and chats – a wonderful confirmation of the fact that, fortunately, amazing people work with us.
I am very grateful and proud to speak of you as my colleagues.
Last week I was informed of the high appreciation of our work.
I was reminded of how important it is for the world to have access to Wikipedia right now, and how useful it is for everyone to have online access to this key resource.
And this is possible thanks to your work, whether it’s ensuring the functionality of websites, paying our colleagues or protecting the security of communities.
The world needs the information presented on Wikipedia, and today it is even more important than ever before.
At this time, in order to achieve meaningful results for the world, it is important not only what we do, but also how we do it.
In view of the importance of this mission and your role in this process, we will make important changes to the order of our joint work, starting next week.
Adjustment of the order of our work and schedules
As Robin said earlier, the C-Team team gathered last night to discuss our approach and schedule for the coming days and months.
In the course of the communication, we considered our ideas on the most effective measures in the current situation and the best ways to ensure the sustainability of the organization during that period.
The vast majority of us wanted to ease the tensions and support our long-term mission.
If you want to step down, let it be so.
For all staff, contractors and volunteers:
According to our expectations, it will take about 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week to receive subsequent orders.
We do not announce weekends: if you can work normally for more hours, this is allowed for the purposes of our mission.
However, the world is now unpredictable; whatever your needs, whether it’s caring for relatives, buying food or going to a doctor’s office, your well-being is our number one priority.
We do not monitor your working hours.
If you are sick, you should not work.
This is understandable and unquestionable, but we mention it.
There is no need to make a hospital sheet or leave: just inform your manager and help the team revisit the schedule and schedule of work to ensure coverage of key areas.
(If you have a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, inform Brian from T&C Ops so that T&C can provide support and due attention from the management to your situation.)
Payment of hourly rates will be made in full.
We have already announced and confirm our intention to comply with the obligations to our contractors and employees at the hourly rate of payment.
Each person will receive a payment according to the usual hourly rates applied under normal circumstances.
This, in particular, implies periods of illness when you can’t work.
If you want to work, we will support you.
Many people use work as a way to direct their efforts into the world around us.
What we do can bring amazing results, especially in times like these.
Again, it is about self-help.
We ask you to communicate with our manager so that we know what to expect and that we can adjust our actions accordingly.
Some types of work are considered significant.
We must always support these kinds of activities.
The SRE, HR Ops, Trust&Safety and Fundraising teams (among others) do critical work that may require additional support.
We are initiating a process for all units to assess current goals and shift the focus on providing support, which is extremely important for our mission.
There are a lot of tasks for each of us, and we just focus on the most significant projects.
The slowdown today does not mean negative consequences in the future.
We don’t plan to work “double as much to make up for what’s missing” after the pandemic is over.
You won’t need to work overtime to meet unrealistic deadlines for the current time.
We recognize that circumstances have changed, and we will work on setting new goals and deadlines, if possible.
What Happens to the App (Annual Plans)?
In order to adapt to the new reality and expectations of the volume of daily working hours, we intend to adjust the deadlines for the implementation of our Annual Plan for 2020-2021.
We intend to propose an extension of the deadlines for our plan for 2019-2020, thus providing more time for budget formation, which will allow employees to prioritize critical work, self-help and care for loved ones is not a success, and at the same time everyone who needs or wants to work will be ensured.
Such an extension of time allows to significantly reduce the current planning burden and tensions throughout the organization.
Next week, we will submit our proposal to the Council, informing the representatives and teams of up-to-date information on the next steps immediately upon receipt of the relevant confirmation.
Thank you to the APP team for their leadership role in this work.
Office Status, Risks and Cleaning
Last week we learned that one of our colleagues from San Francisco could be infected with the COVID-19 virus.
However, in addition to numerous precautionary measures, we have hired an anti-virus cleaning team to disinfect all surfaces in the San Francisco office.
They used medical-grade antiviral solutions to disinfect all surfaces, as well as reception and elevator halls through which access to our floor is possible.
The building has its own rules, which prescribe to be careful, with the use of products that ensure the safety of their tenants.
We feel that the office will be well prepared for the period when we decide to return.
Our office in the District of Columbia (DC) is on the network of WeWork, which has shared with us and all the staff in DC its COVID-19-related rules.
Last week, our office in the District of Columbia completely switched to remote work in accordance with the instructions that came to San Francisco.
As some of our colleagues in New York know, we also discussed the issue of renting a property in Brooklyn.
Such discussions are ongoing, but they can be postponed.
Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
Our old colleagues working remotely know about the possibility of adjusting the situation and would like to give you some advice:
It is recommended to limit the duration of meetings to one or two hours.
If you need longer sessions, consider breaking them down into a course of several days.
Determine clearly the purpose of the meeting, the agenda and pre-distribute the materials for discussion.
By default, use video communication, to facilitate interaction and communication, use tools such as Google Docs and Zoom.
For convenience, appoint a coordinator – a person who will monitor the incoming questions in the chat and monitor the list of speakers, as well as the person responsible for making notes (or co-consecution).
If you need to use a convenient headset, contact the technical support service by e-mail.
Take advantage of your benefits through the Wellness Reimbursement program when purchasing snacks.
Connect to Slack’s <0x23>remoties channel to talk to colleagues about distributed work.
The HR Operations team examines the ergonomics guides available in webinar format to promote the effectiveness of distributed work across the organization.
Last week, we asked all recipients of community grants to cancel Wikimedia-funded mass events, such as editathons, until the WHO announced the end of the pandemic.
We understand and report that our requests for such cancellations and other restrictions may result in the impossibility of concerted grant actions, and no one will be fined for forced delays or changes to such objectives.
Next week we will be holding follow-up events with additional guidance on Wikimania, as well as other regional and thematic community conferences.
The overall mood in the global community is not only a resentment about the interruption of work, but also a sense of relief about mutual understanding and the ability to focus on one’s own communities, Wikimedia, and more.
In terms of prospects, CRT is working on a Meta-Wiki page that will provide space for the community to monitor impact and communication.
We remain in touch on issues related to COVID-19
We will send an invitation to your calendar for a special staff meeting that will take place next Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
This time we will take the opportunity to further share up-to-date information, answer your questions and spend time together by connecting with each other.
We are together in this situation and are ready to help everyone as much as we can.
At the same time, you can still receive information from such an e-mail, and other important information about COVID-19 — from the Office Wiki.
CRT will update such pages, and all the information will be collected in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular communication with staff living in countries that are significantly affected by the current situation.
If you have questions about travel, events, key workflow, problems with information lighting, or if you need other assistance, contact CRT.
We are ready to provide support and liaison as needed.
If you have any privacy issues, please contact Brian Judan, HR Director of International Global Operations, via e-mail.
Any such changes should not be considered as a waiver of our work and commitments.
Rather, it is a recognition of the possible current need for a radically new adaptation of our work and commitments.
We believe that such steps are necessary to support each other and provide the opportunity to continue working, to provide the necessary support to our movement and the world through the necessary service.
Our planning work will wait until the appropriate times.
Today is the time to support each other and create space for important work that is to come in the coming weeks and perhaps months.
For this to happen, we will need the help of each of you; and we need you to be able to take care of yourself and your families, as well as work with maximum return as soon as such a need arises.
Now, please, wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, Tony S), and other members of the Leadership Team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Ryan To).
Angiotensin-transforming enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme attached to the outer surface (cell membranes) of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys and intestines.
ACE2 counteracts the activity of the corresponding angiotensin-transforming enzyme (ACE), reducing the content of angiotensin-II and increasing Ang (1-7), making it a promising solution for the treatment of coronary artery disease.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin-transforming enzyme 2 is a zinc-containing metal enzyme located on the surface of endothelial and other cells.
The ACE2 protein contains the N-terminal peptidease domain M2 and the C-terminal transport domain of the renal amino acid colliline.
ACE2 is a single-pass membrane type I protein, its enzyme-active domain reaches the surface of lung cells and other tissues.
The extracellular domain ACE2 is separated from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme known as seddase, and the resulting soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and eventually excreted in the urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is attached to the cell membrane of most lung type II alveolar cells, enterocytes of the small intestine, arterial and venous endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells of the arteries of most organs.
Biosynthesis of ACE2 and RNA is also found in the cortex of the brain, striatum, hypothalamus and brain stem.
The main function of ACE2 is to act as an ACE counterweight.
ACE breaks down the hormone angiotensin I into vascular angiotensin II.
ACE2, in turn, decomposes the carboxylic finite amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyzes it into the vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-T-A).
ACE2 may also break down a number of other peptides, including [des-Arg9]-bradykinin, applein, neurotensin, dinorphine A, and grelin.
ACE2 also regulates the membrane transport of the neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and is present in Hartnup's disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 serves as the primary entry point into cells for some coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
Strictly speaking, binding the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 spike S1 protein to the ACE2 enzyme domain on the cell surface leads to endocytosis and translocation of both the virus and the enzyme into the endosomes located within the cells.
This entry process also requires the priming of the S protein with the serine protease of the carrier TMPRSS2, the inhibition of which is currently being studied as a potential therapeutic agent. This has led some to the idea that a decrease in ACE2 levels in the air may occur.
However, many professional communities and regulators recommend continuing standard therapy with APF and BRA inhibitors.
According to a systematic review and meta-analysis published on July 11, 2012, “the use of APF inhibitors was associated with a significant 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to the control group.”
In addition, “the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients receiving APF inhibitors who were at higher risk for pneumonia, especially in patients with stroke and heart failure.
The use of APF inhibitors was also associated with reduced mortality from pneumonia, although the results were less reliable than in patients at overall risk of pneumonia.”
It is believed that recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is a novelty in the treatment of acute lung damage and appears to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in pigs with acute respiratory deficiency syndrome.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is about 10 hours, and the onset of action is 30 minutes, in addition to the duration of exposure in 24 hours.
Some data suggest that rhACE2 can become a promising remedy for people with intolerance to classic renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or in ischemic ischemic ischemic ischemic ischemistry in which the circulating angiotensin is elevated.
COVID-19 applications are software applications for mobile phones designed to assist in the epidemiological investigation in the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, i.e. in identifying persons (“contacts”) who could contact an infected person.
In some regions, a number of applications formally supported by the authorities have been developed or proposed.
Several options of applications for tracking contacts have been developed.
This has led to a discussion of privacy issues, especially with regard to those systems that are based on tracking the geographic location of application users.
Softer options in this regard include the use of Bluetooth signals to record a user’s proximity to other mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple announced that they would combine their efforts to integrate Bluetooth-based support for such apps directly into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the government, together with Alipay, has deployed an app that allows citizens to check whether they have communicated with people infected with COVID-19.
It is used in more than 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore, an app called TraceTogether is used.
The app has been developed by local IT companies, has open source and will be handed over to the government. North Macedonia has launched the app "StopKorona!", running on Bluetooth, helping to keep track of contacts with potentially infected people and providing security.
The annex was jointly developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app was expected to register in the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the government announced that the contact tracking app is in the final stage of development and will be available for deployment within a few weeks. Similar apps are planned to be launched in Ireland and France (“StopCovid”).
Australia and New Zealand are considering using apps based on Singapore’s TraceTogether app and the BlueTrace protocol. Russia intends to use an application with a geozonation function, the purpose of which is to monitor its COVID-19 diagnosis.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security at the University of Cambridge, identifies a number of potential practical problems that may arise with application-based systems, including false workflows and potential inefficiency if only a small portion of the population uses the application.
Given concerns about the spread of misleading or malicious “coronavirus” apps, Apple has limited the list of types of organizations that can offer their Coronavirus-related apps to the App Store by including only “official” or other organizations in that list.
Google and Amazon have also imposed similar restrictions.
Participants in the privacy campaign expressed concern about the consequences of mass surveillance of the population through applications related to the coronavirus; in particular, the question of whether the corvette will be dismantled will be dismantled.The monitoring infrastructure created to combat the pandemic
The International Amnesty Organization and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for the restriction of this type of supervision.
The Organizations have announced the following eight conditions for state-run projects:
the monitoring must be “legal, necessary and proportionate”;
the extension of monitoring and monitoring should be accompanied by reservations about the limitation of the period of validity;
The use of data should be limited to the purposes of combating the spread of COVID-19;
the security and anonymity of data must be protected and evidence of such protection must be provided;
Digital surveillance should exclude cases of exacerbation of discrimination and marginalization;
any exchange of data with third parties must be determined at the level of law;
Protection against abuse should be guaranteed, as well as the right of citizens to respond to abuse;
The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (RSF) have also been republished by the German Chaos Computer Club (RCC) and the Reporters Without Borders (RSF).
Google and Apple are proposing a joint plan to address the problem of constant monitoring, which is to remove the tracking mechanism from their devices’ operating systems as soon as it disappears.
In some countries, network location tracking is used instead of apps, which eliminates the need to download the app and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network tracking has been approved.
Network solutions, which have access to source location data, also have large potential privacy issues. <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2>
However, not all systems with central servers should have access to personal location data; a number of privacy systems have been developed that use central servers only for communication (see section below).
In South Korea, a system was used to track contacts that did not use the app as a basis.
Instead of using a special application, the system collected tracking information from various sources, including mobile device tracking data and card transactions, and then merged them to create notifications in the form of personalized text messages that were sent potentially infiltrated.
The government not only used this information to warn citizens about potential contacts with infected persons, but also made the location information publicly available, which became possible due to significant changes in the information protection legislation that were introduced after the R.S.ME outbreak.
Access to such information can be obtained through a number of applications and websites. Countries, including Germany, consider the use of both centralized systems and systems that maintain confidentiality.
As of April 6, 2020, the details have not yet been disclosed.
The tracking of contacts, in which privacy is maintained by Engy, is an established concept, a significant volume of research literature on which is dated at least 2013 year. As of April 7, 2020, the use of the phone for the second time. More than ten expert groups have worked on solutions, providing

These protocols are responsible for ensuring that the personally identifiable data never leaves the device, and that all comparisons take place on it.
The Privacy Group, MIT Media Lab, is engaged in the development of SafePaths, a platform that ensures privacy when collecting and using location or cross-roads data to track the spread of COVID-19.
The work of this platform is based on the research presented in the document “Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic” (“Apps-Holigans: how to maintain privacy also during the epidemic”).
SafeTrace uses reliable hardware technologies that allow users to share confidential information about the location and state of health with other users and officials without jeopardizing the privacy of this data.
On April 5, 2020, the TCN Global Coalition was established by groups that share the same approach and use similar protocols, with the aim of reducing fragmentation and ensuring global compatibility of applications for tracking and alerting.
On April 9, 2020, the Singapore government announced that it had opened the source code BlueTrace used in its official app.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, the companies that control the operation of mobile platforms Android and iOS, announced an initiative to track contacts, which they claimed would ensure privacy, and which is based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy and Krip Energy technology.
They also published the technical specifications of the main technologies used in the operation of the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system should be deployed in three stages:
Deployment of tools that allow governments to create official apps to track the movement of coronavirus-infected citizens, but with the preservation of data privacy
By integrating this feature directly into iOS and Android, Google and Apple plan to solve problems with constant monitoring, first deploying the system through operating system updates, and then removing it in the same way after the threat disappears.
Repositioning a drug (also known as reprofiling, redirection, task change or therapeutic redirection of drugs) is reprofiling an approved drug for the purpose of treating a disease or developing a medical condition other than the disease, initially pre-existing.
This is one of the areas of scientific research that is currently being used to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Other areas of research include developing a COVID-19 vaccine and transfusion of reconvalescent plasma. SARS-CoV-2 contains about 66 drug-resistant proteins, each of which has several ligand-binding sites.
The analysis of these binding sites serves as an appropriate basis for the development of an effective antiviral drug against COVID-19 proteins.
The most important target proteins for SARS-CoV-2 are papain-like protease, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, helicase, S protein and ADF-ribophosphatase.
Hussein AA and the co-authors in their preclinical study studied several candidate compounds, which were then optimized, and analyzed their similarity in structure with the most similarly approved drugs to accelerate the development of a highly effective drug against SARS-Co.
Chloroquine is an antimalarial drug that is also used in the treatment of some autoimmune diseases.
On March 18, the WHO announced that chloroquine and its associated hydroxychloroquine would be among the four drugs investigated in the Solidarity clinical trial.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that testing of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine will begin in the state of New York on March 24. On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of sulfate sulphate by hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine phosphate.
The treatment regimen has not been approved by the FDA during the clinical trial process and is authorised under the U.S.A. only as an experimental treatment for emergency care in patients who are hospitalized but cannot receive treatment under clinical trial regimens.
The CDC said that “the procedure of use, dosage or duration of taking hydroxychloroquine for the prevention or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection” has not yet been established.
Doctors say they use the drug when “there is no other way out.”
A Turkish research group in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc and vitamins A, C and D.
Large-scale research is carried out at Duke University and the University of Oxford .
The Medical School of the University of New York at Langon is studying the safety and effectiveness of the prophylactic use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen have shown that favipiravir is “unambiguously effective”.
In 35 patients in Shenzhen who took this drug, a negative result was obtained after an average of 4 days, while in 45 patients who did not take the drug, the duration of the disease was 11 days.
In Wuhan, a study was conducted in which 240 patients with pneumonia were observed, one half of whom received favipiravir and the other half - umifenovir.
The Italian Pharmaceuticals Agency has reminded the public that the results suggesting the effectiveness of the drug are scarce and should not be considered definitive.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would buy the drug in Japan to replenish its reserves and use military resources to deliver it to university hospitals, where the drug will be used to treat patients with COVID-19.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe informed the Trump administration about the possibility of buying the drug. The drug may be less effective in case of the disease.
Its use may be unsafe for pregnant patients or for patients who are trying to get pregnant.
According to the results of one study dedicated to the combination of antiviral drugs “lopinavir” and “ritonavir” (Caletra), it was concluded that “the effectiveness of the use of the drugs has not been detected”.
The drugs were developed to inhibit the replication of HIV by binding to protease.
A team of researchers from the University of Colorado is trying to modify drugs to find a compound that will bind to SARS-CoV-2 protease. The scientific community is criticizing the reprofiling of drugs that have been specifically developed for therapy.
The WHO has included a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir in the international Solidarity test.
Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences to treat Ebola virus and Marburg viral infections. Later, Gilead Sciences staff found that remdesivir has antiviral activity in vitro in relation to many filo-, pneumonia, pneumonia.
One of the problems associated with antiviral treatment is the development of resistance through mutations, which can lead to more serious diseases and their transmission.
Some early preliminary studies show that remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance. Several clinical trials are currently underway, including two of them being conducted on more than one form by the University Clinics of Cleveland. One is being performed on patients with multiple forms.
There are currently three clinical trials on intravenous intake of vitamin C for people hospitalized with a serious form of COVID-19: two placebo-controlled studies (China, Canada) and one without the use of a placebo (Italy).
On March 24, 2020, antibiotic tests for azithromycin began in the state of New York.
Japan’s National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) plans to conduct a clinical trial of Alvesco (cyclesonide) Tagin, an inhaled corticosteroid for the treatment of asthma, for its use in the treatment of pre-symptomatic patients, infected corticosteroids.
The Phase II trial, an angiotensin-transforming enzyme 2 form, was conducted with the participation of 200 patients from Denmark, Germany and Austria hospitalized with severe forms of the disease, in order to determine the effectiveness of the treatment.
Researchers from the Montreal Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases, Canada, are currently studying the role of colchicine in reducing inflammation and lung complications in patients with poorly expressed symptoms of COVID-19.
For the study, COLCORONA was invited to 6,000 adults aged 40 and over who were diagnosed with COVID-19, with mild symptoms that do not require hospitalization.
Pregnant, breast-feeding and not using effective contraceptives, women cannot participate in this study.
In Italy, there are several coagulants on the test.
Low-molecular heparin is widely used to treat patients, which prompted the Italian Department of Medicines to publish recommendations for the use of this drug.
On April 14, a multi-centre study involving 300 patients was announced in Italy, dedicated to the study of the use of enoxaparin sodium in prophylactic and therapeutic doses.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, significant scientific attention has been focused on reprofiling approved antiviral drugs that have been developed for previous epidemics such as MERS, SARS and the West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: Ribavirin has been recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of the Chinese Recommendations.
Umifenovir: Umifenovir has been recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of the Chinese Recommendations
Some antibiotics that have been found to be potentially suitable for use as a treatment for COVID-19:
Tocilizumab (anti-IL-6 receptor): approved in China.
Also tests in Italy and China, see Tocilizumab<0x23>COVID-19.
The COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical 2019 coronavirus vaccine (COVID-19).
Despite the fact that no vaccine has undergone clinical trials, numerous attempts to develop such a vaccine continue to be made.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it did not expect the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine to be available sooner than 18 months from now.
In April, five candidates for vaccines underwent a Phase I safety study.
The COVID-19 virus was detected in December 2019.
In 2020, a major outbreak of the disease spread around the world, leading to significant investments in the development of the vaccine and its research activities.
Many organizations to develop possible vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 use published genomes.
As announced in April, the key objectives of CEPI’s vaccine development initiative are to ensure the required speed, production capacity, large-scale deployment and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that at the beginning of 2020, there were 10 different technological platforms in the research and development phase to create an effective COVID-19 vaccine.
Some of the main objectives of the platform included in the Phase I security studies:
nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (developer of stage I and vaccine candidate preparation: Moderna, iRNA-1273)
viral vector (stage I developer and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologics, adenovirus vector type 5)
As CEPI scientists reported in April, 115 potential vaccines are in the early stages of development, 78 of them are used in approved active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute); in addition, 37 more vaccines have been reported or have been reported to have been reported (there are plans for more than 37 vaccines).
Preliminary tests for safety and immunogenicity are carried out at stages I-II, usually randomized, placebo-controlled and at several sites, with the simultaneous determination of more accurate and effective doses.
Phase III testing typically involves more participants, including a control group; at this stage, the drugs are tested for effectiveness in preventing the disease and, at the same time, the side effects are tracked at optimal dosages.
Of the 79 vaccine candidates in active development (confirmed at the beginning of April 2020), 74 have not yet undergone human trials (still in the preclinical stage).
On January 24, 2020, the University of Queensland, Australia, announced that it is investigating the potential of a vaccine with a molecular clamp that genetically modifies viral proteins to stimulate the immune response.

The partners also announced plans to conduct pre-clinical trials and phase I clinical trials by July 2020.
On March 12, 2020, the Ministry of Health of India announced that they are studying 11 isolated patients, and that it will take at least a year and a half to develop the vaccine even in an accelerated fashion.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotech company, Quebec, reported that they had created a coronavirus-like particle with a partial funding from the Canadian Institute of Health Research.
The potential vaccine is undergoing laboratory testing, and human testing is scheduled for July or August 2020.
Earlier this week, The Guardian reported that U.S. President Donald Trump had offered CureVac “large amounts of money” for exclusive access to the Covid-19 vaccine, against which the German government expressed its protest.
On March 17, 2020, the American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech to jointly develop a vaccine based on RNA.
BNT162 is a candidate for the vaccine based on RNA; the drug is currently undergoing pre-clinical trials, and clinical trials will begin in April 2020.
On March 17, 2020, Italian biotechnology company Takis Biotech announced that in April 2020 it will receive the results of pre-clinical trials, and their final vaccine candidate may begin testing on humans as early as autumn.
On March 19, 2020, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), France, announced an investment of US$4.9 million in a consortium for the development of a COVID-19 vaccine with the participation of the Institute of Pasteur, Themis Bioscience and Universities.
Other investment partners in developing the COVID-19 vaccine are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, the universities of Hong Kong, Oxford and Queensland.
On March 20, 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had begun testing six different candidates for vaccines on animals.

At the end of March, the Canadian government announced the allocation of 275 million Canadian dollars to fund 96 research projects on medical countermeasures against COVID-19, including the development of numerous vaccine-candidate drugs for savannah vaccines in Canadian companies and Universities.
Approximately at the same time, the Canadian government announced the allocation of 192 million Canadian dollars specifically for the development of a COVID-19 vaccine, as well as plans to create a national “vaccine bank” that will include several new vaccines that could be used in the case of a new vaccine.
On April 2, 2020, researchers from the University of Pittsburgh Medical School reported testing PittCoVacc, a possible COVID-19 vaccine on mice, stating that “MNA has introduced subunit vaccines that have not been passed to SARS-CoV-2 S1 vaccines.”
On April 16, 2020, Waterloo University’s Canadian School of Pharmacy announced the development of a potential DNA-based vaccine, which may be released as a nasal spray.
Using bacteriophages, DNA will multiply inside human bacteria and form harmless virus-like particles that can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the government, industry and three U.S. universities combined IBM’s supercomputer resources with cloud computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have heterological effects, also known as non-specific effects.
This means that they may have other advantages in addition to the disease-preventing properties.
Another randomized study, which is conducted in Australia, covered 4,170 health workers.
It is possible that the vaccines being developed will prove to be unsafe or ineffective.
Early studies evaluating the effectiveness of vaccines using animal models that are characteristic of COVID-19, such as ACE2-transgenic mice, other laboratory animals and lower primates, indicate the need for co-morbidity measures to prevent the standardization of international infection with a level of biosafety 3 in the treatment.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested on animal models.
As of 2020, there are no medications or protective vaccines for SARS that would be safe and effective for humans.
According to research published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and drugs for the treatment of atypical pneumonia has been a priority for governments and public health institutions around the world. Against MERS, there is also no verified evidence.
When MERS began to spread, it was believed that the SARS study conducted at the time could become a standard for developing vaccines and therapeutics against MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, there was one (DNA-based) vaccine from MERS, which went through stage I clinical trials in humans, and three more vaccines, all of which were vaccines based on the viral vector -V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V-V
On social media, there was a conspiracy theory that claimed that the COVID-19 virus is not new at all and that a vaccine from it already exists.
The publications on social media cited the words of some patients who claimed patents for the genetic sequences of other strains of the coronavirus, such as the SARS coronavirus, as well as vaccines for these strains.
Coronavirus is a disease detected in 2019 (COVID-19), an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome of coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The most common symptoms include fever, coughing, and difficulty breathing.
Other symptoms may include feeling tired, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of smell, and abdominal pain.
The time from the first manifestation of symptoms to the peak of the disease is usually about five days, but it can also vary from two to fourteen days.
Most cases are reduced to the manifestation of lung symptoms, however, in some cases the disease passes into viral pneumonia and polyorganic insufficiency.
As of April 17, 2020, there were more than 2.24 million cases of infection in 210 countries and regions, with more than 153,000 people dying from the disease.
More than 568,000 people have recovered. The virus is mainly spread when people are in close contact with each other, often through microscopic drops excreted in the air when coughing, sneezing, or talking.
Although these droplets are formed when exhaled, they are usually a threat when they hit the ground or on the surface, but are not transmitted through the air over long distances.
People also become infected by touching the contaminated surface, and then their eyes, nose, or mouth.
On the surface, the virus can live for 72 hours.
It is most contagious within the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although its spread may be possible both before the onset of symptoms and at later stages. The standard method of diagnosis is a polymerase of a nootropic spleen.
The use of medical masks is recommended for patients with a suspicion of the disease, as well as those who care for them.
Recommendations for the use of medical masks by the population are different: some agencies recommend not to use them at all, some recommend their use, and others require it.
At present, there is no vaccine or specific treatment for the COVID-19 virus.
The local spread of the disease has been recorded in most countries in all six WHO regions.
Infected people may not have symptoms or have flu symptoms, such as fever, cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, constant pain or feeling depressed in the chest, confusion of consciousness, difficulty waking up, bruising of the face or lips; if the above symptoms are present, seek medical attention immediately.
Less often, symptoms of upper respiratory tract disease, such as itching, constipation or sore throat, may be observed.
Also, in different percentages, gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea are observed.
Some cases of the disease, registered in China, were initially manifested only by a feeling of depression in the chest and an increased heart rate.
In some cases, the disease can progress to pneumonia, polyorgan insufficiency, and eventually death occurs.
This is called the incubation period.
The incubation period of COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but can vary from two to 14 days.
In 97.5% of people, symptoms begin to manifest within 11.5 days after infection. According to the available data, symptoms do not manifest in all infected.
The role of such asymptomatic carriers in the transmission of the disease is still completely unknown, but preliminary data suggest that they may contribute to the spread of the infection.
The percentage of infected people with asymptomatic course of the disease is currently unknown, it is only being studied; at the same time the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported that in 20% of all confirmed cases and hospitalizations related to the virus.
China’s National Health Commission has started to include asymptomatic cases in its daily summary since April 1; out of 166 infections recorded on that day, 130 (78%) have declined asymptomatic at the time of testing.
Both mosquitoes and saliva can have a higher concentration of the virus.
With loud speech in the air, more drops are released than with normal volume speech.
A study conducted in Singapore showed that when coughing open, drops can spread at a distance of up to 4.5 meters (15 feet).
The virus is not usually transmitted by air, but the National Academy of Sciences has suggested that the transmission of virus particles by bioaerosol is still possible, and the testing of air recycled by air collectors located in the corridors outside the people's rooms.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), can lead to the spraying of exhalation products and, therefore, the spread of the virus in the air.
There are also concerns that the virus can spread through faeces, however, this risk is considered low. The virus is the most contagious when people have symptoms; the spread of the virus is possible even before the onset of symptoms, but this risk is small.
Officials of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) say that it is not entirely clear how easily the virus spreads, however, it is known that one patient usually infects 2-3 other people. The virus is able to survive on the surface from a few hours to a few hours.
In particular, it was found that on a cardboard surface the virus can live for one day, on a plastic surface (polypropylene) and on stainless steel (AISI 304) - up to three days, and on 99% of copper surfaces - up to 4 hours.
These indicators, however, vary depending on the humidity and temperature.
Soap and detergents with their proper use have a quite beneficial effect in the fight against infection: the soap destroys the fat protective layer of the virus, deactivating it in this way, as well as being able to remove it from the surfaces of the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a surgical disinfectant), are less effective against this virus. During the study, which was conducted in Hong Kong, saliva samples were taken on average two days after the gos.
In five of the six patients, the first test showed the highest concentration of the virus in the blood, and in the sixth patient the highest concentration of the virus in the blood was detected on the second day of testing.
Severe Acute Respiratory Coronavirus Syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new severe acute coronavirus respiratory syndrome, first detected in three people with pneumonia from the group with acute respiratory diseases.
All signs of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are also found in naturally related coronaviruses.
Outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap that opens its protective shell. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
Lightning is the organ most susceptible to COVID-19, as the virus penetrates the host cells through the angiotensin-transforming enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is most common in lung alveolar cells type II.
The virus binds to ACE2 and penetrates the host cell with the help of a characteristic surface glycoprotein – “chip” (peplomer).
12% of infected people who entered the Wuhan hospital were diagnosed with acute myocardial damage, which is more common with a severe form of the disease.
The frequency of cardiovascular symptoms is high due to systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders observed during the progression of the disease, but acute myocardial damage may also be associated with the presence of ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are present in the heart in large quantities as they are involved in the work of this organ.
A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) was observed in patients who were in OIT with COVID-19, and may indicate adverse prognosis. Autopsy of patients who died of COVID-19 in the suffocation of suffocation and suffocation of suffocation of suffocation.
Although SARS-COV-2 has a tropism towards ACE2-expressing epithelial airway cells, symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation have been observed in patients with severe COVID-19.
In particular, it was found that pathogenic GM-XF T-cells correlate with the recruitment of inflammatory monocytes that secrete IL-6 and severe lung pathology in COVID-19 patients.
Lymphocyte infiltrates were also detected at the opening.
The WHO has also published several protocols of testing for the disease.
Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is a standard test method.
The test is usually performed on respiratory samples obtained from a nasal smear, but a nasal smear or nasal smear sample can also be used.
The results are usually prepared within a period of several hours to two days.
You can also take blood tests, but they require two blood samples taken at intervals of two weeks, and their results are not of direct significance.
Chinese scientists were able to identify the strain of the coronavirus and publish its genetic sequence so that scientists in laboratories around the world could independently develop tests using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method to detect the presence of this virus.
As of April 4, 2020, tests on antibodies, which could detect the presence of infection at the current time, as well as the fact of possible infection in the past, were in the development stage, but have not yet received widespread distribution.
The Chinese experience of studying the results of the tests showed that their accuracy is only 60-70%.
March 21, 2020 The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the first test for on-site diagnostics, giving permission for its use at the end of this month.

Bilateral multi-length subpleural sealing focusses of the "matt glass" type with peripheral, asymmetric and aposteric distribution are common symptoms detected at an early stage of the disease.
Subpleural dominance, a symptom of bulge bridge (long thickening of the partition with variable alveolar filling) and consolidation develop as the disease progresses.
There is little data on microscopic lesions and the pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main results of the pathological study carried out at the opening:
Macroscopy: pleuritis, pericarditis, sealing and pulmonary oedema
There are four types of viral pneumonia:
mild form of pneumonia: pulmonary oedema, pneumocytic hyperplasia, large atypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocytic infiltration and the formation of multinuclear giant cells
severe form of pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudate.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ORDS) and severe hypoxemia.
Healing pneumonia: organization of exudates in the alveolar cavities and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis.
Blood: diffuse intravascular coagulation (DVS syndrome); leukoerytroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the likelihood of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, frequent hand washing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, compliance with respiratory hygiene rules, as well as avoiding contact with eyes, nose or mouth.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a napkin when coughing or sneezing, or, in the absence of a napkin, covering the mouth and nose with the inner side of the elbow area of the hand.
After coughing or sneezing, it is recommended to perform a quality hygienic procedure for the hands.
The Centers for the Control and Prevention of Illness of Patients (CDC) recommends the use of tissue face masks in public places, in particular, in order to limit the transmission of infection to persons with asymptomatic course of the disease. Strategies of social distancing
The distancing recommendations also imply that people should be at least 6 feet (1.8 m) apart from each other.
Medicinal products with proven effectiveness against COVID-19 do not exist. Since the completion of the vaccine development is not expected before 2021, the main part of the measures against the spread of COVID-19 is reduced to a peak of the epidemic known as the “release to the plateau”.
The CDC also recommends washing hands more often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after visiting the toilet or with severe hand contamination, as well as before eating and after sneezing, coughing or sneezing.
The CDC also recommends using an alcohol-containing disinfectant (the alcohol content is at least 60%) for hand treatment, but only in cases where soap and water are not available. For regions where such disinfectants are not sold, the WHO provides two nets.
In these compositions, ethanol or isopropanol are used, having antimicrobial activity.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol and is not a suitable means for antiseptic treatment of the hands.
Glycerol is added as a moisturizer.
Patients have been shown supportive therapy, which may include infusion therapy, oxygen support, as well as support for other affected vital organs.
The CDC recommends those who suspect that they are infected with the virus to wear a regular medical mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to address the problem of respiratory insufficiency, but its benefits are still being studied.
To strengthen immunity, it is recommended to follow the rules of personal hygiene, a healthy lifestyle and diet.
Supportive methods of therapy can be shown to patients with mild symptoms in the early stages of the disease. The WHO and the National Health Commission of China have published recommendations for the care of patients hospitalized with COVID-19.
In the U.S., intensive care physicians and pulmonologists summarized the therapeutic recommendations of various institutions in the free resource – IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for Covid-19.
For the treatment of symptoms as first-line drugs, some medical professionals recommend making a choice in favor of paracetamol (acetaminophen) compared to ibuprofen.
When performing procedures in which airborne discharge may occur, such as intubation or drying of the hands, it is necessary to take precautions to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in medical institutions.
Medical workers caring for people with COVID-19, the CDC recommends placing in an air-drop insulator (AIIR) - an additional measure in addition to the standard precautions in terms of contact and air protection. CDC has published recommendations for the use of indus.
Recommended means of personal protection: protective coat, respirator or medical mask, eye protection products and medical gloves. Of the above mentioned means, it is preferable to use respirators, rather than medical masks.
N95 respirators are approved for use in industrial environments, but the FDA has authorized the use of these respirators in accordance with the Emergency Application Authorization (EUA).
They are designed to protect against particles in the air, such as dust, but when used not on instructions, effectiveness in terms of protection against a specific biological agent is not guaranteed.
If medical masks are not available, the CDC recommends using protective face shields or, in extreme cases, make masks yourself at home.
In most cases, the current form of COVID-19 is not severe enough to require artificial ventilation of the lungs or alternatives, but there is also a certain percentage of cases where it is necessary.
The type of respiratory support for hospitalized patients with respiratory failure associated with COVID-19 is currently actively being studied, with some evidence in favor of indubitable indubitable indubitable indubitable or intubation can be avoided with the help of a nasal oxygen indubitable can.
It is not yet known whether any of these two methods are as effective for patients in critical condition as ILD.
Some doctors make a choice in favor of invasive mechanical ventilation of the lungs, if it is available, because this method significantly limits the spread of particles in the air compared to the nose cannulas that are older than 80 years old and are older than people with intense airflow.
In many developed countries, there is a shortage of hospital beds per capita, and the resources of healthcare systems are too limited to cope with the sharp increase in the number of cases of COVID-19 infection in a severe form that requires hospitalization.
According to one study conducted in China, 5% of patients were hospitalized in intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical support for lung ventilation, and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30% of people hospitalized with COVID-19 are eventually resuscitated.
The task of providing artificial ventilation of the lungs is complicated as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which develops with COVID-19, and oxygenation will involve more and more problems.
Inhaled-pressure-supported IVL and PDKV are necessary to deliver the maximum amount of oxygen to the lungs and to ensure their minimal ventilation damage, as a result of which pneumothorax can develop.
On earlier models of fans, high PDKV may not be available.
Studies on potential treatments began in January 2020, and several antiviral drugs are currently in the stage of clinical trials.
The most promising is remdesivir.
The development of new drugs may take up to 2021, but some of the drugs being tested have already been approved for other purposes or are in the final stages of testing.
Antiviral drugs can be tested in patients with severe forms of the disease.
Recommended WHO volunteers take part in the efficacy and safety tests of potential treatments. The FDA has granted a temporary authorisation to use reconvalescent plasma as an experimental treatment in cases where a person’s life is seriously or imminent.
Its use has not been subject to clinical trials to be conducted to prove the safety and efficacy of the treatment method.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app designed to combat the outbreak of the disease.
To log in, users must enter their name and identification number.
The app can detect “close contact” with the help of surveillance data and therefore determine the potential risk of infection.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If the potential risk is detected, the app not only recommends self-isolation, but also sends a notification to the local health authorities. Analysis of big data collected from mobile phones, the technology of facial recognition of Yupo and Korrean people, the tracking of mobile phones and artificial intelligence are used.
In March 2020, the Israeli government gave security authorities permission to track the mobile phone data of people who were allegedly infected with the coronavirus.
Measures have been taken to provide quarantine and protection for persons who may come into contact with infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, in order to investigate and prevent the spread of the virus, Deutsche Telekom provided the federal government agencies of Germany and the Robert Koch Institute with aggregated data on the location of cellular subscribers.
In Russia, face recognition technology was introduced to identify quarantine offenders.
Italy’s regional health commissioner, Giulio Gallera, said that cellular network operators reported that “40 percent of people are still moving around the territory.”
The German government held a 48-hour weekend programming marathon with more than 42,000 participants.
Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid also called for creative solutions against the spread of the coronavirus.
People may experience stress due to quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment, or due to fear of the infection itself.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying, "Intensified social isolation, loneliness, health concerns, stress and economic decline are ideal conditions for harming people's mental health and well-being."
The disease can occur in a mild form with minor or absent symptoms reminiscent of other common diseases of the upper respiratory tract, such as a common cold.
Patients with a mild form of the disease usually recover within two weeks, while for the treatment of patients with severe or critical forms it may take from three to six weeks.
Pregnant women may be at a higher risk of developing a severe form of COVID-19 based on data on other similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, although similar data on COVID-19 is not available. In some people, COVID-19 can affect the lungs and cause pneumonia in quality.
In people with the most severe course of the disease, COVID-19 can quickly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which causes respiratory insufficiency, septic shock, or polyorgan insufficiency.
Complications of COVID-19 include sepsis, abnormal thrombosis, as well as problems with the heart, kidneys and liver.
Anomalies of thrombosis, particularly an increase in prothrombin time, have been reported in 6% of patients hospitalized with COVID-19, while renal impairment is observed in 4% of this group.
Approximately 20-30% of patients with COVID-19 have elevated liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the average time between the onset of symptoms and death was ten days, five of which patients were hospitalized.
However, the average time between hospitalization and death in patients transferred to the intensive care unit was seven days.
According to early-stage disease studies, the average time from the onset of initial symptoms to the day of death was 14 days with a full range of six to 41 days.
According to a study conducted by the National Health Commission of China (NHC), the mortality rate among men was 2.8% and among women - 1.7%.
Histopathological studies of postmortem lung samples indicate diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exudates in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic changes were observed in pneumocytes.
The appearance of the lungs resembled acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of deaths registered by the National Health Commission of China, heart problems were increased levels of troponin or cardiac arrest.
According to data provided by the United States in March, 89% of hospitalized patients had previous health problems. The availability of medical resources and the socio-economic situation in the region can also affect mortality.
Estimates of mortality depending on the condition vary due to such regional differences, as well as due to methodological difficulties.
Inadequately effective counts of cases in light form can lead to over-mortality.
However, the fact that deaths occur as a result of diseases acquired in the past may mean that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
In smokers, severe symptoms of COVID-19 generally developed 1.4 times more often, and such patients were about 2.4 times more likely to need intensive care or died compared to non-smokers. Concerns about the consequences of the disease were expressed.
The administration of one of the Hong Kong clinics found that in some patients who recovered from the disease, the volume of the lungs decreased by 20-30%, and their scan showed damage.
After recovery, it can also lead to “After Intensive Therapy” syndrome.
As of March 2020, it was unknown whether patients recovering from the virus had a stable immunity against it.
According to other coronaviruses, this is considered probable, but there have also been reports of cases where, after recovering from COVID-19, the coronavirus tests were still positive.
It is believed that in these cases there has been an exacerbated long-term course of the disease, rather than a re-infection.
It is believed that the virus is natural, has an animal origin and is an infectious disease.
The actual origin of the virus is unknown, but by December 2019, the spread of the infection was almost entirely due to its transmission from person to person.
A study of the first 41 confirmed COVID-19 cases, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, calls December 1, 2019 the earliest date of the first case.
According to official data published by the WHO, this date is December 8, 2019.
A number of methods are usually used to quantify mortality.
All figures vary depending on the region and time of spread of the disease, they are also affected by the volume of testing, the quality of the health systems used treatment regimens, the time since the onset of the outbreak of the disease and the parameters of the population such as age, sex and general condition.
At the end of 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) has assigned the disease with a code of emergency care for ICD-10: U07.1 - for deaths from laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 and U07.2 - for deaths from clinical or epidemiologically diagnosed SARS - without laboratory.
According to statistics from Johns Hopkins University, as of April 17, 2020, the global number of deaths and infections is 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191).
This figure varies depending on the region. Some other methods include the determination of the disease mortality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed patients who died as a result of the disease. The result is diphtheria and the result is diphtheria, as well as the determination of the mortality rate as a result of the infected FR.
These statistics are not tied to a specific time and reflect the indicators of a certain stratum of the population from the moment of infection to the end of the course of the disease.
Despite the fact that antibodies are not produced in all patients who have had the infection, it is possible to understand by the presence of such antibodies how many people have been infected.
In the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, Castillon d'Adda, a small village with a population of 4,600 people, 80 people (1.7%) are no longer alive.
In the city of Gangelt, the disease spread during the carnival celebration among young people, causing relatively lower mortality, and not all cases of death from COVID-19 could be officially classified as such.
In addition, Germany’s health care system has not been overloaded.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of the population may have antibodies, based on donor blood.
COVID-19 is the official cause of 69 deaths (0.004% of the population).
The impact of the pandemic and mortality rates vary for both men and women.
According to studies conducted in China and Italy, the mortality rate is higher in men.
The highest risk group is men over the age of 50; the gap in indicators between men and women decreases only from the age of 90.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 per cent for men and 1.7 per cent for women.
The exact causes of this discrepancy are unknown, but may be genetic and behavioral factors.
Gender immunological differences, the lower prevalence of smoking among women associated with diseases in men (e.g., hypertension manifesting in men at a younger age than in women) may cause higher mortality among men.
In Europe, 57% of those infected were men, and 72% of deaths from COVID-19 were caused by men.
As of April 2020, the U.S. government does not maintain gender statistics on COVID-19.
Scientific studies have shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza, and ORVI have different gender statistics.
The majority of health care workers, especially nurses, are women, accordingly, they are more likely to become infected.
On February 11, 2020, the World Health Organization announced the official name of the disease – COVID-19.
WHO chief, Mr. Tedros Adan Gebreisus, explains: “CO” means “corona”, “VI” means “virus”, “D” means “disease”, and 19 – the year when the outbreak was first detected: December 31, 2019.
This name was chosen to avoid references to a specific geographic location (e.g. China), animal species or groups of people, as required by international naming recommendations aimed at preventing stigmatization of the virus RS2, a virus that causes COVID-19.
In public announcements, the WHO additionally uses the terms “covid-19 virus” and “covid-19 virus”.
Both the disease and the virus itself are commonly referred to as the “coronavirus”.
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and the disease were commonly referred to as the “coronavirus” and the “Coronavirus of Wuhan”.
In January 2020, in accordance with the 2015 recommendations on the use of geographical locations in the names of diseases and viruses, WHO recommended the use of the terms “acute respiratory disease 2019-nCov” and “2019-nCoV” as temporary names of the virus and rabies.
On February 11, 2020, the official names – “COVID-19” and “SARS-CoV-2” were published.
Due to the limitations of the volumes of standard supply chains, some digital service manufacturers print medical materials, such as nasal swabs, as well as parts of IVL devices.
In one such case, the Italian clinic urgently needed a ventilation valve, and the supplier was not able to deliver it in the required time, then one of the local productions was reprofiled and was able to print the necessary 100 valves per night.
After the outbreak of COVID-19 for the first time, various conspiracy theories, disinformation and fake information about the origin of the virus, its scale, prevention, treatment and other aspects began to spread at a high speed on the Internet.
It is likely that humans can infect other animals with the virus.
The results of the study did not confirm the spread of the virus among pigs, ducks and chickens.
At the moment, there is no approved vaccine against the virus or medications for its treatment.
At present, various international studies of COVID-19 vaccines and drugs are being conducted by governmental organizations, academic groups and industry researchers.
In March, the WHO initiated the SOLIDARITY Trial (“SOLIDARITY Trial”), which aims to assess the therapeutic effect of the four existing compounds that are considered to be the most effective to date.
The ready-made vaccine does not yet exist, but various organizations are actively developing vaccine-candidate drugs.
Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 penetrate human cells with the ACE2 receptor, so the results of previous studies conducted on SARS-CoV are used in scientific research.
There are three vaccination strategies.
First, the researchers aim to create a whole-viral vaccine.
The use of such a virus, whether inactive or dead, is aimed at causing a rapid immune response of the human body to a new COVID-19 infection.
The second strategy, the creation of a subunit vaccine, is aimed at creating a vaccine that increases the sensitivity of the immune system to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such studies are aimed at the destruction of an S-like protein, which helps the virus penetrate the ACE2 receptor.
The third strategy is to develop vaccines based on nucleic acids (DNA or RNA vaccine, a new method of vaccine creation).
Experimental vaccines developed under any of these strategies must be tested for safety and effectiveness. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of the vaccine in four volunteers began in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code copied from the virus that causes the disease. Antitelosing enhancement has been identified as one of the potential problems in the development of SARS-COV-2 vaccines, but this assumption is controversial.
As of April 2020, more than 300 active clinical trials are being conducted.
The drugs approved for the treatment of malaria were evaluated in seven trials, four of which were for hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Reprofiling of antiviral drugs is a major part of Chinese studies; by the end of April, nine Phase III studies were conducted in several countries on remdesivir.
As of April 2020, a dynamic review of the clinical development of vaccines and drug candidates for the treatment of COVID-19 was conducted. For the same purpose, several other existing antiviral drugs for the treatment of sopirin are also considered in the sopirin/lohprin, remdesivir, chloroquine and hydrox.
As of March 2020, there are preliminary data on the effectiveness of the use of remdesivir.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients receiving remdesivir as an exception.
Phase III clinical trials are already being conducted in the US, China and Italy. The use of chloroquine, previously used to treat malaria, was considered in China in February 2020, and preliminary results are available.
However, there is a need for an expert evaluation of the study.
The health authorities of Korea and China recommend the use of chloroquine.
The Wuhan Institute of Virology recommends a daily dose of one gram, but at the same time notes that doubling this dose is very dangerous and can lead to a fatal outcome.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency authorisation for the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of doctors treating COVID-19 patients. The Chinese guidelines of the 7th edition also specify interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir as a means against COVID-19.
Preliminary data suggest that high doses of ribavirin are necessary to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide has been recommended for a detailed in vivo study by demonstrating inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 at low concentrations. Studies have shown that for the penetration of SARS-CoV-2 through serbrain-probrain 2 (ACEPRS2 receptor) it is necessary to reconcile the spike protein transmea.
Studies of the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have serious limitations that do not allow the medical community to use these treatments without further study. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, and its role in the treatment of CO-19 does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2.
Hypercytokinemia may occur as a complication in the late stages of a severe form of COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have hypercytokinemic properties. As a result of a small study conducted by the National Health Commission of China, tocilizumab was included in the recommendations for the treatment of the coronavirus.
This drug came out in a 2 stage unrandomized test, which is carried out at the national level in Italy, after the positive results of its use in patients with a severe form of the disease were obtained.
Combined with a blood serum analysis for ferritin to detect cytokine storms, it is designed to counteract such factors that are thought to be the cause of death in some patients.
In 2017, the FDA approved an interleukin-6 receptor antagonist based on retrospective thematic studies to treat steroidal refractory cytokine release syndrome caused by another cause, T-cell therapy CAR.
To date, there is no randomised and controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for cytokine release syndrome.
The transfer of purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune systems of patients who have recovered from COVID-19 to people who need them is currently considered a non-vaccine method of passive immunization.
This strategy was tested in the treatment of patients with SARS, but its results were inconclusive.
Neutralization of the virus is an expected effect, with the help of which passive antibody therapy can provide protection against SARS-CoV-2.
However, it is possible to use other mechanisms such as antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy, for example, using manufactured monoclonal antibodies, are in the development stage.
The extent of use of the reconvalescent blood serum, which consists of a liquid part of the blood of recovered patients and contains antibodies against this virus, can be increased.
Coronavirus diseases, a group of syndromes with a high degree of similarity
Lee Vanillaan, a doctor at the Wuhan Central Clinic, who later became infected and died of COVID-19 after reporting the spread of the virus.
