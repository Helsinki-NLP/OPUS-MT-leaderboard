Welsh councillors are worried about 'looking like a doll'
There are concerns among several AMs over their title proposals to be changed to MWP (Member of the Parliament of Wales).
It came about because of plans to change the name of the conference to the Parliament of Wales.
The entire political spectrum is concerned that it may invite rabies.
An AM of the Labour Party said the party took care of ‘he took it with ‘Twp' and ‘Pwp'.
For readers outside Wales: In Wales, ‘twp' means ‘crazy' and ‘pwp' means ‘dirty.'
Plaid's AM said the party as a whole was "unhappy" and had suggested an alternative.
A Welsh Conservative said his party was ‘open-minded' about the name change, but stated it was a brief oral leap from the MWP to the Puppet.
In this context, the letter ‘w' in Welsh is called the same as the Yorkshire English term for the letter ‘u.'
The Council Commission, which is drafting a law to introduce a name change, said: "The final decision on any so-called Council Member must be a matter for the members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act of 2017 authorizes the council of Wales to change its name.
In June, the Commission announced the results of the public consultations on proposals that received broad support for calling the council as the Parliament of Wales.
With regard to the title of AM, the Commission is favored by Members of the Parliament of Wales or WMP, but MWP elections receive the most support in public consultations.
AM appears to be proposing an alternative option, but has trouble reaching a deal and could elevate Honorary Officer Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a bill on the change within weeks.
The law on renewal includes other changes in the way the committee functions, including regulations on the loss of AM qualifications and the design of the committee system.
AM will get a final vote on what to call when they discuss the law.
Macedonia held a vote in a referendum on changing the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday to either change their country's name to 'Northern Republic of Macedonia'.
The popular vote was established in an effort to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which had its own territory called Macedonia.
Athens has long asserted that the name of its northern neighbour represents a claim to its territory and has repeatedly denied its offer of membership to the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposed the vote on the name change, said he would ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argued that the name change was just the price to pay to join the EU and NATO unions.
St. Martin's Church is silent because the Churches are in Harlem.
“The parents I met said, historically, there are bars and churches on every corner of the street,” Adams said.
"Today, they're both gone."
He said the loss of the bar was understandable.
"People are socializing in a different way now," he said.
"The bar is no longer a living room in the neighborhood where people will always go."
For the church, he feared the money from the sale of assets would not last as long as the leader expected it, "and soon they will be back where they started."
The churches, he said, could be replaced by apartment buildings and condominiums inhabited by people who do not want to help maintain the sanctuaries that are still in the neighborhood.
"The majority of people who will buy condominiums in this building are white people," he said, "and therefore will make these churches closed at all because it is unlikely that most people who enter these condominiums will be members of the churches."
The two churches were built by whites before Harlem became a black metropolis - the Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The original Methodist church moved in the 1930s.
The black church that had worshiped nearby had taken possession of the building.
St. Martin has been taken over by the black group under The Honourable John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of merchants on 125th Street, a main street to shop in Harlem, which opposes the taking or promoting of blacks at work.
A fire in 1939 made the building badly damaged, but as the Pastoral Fathers, Johnson made plans to rebuild, they ordered the tower bells.
David Johnson, son and successor of the Johnson Priesthood in St. Martin, proudly called the tower bells a ‘poor people’s spot.’
The expert who played the carillon in July called it something else: ‘Cultural beauty’ and ‘an irreplaceable historical instrument.’
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also stated that it was the first bell in the world to be played by black musician, Dionysius A. Lind, who moved to a larger bell at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin did not replace him.
What has been played at St Martin in recent months has become a complication to architects and contractors, some brought by church leaders, others by bishops.
The Vestri space - the church's administrative body, consisting of a public leader - wrote the bishop in July with concerns the bishop "will seek to approve the cost" for the vestry space, although the vestry space was not involved in the hiring of architects and contractors brought in by the bishop.
Some members of the congregation complained about the lack of transparency in the bishop's section.
A 13-year-old shark hurts a 13-year-old boy while searching for a coral reef in California.
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday as he dived in search of coral reefs in California on the opening day of the coral reef season, officials said.
The attack took place before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego he was diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy scream for help and then rowing along with a group of people to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel said at first he thought it was just a funny scream of catching a coral reef, but he " realized that the boy was screaming, "I have to bite!
I have to bite!"
The whole leg was swollen and open," Hammel said he noticed when he got the boy.
"I yelled at everyone to get out of the water: "There's a shark in the water!" added Hammel.
The boy was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego where he was listed in critical condition.
The shark species responsible for the attack is unknown.
Rescue Captain Larry Giles said in a press release that sharks had been found in the area a few weeks ago, but it had been identified as a harmless shark species.
Giles added that the victim suffered a traumatic injury to the top of his body.
Officials closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security purposes.
Giles says there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plan to enter the beauty market in the UK
Sainsbury takes Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams from a beauty-style room in a versatile building controlled by an expert assistant.
As part of the hard work entering the <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion beauty market in the UK, which continues to grow while selling fashion and home appliances back, a larger beauty space will be tested in 11 buildings across the country and brought to more buildings next year if it yields profits.
Investment in beauty comes when the market is looking for ways to use the shelf space previously charged for TVs, microwave leaks and home appliances.
Sainsbury said it would double the size of its beauty offerings to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The range of available products from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with the same branded parts as those found in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket also re-launched a range of Boutique retail products to make the majority of its products vegan-friendly - something that is getting more and more in demand by buyers from young people.
Fragrance Shop dealers will also test concessions at two major markets in Sainsbury, the first opened in Croydon, south London, last week while the second opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham, late this year.
Buying online and switching to buying a little food every day at a local convenience store means the supermarket needs to work hard again to convince people to come.
Mike Coupe, Sainsbury's chief executive, said the branch would look like a multi-storey building as the major market chain tries to fight Aldi and Lidl's big business with more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury has placed Argos's branches in hundreds of stores and has also introduced several places since it bought both chains two years ago, said to have increased retail sales and made earnings more profitable.
Previously, the supermarkets wanted to modify the beauty and pharmaceutical parts that ended in failure.
Sainsbury tested a similar venture with Boot in early 2000, but the collaboration ended after arguing about how to share revenue from a pharmacy store in its main market.
The new strategy emerged after Sainsbury sold 281 pharmacy stores to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmaceuticals chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million, three years ago.
He said Lloyds played a role in the design, adding a variety of luxury leather care brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy within the four buildings.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, said: "We have changed the look and feel of our beauty space to improve the environment for our customers.
We also invest with special-trained friends to be willing to offer advice.
Our range of brands are designed to meet every need, and an attractive environment and comfortable location mean we are now an exciting beauty destination that challenges the old ways of shopping."
Peter Jones 'crosses' after Holly Willoughby withdraws <0xC2><0xA3>11 million bid
Peter Jones, the Dragons' Den star, 'crosses' after TV presenter Holly Willoughby pulled a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with his lifestyle brand business to focus on his new contract with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for home goods and accessories from the Truly Brand.
The pair's business was matched to the Goop brand by Gwyneth Paltrow.
A spokesperson for This Morning, 37, used Instagram to announce that she would stop.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragons' Den star, Peter Jones, in a state of anger by withdrawing from the lucrative lifestyle brand business at the end of the day - to focus on her extraordinary new contract with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources said Jones "crossed" when the successful TV woman admitted during a tense meeting on Tuesday at her imperial headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new offer - worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million - meant she didn't have time to devote house goods and accessories from the True brand.
The business has been matched to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and is expected to double Willoughby's <0xC2><0xA3>11 million fortune.
When Willoughby, 37, used Instagram to announce he was leaving Truly, Jones flew out of Britain to one of his vacation homes.
The source said: "During this time, Truly has been Holly's priority.
It will be his long-term future that will see him in the coming decades.
The decision to pull out everyone involved was truly shocking.
No one can believe what happened on Tuesday, it's so close to the launch.
There's a warehouse full of stuff in the Marlow headquarters that's ready for sale."
Experts believe the delivery of This Morning, which is among the most accepted stars in banks in Britain, could damage millions of firms caused by large investments in products consisting of pillows and candles to clothing and household goods, and potentially suspending its launch.
It could be the end of that friendship.
Willoughby, the mother of three children and husband Dan Baldwin has been friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined him as chairman in March.
The couple are on vacation together and Jones owns a 40% stake in Baldwin, a TV publishing firm.
Willoughby will be the brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as an ITV lawyer in the I'm A Celebrity' program.
A source close to Jones said last night "We will not comment on his business affairs."
Conversation' and then we fall in love'
He joked about the criticism that would be received by the news media for making reviews that he would partly consider "unreasonable to the president" and very positive about the North Korean leader.
Why is President Trump giving up too much?
Trump said by calling the "news reader" voice.
“I never gave up losing.”
He said Kim was interested in a second meeting after their initial meeting in Singapore in June had been set by Trump as a major step towards the cessation of North Korea's nuclear program.
Negotiations on the cessation of the nuclear program have been slowed down.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea did not see a "similar response" from the United States about North Korea's early arms movement.
On the contrary, he said, the U.S. continues its sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump took a more optimistic view in his assembly speech.
"Our relations with North Korea are good," he said.
"We will fight with North Korea.
Millions of people will be killed.
We have a great relationship now."
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had led to a positive decision - to end the missile test, help release the hostages, and bring the bodies of the American military home to the water.
And he maintains his extraordinary approach in talking about the relationship with Kim.
"It's very easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people out there trying to get into this solid arena, we're going to have about 200 people standing there," Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him directly.
Indonesia's Tsunami and Earthquake Destroy Islands, Killing Hundreds
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations said they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population has been displaced, no national disaster has been declared, as a condition for granting international aid.
"In many situations, unfortunately, they clearly did not ask for international help, so it was somewhat challenging," Ms. Sumbung said.
While Save the Children together in a team go to Palu, it is uncertain whether foreign staff can work at the scene.
Mr Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see if the international agency would be allowed to contribute to the relief effort.
Based on the earthquake that is often faced by Indonesia, the country remains unprepared to face natural disasters.
Although a tsunami shelter has been built in Aceh, it is not a common sight on other coasts.
The lack of tsunami warning sirens in Palu, although the warning has been strong, it seems to contribute to the loss of life.
At its best, the journey between the islands in Indonesia is indeed challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics more complex.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to care for earthquake victims was heading to Palu, but it took at least three days to get to the new disaster site.
President Joko Widodo has made poor infrastructure improvements a top priority in his election campaign, and he has made a high commitment to highways and railway tracks.
But the lack of funds has hit Jokowi's administration as he faces re-election next year.
Jokowi faces pressure from the mazhab tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have received a more conservative religious understanding.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were displaced from their homes as Christian and Muslim groups fought in the streets, using parades, arrows and arrows, and other weapons.
Watch: Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge equals position against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing to Chelsea in the Premier League by scoring one goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a referral from Xherdan Shaqiri when about 30 ela from Chelsea's goal with his team ahead 1-0.
He kicked the ball to the left before kicking towards a distant goal net.
The attempt swelled high above the goal goal as it floated towards the top right corner of the net.
Eventually the ball fell over Arrizabalaga who jumped and fell into the net.
"He's just trying to get into that position, to get the ball and players like Shaq always bring the ball as far as possible, so I'm trying to spare as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante come and make a splash and don't think long then make a punch on it."
Chelsea are ahead of 1-0 in the semi-finals after winning the net in the 25th minute of Belgium's Eden Hazard.
The Blues forward sent the ball back to Mateo Kovacic in the game, before lying in the middle of the field and running into the centre of Liverpool.
Kovacic can give and send quickly in the middle part.
He then released a beautiful kick, bringing Hazard into the goal.
The danger passed the defense and netted the goal away with a left-footed kick passed Liverpool player Alisson Becke.
Liverpool beat Naples in the Champions League group stage at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea faced Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3 p.m. Thursday in London.
Indonesian tsunami death toll rises to 832
The death toll from earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia rose to 832, the country’s disaster agency said early Sunday morning.
Many people were reportedly trapped under the debris of a 7.5-magnitude earthquake that struck Friday and triggered a 20-foot wave, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference.
Palu Airport, which has more than 380,000 people, is filled with debris from collapsed buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been carried out after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. on Grayson Mews on John Street, with a 32-year-old man arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have urged people in the area to see or hear anything to show up.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is still in its early stages but I appeal to anyone who is around John Street in Birkenhead who sees or hears something suspicious to contact us.
I also appeal to anyone, especially the taxi driver, who may have recorded something on the futej of the front panel camera to contact us because they may have important information for our investigation."
A police spokesperson confirmed the woman found her body was a local Birkenhead resident and she was found inside her home.
In the evening, friends who believed they knew the woman had arrived at the scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
Police say the investigation is underway, they are in the process of informing the victims' heirs.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has just tried to enter his apartment but is told by police no one is allowed in or out of the building.
He'd be so upset when he found out what was going on.
Residents were told the investigation took hours until they were allowed back in.
A police officer told a man that the entire area is now considered a crime scene.
A woman appeared at the scene in a state of crying.
He kept repeating "it's so terrible."
At 2 p.m., two police vans were inside the cordon and another van was outside.
Several officers stood inside the cordon overseeing the part-apartment block.
Anyone with information is asked to send a message directly to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers by default at 0800 555 111 quoting log 247 from September 30.
The Cromwell statue of Parliament becomes a recent memorial marked by the 'history of rewrite'
Its abolition would be poetic justice for destruction like the Taliban with so many of England's artifact cultures and religions done by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick’s suggestion as ‘stupid’ and ‘trying to rewrite history.’
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "It is inevitable in the debate now about the removal of the statues in which the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster will be the target.
The iconoclasm of the English civil war was either not directed or run by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of Thomas' ancestors in the last century.
The beautiful representation of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft against Cromwell is evidence of the 19th century and part of the history of the figures that many believe are still worth celebrating.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was considered crowded, more crowded in the late 19th century than today, as a parliamentary defender against external pressure, in his situation of course a monarchy.
Whether it is a full representative becomes the subject of continuous historical discussion.
What is certain is that the mid-17th century conflict has shaped the next development of our country, and Cromwell is an individual known as a figure who represents one part shared.
His achievements as Lord Protector should also be divorced and remembered."
China's farmers have been killed by pigs
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China, according to local media reports.
The man, known definitively by his family name "Yuan," was found dead with a broken artery, filled with blood near a market in Liupanshui in the Guizhou region, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer was preparing to inject a vaccine to pigs on May 30, 2005 in Xining Province of Qinghai, China.
He reportedly traveled with his cousin from the Yunnan region on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next day, his cousin finds him dead, and finds a pig's door open.
He said in the pig cage was a large male pig with its mouth bleeding.
A forensic examination confirmed that 550 pounds of pork had beaten farmers to death, according to the report.
"his family" Wu, "said, as quoted by the Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the store at 4.40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pig.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Night News that the pig had been locked to prevent it from attacking others, while police were gathering evidence at the scene.
The Yuan family and market authorities are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of swine that attack humans have been recorded before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man with a critical injury.
Ten years ago, a <0xC2><0xA3>650 pig tied a Welsh farmer to his tractor so his wife drove the animal away.
After Oregon farmers were eaten by pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs aren't always aggressive but a sense of blood can act as "pencetus."
They're just playing.
They're nippers, very curious to know... they don't come out to hurt you.
You just have to pay the right amount of respect," he said.
Excessive Rosa typhoon brings extensive heavy rains to the southwest of the US
As predicted, Typhoon Rosa is getting weaker as it moves to cold water off the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring heavy rain to the north of Mexico and southwest of the United States in the coming days.
Rosa has winds of 85 mph, Category 1 Storms, up to 5 am. Eastern time Sunday, and is located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, the bulge that began to form in the Pacific Ocean and moved eastward toward the U.S. West Coast When Rosa approached the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, she began to reject the tropics to the north southwest of the U.S.
Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain in Mexico on Monday.
Subsequently, the tropical humidity interacts with the approaching bulge that creates heavy rain in the Southwest the next day.
Within the country, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous floods, debris flows and soil collapses in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity will cause rainfall to reach 2 to 3 inches per hour in places, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in the southwest, especially more than Arizona.
Lightning floods may be in severe conditions due to tropical rainfall.
It is highly recommended to melt into the desert with the threat of tropical rains.
Heavy rains can cause flooding for torrential rivers and thunderstorms that will bring the country strong winds and blowing dust.
The close-up will bring heavy rain on the southern coast of California.
The amount of rain more than half an inch may occur, which can lead to a stream of small cracks and slippery roads.
It became the first rain in the region during the dry season.
Some tropical rains will begin approaching Arizona on Sunday and early Monday, before the rains become more distant on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rains will spread to the Four Corners on Tuesday and the last on Wednesday.
In October you can see some intense temperature changes across the U.S. as the Arctic gets cooler, but the tropical areas remain a little warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes with short-term temperatures.
There's a great example of the temperature difference through the U.S. center on Sunday.
There is a 20-degree temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the coming days, the melting summer heat will try to build and develop again.
Most central and eastern U.S. are expected to witness a warm start until October with the 1980s extending from the South Plains to the Northeast.
New York City can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is estimated to be 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows a high chance of temperatures above average for the eastern U.S. through the first half of October.
More than 20 million people have seen Brett Kavanaugh.
More than 20 million people witnessed shocking testimony on Thursday by prospective Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused her of sexually assaulting was accused of taking place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, political pauses continued, with broadcasters disrupting regular programming for the last minute touch Friday: a deal designed by Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a one-week investigation into the charge.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100 percent sure Kavanaugh was raping him and trying to open his shirt at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in his statement, said 100 percent certainly did not happen.
It may be more than 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen on Friday watching it.
The company estimates the average audience on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers are not immediately available for other networks that show PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has a problem measuring people watching in the office.
To put in perspective, it is the same size of the audience as a football game or an Academy Award.
Fox News Channel, which hosts it said had supported Kavanaugh's appointment, led all networks with an average of 5.69 million listeners throughout the day, Nielsen said.
ABC is second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS has 3.1 million, NBC has 2.94 million, MSNBC has 2.89 million and CNN has 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Benefits remain high after hearing.
Flake is the main character in this Friday's drama.
After a simple Republican official issued a statement that he would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, he was arrested as a CNN and CBS camera on Friday morning was yelled at by protesters as he tried to climb the elevator to the hearing of the Judiciary Committee.
He stood with less effort for a few minutes when he preached, broadcast live on CNN.
"I'm standing here in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth?"
She was told, "You have power when a lot of women don't have power."
Flake said his office had issued a statement and said, before the elevator was closed, he would say a lot at the committee's hearing.
Cable networks and broadcasts all covered hours directly afterwards, when the Judiciary Committee voted to advance Kavanaugh's candidacy to the Senate to vote.
But Flake said he would only do so with the understanding that the FBI would see charges against the impeachment next week, a minority Democrat urges.
Flake is confident part of a conversation with his friend, Sen. Democrat Chris Coons.
After the Coons and several senators' conversations thereafter, Flake made the decision.
This Flake election is indeed in power, as it is clear that Republicans will not have a vote to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of 'playing politics' over Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union of "playing politics" with Britain's future and affecting the country's interests in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives for the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain, September 29, 2018.
In another conversation with him on the front page of the newspaper, former foreign minister Boris Johnson stressed his alleged attacks as Checkers for Brexit, saying Britain and the EU's proposals should collect tariffs each "completely unreasonable."
Wayde Sims shooter: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson with death of LSU player
Police have arrested suspects in shooting dead Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and placed in jail on charges of killing two degrees, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officers released a video of a confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his eyeglasses during the fight.
Police rediscovered eyeglasses from the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA in them, CBS affiliate WAFB reported.
After harassing Simpson, the police said he claimed Wayde was shot dead physically.
His bounty has been set at $350,000, the Defender's report.
Eastern Colonel Baton Rouge East issued an early report on Friday, saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head to the neck.
The department credits the Louisiana State Police evacuation police force, state police crime labs, Southern University Police and local people in assisting the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked the law enforcement for "sustainability and the efforts of justice".
Sims is 20 years old.
6-foot-6 ahead grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "satisfying" and "surprised" by Wayde's death.
"That's what you're worried about all the time," Wade said.
Volcano erupts in Mexico City
Dust spilled from the Popocatepetl volcano to the southern part of the Mexican capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after increased activity in the crater and it registered 183 gas and dust releases for 24 hours.
The center monitors various earthquakes and earthquakes.
The image on social media shows a thin layer of glass in the front of the car on the cover of an ash layer in residential areas in Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists are aware of an increase in activity on a volcano located 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the country's capital since the 7.1 magnitude earthquake rocked Central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan dissidents ahead of independence anniversary vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police, and thousands attended demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarization election separation.
A group of masked pro-separators held by riot police hurled them with eggs and released paint powder, making dark clouds in the streets that tourists usually visit.
Conflicts also occur later with police using their sticks to fight.
A few hours later a pro-independence group chanted "Don't forget, there is no forgiveness" facing a Unionist protester shouting, "Life in Spain."
Fourteen people received treatment for minor injuries in the protests, local media reported.
Tensions remain high in the independence region a year after the October 1 vote was deemed illegal by Madrid but welcomed by Catalan separatists.
Voters voted as a whole to be free, although the percentage of voteouts is low with those opposed to largely boycotting the vote.
Catalan authorities said nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop elections taking place at polling stations across the region in a violent battle.
A pro-independence group camped on Friday to prevent demonstrations supporting the country's police.
The demonstration took place but had to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended a separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer hoped for Catalonia's prospect of independence.
"Last year we went through one of the best moments of our lives.
I saw my parents cry with joy for being able to vote but now we're stuck," he said.
Although management is important if approaching a victory in regional elections last December, the Catalan pro-independence party has struggled to maintain this year's momentum with its many well-known leaders either in exile or in jail to wait for a hearing for their role in organizing a referendum and declaring independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, recorded a protest against police support on his phone, saying the conflict had been voiced by politicians on both sides.
"She's getting tighter," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in prison before the trial since the end of last year, announced he would contest in next year's European Parliament election.
"Competing as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to condemn the regression in the values of democracy and oppression that we see from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Man arrested after house hit by car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after the same car crashed into a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 19:30 BST.
Det Insp Bob Blemmings said the damage was caused by the door and the building itself.
A crossover may have also fired a shot at the car at one time.
Menga's attack gave Livingston a 1-0 win over the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston wins
Livingston's rise surprised the Rangers to surrender Steven Gerrard to a second defeat in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's attack proved different when Gary Holt's troops moved with Hibernians in second place.
Gerrard's team remain without a win in the Premiership this season and are ahead of the Heads of Hearts, which they will trail with eight points, next Sunday.
Previously, the Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, extended the run without a loss in this part to six games, with head coach Holt still feeling a loss since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston missed a chance against the opponents.
Holt's team was supposed to be far ahead before scoring goals, with their involvement causing the Rangers to face all the trouble.
Scott Robinson broke it but gave up his effort to pass the goal, but Alan Lithgow could only give up his effort after sneaking into Craig Halkett's trap.
The hosts are eager to let the Rangers play in front of them, realizing they can give problems to the opponents with a set piece.
And that’s how important goals are.
The Rangers conceded a free kick and Livingston opened the curtain, Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined to set Menga, who took the touch and net of goals from the center of the box.
At that stage, the Rangers had mastered possession but had found home defenses that could not break through goalkeeper Liam Kelly for the most part no problem,
The pattern continued into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced to save Kelly.
Scott Pittman was rejected by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow scoring from another Livingston match.
Crosses continued to enter the Livingston box and continue to clean up, while two penalty claims - after Halket's challenge to replace Glenn Middleton, and one for handball - went away.
'Phenomena' from Livingston - analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
Outstanding performance and results for Livingston.
For men, they are very brilliant, continuing to exceed expectations on this upward trajectory.
The style of the game and their staff have hardly changed since returning to the top ranks, but a huge credit has had to go to Holt for him to launch the team since he came.
He has a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett was very brave, creating a regular great defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall all over his toes.
Rangers aren't inspired, though.
Good as they are sometimes under Gerrard, they fall far from that standard.
The last ball was somewhat lacking - only once they cut off the host team - and it was a call for the Rangers to wake up, who found themselves in the middle table.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an received a wide variety of welcomes in Cologne.
There was a smile and blue sky on Saturday (September 29) as the Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - aimed at improving relations with NATO allies.
They discussed issues including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's participation in the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to open a new giant mosque.
The city is the largest residential area outside of Turkey.
Police cited security reasons to block 25,000 strong people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many nearby supporters wanted to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters — most of them Kurds — also made their voices heard, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
The defence of the war described the part of a visitor who was praised as a hero by some Turks and fired as an autocrat by others.
Deptford Highway Accident: Bicyclist Died in a Car Accident
A cyclist died in an accident involving a train in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, south-east of the airport, around 10:15 BST.
The driver stopped and the paramedic came, but the man died at the scene.
The incident came months after another cyclist died in a runway on Childers Street, about a stone from Saturday's crash.
The Metropolitan Police said the officer was trying to identify the man and informed his successor.
Road closures and bus rides in places and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured in riots
Six prison officials were injured in a disturbance in a man's high-security prison, the prison official said.
The disruption occurred at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 09:30 BST on Sunday and was ongoing.
A "Tornado" specialist has been brought in to deal with the disturbance, which involved eight residents and had one wing.
Officers have been treated for minor facial injuries at the scene.
A spokesman for the Prison Service said: "Trained prison staff have been assigned to deal with the ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six members of the staff were treated for injuries.
We don't resist the surge of violence in our prisons, and obviously they are responsible for referring to the police and can spend more time behind bars."
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 detainees, including some of the most dangerous offenders in the country.
In June he was reported to the prison governor receiving hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year delinquent officials were called to jail to deal with a serious disturbance in which staff were attacked with a pool ball.
Pink Hurricane Threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City With Lightning Floods (The Smell Area Benefits)
It's rare for tropical depression to hit Arizona, but that's what may happen next week when the wind gusts of Hurricane Rosa crosses the Desert Southwest, the risk of flash flooding.
The National Weather Service has issued flash flooding hours for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take her way up to Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching late last night with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted in a tweet only "ten white tropical beetles remain stormy or depressed status within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a typhoon within 40 miles of the AZ border."
The latest model of the National Hurricane Center predicted 2 to 4 inches of rainfall to fall, with the amount remotely up to 6 inches in the Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Other areas in the Desert Southwest including the center of the Rockies and the Great Basin will probably get 1 to 2 inches, with the amount remote to possibly 4 inches.
For them from the risk of lightning flooding, Rosa's rains may have been graceful since the region was drenched with drought.
While flooding is a serious concern, some rainfall will benefit since the Southwest is now experiencing arid conditions.
According to the U.S. Smell Monitoring, more than 40 percent of Arizona suffers from the worst drought, the second highest category, "reported by weather.com.
First, the Hurricane Rosa route leads to land on the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, having the force of a Sunday morning typhoon with a maximum wind of 85 miles an hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moves north by 12 miles an hour.
Storms face cold waters in the Pacific and therefore produce a downturn.
Therefore, he is expected to land collapse in Mexico at the strength of a tropical storm in the evening or evening on Monday.
The rains throughout Mexico can be heavy, causing a huge flood risk.
"The amount of rainfall is expected from 3 to 6 inches from Baja California to northwestern Sonora, so maybe 10 inches," reports weather.com.
Rosa will track north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, then will detect through Arizona and south Utah by late Tuesday night.
“The main expected danger from Rosa or the cracks is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and U.S. Southwest desert,” the National Hurricane Center said.
The rain is expected to produce life-threatening flash floods and debris flows in the desert, and land collapses in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Attempts to Kill
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old man was found injured in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, about 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital where he remained in a "stable" condition.
A 17-year-old man, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested last night in the Radstock, Avon and Somerset areas, police said.
Officers appeal to those who may have a cell phone record about what's going on ahead.
Trump Says Kavanaugh 'Suffers, Doesn't Mean, Angry' Democratic Party
"Judge Kavanaugh's vote is a vote to reject cruel and excessive tactics in the Democratic Party," Trump said at a meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had been "very bad, angry" for the Democratic Party throughout its candidacy process.
Kavanaugh gave an explanation before Congress on Thursday, firmly and resolutely denying the accusations of Christine Blasey Ford she sexually assaulted at a time of adolescence.
Ford also gave an explanation at the hearing about his accusations.
The president said on Saturday "the American people saw the excellence and quality and courage" of Kavanaugh on that day.
"One vote to approve Judge Kavanaugh is to vote to confirm one of the most successful legislative minds of the time, a lawyer who has a brilliant record in public service," he told the people who support West Virginia.
The president simultaneously referred to Kavanaugh's candidacy when discussing the importance of Republican elections in general elections.
"Five more weeks, one of the important elections in our lives.
I didn’t run, but I really ran,” he said.
"That's why I'm in a place fighting for a great candidate."
Trump argues that the Democrats are on a mission to "oppose and prevent."
The first major procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's appointment is expected to be held no later than Friday, the right-wing leadership of the GOP has told CNN.
Hundreds killed in earthquake in Indonesia, tsunami, with toll numbers rising
At least 384 people were killed, many were swept away by giant waves that crashed on the coast, when an earthquake and a major tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach celebration in the town of Palu on Friday when a six-metre (18-foot) wave landed on land at twilight, sweeping away many deaths and destroying anything in their way.
The tsunami was followed by an earthquake of 7.5 magnitude.
"When the tsunami threat emerged yesterday, people were still doing activities on the beach and didn't run and eventually they became victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's disaster arrest agency BNPB said in a statement in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come by itself, it dragged cars, bullets, houses, it attacked them all on land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had crossed the open sea at a speed of 800 kph (497 mph) before a strike on the edge.
Some people climb trees to escape the tsunami and survive, he said.
About 16,700 people have been transferred to 24 centres in Palu.
The aerial images issued by the disaster agency show many buildings and shops destroyed, bridges rotated and collapsed and a mosque surrounded by water.
The end riots continued to rock the city on the beach on Saturday.
Several tremors are felt in the area with 2.4 million inhabitants.
Indonesia's Agency for the Study and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by a strong earthquake last Friday was about 200 times more than the atomic bomb power dropped in Hiroshima in World War II.
The city, located at the end of a long and narrow bay, may have increased the size of the tsunami wave, the agency said.
Nugroho described the destruction as “expanding” and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
He said the bodies of the victims were found trapped under the ruins of the building and said another 540 people were injured and 29 others were still missing.
Nugroho said the casualties and destruction could be more severe along the 300 km (190 miles) coastline north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is close to the earthquake center.
"The communication was completely cut off without any information from Donggala," Nugroho said.
"About 300,000 residents live there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that their staff and volunteers were heading for the affected area.
"It's a tragedy but it can get even worse," the Red Cross said.
The agency was heavily criticized on Saturday for not informing that the tsunami had hit Palu even though officials said the tsunami occurred within a period of warning issued.
In an amateur video swirling on social media, a man's voice on top of the building was heard screaming at people on the street about the tsunami's presence.
Within minutes, a tsunami wave swept over the coast and pulled together buildings and trains.
Reuters cannot confirm the authenticity of the video.
The earthquake and tsunami resulted in a large power leak that cut off communications around Palu and this made it easier for authorities to carry out search efforts.
The military has sent aid by cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities but the displaced population is still in need of food and other basic needs, authorities said.
The airport has been reopened for relief efforts only and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the transfer center in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has increased to 800 people.
It's very bad.
While the World Vision staff from Donggala had made it to the city of Palu, they were through the scene of the disaster. Workers were sheltered under tarpaulins set up in the front yard of their office in Palu, Mr. Doseba said.
"They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed," he said.
It's very bad.
Although aid forces began to provide disaster relief in a grim atmosphere, some say foreign aid workers with deep experience were prevented from heading to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, the financing, supply of supplies and the delivery of workers from abroad can only be carried out if the disaster area is declared a disaster zone of the country.
That still hasn't happened.
"It's still a disaster at the regional level," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says, 'OK, it's a state disaster,' then we can receive help from abroad but for the time being there is no status."
When the second night of the Palu after the earthquake and tsunami last Friday, friends and families of the missing victims hope that the person they love will be a miracle that appears and excite them from feeling sad.
On Saturday, a slave was found in the shed.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman's victim trapped under a rock ruin for two days with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the head coach of the Indonesian launch team, has trained two paratroopers who were missing as a result of the earthquake for the Asian Games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Among the people trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel were his students, Mr Mandagi said.
"As a senior in the field of launchers, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr Gendon told how he was seriously sending WhatsApp messages to participants of the launchers in Palu who attended the beach festival after hours of news about the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel spread among the launchers community.
The message sent has only one grey line marking compared to two blue line markings.
"I don't think the message came," he said.
Thieves rob $26,750 while recharging ATMs in Newport on the Levee
The thief stole $26,750 from a Brink employee who filled the money at the Newport on the Levee ATM on Friday, according to news released by the Newport Police Department.
The Brink employee emptied the ATM at the entertainment complex and was willing to send more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a press release.
While Brink’s worker was busy performing his duties, a man ‘runns to his back’ and steals a bag full of money.
Witnesses saw several suspects flee the scene based on the report, but police did not say how many people were involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information about the alleged thief needs to contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rap singer changed his name to Ye
Rap singer Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
Announcing a change of name on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "This man is officially known as Kanye West."
Kanye West, 41, was named Ye for an instant and she used the name as the title of her eighth album, which was released in June.
The change came when he appeared in the Saturday Night Live show where he is expected to release his latest album Yandhi.
"He replaced singer Ariana Grande who canceled her appearance in the plan over 'emotional issues,'" the plan's creator said.
Previously, Kanye West said the name had religious significance and was also an abbreviation for his professional name now.
"I believe 'yes' is a common word that is often found in the Gospel book and it means 'you,'" Kanye West said earlier this year when discussing the title of his album with the Big Boy radio host.
"So I'm you too. I'm us too. We're us.
It shifted from Kanye which meant only one, to Ye - an image of the judgment of our goodness, our evil and our error and all.
The album is more than just our own image."
She was one of the famous rap singers who changed her name.
Sean Combs is known by various names such as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy but this year he announced that he prefers with the names Love and Brother Love.
Former partner Kanye West, JAY-Z can also accept it without or with a simple sign and capital letters.
Mexico's President, AMLO vows not to use military action against civilians
Mexico's president-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed not to use military action against civilians as the country nears its 50th anniversary of the bloody retaliation of students.
AMLO vowed at the Plaza Tlatelolco on Saturday to "never use the military to curb Mexicans."
The military fired at civilians holding a peaceful demonstration on the square on October 2, 1968, which had caused 300 civilians to die while the left-wing student movement began marching across Latin America.
AMLO vows to support young Mexicans by giving monthly subsidies to those studying and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and the lack of educational opportunities attract young people to engage in criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double the amount of artificial intelligence.
"America should double the amount of funding in the field of artificial intelligence as China becomes more active in that field," said Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The view was expressed after the U.S. government made an announcement about artificial intelligence even though the U.S. itself as a whole lacked an official artificial intelligence strategy.
China, meanwhile, introduced its plan last year with the aim of becoming the number one in artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
"Supporting the provision of artificial intelligence studies is a good start given that all other countries are far behind the United States and we want to achieve the next success in artificial intelligence," Lee said.
"Doubling the funds could increase the chances of the next big achievement of artificial intelligence (AI) in the United States," Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee's book 'AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and New World Order' was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcout, CEO of Sinovation Ventures who has invested in one of China's well-known companies, Face<0x2B><0x2B>.
In the 1980s, he attempted an artificial intelligence system that had defeated American Othello players who were in the best position while still studying at Carnegie Mellon University. Later, he became executive at Microsoft Research and president of the Google branch of China.
Lee recognizes previous U.S. government technology matches such as the Robot Challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency and wants to know when the next match will be held so he can identify new talents.
"Researchers in the United States usually need to work hard in order to win government aid," Lee said.
"It's not China that takes on academic leaders but corporate companies," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have identified the great talents of the university to work in artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee said the change in immigration policy could also help the United States support its artificial intelligence efforts.
"I think green cards should be offered automatically to PhD graduates in artificial intelligence," he said.
China's state council issued the Future Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
"The National Science Foundation of China provides funding to people in academic institutions. It equates the way the National Science Foundation and other government organizations allocate funding to U.S. researchers but the academic quality of work in China is lower," Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense set up a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence that aims to gather partners from industry and academia. The White House announced the row of Selected Committees for Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
The NSF invests more than $100 million annually in AI research.
Meanwhile, the rank of U.S. law that seeks to establish the National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence seen has not been implemented in the past few months.
Macedonians have voted to change the country's name
Macedonians held a vote on Sunday to determine the change of name to ‘North Macedonia’. An action that will resolve a dispute with Greece that has been resolved for a decade in which Greece has prevented Macedonia from joining the European Union (EU) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
Greece, which has its own territory called Macedonia, asserts that the name ‘Macedonia’ represents a claim to its territory and has vetoed to reject Macedonia’s membership in NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached agreement on a proposed name change in June, but nationalist opponents said the change undermined the ethnic identity of Macedonia whose majority of the population is Slavic.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the ballot and the start raised doubts as to whether the ballot would reach the minimum of 50 percent of the ballot required for the ballot to be valid.
The question on the ballot paper was: "Do you agree to join NATO and the EU with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev said: "Receiving a new name is a price worth paying to join the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the fall of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country and for young people in Macedonia so that they can live freely under the European Union because that means our lives are safer," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79 in Skopje.
Although it is not legal on the side of the law, parliamentarians say they will comply with the ballot decision to make it final.
The change of name requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state election commission said there were no reports of things that did not come into effect until 1 p.m.
However, voter turnout was 16 percent compared to 34 percent in the 2016 parliamentary election after 66 percent of registered voters cast ballot papers.
"I came to vote for my children. Our place in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife and their son Dushko cast ballot papers in Macedonia for the change of country name that will pave the way for Macedonia to join NATO and the EU in Strumica, Macedonia on September 30, 2018.
In front of parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was setting up a small stage and placing chairs in front of the tent set up by people boycotting the referendum.
"We want to join NATO and the EU but we want to join it with pride and not through this way," Kavadarkov said.
"We're poor people, but we're poor.
If they don't want to see us as Macedonians, we can turn to China and Russia and become part of the Euro-Asian integration."
Zaev said the participation in NATO would provide enough investment to Macedonia where its unemployment rate exceeds 20 percent.
I believe the vast majority will accept because more than 80 percent of our population elects the EU and NATO," Zaev said after casting the vote.
He said the “yes” decision was “a confirmation of our future.”
A poll was published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Police Studies that said between 30 and 43 percent of voters would take part in the polls - below the required number.
Another poll, run by Macedonian TV Telma, found that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
For a successful voter turnout, the number of voters coming must be 50 per cent plus one vote.
Failure in the ballot will be considered the first serious blow to the pro-Western government police since taking over in May last year.
Watch: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City navigates across the entire Brighton defensive line to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling were sent off as Brighton's defense at Manchester City and won 2-0 on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made him look very happy on his network in the 65th minute.
The Argentine attackers received a broadcast in the middle of the field at the beginning of the order.
He raced between three Brighton defenses, before cutting into the open field.
Then Aguero finds himself surrounded by four green-blooded players.
He refused a defense before chasing a few more at the edge of the Brighton box.
Then he refused to send to the left, looking for Sterling.
The forward uses his first touch inside the box to send the ball back to Aguero, who used his right butt to kill Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with one shot to the right of the net.
"Aguero is struggling with his leg problems," City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about him playing 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he scored at the time."
But Sterling gave the Sky Blues an early lead in the Premier League match.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the inside ball in the Brighton area at the match.
He made a beautiful ball pass through the left wing to Leroy Sane.
Sane took a few touches before leading Sterling towards the far position.
The Sky Blues forward kicked the ball into the net before sliding out of the limit.

Scherzer just wants to play against the Rockies.
With the Nationals being kicked out of the playoffs, there's not much reason to force another start.
But the highly-competitive Scherzer hopes to face the fort on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there is a play-out implication for the Rockies, who hold one game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West.
The Rockies embraced at least a special opportunity spot with 5-2 wins over the Nationals on Friday night, but were still looking to lock down their first division champions.
"Although we're just playing, at least we can know the atmosphere in Denver with the people and the other teams will probably play at the highest level I'm going to face this year.
Why don't I want to compete in that?"
The Nationals have not yet announced a newcomer for Sunday, but reportedly tend to allow Scherzer to make a comeback in this situation.
Scherzer, who will make the start of the 34th, holds a body-warming session on Thursday and will make a swing on his usual rest day on Sunday.
The midfielder using Washington's right hand was 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikes right in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump's meeting in West Virginia
The president by indirectly referring to the situation around the High Court elected Brett Kavanaugh while talking about the importance of the number of Republicans coming to the midterm elections.
"Everything we've done will be at risk in November.
Five more weeks to face the most important elections in our lives.
I don't compete but I'm very competitive and that's why I'm everywhere fighting for a great candidate," he said.
Trump added, "You see this bad Democratic radical group, you see it's happening right now.
And they really want to take back power by using whatever method, you see atrocities, crimes.
They don't care who they hurt, who they need to lash out to gain power and control; what they want is power and control, we won't give it to them."
Democrats, he said, are on a mission to ‘reject and block.’
“And you’ve seen it for the last four days,” he said, calling Democrats “angry, evil and untrue.”
He referred the Senate Judiciary Committee to Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein by name, who had received a powerful boo from attendees.
"Do you remember his answer?
You're leaking the documents?
Uh, uh, apa.
No, I’m waiting for one — it’s the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
The church is no longer a large church.
They are intolerant of anyone who expresses their views.
When a momentum activist in my local party voted to criticize me, he didn't play.
After all, I was the latest in the line of AP Labor was told that we were not welcomed - all because of our voiced views.
My colleague Joan Ryan received almost the same treatment because she was anti-Jewish.
In my case, the whistle-blower movement has criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
In the interest of responsibility for the economic policy, about national security, about Europe, whose irony is almost the same issue as what Jeremy did not agree with the previous leader.
A note for the Nottingham East Labour Party on Friday said that "we want a meeting that encompasses everything and is productive."
For nearly eight years as a local Labour AP, the GC meeting on Friday night really covered all of that.
Sadly today, it is not the tone for many meetings and the political promise of ‘better, softer’ has long been forgotten if, indeed, it ever began.
It is becoming more and more obvious that differences of opinion are unacceptable in the Labour party and any opinion will be judged whether it is accepted by the party's leadership.
It started shortly after Jeremy became the leader, as a former co-worker, I thought sharing a political view that was almost the same began to expect me to make the U round and take a position that I would not agree with - whether on national security or the EU single market.
When I speak outside - and it doesn't matter what I say - then I will be followed with criticism for abuse on social media, ordered not to vote, denounced the political center, sent me out of the Labour party.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I know I'm more fortunate than my colleagues because of my comments on politics.
I am impressed by the professional attitude and endurance of my fellow employees who swear sexist insults and homosexuality every day but never give up.
One aspect of the political disappointment of this era is how the rate of perpetrators has become accustomed.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn demanded that the Labour party cultivate cultural tolerance.
The fact is that we are no longer a broad church and with every ‘disbelief’ proposal or change in election rules, the party becomes ever narrower.
I’ve received a lot of advice since two years ago urging me to keep quiet, not too prominent and then I’ll ‘be good.’
But that’s not my goal to get into politics.
Since I joined Labor 32 years ago as a school pupil, awakened by Thatcher's government neglect that left my entire grade class ruined, I've been trying to lead a better public service for those in great need - whether as a local councillor or a government minister.
I never hid my politics, including in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East may be mistaken about my position and the part of the dispute with the leadership right now.
To those who support the proposal on Friday, what I want to say is that when the country rejects Brexit, it will ruin our households, businesses and public services, I don't understand the feeling of wasting my time and energy on loyalty to the leader of the Labour party.
But the only message I have is not to Nottingham Momentum, it is to my voters, whether a Labourer or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise an unelected pledge or political adequacy does not prevent me from acting in what I believe is in your interest.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: The unmatched Ayr climbs to the top
Two slow attempts may make a secluded final decision, but without a doubt Ayr deserves success in this exciting and entertaining Premiership Tennent match.
They are now at the top of the table, the only one who has never lost 10 people.
Finally, their superior defense, as much as they took the chance, made the host team and coach Peter Murchie happy.
"We've been tested for our game so far, and we're still unbeatable, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "Congratulations to Ayr, they took a better chance than us."
Grant Anderson made the attempt in the 14th minute, conversion by Frazier Climo, putting Ayr in front, but, the yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, issued for the match by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to make the net and Jason Baggot catch the non-conversion attempt.
Climo preceded Ayr with a penalty, before, at half-time, he got an eye then a solo conversion attempt to make 17-5 to Ayr at rest.
But Melrose started second place well and Patrick Anderson's attempt, converted by Baggot, reduced the gap to five points.
There was a long delay due to the serious injury of Ruairidh Knott, which was brought out, and from the start, Ayr went on again through Stafford McDowall's attempt, a conversion by Climo.
The bride of captain Ayr Blair Macpherson was then given a yellow card, and once again, Melrose retaliated the additional player with an attempt not to convert Bruce Colvine, at the end of a fierce time of pressure.
The host team returned, however, and when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card due to Climo's tackle without the ball, from the penalty line, MacPherson broke behind hit Ayr's forward.
Climo conversion, as he did almost like a restart, after Kyle Rowe picked up David Armstrong's box kick and sent far flanker Gregor Henry for the host's fifth try.
Stars Still Games seen are ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran was seen to be ready to move into the hospitality industry after he was named director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old played Jack Jarvis in the BBC's famous show, where he wrote and starred alongside longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The pair have announced that the upcoming ninth series is the last in the series, and it looks like Kiernan is planning a lifetime after Craiglang.
According to the official record, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although a Scottish Sun source gave a shadow that Kiernan wanted to engage in a 'advanced restaurant business.'
'The ocean is ours': Bolivia surrounded by mainland hopes court will reopen its path to the Pacific
The Marine Corps's headquarters in La Paz.
The common building spreads the blue flag of the sea.
The naval base from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon is complicated by the motto: 'The ocean is really ours.
Recovering is a responsibility."
Throughout Bolivia encircled the mainland, the memory of losing the coast to Chile in bloody conflict in the 19th century is still clear - as one yearning to sail the Pacific Ocean once again.
The hope is perhaps the highest in this century, as Bolivia is still awaiting a ruling from the International Court of Justice on October 1st after five years of talks.
"Bolivia has momentum, a spirit of unity and tranquility, and of course hope for a positive decision," said Roberto Calzadilla, Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the ICJ's decision on a large screen across the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will back Bolivia's demand - after multiple discussions - Chile is required to negotiate to give Bolivia a sovereign exit into the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic native president - who faces controversy over next year's re-election pile - also had a lot of interest in Monday's decision.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he vowed in late August.
But some analysts believe that the court will not make a decision in favour of Bolivia - and if it happens little will change very much.
The Netherlands-based UN agency has no authority to award the area to Chile, and has set out that it will not determine a decision for possible talks.
Regarding the ICJ's decision to come out only after six months of final arguments are heard showing the case is "uncomplicated," said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, Chile's international law expert.
And not to slow down Bolivia's policy any more, for these four years there may be a hindrance.
"The Jesus for the way into the sea has been robbed by the Bolivian administration now," Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
Morales' rhetorical hostility has reduced Chile's little mercy, he suggests.
Bolivia and Chile at one point will continue to talk, but it will be too difficult to hold a discussion afterwards.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former president Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that made the court's decision usually quick.
Monday will bring Bolivia "a great opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "end the 139-year dispute for the common good," he said.
Calzadilla also denies that Morales - still one of Latin America's most famous presidents - used maritime issues as political aid.
"Bolivia has never violated its right to have a direct route to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"This decision is an opportunity to see that we need to forget the past."
North Korea says nuclear weapons won't happen unless it trusts the U.S.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his country would not carry out their nuclear weapons first if it did not trust Washington.
Ri was speaking on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He asked the United States to deliver on the promises made during a summit in Singapore between rival leaders.
His comments come as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to want to restart nuclear diplomacy that was halted more than three months after Singapore with Kim Jong Un from North Korea.
Ri said it was “only a dream” that continued restrictions and U.S. opposition to the declaration that ending the Korean War would cause North Korea to surrender.
Washington is careful to agree to a declaration without Pyongyang first making important arms actions.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread doubt that Pyongyang is serious about launching weapons that are seen as the only way to guarantee its country's security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month for preparations for the second Kim-Trump summit.
The Paris Fashion Show introduces the latest major head decoration designs on its way to the main street nearby.
If you want to add your hat collection or block sunlight completely, then you don't have to look far.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveil a variety of large-sized odd head decorations for their SS19 collection on stage that matched the style set at Paris Fashion Week.
The impractical hat has wiped out Instagram this summer and this designer has sent their in-person designs to the stage.
The design that stands out by Valentino is a great water-yellow hat decorated with a thick ribbon feather that wide covers the model's head.
Other large-sized accessories include jewelry-decorated pottery, smart hats and even chicks - but it's not designed to make your head hot.
Thom Browne also reveals a strange mask choice - and the right time for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks have been sewn on her lips and are more like Hannibal Lecter than fashionable.
One design resembles scuba diving equipment equipped with snorkel and gogal, while another looks like a liquid ice cream cone.
And if you continue with the reality of great fashion - you're in luck.
A style watcher predicts a very large bonnet may be heading to the main road near you.
A large hat is warmer than 'La Bomba', a two-foot-wide straw hat has been seen worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The label king behind the very impractical hat has been lined up on social media sending another big design to the stage - a straw beach bag almost as big as the model wearing a bathrobe.
The razor-coloured rafia bag is on fire, decorated with ribbed rafia and added with a white holder, which stands out in the Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection in Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity style expert Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect to be able to see large hats and beach bags arrive on the main road for the summer to come - because designers have made a huge impact and it's difficult to let the demand for large-sized accessories."
John Edward: Language skills are very important for global citizens
Scottish private schools maintain a record of achievement for academic excellence, and this has continued in 2018 with another set of excellent exam decisions, reinforced by individuals and collective successes in sports, arts, music and other community endeavors.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, the school, represented by the Scottish Private Schools Board (SCIS), strives to provide the best service to their students and parents.
The goal of private schools is to prepare their students to pursue higher education, careers of their choice, and their place as global citizens.
As the education sector they can and implement earlier school curricula, we see the modern language continues to be well-known and the subject of the yamg choice is desired within the school.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you speak to someone in a language they understand, it will get into their head.
If you speak to him in his mother’s language, it will enter his heart.”
This is a strong warning that we can't just rely on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From this year's exam decision, we can see which language is the top subject in the league schedule with the highest graduation rate in private schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who learn a foreign language get a higher A grade.
This data, collected from 74 SCIS school members, showed 72 percent of students got a higher grade of A in Mandarin, while 72 percent of them studied German, 69 percent of them studied French and 63 percent of them studied Spanish also got an A.
This shows that private schools in Scotland support foreign language as an important skill that children and young people will no doubt need in the future.
Language now, as a subject of choice, is being held in the same way as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in private school curricula and elsewhere.
A survey by the UK Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 found the reasons employers struggle to fill the gap, 17 percent attributed to a lack of language skills.
That's why language skills become essential to preparing young people for their future careers.
With more prospective job opportunities requiring language, these skills are crucial in this global world.
Regardless of a person's career choice, if they learn a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future by having lifelong skills like this.
Being able to communicate directly with people from a foreign country will put someone who masters many languages automatically ahead of the competition.
According to a YouGov poll of more than 4,000 UK adults in 2013, 75 percent should not speak a foreign language well enough for conversation, with French as a conversational language used by only two digits of a percentage, 15 percent.
This is why investing in language teaching is important for today's children.
Having a variety of languages, especially countries that are building their economies, will equip children with better opportunities in finding meaningful jobs.
In Scotland, each school will be different in the language they learn.
Some schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are seen to be very important for the UK when looking ahead in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child is interested in, there are always a lot of languages to choose from within private schools, with expert teachers in the area.
Scotland's private schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills necessary to succeed, whatever happens in the future.
It is undeniable at this time, in a global business environment, that language continues to be very important to the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern language should be considered as ‘international communication skills.’
Private schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
We have to do it right.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Private Schools Council
LeBron will make the Lakers' first appearance on Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans who want to see LeBron James make his first start for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the opening match before the season on Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
The number of minutes he will play has not yet been determined.
"It will be more than one and less than 48 minutes," Walton said on Lakers' official website.
Lakers whistleblower Mike Trudell noted that James may be playing in a limited minute.
Following training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for a six-game schedule before the Lakers season.
"I don't need a game before the season to be ready at this stage of my career," he said.
Trump meeting time in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump launched a rush-to-meeting campaign tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It was Trump’s first of five gatherings scheduled for next week, including a stop at friendly venues including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With a confirmation vote held for him to elect to fill the vacancy in the Federal Court, Trump aims to gain support for the upcoming midterm election as Republicans risk losing control of Congress when the vote is decided in November.
What time is Trump meeting in West Virginia tonight and how do you watch online?
Trump's rally at Wheeling in West Virginia is scheduled at 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia online via live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to handle this week's trial for Federal Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who has become tense over allegations of sexual misconduct with Senate vote confirmation expected to be held for a week during an FBI investigation.
But the main goal of this hasty assembly is to help Republicans gain momentum in the face of the November election.
President Trump's campaign said the five meetings in the coming week were an incentive "to empower volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and develop the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"Congress control is so critical to his agenda that the president will go to as many countries as possible in our country towards a busy campaign season," a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
Scheduled at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, this evening's gathering can bring supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and draw coverage from the Pittsburgh media," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state he wanted more than 40 percent of the time in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is running for president in the election.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey so the president needs to come to support him," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
The 2018 Ryder Cup: U.S. forces show courage to fight in ensuring there is still hope for a single match on Sunday
After three heavy matches aside, the corner-back match on Saturday evening was probably what Ryder Cup needed this time.
Swinging momentum is a sporting concept that is one creation but it is really trusted by players, and even more profoundly in games like this.
Where's the momentum now?
"They have six points and now it's four points, so we're bringing a little momentum, I think," Jordan Spieth said as he walked at the end of the day.
Europe certainly has the advantage, four eyes ahead with twelve more to catch.
American players, as Spieth says, feel they have a bit of an edge and a sense of encouragement, not just from Spieth and Justin Thomas who play together all day and each has three out of four points.
Spieth showcases the game from the beginning to the green area and is an example to other players.
The lively urge was getting louder as he continued to run, doing an important stroke to balance the four eyes when he and Thomas were left behind after two eyes.
His sluggish blow that gave them a victory on the 15th hole was greeted with the same cheer, which tells you that he believes the American forces are still fighting.
"You just have to work harder and worry about your own fight," Spieth said.
That’s all there is for all of these players right now.
18 holes to show the power.
Only two players with more points than Spieth and Thomas since the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the story in the irrefutable Ryder Cup.
The players are different characters from Europe but they have four out of four eyes and don't seem to make any mistakes.
"Moliwood" is the only couple that doesn't do the bogies on Saturday afternoons, but they also avoid the bogies on Saturday mornings, Friday evenings and the last nine holes on Friday mornings.
That period and the way they are given and shown by supporters is proof they are players to be shot on Sunday, and no more popular player to block the possibility of European wins at sunset at Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
It's best to have them both in different holes.
However, the conversation about the European team's victory was too early.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson facilitated the work of Sergio Garcia, the hero of four players this morning, when he was compared to Alex Noren.
One bogus and two doubles in the first nine holes made the Spanish and the Swedish players hilarious.
However, on Sundays, no one can help you.
Four balls and four players are very interesting to watch more closely due to the interaction between the pair, the advice given and not given and the strategies that can change in a flash.
Europe has played better as a team so far and is ahead of the last day but these four sessions also show the U.S. forces have the courage that has previously been challenged by many parties, including local fans.
The European team went 10-6 towards the last day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe brought a comfortable edge on the last day of the Ryder Cup after rising from a four-ball and four-player match with 10-6 points over the United States.
Both great players, Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari ahead with two wins over the struggling Tiger Woods to bring their victory at Le Golf National to four points.
The European team led by Thomas Bjorn sought to maintain the trophies seized at Hazeltine two years ago, overtaking the American team in the wrong four-ball morning session, with a 3-1 series point.
The U.S. team gave more competition in a four-player game, winning two matches, but could not close the gap.
Jim Furyk's team needed 8 points out of 12 points in Sunday's singles match to maintain the trophy.
Fleetwood was the first new European player to win four consecutive points during his and Molinari, dubbed "Molliwood" after the sensational weekend was the second pair to win four points out of their four opening matches in Ryder Cup history.
After destroying Woods and Patrick Reed in a four-ball game, they then together defeated Woods and the new American player, Bryson Dechambeau in a 5–4 match.
Woods, who went through two tough matches on Saturday, showed excellence but has now lost in 19 of 29 matches four balls and four players and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who did not play during the morning four-ball session, rematched with Henrik Stenson in a four-player match to beat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka in 2&1 - occupying the world's first and third position.
Europe is unlucky on a quiet and relaxed day in the southwest of Paris.
The three-time major championship winner, Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas became the gauge for America with two points on Saturday.
They gained a 2&1 victory killing Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter of Spain in a four-ball match and then again killing Poulter and Rory McIlroy in a 4&3 match in a four-player game that was killed on two opening holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup a team that missed four points went into a singles match, although as the defending champion of the Furyk team only needed a series to maintain the trophy.
After occupying second place for two days, the retaliatory attack on Sunday looked like out of reach of them.
North Korea says 'impossible' they will voluntarily disarm without trust
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions had caused its deep distrust of the United States and it was unlikely that its country would voluntarily release nuclear weapons in the situation.
Ri Yong Ho told the world body’s annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken “important milestones” last year, such as stopping nuclear tests and guided missiles, shutting down nuclear test sites and promising not to expand the use of nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we do not see any corresponding reaction from the United States," he said.
"Without any trust in the United States, there will be no trust in the security of our country and in such a situation, it is impossible for us to disarm hardly first."
While Ri has raised complaints against North Korea over Washington's opposition to a "step-by-step" approach to a nuclear shutdown in which North Korea will be rewarded for taking step-by-step steps, the reality seems important as it does not reject the voluntary rejection as Pyongyang did in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the U.S. president and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to try to "nuclearize the Korean peninsula" while Trump gave assurances to North Korea's security.
North Korea was seeking an end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States said Pyongyang had to release its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also refused to take steps to loosen international sanctions on North Korea.
"The U.S. insists on "exit first" and increases the level of pressure in the restrictions to achieve their goals by force, and even opposes the "end of war declaration," Ri said.
"The perception that restrictions can weaken us is an empty dream of those who don't recognize us.
But the problem is the continuing restrictions that worsen our sense of disbelief."
Ri did not mention the plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leader was concerned about at a United Nations conference earlier this week.
The minister only mentioned three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Kim Jae-in over the past five months and added: "If the parties to this termination issue were South Korea and not the US, the nuclear termination of the Korean peninsula would not find a halt."
However, Ri's tone of voice differed dramatically from last year, when he told the U.N. General Assembly that targeting large U.S. ground with North Korea's rockets was unavoidable after "Evil President" Trump named Kim a rocket man" in a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations conference, Trump, who last year threatened to "fully destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking steps to disarm, but said much work still needed to be done and sanctions needed to remain in place until the North's program ended.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time limit for this, saying "If it takes two years, three years or five months - it doesn't matter."
China and Russia have argued that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council: "The Security Council's enforcement of sanctions must continue with seriousness and without failure until we feel a complete, definitive and confirmed nuclear cessation."
The Security Council has voted to increase the sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in an effort to dismantle the financing of Pyongyang's nuclear-guided missile and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri outside the UN General Assembly and said he would then visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not go smoothly.
He left Pyongyang in July saying progress had been made, only for North Korea within hours after he had condemned him for making "gangster-like demands."
North Korea pledged in a meeting with Moon this month to expose the site of guided missiles and also nuclear complexes if the United States takes "appropriate steps."
He said Kim had told him that the "same steps" that Kim was looking for was a security guarantee that Trump had promised in Singapore and headed towards normal relations with Washington.
Harvard students have taken courses to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has given all its students more sleep in an effort to fight an increasingly caffeine-based learning culture.
A teacher finds students at the number one university in the world often can't understand the basics of taking care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and an expert at Brigham and Women's Hospital, provided the course he believed was the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a lecture on the effects of sleep deprivation during learning.
“At the end of the course, a girl came to me and said, ‘Why am I just being told about this now, in my senior year?’
He said no one ever told him about the importance of sleep - and that surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course was introduced for the first time this year, explaining to students the need for good sleep habits to help academic and sports performance, as well as improving their well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the university's executive director of health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after finding its students to be sleep deprived throughout the week.
The one-hour course involves several interactive tasks.
In one part, there is an image of the bedroom, where students click on coffee cups, umbrellas, coaches and books to be told about the effects of caffeine and light and how sports performance is affected by sleep deprivation, and the importance of sleep routines.
In other parts, participants were told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
A campus map with interactive icons, then encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
"We know he won't change the behavior of the students immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know - just as you have the right to know the health effects when choosing to smoke," added Prof. Czeisler.
A proud culture of 'night watch' still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students means lack of sleep is an increasingly pressing problem.
Ensuring you have enough quality sleep, it should be the student's 'secret weapon' to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said - even to avoid weight gain, because lack of sleep puts the brain into starvation mode, making it always hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student studying chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, after taking his class last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to develop the course throughout the campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all postgraduate students to complete the same learning program before joining a competitive institution.
Prof. Czeisler suggests that students should consider the use of alarm clocks before and also after sleep, and be aware of the harmful effects of 'blue light' emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can damage your circadian rhythms rather than moving, causing sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Goal Menga kills Gerrard
The Rangers suffered another defeat at the opponent's spot when Dolly Menga's net tied the weaker Steven Gerrard with a 1-0 loss at Livingston.
The Ibrox team is still looking for the first victory in the opponent's spot since the February 4-1 victory at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team gave Gerrard a second defeat in 18 games as manager to cause his team to lose eight points behind Ladbrokes Premiership's league predecessor, Hearts.
To blow up in the seventh minute before the first half of the time and the Rangers seem to have no idea to equalize the position.
With the Rangers now down to sixth place, Livingston climbed to third place and was just behind Hibernian with a goal difference.
And the Rangers may face another problem after line guard, Calum Spence is forced to be treated for a head injury after turning an object from his army area.
Gerrard made eight exchanges on his team that went to the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup after defeating Ayr.
Holt kept the same team as Livi 11 who stole one eye from the Hearts last week and he was certainly happy with the way his team played that worried their opponents at all times.
The Rangers may have mastered the game but Livingston made more attempts on the goal.
They were supposed to score just two minutes after the first touch of Menga gave Scott Pittman space through Allan McGregor's goal but the midfielder scored.
A free kick from the back of Keaghan Jacobs found captain Craig Halkett but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could only send the ball behind the goal.
The Rangers managed to regain control but it remained only hopeful in the last thirty minutes.
Alfredo Morelos felt he should be given a penalty kick in the 45th minute when he and Steven Lawless clashed but judge Steven Thomson allowed the Colombian player's appeal.
The Rangers only managed to give two tries right in the first half but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly easily knocked out Lassana Coulibaly's panda and a weak Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livi's opening goal in the 34th minute may conflict with the game's slump, no one can deny their chances.
The Rangers once again failed to advance with Jacobs' planned move.
Scott Arfield was only stiff when Declan Gallagher pitched the ball to Scott Robinson who quietly sent to Menga for an easy finish.
Gerrard made the exchange during the break by swapping Coulibaly for Ryan Kent and he almost made an immediate impression when the wingman gave the ball to Morelos but the amazing Kelly out of his area to block.
But Livingston continued to make it easier for the opposing teams to play the game they enjoyed, with Lithgow and Halket sending the broadcast away for the broadcast away.
Holt's team was supposed to widen the gap in the final rounds but McGregor held out well to deny Jacobs before Lithgow's pitching widened from a goal angle.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton won another penalty kick as he clashed with Jacobs but again Thomson didn't.
Germany: The creator of the Geiger pencil
And now, the pages of our Almanak "Morning Sunday": 30 September 1882, 136 years ago on this day, and THE DAY WHEN physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger created a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, a discovery that eventually led to a device known as the Geiger Monitor.
As the main foundation of science since then, Counter Geiger has become the backbone of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", starring unknown scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger Pengira, used to look for radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you use this earphone, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms given by the radioactivity in the minerals."
“Yeah, that sounds like it now!”
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the creation that bears his name is eternal.
New Cancer Vaccines May Teach the Immune System to 'See' Evil Cells
New cancer vaccines can teach the immune system to 'see' malignant cells and kill them
Vaccines teach the immune system to identify malignant cells as part of the treatment.
The method involved is to extract immune cells from the patient, changing them in the laboratory.
It can 'see' proteins that commonly occur in many cancer cells and then be re-injected.
The trial vaccine shows a positive outcome for patients with a wide range of cancers.
A woman is treated with a vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells, recovers from her ovarian cancer after more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from patients, changing them in the lab so they can "see" the proteins common to many types of cancers called HER2, and then re-injecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our test results show that we have a very good vaccine.”
HER2 "causes the growth of several types of cancer," including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer, Prof Berzofsky said.
The same approach to taking immune cells from patients and "teaching" them how to target cancer cells has been successful in treating types of leukemia.
Kanye West joins the Pro-Trump search, wearing a MAGA cap, after his SNL appearance.
He's not well received.
Kanye West was spotted in the studio during Saturday Night Live after a great performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would compete in 2020.
After delivering his third song that night titled Ghost Town in which he wore a ‘Make America Great’ hat, he continued to oppose the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"I asked white people many times and they said, 'How can you support Trump, he's a gay man?'
"If I was worried about gender equality, I would have moved from America a long time ago," he said.
SNL began a performance with a sketch starring Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star glimpsed Brett Kavanaugh's confession before the Senate Judiciary Committee on allegations of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it wasn't broadcast, Kanye West's footage was uploaded to social media by actor Chris Rock.
I'm not sure if Rock is trying to mock the West with the post.
Also, West has complained to the audience that he has had difficulties behind the scenes about his top.
"They beat me up behind the scenes.
They said, 'Don't go out there with that hat.'
They beat me!
Then they said, "I'm in an unimportant place," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West added, "You want to see that unimportant position?" by saying that he would "wear my superman coat, because this means you can't lead me. You want the world to move forward?
Try the love."
The comments he invited to mock at least twice of the audience and the SNL actors seemed embarrassed, Variety reported, with one there telling the publication: "The whole studio be quiet."
West has been brought in as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, where her former friend, singer Mac Miller died a few days ago.
West surprised a lot of people with the performance of the song I Love It, dressed as a Perrier Bottle.
West received the support of TPUSA's conservative leader, Candace Turner, who sent a statement: "To one of the most daring people: THE TERMS FOR YOUR CRITICS."
But a spokeswoman for the host of the talk show, Karen Hunter said West was just "becoming herself and that's great."
"But I chose NOT to reward someone (by buying his music or clothing or supporting his 'art') whom I believe to accept and share the ideologies that harm my community.
He's free.
We too," he added.
Prior to the performance, the rapper announced on Twitter that she had changed her name, saying what she is now known as "the person formerly known as Kanye West."
He was not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His friend, a rap singer, Snoop Dogg once changed his name to Snoop Lion and of course his song refers to the legendary music, Prince, which changed his name to a symbol and later also as an artist formerly known as Prince.
Accused of attempted murder in a stab at a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident happened in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is expected to be present at the Belfast Magistrate's Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington escapes toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for the sword hero Jon Snow in the medieval fantasy HBO series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor has run a stereotype of a maco hero, saying his character played on the screen means young people often feel like they need to be strong to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed "something is wrong" and questioned how to deal with the toxic masculinity problem in the <0x23>MeToo era.
Kit, who was recently married to Game of Thrones star Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted she felt "very strong" about handling the issue.
"I think it's pretty strong personally, in the present moment - where are we wrong with masculinity?" he said.
"What did we teach men when they were growing up, from the point of view of the problems we are seeing now?"
Kit believes television may be responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to its highly masculine characters.
He added: "What is natural and what is taught?
What do you teach on television, and on the streets, that makes the boys feel they need to be men like this?
I think that's one of the important questions right now - how do we change it?
"There's something wrong with young people right now."
In the interview, he also admitted he would not concede any prequels or follow-up to Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, saying he was "finished with battlefields and horses."
In November, Kit will star in a remake of the film True West by Sam Shepard, which is the story of a filmmaker and his brother, a robber.
The actor recently revealed he considered meeting his wife, Rose, to be the best thing that happened in Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife in this plan, so with that, she gave me a future family and my life started from here," he said.
Rose brings the character of Ygritte, the love of Jon Snow played by Kit, in an Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple got married in June 2018 at the estate of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are infected in the country, health officials said.
Approximately 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Most new cases are infected through sex, indicating a change from the previous one.
Typically, HIV spreads rapidly through several parts of China due to contaminated blood transfusions.
But the number of those who suffer from HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in the Yunnan region.
However, year after year, the number of HIV and AIDS patients in China has increased by 100,000 people.
The spread of HIV through sex is a serious issue in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality is no longer a crime in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be becoming more and more.
Because of the country's conservative values, the study estimates that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Most of the spread of the disease is due to insufficient sexual protection in a relationship.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV drugs as part of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies her staff leaking GOP senator data, evading 'dangerous lies' and 'conspiracy theory'
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday denounced the accusations of one of her staff who had displayed the personal information of three Republican senators on Wikipedia's law enforcement website.
The Los Angeles Democrats asserted the claim had been spread by "ultra-right wing" members and websites.
“Scams, scams and more are bad scams,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The leaked information reportedly included the home address and phone number of U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, broadcast by an unknown person at Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing of allegations of sexual misconduct against prospective Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
The leaked information came after three senators accused Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported an IP address that identified the source of the shipments associated with Waters's office and disseminated information from Waters' staff members, Hill said.
"This unfounded accusation is a fake and a lie," Waters said again.
"My staff - where their identities, personal information, and security have been compromised due to these false accusations - is at all unrelated to this information leak.
This unfounded accusation is completely false and fraudulent."
Waters' statement quickly attracted criticism online, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This murder is outrageous," Fleischer wrote.
"It shows he doesn't have the characteristics of being a Congressman.
When someone is accused of doing something they don't do, they can't be angry.
They can't resist.
You can't question the motives of the defendant.
They have to be calm."
Fleischer said while comparing Waters' reaction and Democrat criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics who appeared to be too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who fought to kill Waters in the midterm elections, also voiced his opinion on Twitter.
"It's great news if it's true," he tweeted.
In fact, Waters said his official had informed "the relevant authorities and law-enforcement entities of this false accusation.
"We will make sure the perpetrators are exposed," he said, "and they will be responsible for all their actions that can be destructive and dangerous to any and all of my staff."
Johnny English Strikes Again – The Weakest Rowan Atkinson Scam
It is now common to look for signs of Brexit in any new film with a British slang and it seems to be used for the revival of Johnny English's action-comedy fraud franchise - which began in 2003 with Johnny Engilsh and returned in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Is it a joke about how bad it is for us to become a new country's export opportunity?
Anyway, Johnny English who likes to blindfold and bored faces has the chance to ruin the situation for the second time - the name of the sign above all that he is an extensive comic creation designed for a non-English-speaking audience.
He was of course a silly secret agent who rallied strangely to diminish the glamor of Clouseau's nature, a little Mr. Bean and a musician who contributed one note to the theme song Chariots of Fire at the 2012 London Opening Ceremony.
He is also inspired by the mysterious traveller and international intelligence agent Rowan Atkinson who once appeared in the now-forgotten Barclaycard television commercial, leaving the chaos behind.
There's one or two great moments in your latest movie.
I like Johnny English approaching the helicopter while wearing medieval war clothes and fan blades attached to his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is being streamed, but his nicknames are very weak and bizarre, especially "serious" films like 007 and Mission Impossible now confidently offering comedy as their material.
The joke felt as if it was highlighted for children rather than adults, and for me Johnny English's accidental mistake was not to innovate and focus on the Atkinson films in the Bean persona.
His main premise was that Great Britain was in serious trouble.
A cyber hijacker has infiltrated Britain's secret web network, revealing the identity of all British agents on the field and disappointing the acting agent - a very small character for Kevin Eldon.
It was the last chance for a proud prime minister who was struggling with political and unpopular breakdowns: Emma Thompson gave her best with this side character Teresa May but nothing good in the script for her character.
His intelligence advisor tells him every active detective has been compromised, and he needs to call someone out of retirement.
And that means Johnny English himself, who's smart and now works as a school teacher in some fancy places, but provides unsuitable lessons to be a secret agent: some great jokes here, because English offers inventive science in academia like the School of Rock.
English was brought back to Whitehall for a moment of anxiety and reunited with his former assistant Bough, played back by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, engaged to a submarine commander, a diabolical character carried by somewhat detrimental Vicki Pepperdine.
So, Batman and Robin, caught up in the Secret Service Under Your Majesty's Duli, re-acts in the face of the beautiful seductive female character Ophelia Bulletova by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is being influenced by charismatic tech millionaires who claim he can solve Britain's computer problem: the evil Jason Volta and played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their adventures with a small task: disguised as a waiter, lighting a fire and burning a French restaurant; struggling to sniff himself into the Volta's luxury ship; and English sparks a riot when he tries to use the Mayan Reality head font to familiarize himself in the home.
All of the funny scenes are well taken for the last half, but because it looks friendly and low-key there's a little bit of a taste like a children's television show about it.
It's a pretty simple movie.
And like the other Johnny English movies, I'm wondering: can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a character that really fits his talent?
The Labour Party plans for the British people to work four days a week but is paid for five days
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is considering a radical plan that would see British citizens working four days a week — but paid for five days.
The party reportedly wants the company's bosses to channel the savings made through the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to workers by giving them an extra day off.
He would watch staff enjoy the weekend for three days - but still bring home the same salary.
The source said the idea was "fit" with the party's economic agenda and plans to bring the country to the side of the workers.
Switching to work for four days a week is supported by the United Nations Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of economic change.
A right-wing source from the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: "The basic study is expected to be announced before the end of this year.
"It's not going to happen overnight but working four days a week is an aspiration that fits the party's approach to balancing the economy and supporting workers and the entire party's industrial strategy."
The Labour Party was not the first to support the idea, with the Green Party promising a four-day working week in the 2017 election campaign.
However, this aspiration is not fully supported by the Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "A four-day working week is not the basis of the party and it is not considered by the party."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour conference last week to advance his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was eager to seize power from a "faceless director" and a "scout" at a utilities firm.
The shadow chancellor's plan also means that current shareholders in a water company may not be able to recover their entire shares because the Labour government can make 'cuts' based on the reason they are considered to be making a mistake.
He also approved plans to put employees in the company's board of directors and create an Inclusive Ownership Fund to hand over 10 percent of private sector firm equity to employees, who will receive annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy told "60 Minutes" whether the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could change their mind
The FBI's investigation into charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his candidacy for the Supreme Court for at least a week, and raised the question of whether the bureau's findings could affect Republican senators to provide their support.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, 60 Minutes reporter Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could find something that would cause them to change their minds.
Kennedy seems to be more open than his counterparts from South Carolina.
“I mean, of course,” Kennedy said.
"I told you to attend the trial, I said, I've spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I contacted him after this happened, which the accusation came up, and said, 'Did you do it?'
He's clear, he's clear, he's clear."
In any case, Graham's vote has been decided.
"I've made a decision by Brett Kavanaugh and he's going to take a heavy charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know about this: Brett persistently denies it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And all the people he named couldn't confirm it.
It's been 36 years.
I didn't see any change."
Is the World People’s Day and has it done something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the World People's Party, an annual music event that has an amazing line of great stars and an equally great mission; ending the world's poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the World People's Day will see tens of thousands of people gathered at the Central Park Grand Site to not only watch shows like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness about the true goal of the event ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The World People's Day, which began in 2012, is an extension of the World Poverty Project, an international support group that aims to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people who are active against it.
To receive free tickets to the event (unless you are able to pay for a VIP ticket), visitors to the concert need to prepare some tasks, or "actions" such as becoming a volunteer, sending emails to the world leader, making phone calls or any other means that means to help raise awareness about their elimination goals.
However, how far is the success of the World People with the remaining 12 years to achieve its goals?
Is the idea of giving a free concert an honest way to persuade people to demand something, or just another case of "clickivism" - making someone feel they've done something by just signing a petition online or by sending a bill?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has said it has recorded as many as 19 million "actions" from its supporters, urging movements with different goals.
They say these actions have helped encourage world leaders to announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion that will bring change to more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
By the beginning of 2018, the group had identified 390 commitments and announcements resulting from their actions, and at least $10 billion of that amount had already been taken into account or had been collected.
The group also estimated that the funds that have been known to have impacted nearly 649 million people around the world.
Several important committees include the Power of Nutrition, a partnership between UK-based investors and enforcement that is committed to "helping children reach their full potential", promising to donate $35 million to Rwanda to help eliminate unbalanced nutrition from the immediate Citrizen after receiving more than 4.7 ci.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, the federal government and Global Citizens like yourself, we can make this unbalanced social injustice of nutrition a story of a long time in history," Nutrition Power Ambassador Tracey Ullman said at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said after receiving more than 5,000 calls for the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government has pledged to fund a project, the Nutrition Power, which will now reach 5 million women and children in need.
Replying to one of the Common Questions on his website asking "What makes you think we can end severe poverty?"
Global Citizen has responded: "This is a difficult path and will take time - sometimes we will be disappointed and desperate.
But, just as the movement has demanded civil rights and anti-apartheid before, we will succeed, because when we work together we will grow stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are among several artists who have also performed at this year’s show in New York, which will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. could use the Navy as an "imposition" to prevent Russia from exporting oil
Washington could "if necessary" use its Navy to prevent Russia from selling its oil on the market, including in the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of State Ryan Zinke said in a Washington Examiner report.
Zinke claimed Russia's withdrawal in Syria - as it is known, involving themselves at the Syrian government's invitation - was supposed to find a new oil market.
"I believe their presence in the Middle East is to dominate the oil supply as they have done in eastern Europe and southern Europe," he said.
And according to the official, there is a way to deal with this issue.
"The United States has the capability, with our Navy, to ensure the seaways are open, and if necessary, to prevent to ensure their oil cannot be marketed," he said.
Zinke said so when making a speech at a Consumer Energy Alliance advocacy event, a non-profit group that disguises itself as an "oil user voice" in the US.
He also compared Washington's actions against Russia and Iran, emphasizing the same.
"The economic choices over Iran and Russia are more or less the same, affecting and replacing oil," he said, while referring to Russia as having no other choice and with its economy so dependent on oil.
This statement was issued when the Trump administration in a mission to increase exports of liquefied natural gas to a much cheaper Europe to consumers in Europe, replacing Russia.
Trump officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the “heavy side” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump said would make Berlin backed by Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly said the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline project would have the capacity of the existing pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters and it is purely an economic project.
The Kremlin denies Washington's so vigorously cracking down on this project is due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I am confident that we agree that the energy supply should not be a weapon to press and users need to be free to vote," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said following a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. action has invited the dissatisfaction of the German state, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industrial organisation, the German Industrial Federation (BDI), has called for the US not to interfere in the EU’s energy policy and also on the deal between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country interferes in our country's energy supply," Dieter Kempf, head of the German Federation of Industry (BDI), said recently after a meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren Will "Think Cooking" to Compete as President in 2020, Massachusetts Senator said.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would "think cooking" before becoming a presidential candidate following the midterm elections.
When it comes to open responses to residents of Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren said he would consider competing.
"It's time for a woman to go to Washington and fix our broken government and this includes putting a woman at the top of it," he said.
"After November 6th, I will think with his cooking to become a presidential candidate."
Warren expressed concern about President Donald Trump when the matter was open, saying that Trump "is driving our country in the wrong direction.
"I'm worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren has strongly criticized Trump for running Brett Kavanaugh as a candidate for the Federal Court.
In an interview on Friday, Warren said "we definitely need an FBI investigation before the draw is made."
However, welcome one review on Thursday, showing a majority of the population in the area represented by Warren felt Warren was not worth competing in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of voters in Massachusetts "will" say the senator should not compete, according to a review by the University of Suffolk/Boston Globe Center for Political Studies.
Thirty-two percent supported him.
The review also showed more support for former Governor Deval Patrick to compete, with 38 percent supporting him potentially competing and 48 percent disagreeing.
The names of other high-profile Democrats who are also discussed as potentially competing in 2020 are former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would formally decide on it by January, according to an Associated Press report.
Sarah Palin focuses on post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) track palin at trump meeting
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after joining the military in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
"What my own son faces, after coming home, I can feel the feelings of other families who are facing this PTSD problem and those who are home with injuries," he said at a meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin said the events of his son's detention were "significant" and he said of his son as well as other war veterans as, "they came home different, rather hard and wondered if they would be admired for their sacrifice to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and charged with committing domestic violence against a woman, disrupting reports of domestic violence and possessing weapons when drunk, according to Dan Bennet, a Wasilla Police Department spokesman.
Eighteen states, Washington supports a new policy of asylum
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are in favour of opposing a U.S. policy that prevents asylum for victims fleeing attacks by groups of domestic violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and territories made a friend registration to the court on Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker who opposes this policy, NBC news reports.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions of the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against the federal policy has not been disclosed.
He said his partner and "members of his son's violent group" were suffering from him but U.S. officials rejected his asylum application on July 20.
He was arrested in Texas.
Prosecutors in favor of Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which have the largest number of asylum seekers in the U.S., as a country filled with problems of evil groups and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum application policy reverts to a decision made in 2014 in which the Immigrant Appeals Board has allowed immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Karl Racine, the Attorney General of the District of Columbia, said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "does not undermine the state, federal and international laws that have existed decades ago."
"The federal law requires all applications for asylum to be decided on the basis of the facts and circumstances leading to the application, and prevents it from violating the principle," a friend told the court.
Prosecutors also disputed the policy that would prevent immigrants from entering the U.S. economy by saying the immigrants would likely become entrepreneurs and "become necessary labor."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions has directed immigrant judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing for domestic violence and for the violence of evil groups in June.
Suaka will be given to those who leave their homeland for fear of being oppressed because of homosexuality, religion, ethnicity or because they belong to a particular social group or adhere to different political stances," Sessions said when announcing the policy on June 11.
Suaka is not meant to solve all the problems -- even if all the problems are serious -- that everyone in the world faces every day.
Survival work is on the rise in Palu while the death toll doubles
For the survivors, the situation is getting worse.
"It feels very depressed," said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, who is breastfeeding her next fever-stricken baby in a crowded Palu city center.
"Every minute an ambulance carries a corpse.
Drink a little bit of water."
Residents appear to be gradually returning to their home that has been deserted, searching for their belongings in the water while trying to save what they can.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals were damaged as a result of an earthquake at magnitude 7.5 that was too severe.
Among the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a fractured spine and shoulder, rest outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients are being treated outside as there is still a follow-up quake.
Her tears flowed as she scanned back as the earthquake shook the five-storey hotel room she shared with her wife and daughter.
"There is nothing to save us.
I'm stuck in a collapsed wall, I guess," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town to attend a wedding.
"I heard my wife's voice asking for help, then kept quiet.
I don’t know what happened to my wife and daughter.
I hope they're safe.
U.S. ambassador accuses China of ‘propaganda advertising’
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A week after a Chinese newspaper published a four-faced advertisement in a U.S. newspaper detailing the common good of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused China of using U.S. newspapers to spread propaganda.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to paid advertisements in the China Daily newspaper in the Des Moines Register - the state's best-selling newspaper - after accusing the Chinese state of trying to interfere in the November 6 congressional elections, a charge China denies.
Trump's accusations that Beijing was trying to interfere in the U.S. election explain what U.S. officials reported to Reuters as a new phase in a campaign to pressure the Chinese state.
Becoming a common practice for foreign governments to broadcast advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are now engaged in an increasingly worsening trade war with each imposing tariffs on their imports.
China's initial action in this trade war was to target exporters in countries such as Iowa who support the Trump-represented Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. state experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, the largest exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing's move had plagued many American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, according to Branstad in a press room in the Des Moines Register on Sunday wrote, "now more bullying by broadcasting propaganda ads in our own free press."
"In broadcasting this propaganda, the Chinese government received the freedoms practiced by the United States, a tradition that prioritized freedom of speech and freedom of the press," Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, in the Beijing press, there is very little opposition and you can't see the real view of the people against the Chinese economy's concerns because their media is tightly controlled by the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He also added "one of the main newspapers in the Chinese country avoiding an offer to publish" his article, although he did not state which one.
Republicans vote for women ahead of midterm elections due to Kavanaugh's story, a warning by analysts
While many prominent Republicans support and support Brett Kavanaugh's federal court candidate who faces allegations of sexual harassment, analysts warned they would call for a response specifically from women, in the upcoming midterm elections.
High emotions cover this story and most Republicans say in the record they will continue with the vote.
Those things cannot be changed," Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell Study Center, Syracuse University, said in an article published Saturday in The Hill newspaper.
Reeher is unsure of Senator Jeff Flake's (R-Arizona) move to force the FBI to start an investigation is enough to reassure angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened last night - they will not forget it tomorrow and also in November," Karine Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, told the Washington D.C. newspaper on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters highlighted "November is coming!" while pointing to the sentiments in the Senate building plot as Republicans ruling the Judiciary Committee voted to proceed with Kavanaugh's candidacy despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reports.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will explode," Stu Rothenberg, a freelance political analyst, told the news site.
"People say this is too high; it's true.
This may be higher especially for women voters who will vote from suburban areas and young voters, 18-29 years old, they don't like the president and rarely vote.
Prior to Ford's public testimony detailing allegations of sexual assault against him by a federal court candidate, analysts thought it would be a scam if Republicans continued with confirmation.
"It's been something very complicated for the GOP," said Micheal Steela, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, earlier this week, according to NBC news.
"It's not just a committee vote or a final vote or if Kavanaugh succeeds to be a federal judge, it's also about how Republicans cope with this issue and how they serve him," Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, said in a statement.
However, the American people seem to be divided into two and do not know to trust who in the Ford and Kavanaugh testimonies with more than half in favor of Ford.
A recent YouGov review showed 41% said they would believe or maybe believe Ford's testimony, while 35% said they believed or maybe believed Kavanaugh.
Meanwhile, 38 percent said they argued Kavanaugh may or may not be a liar in his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After being pressured by Flake, the FBI is now investigating the allegations made by Ford and at least one other, reports Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian newspaper.
Last week, Ford made a sworn confession before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh intoxicated him when he was 17 years old.
Ramirez also said the federal court candidate also showed his contempt for Ford when a party he was suing at Yale University around the 1980s.
World website creators plan to launch a new Internet network to compete with Google and Facebook
World website creator Tim Berners-Lee launched a startup company to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that uses open source software based on the creation of Solid software Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data will be stored and who will be entitled to access the information.
In an exclusive conversation with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt's real goal was "to dominate the world."
"We need to do this now," he said of the start of the company.
"This is a historic moment."
The app uses Solid technology that allows people to create their own "personal online data storage" or POD.
It can contain contact lists, daily work lists, calendars, song lists and other personal professional accessories.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify that are available in one browser and simultaneously.
What's unique about data storage in this personal store is that it's up to the user for who can access the type of information needed.
The company refers to it as "personal control through data."
The key to this Inrupt, according to its Chief Executive Officer John Bruce, is to bring certain resources, processes and expertise to help people enjoy Solid.
The company now consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several developers hired to work on the project and a community of volunteer code writers.
As of this week, tech developers from all over the world can create their own free apps without centering anywhere using the complements found on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team did not have any discussions with "Facebook and Google to introduce or not introduce one change in which all of their business models will change immediately.
“We don’t ask for their truth.”
In an issue in Medium on Saturday, Bernes-Lee wrote, Inrupt, "its mission is to provide one business power and ecosystem to help protect the intergrity and quality of new websites built using Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the world of the Internet when he founded the World Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been arguing about the need for a free website.
While launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the Founder and Director of the World Web Site Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m very optimistic about the new era of websites,” added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: First World War Victoria Cross Receiver Padre
The only priest from the Church of England to receive the Victoria Cross award during World War I as a combat soldier has been divorced in his hometown after 100 years.
Lieutenant Colonel Pater Benard Vann who received this award on 29 September 1918 in an attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and did not immediately know he had ever known that he had been awarded the highest award of the British army.
A memorial stone has been erected and opened by his two grandchildren at a rally in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was a "glorious symbol" because the stone would open a curtain 100 years after his grandfather's bravery.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918 Lieutenant Colonel Vann carried his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "filled with thick fog and sparked a great air strike."
He then heads to the border and with "extraordinary courage" and leads him before he heads with a single gun and shoots three people.
The lieutenant colonel was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - a month before the war ended.
Micheal Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something that I couldn't possibly repeat and so embarrassing."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also put down a flower collar after the show was led by the Brentwood Imperial Young Manor.
Michael Vann said it was "very honored to be part of this show" and added "true courage with the support that has been given by so many people."
Fans of MMA watch all night to watch Bellator 206, otherwise they are given Peppa Pig
Imagine, you're waking up all night to watch the Bellator 206 but disillusioned from watching the main performance.
The list of San Jose contains 13 matches, including six major matches that will be broadcast live every night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were getting ready to make contact, audiences in the UK were surprised when the broadcast switched to Peppa Pig's show.
Some of them were angry because they were watching all night to watch this match.
One fan said the exchange to the children's cartoon channel was "an unintelligent joke" through its leak.
"Government rules show broadcasts at 6 a.m. are not suitable for the match so they are forced to broadcast the broadcast for children," said Dave Schwartz, chief vice president of marketing and communications Bellator when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa is Khinzir," he said.
Bellator company president Scott Coker said they were trying to reschedule the broadcast so that viewers in the UK could watch it.
"I think, when I talk about rebroadcasting, I think we can do something," Coker said.
“But at six o’clock on Sunday we cannot do anything until the day of our time, that is the Monday of their time.
We're working on it.
Believe me, when the broadcast is changed there are many original text retransmissions and everything is not nice to hear.
We're trying to solve this problem, we think it's a technical problem.
But no, this is more of a government issue.
I promise this won't happen in the future.
We're going to limit it to five matches instead of six - as usual - and we're trying to do something that can't be done for fans.
This is a sad situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels "low" to sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley said he grew up with low self-esteem due to his sexuality - but that's what motivates him to succeed.
The 24-year-old didn't realize anything until he went to high school and felt "not everyone is like me."
Speaking for the first time on Radio 4 Desert Island Discs hosted by Lauren Laverne, she spoke about the gay right to give "hope" to others.
He also spoke after his father's title, he didn't so much want to win the Olympics.
A reporter on this long-running plan, Kris Young has been on vacation for several months due to illness.
His sudden appearance in Laverne's first draft, Daley said he felt "less than" peers when he was growing up because "he was not socially accepted as either a man or a woman."
He said: "To this day, feeling less than others and feeling different from others are things that have encouraged me and given me the strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "something" he said, so he didn't disappoint anyone when they found out about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic medalist is now a high-profile campaigner for the LGBT group and has used his appearance at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year to prevent more countries from making homosexuality a crime.
He said he spoke this way because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without any problems and wanted to give "hope" to others like him.
The three-time world champion said the event fell in love with a man - U.S. filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - was "unthinkable."
Daley married the Oscar winner who was 20 years older than himself last year but said their age gap was never an issue.
"When you go through so much experience at such a young age" - he joined the first Olympic sport when he was 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was very difficult to meet someone in this age link who went through the same challenge.
The couple became a father in June to a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said "all the prospects" of his life had now changed.
"If you ask me last year, it's just about 'I need to win a gold medal'," he said.
"There's more to it than the Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medalist is Robbie."
His son's name is after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 when he was 40 years old after being diagnosed with cerebral palsy.
Daley said his father did not want to accept a statement that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked was whether their tickets to London 2012 had been purchased - because he wanted to sit in front once.
"I didn't have the heart to say 'Daddy won't be there to sit in the front row'," he said.
"I still hold my father's hand when he stops breathing and not until my father stops breathing and is legally dead I just realized my father won't live forever," he said.
The following year Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
"I realized this is what I've dreamed of all my life - to jump in front of my fans in my own country in the Olympics, there's no other notion that can match this," he said.
He was also a source of inspiration for his first song choice - "Proud" by Heather Small - which collided with him during preparations for the Olympics and still made his Roma fur droop.

Mickelson is not so willing to face the Ryder Cup this Saturday will be relaxed
American Phil Mickelson will create a new record on Sunday when he plays for the 47th time in the Ryder Cup, but he needs to be prepared to redeem the game's performance so as not to end with grief.
Mickelson who will play in this biennial event for a record 12 times, has been relieved by captain Jim Furyk for the "fourballs" and "foursomes" games on Saturday.
Back to being such a focus as usual for the United States, the winners of these five major games spend time being entertainers and training in the hopes of improving the quality of the game.
A person who can't hit the ball straight even when at the top of his game, the 48-year-old is not the right choice for the Le Golf National golf course, where the distance is far too difficult for a non-target hit.
And if this golf course is just a relief, Mickelson in the ninth match on Sunday will clash with British Open winner Francesco Molinari who has joined newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If the American player, the loss of four points starts with 12 singles games, starts with fierce, then the game of Mickelson is certainly very important.
Furyk is so confident with his players, that's all he can say.
"He understood his role today, and grabbed his shoulder and put his hand on my shoulder and said he would be ready for tomorrow," Furyk said.
"His self-confidence is very high.
He's been a great supporter of this team and he's done a lot of work this week.
I can't imagine what he's going to play in two games.
I imagined more than that, but that's the way we think we should do it.
He wants to do the same, just like everyone else.
Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record for most appearances in the Ryder Cup on Sunday.
This may be the last time he will join the Ryder Cup that has never matched his personal record achievements.
Mickelson won 18 times, lost 20 times and seven series, although Furyk said his presence brought one injection of spirit to his team.
"He's funny, he likes to ride, he likes to joke, he likes to wear people and it's really fun when he's in the team room," he said.
"I think all the young players are having fun with him this week, and it's fun to see him.
He's not just playing, he's more than that.
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knows their leading position will slowly be lost.
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knew from his experience that the far-flung position he had could be lost in the final day of the Ryder Cup and made things worse.
This Danish player first joined the 1997 match in Valderrama, where Seve Ballesteros drove as captain and led the American team with 5 points but was only able to win by a very thin one with a 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 point count.
"You keep reminding yourself after the lead in front at Valderrama; we can also lead in Brookline but we lose and in Valderram we win, but win thin," Bjorn said after seeing the 2018 Class win 5-3 on Friday and last night to be ahead with a 10-6 National score at Golf.
So history will prove to me and everyone in the team that this game is not over yet.
We're fighting exhaustively tomorrow.
Go out and play with seriousness and don’t make mistakes.
It's not over until the eyes are peeled off and dripped in the mirror.
We have a goal to win this trophy, and we will focus on that goal.
"I'm going to focus on 12 players in our team, but we all have to be aware of who our opponents are - they're the greatest players in the world.
So happy with the achievement of his men on the golf course that was so difficult, Bjorn added: "I can't possibly stand up.
Tomorrow is a new day.
Tomorrow's individual achievements need to step up and that's something different to do.
It's great to be out there with friends and when everything goes smoothly but when you're alone then your full capacity as a golfer will be tested.
This is a message that all players need to hear, give the best in yourself tomorrow.
Now leave your friend and he needs to give his best in himself as well."
Contrary to Bjorn's view, his opponent Jim Furyk would hope his players would play well as an individual player compared to a team event, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who managed to get three points out of four.
Furyk himself had an experience on the last day where the position changed, when he was in a winning team in Brookline before losing to surprise when European teams performed "The Miracle in Medinah."
"I still remember every broken word," he said when answering a question about how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, burned the player's spirit on the last day.
"We have 12 more shows tomorrow, but if you all want to start as fast as you see in Brookline, as you see in Medinah.
When the momentum begins, it will put pressure on the event in the middle.
"We're going to risk our players according to a schedule that we feel fit, we're going to try to do something great tomorrow.
Thomas has been given the task of fighting back and colliding with Rory McIlroy in the main event, along with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter who are European players in the top position of the first part.
"I made this rule because I think it will adhere to and encompass everything once and for all," Bjorn said of the individual player's choice.
Germany's new warship is delayed again.
The German Navy should receive its latest frigate in 2014 to replace the Cold War-era warship, but the ship will not be ready until next year due to system damage and rising costs, according to local media reports.
The authorization of the warship "Rhineland-Pfalz", the first ship under the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigate brand has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit which quoted a military spokesman.
This warship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, unfortunately the post-conflict problem hit the fate of this major project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates seized by the Navy in 2007 would replace the Bremen-class frigates.
Understandably, it will contain features such as high-powered cannons, a variety of anti-aircraft and anti-ship fittings as well as some awkward features such as reducing detection by radar, red lights and acoustic capabilities.
Another important feature is a longer maintenance period - this latest frigate must be able to sail up to two years from its storage.
However, the various obstacles mean that these sophisticated warships are said to be capable of highlighting German power abroad - it will be outdated by the time the ship joins the Navy service, according to Die Zeit.
This unfortunate F125 frigate became a headline last year, when German Navy officials refused to license the warship in and return it to the shipbuilding company Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has returned the ship to its builder after delivery.
Not much is known as to why the ship was returned, but German newspapers called some of the damage "persions and devices" making the warship useless if sent for combat missions.
Damage to the software needs to be taken seriously because the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class warship would be controlled by only 120 grades - half of what was needed to control the old Bremen-class frigates.
There are also things where this warship is too heavy and this will reduce the performance and limit the ability of the Navy to make any future improvements.
The "Rheinland-Pfalz" warship is believed to be twice as heavy as warships in the same class used by the German army during World War II.
In addition to damage to the device, the overall price of the project - including training for quality - is also an issue.
The project is said to have reached <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6bn) - an increase from its original price of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems that struck the most recent frigate warships show how much of the German naval capability was lacking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the chairman of the defense committee in parliament, acknowledged the Navy was indeed facing a lack of mobile capable warships.
The official also said the issue was getting worse, as the old warships that had been stopped did not get replacement warships.
He complained that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates could join the Navy.
The National Trust is committed to life
The latest study, which is being conducted on an esthet in the Scottish highlands, aims to explain why maggots use the shape of the earth's surface to hunt for food.
It is expected that this study will lead to the latest discoveries regarding the unique mammalian behavior that attempts to fly this and can be a guide for conservation activities.
The study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow regular whims, and soprano whimstle pipistrelles as well as long-eared brown whims and Daubenton whims at Inverewe Park in Wester Ross.
A special recorder tool will be placed in certain locations around the property to track the lobster activity throughout the season.
NHS employees and volunteers will also make mobile surveys using mobile tracking tools.
Experts analyzing the sound of all the recordings will determine the frequency of each type of lobster and its species and the actions of these lobsters.
A habitat map and a report will be generated to create a scaled image of the Earth's surface with respect to the behavior of the insect.
Rob Dewar, conservation advisor to the NTS, hopes that the study's findings will show the most important habitat area for molluscs and how it is used by each species of molluscs.
This information will help identify the benefits of habitat management such as making meadows and the best way to maintain forests for lizards and other related species.
The number of turkeys in Scotland and the UK has declined greatly over the last century.
The mosquitoes are threatened by buildings and development work that disrupt the mosquitoes' habitat and loss of habitat.
Wind turbines and lights are also a risk to insects similar to fly trapping paper and some chemicals used to treat building materials as well as pet cat attacks.
In fact, squirrels aren't blind.
Because of the squirrels hunt at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes.
They use location detection techniques using sound to identify the position of insects and obstacles during flight.
The NTS is responsible for maintaining more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important parks and 76,000 hectares of land across the country.
They have ten trained specialists who often run surveys, check places of belief and sometimes save the mood.
The organization has also established one of the first mollusc protection centres in Scotland at Thrave estet in Dumfries and Galloway, which is the place where eight of the ten mollusc species in Scotland live.
David Thompson, the manager of the esthet, said that this esthet is the most suitable place for aesthetics.
"We've got a very good place to stay," he said.
"We have old buildings, lots of big trees and suitable habitats.
There is so much more we don't know about marigolds, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us understand what marigolds need to live and thrive.
He stressed how important it is to carry out inspections before starting maintenance work on the property because there is a possibility we can accidentally destroy a mosquito net that will contain mosquito children where it is capable of killing 400 female mosquitoes and mosquito children, and possibly destroying the entire population.
Ants are protected and are the fault of killing, harassment or disturbing or destroying a nesting antler's place.
Elisabeth Ferrell, an officer for the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help.
He said: "There are still many things we need to learn about molluscs and for many species we don't know how their populations evolved."
Ronaldo denies allegations of rape while his lawyer is preparing to cover up German magazines.
Cristiano Ronaldo said the accusations of raping him were "fake news" and said there were people who wanted to "promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyer would disguise the German magazine, Der Spiegel, which published the accusations.
The Portuguese and Juventus forwards were accused of raping an American woman, named Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
Later he was said to have paid $375,000 to close the victim's mouth according to Der Spiegel's report on Friday.
Speaking in an Instagram Live video to 142 million followers hours after the allegations were reported, 33-year-old Ronaldo denounced the report as "fake news."
"It's not true.
What they say today is fake news," said the winner of the 5 Ballon d'Or awards to the camera.
“They want to promote themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous by naming my name, this is part of my work.
"I'm happy and everything is fine," he said, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to bribe De Spiegel on the charges, which they call "an unfounded and disruptive report," according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would demand compensation for "moral damages that directly disrupted his personality, which may be one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years."
The incident reportedly occurred in June 2009 in a luxury room at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the player's hotel room, where he was accused of passing the woman without a permit, according to a paper of investigation registered at the Clark District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claimed after the incident the player leaned in front of him and said he was "99 percent" a "good man" and was only beaten for "one percent."
The document confirmed Ronaldo claimed to have had sex, but on the grounds that he liked the same.
Mayorga also claimed he made a police report and took pictures of the injuries suffered while in hospital, but later agreed to settle it outside the courthouse because he was "afraid of a response" and worried about "going public."
The 34-year-old woman now wants to cancel her previous settlement because she is still traumatized by what has happened.
Ronaldo almost joined Real Madrid from Manchester when the accusations took place, and this summer he has moved to Italian football giant Juve for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million.
Brexit: UK 'will regret forever' for losing car makers
The UK "will regret forever" if it loses its status as world leader in automobile production after Brexit, Commerce Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added this was somewhat "worried" because Toyota UK told the BBC if Britain left the European Union without a solution, it would stop production of its cars at its factory in Burnsaston, near Derby, for a while.
“We need a solution,” Mr. Clark said.
The Japanese carmaker said the effect of this would result in a border delivery problem if there was no solution to Brexit and this would lead to a job loss.
The plant in Burnaston - which produces Toyota Auris and Avensis cars - installed nearly 150,000 units last year, 90% of which were exported to other EU countries.
"In my view, if Britain leaves the European Union without any resolution at the end of March, we will stop production of cars at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director at Burnaston.
Several other carmakers in the UK, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar and Land Rover, also said they were concerned if the UK exited the European Union without a solution on how cross-border trade would work.
For example, BMW said it would close its Mini car factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concern of car manufacturers is about the risk to the supply chain if there is a Brexit without any solution.
Toyota's production of cars depends on the installation basis based on the receipt of the right supplies at the right time without the need to be stored with the parts of the car being brought into the factory every 37 minutes from the UK and the European Union for the scheduled cars.
If the UK leaves the European Union without any resolution on March 29, it is likely that there will be delays at the borders that industry players predict will be postponed and lack of replacement materials.
Toyota is unlikely to be able to keep an inventory of more than one day at the Derbyshire plant, the company said, so production will be stopped.
Mr Clark said Finance Minister Theresa May's future plan for bilateral relations with the European Union "must be done decisively to avoid any border checks."
"We need a solution. We want a solution that will allow not only success for the present but for us to seize this opportunity," he told the BBC in the Radio 4's Today program.
"Evidence not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers shows that we need to continue this highly successful supply chain.
Toyota can't say how long its production will be halted, but in the long run warnings will increase costs and reduce the competitiveness of the factory and so on will result in job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is a union member responsible for the management of the unit at this factory, said the union members had already started to worry: "From my experience, the lost work will not return.
A government spokesman said: "We have put forward an accurate and robust plan for future relations between us and the European Union.
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, White House says
A very important meeting between Donald Trump and deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein may be "rejected next week" as disputes over Brett Kavanaugh's candidacy as a federal court candidate continue, according to the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein, who oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russia's intervention in the election, the relationship between Trump and Russia's aide and the possible impediment to justice by the President.
Whether Trump will fire a deputy prosecutor or not and further disrupt Mueller's freedom to continue the investigation has become Washington's hottest gossip.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported Rosenstein planned to use a secret recorder tool to record his conversations with Trump and the possibility of replacing the president by using a 25-second amendment to the constitution.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But on Monday, he rushed to the White House, behind a report that said he would step down.
Instead, it was announced one meeting on Thursday with Trump who was at the United Nations in New York at the time.
Trump said he was "not willing" to fire Rosenstein but the meeting was postponed to avoid him colliding with Kavanaugh's confession and Dr. Christine Blassey Ford, one of the women who accused Kavanaugh of raping him, before the Senate Judiciary Committee, which they both confessed to.
On Friday, Trump directed the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into charges against Kavanaugh, which has suspended another full vote in the Senate.
Trump's secretary of press, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox's news on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "The date has not been set yet, maybe this week, I think it may be postponed for another week given some of the things that are going on in federal court.
We'll see later and I'll always provide the latest information to the press.
Some reporters will dispute it: Sanders has never held a White House press conference since September 10.
When the host, Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said he didn't hold a lot of press conferences not because he didn't like TV reporters trying to find "attention" but he also said: "I don't agree because they do want attention."
He said that the relationship between the press and Trump would increase.
"The president has held the most response sessions compared to the presidents before him," he said without giving any evidence. "We have made the calculations."
A press conference will continue to be held, Sanders said, but if the press has a chance to ask directly to the president of the United States, it is better than talking to me.
We're trying to do it more often, and you've seen we've done a lot of it over the past few weeks and this will replace the press conference when you can speak directly to the president of the United States.
Trump often answers questions from the press when on his way out of the White House or when taking part in an open-ended answer session or at a press conference with honorary guests.
Media conferences in person are very rare.
This week in New York, the president showed why he sometimes made a free and bizarre appearance in front of a gathering of reporters.
Health Secretary writes to EU workers at the NHS on their concerns about Brexit
The health secretary has written a letter to all workers from the European Union working at the NHS Scotland to express their gratitude to the country and hope they will continue to work here after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP has sent a letter of formal notice less than six months before the UK left the European Union.
The Scottish Government has also committed to bear the costs for the applications of EU citizens who work in its public sector.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the European Union on the resignation have been ongoing, and are heading towards reaching a decision by the fall.
But the UK government has increased its preparedness to face a scenario without a solution.
I know this is something that worries you all.
That's why I want to emphasize how much I appreciate each of you's contributions, regardless of your nationality.
Partners from across the European Union and other countries, bringing together a wealth of experience and expertise that strengthens and improves health services and provides benefits to patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we want you all to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after having a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers defender Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury after losing 31-27 to Vanderbilt Commodores, reports Mike Organ of Tennesseean.
The head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred just before the second half.
“He came near the edge line and suddenly cracked there,” Reed said.
Coaches and health officials gave Abercrombie oxygen there before putting him in a ditch and bringing him for further treatment.
An official from Tennessee State told Chirs Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had completed surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added "no information on the type/ extent of his injury at this time" and Tennessee State was trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, the first-year contender in the red shirt, played in the first season with Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
He made five runs on Saturday before leaving the game, his number of runs this season is 18.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty when they buy property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher stamp duty when they buy real estate in the UK and the excess of this money will be used to help the landlords under the latest Tory plan.
This move will mark Corbyn's success in attracting young voters
This stamp duty will be levied on those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Treasury is expected to cite up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year - to help the migrants
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher stamp duty when they buy real estate in the UK - money from this will be used to help landlords, Theresa May said today.
The move seems to mark Jeremy Corbyn's success in attracting young voters by promising to provide affordable housing and make high-income people a target.
These stamp duty increases will be imposed on individuals and firms who do not pay taxes in the UK, money from these results will help the government address the problems of people who do not have a residence.
This addition - is an addition to the stamp duty that has also been imposed including the higher duty that had been introduced two years ago on the second house and the house purchased for rent which may be charged three percent.
The treasury is expected to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year through this step.
It is estimated that 13 percent of new properties in London were purchased by those who were not UK citizens, causing prices to rise and make it easier for those who want to buy their first home.
Most luxury areas - especially in the country's capital - have become "silent" because many of its owners are foreign owners who spend a lot of time abroad.
The new policy was announced a few weeks after Boris Johnson demanded that stamp duty be reduced so that more young people could buy their first home.
He accused a large construction company of deliberately maintaining high property prices by buying land but not developing it, and accused Ms May of removing quotas on homes capable of owning to address Britain's "shameful housing problem."
Mr Corbyn has announced a number of interesting housing renovation proposals, including rent controls and abolishing "innocent" evictions.
He also wanted more power to be given to the members of the council to build a new house.
May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my term as prime minister to restoring the British dream - this life must improve for every generation to come.
And that's going to improve our poor housing market.
The UK will always be open to anyone who wants to live, work and build life here.
However, it is unfair because it is very easy for individuals who do not live in the UK, as well as companies that do not live abroad to buy a house compared to British residents who work hard here.
For too many people, the dream of having their own home is a long way off, and the fact of living in flat places with a sense of humiliation is indeed a reality.
Jack Ross: 'My main goal is to manage Scotland'
Sunderland boss Jack Rosa said his "main goal" was to become Scotland's manager one day.
The 42-year-old Scotsman is looking forward to a challenging opportunity to revive the North-East club that is in third place in League One, less than three points from the top position.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after bringing St Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
“I want to represent the country as a player.
I can call for a B cap and that's all," Ross told BBC Scotland Sportsound.
"I grew up seeing Scotland in Hampden with my father when I was a kid, and there was something that always drew me there.
That's the only way I'll be able to do it if I'm a manager at the club.
Ross' replacements as Sunderland manager included Dick Advocaat, Dovid Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neil, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former Alloa Athetic manager said he doesn't like to be bullied after such a well-known name in big clubs, as he had previously rejected Barnsley and Ipswich Town's proposals.
“For me, success at this point means ‘can I bring this club back into the Premier League?
"Because of the structure and facilities that exist in this club, it should be in the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to achieve, but I would consider myself a success if I could get the club back into the Premier League."
Ross was just three years in management, after being a managerial assistant at Dumbarton and becoming one of the coaches at Hearts' for 15 months.
He then helped Alloa return to stage three after being dropped off the position and changed St Mirren's fate from being dropped down to becoming Champions the following season.
And Ross said, he's very comfortable now compared to being a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It's an option," he recalls, as he manages Alloa.
"I know that the management field is the same with me, rather than playing.
Maybe it sounds weird because I'm successful, can live happily and enjoy some interesting times.
Playing is a bit difficult.
There are a lot of things you need to do every week.
I'm still going through it in terms of pressure and urge to work as a player but as a manager I'm more comfortable.
I’ve always wanted to take care of it and now I’m doing it, and I’m comfortable doing something I like all my adult life.”

The right time to drink beer is 5:30pm on Saturday, according to the study.
This summer's heat wave has brought hay to British pubs that are facing problems but chain restaurants are under pressure.
Groups of pubs and bars showed a 2.7 percent increase in sales in July - but in restaurants it fell 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin of CGA's business consultancy firm, which collected these figures, said: "The ongoing heat wave and the longer England World Cup campaign means July will follow the pattern of June, where pubs rose 2.8 percent, except for restaurants falling worse.
The 1.8 percent drop in restaurant business in June grew worse in July.
The performance of pubs that prioritize drinks and bars is very strong compared to the declining restaurants.
Pubs that prioritize food also experience bad luck as a result of hot weather, but not as bad as restaurant operators.
Most people just want to go out for a beer.
Pubs and bars recorded a 6.6 percent increase in sales for the month, while food fell 3%.
Paul Newman, an entertainment and food analyst at RSM, said: "This decision seems to be the same and has been ongoing since the end of April.
Weather and social events or sports events are still a major factor in the increase in sales in the market outside the home.
Unsurprisingly, the restaurant group continues to crumble, sales drop 4.8 percent if compared to this year is definitely worse with the cost pressure again.
The long summer summer weather hits the restaurant operator in bad weather and only the weather will determine if the cooler weather we experience in August will bring relief."
The number of increases in sales in pubs and restaurants, including the new ones opened is, 2.7 percent in July showed moisture in the newly introduced brand.
Observers for the UK pub, bar and restaurant sales sector The Coffer Peach Tracker collects and analyzes data performance from 47 groups operating with a <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion turnover are industry-leading indicators.

A study by the UK Digital Awareness and the Big Teachers Conference (HCM) found that 40 percent of 11 to 18-year-olds have two profiles, with more than half of them admitting they have a personal account.
HCM Chairman Mike Buchanan said: "It's worrying to see so many teenagers trapped creating an online space where parents and teachers can't track them."
Eilidh Doyle will be "voice to athletes" in Scottish Athletics
Eilidh Doyle was appointed to Scottish Athletics as the non-executive director during the meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is a respected Scottish racing athlete and chairman Ian Beattie explains this step is an opportunity for those who lead this sport to benefit from Doyle's extensive international experience for over a decade.
"Illidh is highly regarded in Scotland, the UK and the international athlete community and we are sure the athletes in Scotland will benefit greatly from his participation in this institution," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I want to be the voice of all athletes and I hope to contribute and help guide this sport at Scotand

Mother's milk pump ads that make comparisons with cows bring mixed opinions online
A mother's milk pump company gets mixed opinions online as their ads compare breastfeeding mothers to cows being fertilized for milk.
To launch what is said to be "the world's first silent and wearable mother's milk pump," Elvie's user technology company released a joke-shaped music video to show the freedom that mothers using this new pump can feel.
Four mothers dance in a straw-filled cowhouse to a song in which the lyrics read: "Yes, I pump my own milk, but you can't see any tail" and "If you don't realize this is not a white, this is my breast."
"Pump out, pump out, I'm breastfeeding the kids, pump out, pump out, I'm pumping my chest fruit."
However, the ads published on the company's Facebook page have caused online controversy.
With 77,000 views, and hundreds of comments, the video has invited a variety of reactions rather than the general public, many who say it gives a cheerful picture of the skin industry that is "promoting".
"It's an unreasonable decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Just like us, cows need bunting and have to give birth to milk, but unfortunately cows are divorced from cows within a few days of their birth," said one author.

Another commented: "It's a trauma for cattle and cattle.
"But what say you use them to advertise milk pumps for mothers who can keep their children?"
Another added: "An advertisement that doesn't have to be directly related."
Others defended the advertisement, with a woman claiming that she found the song "really heartbreaking."
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
I would buy one if I still gave the body milk.
It makes me feel like a cow's.
The ad was a little crazy, but I thought it was the way it was shown.
"It's a brilliant product," one wrote.
Another commented: "This is a funny advertisement aimed at mom who pumps (usually at work or in the toilet) and feels like a "cow."
This is not an advertisement that praises or assesses the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women reveal that they've all been dancing with pumps hidden in their clothes.
The concept behind this campaign is based on the perception that most women who pump milk say they feel like cows.
However, Elvie's Pam is completely silent, has no wires or tubes and can be loaded secretly in shirts in sets, giving women the freedom to move around, hold their baby, and also go out while pumping.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother commented: "Pam Elvie is such a revolutionary product, he deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By equating women who pump with bulky cows, we want to put the milking of the body and all the challenges associated with it as the main focus, while showing how to entertain and relate to feelings of freedom through the use of new pumps.
This isn't the first time Elvie's pump has been a news headline.
During London Fashion Week, a mother to two children appeared on stage for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children switched silently to tent camps in Texas border
The number of detained migrants increased even though monthly border transfers did not change much, due to the rhetoric and heavy policy introduced by the Trump administration, making it increasingly difficult to place children with guarantors.
According to tradition, guarantors are undocumented immigrants, and they are afraid of affecting their position to continue living in the country if they take a child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that the guarantors and other adult members of the family would have to hand over their fingerprints, and the data would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, the chief official of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, told Congress that the agency had detained dozens of individuals who had applied to be guarantors to unguarded children.
The agency confirmed that 70 percent of those detained do not have a previous criminal record.
"Nearly 80 percent of individuals, whether a guarantor or a member of a guarantor family, are here illegally and most of them are immigrants without permission.
With that, we will continue to hunt down the individual," said Albence.
In order to process children more quickly, authorities are introducing new rules that require some of them to appear in court within a month of detention, not after 60 days according to previous standards, according to protection workers.
Many will be present through video court calls, rather than in person, to appeal their case for a legal position in front of immigrant judges.
Those who are not eligible for assistance will be deported immediately.
The longer the children are under detention, they will be more likely to become anxious or sluggish, and this will lead to a beleaguered act or an attempt to escape, according to security officials and according to reports released by the system in recent months.
Supporters said the concern was higher in larger facilities such as Tornillo, where a sign that children are struggling with feelings may not be noticed, due to the size of the place.
They added that moving children to a camp town without providing time for them to be emotionally prepared, or saying goodbye to friends may exacerbate the trauma they face.
Syria's U.S., French and Turkish troops immediately retreated
Speaking at the United Nations General Conference, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem urged Syrian refugees to return, even as the war in the country has reached the eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign troops in Syria under the umbrella of fighting terrorism "will be subjected to appropriate action."
"They have to step back immediately and unconditionally," he told the conference.
Moualem asserted that the "war on violence has ended" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011, and millions more have lost their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to “fight this holy war so that we would eliminate the territory of Syria” from both violent groups and “any foreign occupation”.
The United States has 2,000 troops in Syria, special for training and advising Kurdish and Syrian Arab troops against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the country.
On the issue of the escape, Moualem said the situation was appropriate for them to return, and he accused "outsiders" of "spreading irrational fears" that caused the escapees not to return.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to help this return," he said.
"They're politicizing things that should be a mere matter of humanity."
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not be given reconstruction aid until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the rebels to end the war.
A U.N. diplomat said an agreement between Russia and Turkey to provide a military-free zone in the rebel-held area of Idlib has created opportunities to continue political development.
The Russian-Turkish talks have diverted large-scale attacks by Russian-backed Syrian troops in the region where three million people live.
Moualem, however, said the deal had a "real time limit" and expected military action to target jihadists including rebels from the Nusra Front linked to Al Qaeda, which "will be abolished."
The UN special envoy, Staffan de Mistura, hopes to hold the first meeting for a new committee, which includes governments and opposition members to schedule post-war flights and pave the way for elections.
Moualem stated the terms of the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the panel's work should be limited to "reviewing current constitutional articles," and warned of disruption.
Trump is going to win the second round.
With that logic, Trump will win a re-election in 2020, unless, as expected by liberal observers, the charges of dismissal and scandal end his presidential office before his time.
In an undeniable situation as "The most dramatic finale for a president's office!"
At the moment, there is no sign of loss.
Since 2014, the prime time ranking has more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average prime time audience of 2.4 million, an additional of 1.7 million, four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" broadcast has preceded the cable ranking, up to 3.5 million viewers on the night of the premiere news.
"This is a fire that attracts people's attention because it's not something we understand," said Neal Baer, the lead publisher of ABC's "Designated Survivor," a story about a cabinet secretary who became president after the attack destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club," has another theory.
He recalled the taxi ride before the 2016 election.
The driver told him he was going to vote for Trump.
Why? he asked.
"He said, "Because he made me laugh," "Mr. Scovell told me.
There's a value in entertainment.
True, unlike what's on TV, the story path that comes from Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can reunite or the health of the global economy.
Not following developments is just a pleasure for a lucky audience.
However, it's far from being a knowledgeable citizen when you find you're watching a panel of experts arguing about Bob Woodward's use of a 'deep background' in search of a source for his book "Fear," a jersey bomber jacket about a $15,000 camel by Daniel Manafort.
I will not see Super Mario with the same view again.
"Part of what he's doing is like in a reality show that looks like he's setting you up for something every night," said Brent Montgomery, executive chairman of Wheelhouse Entertainment and "Pawn Stars," about Trump's story with an actor's exchange and a daily plot exchange.
You can't miss an episode or you'll miss it.

He can't leave TV, not when Brett Kavanaugh is set to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court is still uncertain.
"I remember when we were making a crazy show first and people were saying, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but they were right."

Foreign money flooded into fierce matches of the mid-term election council
It's not surprising that the election to 17 Pennsylvania showed a flood of money, given the reunification of the congressional district showed two officials now competing for the same seat.
The repainted Pittsburgh suburban area rivals Democratic representative Conor Lamb - who won his seat in a special election last spring.
Lamb competed against another current official, Republican deputy Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the 12th district of the old Pennsylvania, which overlaps with the new 17.
The map was repainted when the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old area had been ripped apart by Republicans.
The new 17th innings have kicked off a fierce financial campaign match between the party's main financial machinery of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a common name in Pennsylvania after a thin victory in the March special election for the crowded 18th Pennsylvania Congressional District.
The seat had been won by Republicans for a decade, and President Donald Trump won the area with 20 points.
The clever political elites have given the Democrats an advantage.
U.S. plans to sanction El Salvador for its support of China, then backs up
Diplomats of the Dominican Republic and Panama have recognized Beijing, with little negative response from Washington.
Mr Trump held a meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama so that the partners expelled the Trump Organization's management team.
Government officials decided to recall the head of U.S. diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama for "the latest decision not to recognize Taiwan," Heather Nauert, a spokeswoman for the ministry, said in a statement earlier this month.
But fines are only imposed on El Salvador, which received a $140 million budget in the form of American aid in 2017, including drug control and economic support.
The proposed fines, including cuts to financial aid and intended visa restrictions, will have a negative impact on the Central American country with high unemployment and murder rates.
After the internal meeting was held, North and Central American officials suspended a high-level conference focusing on economic security and prosperity, following a similar meeting last year that appeared to be a positive step in preventing immigrants to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior administration officials decided that they wanted the trial to continue, effectively stopping any considerations to penalize El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence will now deliver a speech at the hearing, scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the administration's import place at the meeting, the diplomat said.
And all three American representatives returned silently to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic with no clear message or fines from Washington.
White House spokesman for Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats who had agreed to discuss internal considerations on condition of anonymity.
Their explanations were supported by external analysts who were close to the administration and also spoke on condition of anonymity.
The study of history
What will happen next may be the special counsel Robert Mueller's report on the possibility of an impediment to justice by Trump, which now has solid evidence in the public record.
Mueller will also postpone an investigation to investigate whether Trump's campaign has joined Russia in an attack on our election.
If Congress changes hands, Trump will face responsibility on the side, as soon as he is ready to face the voter, and possibly finally a jury that contains his peers.
It's all that if, and I'm not saying that the fall of Trump must have happened - or people like him in Europe.
There are choices that we all have to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will make an impression on how long this conflict lasts.
In 1938, German officials were willing to make an attempt to seize power against Hitler, otherwise the West would not follow Hitler and support the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We have failed, and have missed the opportunity to avoid the brutal murders that took place over the next few years.
The historical journey revolves around such an inflection point, and the journey of unfettered democracy will be accelerated or suspended.
The American people are facing some of these points of inflation now.
What are we going to do if Trump fires Assistant Attorney Rod Rosenstein, the person who controls Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since this newspaper made the report that, last year, he had planned to make a record of the president and make speculation that the president was not eligible for the post.
Rosenstein said the Times statement was inaccurate.
"What will we do if the FBI's new investigation request against Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or unfair - or if he is confirmed to the Agong Court even though there are real allegations of sexual assault and evidence of fraud?"
And more importantly, are we going to vote for the Congressional dissent to which Trump will be held accountable?
If we fail in that test, democracy will go through a long winter.
But I believe we will not fail, because of the lessons I learned in Prague.
My mother was of Czechoslovak Jewish descent who had been exiled to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had conquered the house of my embassy.
He survived, moved to America and, 60 years later, sent me to light a Sabbath candle on a table with a swastika.
With that as my legacy, how am I not optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers optimistic about the battle with Rapid Vienna
The Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a win against Austria, following a series with Spain opposing Villarreal earlier this month, would put them in a strong position to qualify them in Group G in the European League.
The knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his comeback this season to a 2-2 series with Villarreal, but he believed the Rangers used this decision as a springboard for a great win.
"It's a good point because Villarreal are a good team," the 31-year-old said.
"We played in this game with the confidence that we would get something and we had one point.
We may win at the end of the match, but the series may be a fairer result.
They may play better in the first half and we'll play better in the second half and in a better side.
On Thursday, another great European night.
We hope we get three points but the game is difficult because they made a good decision in the previous game but, the spectators support us, I'm sure we'll play well and get a positive result.
"Last year was certainly a difficult one, between everything that happened with my injuries, and the placement in the club but there's a fun factor about this place now.
The squad is good and the team is having fun; the training is also great.
We hope we can do the best we can, leave last season and succeed."
Women can't sleep because of this stress.
Although the participants' reviews have a real idea of how they want to be maintained, some have even talked to their family members about it.
Half of the induvidu in a nationwide study said they had talked to their partner about the cost of long-term maintenance.
Only 10 percent of them talk to their children about it.
"They want family members to take care of them but not take steps to talk," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the nation's insurance business.
Here's how to get started.
Talk to your partner and child: You won't be able to provide family to provide care for you if you don't tell them in advance.
Working with your advisors and your family to discuss the place and how to get care, as such options will be an important factor to know the cost.
Bring your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you find a way to pay for those expenses.
Funding for long-term care can include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid cash value life insurance policy to help protect these expenses or self-insurance with your wealth - as long as you have money.
Complete your legislative document: Complete the legislative war at a time.
Set up a health care representative in place so that you can appoint an individual you trust to oversee your health care and ensure the professional at your will in case you are unable to communicate.
Consider also the power of attorney for your finances.
You will choose the person you trust to make the decision for you and make sure your bill is paid if you don't try.
Don't forget the little details: Imagine your elderly mother has a medical emergency and is on her way to the hospital.
Will you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
Describe these details in a written plan so that you are ready.
"It's not just the financial setting, but who's the doctor?" asked Martin.
"What is medicine?
Who will take care of the dog?
Set a plan."

Earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 have been killed in an earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to authorities, the death toll is expected to rise.
With the absence of communication systems, authorities are unable to obtain information from the Donggala government, the northern region of Palu adjacent to the earthquake center with a magnitude 7.5 shake.
In Palu more than 16,000 people have been displaced after the disaster struck.
Here are the main facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi region, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with a population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city is celebrating its 40th birthday during an earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala government area 300 km (180 miles) off the northwest coast of Sulawesi Island.
The area, the administrative region under the region, had a population of 299,200 as of 2017.
Fishing and farming became the economic backbone of the Central Sulawesi region, especially in the Donggala water area.
Nickel mining is also important in this region, but is only concentrated in Morowali, on the coast opposite Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by Tsumani several times in 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
The tsunami had also hit the west of Donggala in 1996, sacrificing 9 people.
Indonesia is seismically located in the Pacific Circle of Fire and has always been hit by earthquakes.
Here are the major earthquakes and tsunami in recent years:
2004: A large earthquake in the western outskirts of the region of Acheh, Indonesia north of Sumatra on Dec 26 has triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries, sacrificing 226,000 people along the waters of the Indian Ocean, half of that number in Aceh.
2005: A series of earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds were killed on Nias Island on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that hit the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck near Padang City, the capital of the West Sumatra region.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands, in Sumatra, triggering a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed 300 people.
2016: A simple quake struck the government area of Pidie Jaya in Acheh, causing destruction and panic, reminding residents of the events of the great earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
No tsunami was triggered at the time, but more than 100 were killed due to the ruins of the building.
2018: A powerful earthquake struck the tourist island of Lombok Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, especially in the northern part of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists stranded at the time.
Sarah Palin's son-in-law arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the son-in-law of former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested, suspected of conducting domestic attacks, disrupting reports of domestic violence and opposing detention, according to a report issued on Saturday by the Alaska State Troops.
According to police reports, when a female friend tried to make a police call to report the crime charges, she had picked up the phone from the woman.
Palin was held in custody at the Mat-Su pre-speak facility and detained with $500 unblocked bonds, KTUU reports.
He was brought before a court on Saturday, where he had pleaded "definitely, innocently" when asked about the confession, the network reports.
Palin faces three minor Class A errors, meaning he may be jailed for up to a year and fined $250,000.
He has also been charged under a minor Class B error, can be punished a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time a criminal charge has been brought against Palin.
In December 2017, the young man was accused of attacking his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, contacted the police to report the allegations of the attack.
The case is referred to in the Alaska Military Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic attacks, disrupting reports of domestic violence and possessing weapons intoxicated in connection with the incident.
Palin's girlfriend accused the man of punching his face.
Sarah Palin was criticised by a group of veteran soldiers in 2016 after associating her child with PTSD following her service in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake tsunami: hundreds killed
At least 384 people have been killed after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake triggered a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are also affected by the expected death toll to rise in the next day.
Earthquakes hit outside the Sulawesi Centre located northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos posted on social media show at the time of the event.
Hundreds of people gathered on the beach to celebrate a party in the city of Palu during a tsunami that hit the beach.
The prosecutors demanded an extraordinary death penalty for the suspects in the NYC terror attack.
New York prosecutors demanded the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the New York City suspect of a terror attack that killed eight people -- an extraordinary sentence no longer carried out in the state called for federal crimes since 1953.
Saipov, 30, was accused of using a Home Depot rental truck to carry out an attack on a bike lane along the West Highway in Lower Manhattan, hitting pedestrians and cyclists in its lane in Oct.
In order to enforce the death penalty, prosecutors need to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" inflicted serious bodily injury, according to a notice with the intention of demanding the death penalty, filed in the Southern District, New York.
Both charges led to the death penalty, according to court documents.
Several weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury had charged Saipov with 22 counts of murder, including eight counts of murder caused by illegal activities, which prosecutors have always used in planned criminal cases, and one count of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "a thorough planning and planning", according to prosecutors, reflecting on how Saipov carried out the action as "dumb, cruel and degrading."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injury, pain, and loss to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pangnucco."
Five of the victims are tourists from Argentina.
It has been close to the Southern District of New York claiming the death penalty case.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was accused of killing two drug dealers but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was imposed for the New York federal case was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, the married couple who had been punished after they were convicted of running an inauguration for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were sentenced to death using an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a citizen of Uzbekistan, did not feel guilty on the day and month after the attack, according to court documents.
He made it clear to investigators that he was happy with what was being done, according to police.
Saipov said he was urged to carry out the attack after watching an ISIS video on the phone, according to the allegations.
He also asked to display the ISIS flag in the hospital room, according to police.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal martial lawyers representing Saipov, said they were "really disappointed" with the prosecutor's decision.
"We feel the decision to demand the death penalty rather than receiving a guilty plea for life imprisonment with no possibility of release, only prolonging the trauma of this event for everyone involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defense has previously asked the prosecutors not to demand the death penalty.
According to Tory Member of Parliament, Nigel Farage should be responsible for conducting Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage pledged to "mobilize the people's army" today during a protest at the Tory trial.
Former Ukip chairman said politicians needed to "feel the shoulders" of "Eurosceptics" - because one of MEPs Theresa May, suggested she should be given the responsibility of controlling negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone told a rally in Birmingham that the UK would 'go out now' if Farage became Brexit secretary.
But the challenge May faces is to resolve the split between members who support the Remain Tories members who join protests against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is trying to ensure the Chequers' reluctance plan remains in place amid attacks from Brexiteer, Remain and the EU.
The allied parties insisted May was holding talks with Brussels despite the impact it faced - and Eurosceptic and Labour's power to choose between his package or "chaos."
Bone tells the gathering Out means Out in Solihull who wants to 'throw away the Chequers'.
He recommended Farage be made a nobility and was given the responsibility to negotiate with Brussels.
"If he was given that responsibility, we're out now," he said.
Wellingborough MP added: 'I support Brexit but we have to get rid of the Chequers.'
Demonstrating against the EU, he said: 'We are not fighting in the world war to be slaves.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Bone rejected the suggestion that public opinion had changed since the 2016 draw: 'The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to remain incorrect at all.'
Tory Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns, who also attended the rally, told reporters: "I just said: Prime Minister, listen to the voice of the people.
Chequers are not popular among the public, the Opposition will not vote in favour, it is not popular in our party and the activities that are on the street and that have voted for us.
Please drop the Chequers and start listening."
In a message addressed to May, he added: "Prime Ministers will continue to hold their posts if they keep their promises."
Farage said politicians need to "feel the shoulders" if they want to betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
"This is a belief between us - the people - and the political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here to tell them 'we're not going to allow them to lose by doing so.'
In a message to an enthusiastic audience, he added: "I want you to make our political class, which almost betrays Brexit, feel its shoulder.
"We are preparing a people's army that gives us victory in the Bexit and will not rest until we make the United Kingdom free, have its own government, proud."
Meanwhile, Remainer roamed through Birmingham before holding a rally in the middle of the city.
Serum activists spread Tories protesting Brexit after the group's launch on the weekend.
Peer Labour Lord Adonis ridiculed the Conservatives about the security issues they faced with the party's application at the start of the trial.
"They say they can organize IT systems in place and all technologies with Canada and so on, for borderless, for borderless trade," he added.
"It's all the words.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.
Warren plans to 'examine' to compete for the presidency
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would "examine to run for president" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that Massachusetts Democrats delivered his future plan during the 'town hall' in West Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a fierce critic of President Donald Trump, was fighting for re-election in November with GOP state Rep. candidate Geoff Diehl, who was the co-chair of the 2016 Massachusetts Trump campaign.
He is speculated to compete with Trump in 2020.
Saturday's midday event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with an employee using the 'town hall' format since Trump took office as president.
He asked if he wanted to run for president.
Warren replied it was time "for women to Washington to repair a broken government, and this included a woman on the upper stairs."
Capture made in death-shooting Sims from LSU
Police in Baton Rouge, La., announced on Saturday that a suspect had been arrested in the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11 a.m. ET news conference.
They had broadcast a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help to identify the man seen in the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus early Friday.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and was eventually killed as a result," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, via 247sports.
Wayde acts in defense of his friend and is shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and claimed to be at the scene, had a gun and claimed to have shot the Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and placed under arrest by the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
A junior has a height of 6 feet 6 raised in Baton Rouge, the Sims played in 32 games with 10 starts last season and averaged playing 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 runs each game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton closes the world championship gap when the team orders him to win, killing Sebastian Vettel
It was obvious at the time, Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, "the direction of the Mercedes team played an important role in this race.
From the start of Friday, Bottas started well, almost defeating Hamilton while defending his position in the first two rounds and leading Vettel to attack his teammates.
Vettel got into the pit first and left Hamilton in traffic at the end of the group, something that was supposed to be final.
Mercedes then entered the pit on the next round and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton then made a tire-to-tyre action that caused Ferrari drivers to leave the innings free of the risk of defending themselves after the third corner defending act.
Max Verstappen started from the back grid and was in seventh place after the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then went ahead for most of the race and did not change the tyres to aim for a quick finish and passed Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He entered the pit in the 44th round but was unable to increase speed for the next eight rounds when Raikkonen was in fourth place.
It's a tough day for Valtteri who has made a good race all weekend and being a decent guy allowed me to pass.
The team has done a great job of winning first and second place," Hamilton said.
That's the wrong language.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump mocks Senator Dianne Feinstein at a Saturday meeting on a woman's call that she did not leak a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing the prospective Agong Court Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault charges.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not give a direct answer about the testimony given before the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead commenting that what happened in the Senate showed people to be "cruel and ugly and lying."
"One thing can happen and beautiful things happen a few days ago in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see angry and cruel and ugly and lying people," he said.
"When you look at exposure and leaks and they say, 'Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
You remember?
Dianne Feinstein, are you leaking?
Remember the answer... did you leak the document - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I'm not leaking."
Okay, wait a minute.
Are we leaking... No, we're not leaking," he added, making the expression of the senator's face.
Feinstein had sent a detailed letter of accusations against Kavanaugholeh Ford in July, and the letter had been leaked in September - but Feinstein denied that the leak came from his office.
"I didn't charge Dr. Ford, I didn't leak the story," Feinstein told the committee.
"He told me to keep it as hard and I kept it as hard as requested."
But the defamation of the woman was disliked by the president, who commented during Saturday's meeting: "I tell you, it's a bad language of movement.
Maybe he didn't do that, but it's the worst language of movement I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the Agong Court candidate, who has been accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that Democrats use the accusations to achieve their own goals.
"They're trying to get back to power in any way.
You see, atrocities, atrocity, they don't care who they hurt, who they sacrifice to gain power and control," the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scores for Giants against Dundee
Star Dundee redeemed the Elite League defeat for Friday against the Belfast Giants by winning a 5-3 rematch at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants went ahead with a two-goal victory by a blow from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie equalled the host position before Dwyer recovered the Giants' victory.
Francois Bouchard equalized the points for Dundee before two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen guaranteed a victory for them.
This is the third Elite League defeat for this season for Adam Keefe's team, who came from below to beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two sides, with the Giants winning three previous matches.
The opening for Dwyer arrived in the fourth minute at 3:35 instead of Kendall McFaull's help, with David Rutherford providing help while Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
With what looked like a busy opening time, Sullivan raised the host's eyes at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt became an aide to Cownie's equalization at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants won the match during the first rest time when he scored his second goal that night at the end of the first time.
The hosts then regrouped and Bouchard again equalized the situation by scoring at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran joined in helping Nielsen give Dundee his first win in a late match in the second time and he secured the win with the fifth team in the middle of the last time.
The Giants, who have lost four of the five games at home, Milton Keynes for the next game on Friday.
Air traffic controllers sacrificed to ensure hundreds aboard aircraft pass the quake
Indonesia's air traffic controller is considered a hero after being killed after ensuring the plane carrying hundreds of passengers successfully escaped.
More than 800 people were killed and many were missing after a major earthquake struck Sulawesi Island on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Strong tremors continued to hit the area and many were trapped in the ruins of the City of Palu.
Even though his friend, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan the Great, refused to leave his place of control in the highly agile control tower at Sis Al Jufri Airport, Palu.
He did not hesitate to ensure the 6321 Batik Airplane, which was on the runway at the time, could safely escape.
He then jumped out of the control tower when he felt the tower would collapse.
He then died in the hospital.
A spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, ABC News Australia reported.
We provided a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately we lost it this morning before the helicopter got to Palu.
"Our hearts are broken to hear this news," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities are concerned the number of deaths could reach thousands with disaster mitigation agencies saying access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The death toll is still rising due to many bodies still under the rubble and many uncontacted," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency, said in a statement.
The 6-metre-high ramp has destroyed Palu, which will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft will bring in aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute the ambulance brings back the body.
Clean water is hard to get.
A small shop is ripped up everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, Chairman of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is in a hurry to provide assistance to the survivors but we don't know what will be found there.
It's a tragedy, but things can get worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's army: "I ask you to work day and night to complete every task related to the transfer.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia was hit by an earthquake earlier this year in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Micronesian plane crash: Air Niugini says a passenger is missing after the plane crashes
The airline that operated the plane that crashed in Lagun Pacific in Micronesia said one passenger was missing, after saying all 47 passengers and crew members were taken out of the plane that sank.
Air Niugini said in a broadcast that since Saturday afternoon, the company is uncertain about the safety of a male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline does not immediately respond to requests for further details about the passenger, such as age and age.
A local boat helped rescue other passengers and children after the plane crashed over water during an attempt to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Authorities said on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in hospital on Saturday and all of them were in stable condition.
What caused the accident and the actual sequence of events is still unclear.
The U.S. Navy and Air Force said the plane landed in the lagoon not far from the runway.
Some witnesses felt the plane was being detached from the runway.
According to American passenger Bill Jaynes, the plane entered the runway in a low condition.
"That's a very good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said he and the other passengers managed to cross the water as high as the belt to the plane's sinking emergency door.
He said the guards were in a state of panic and screaming, and he only got a slight head injury.
The Assyrian navy said the nearby docks on the well-recovered dock also provided assistance by using a re-inflatable boat to move passengers to the beach before the plane sank into 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network showed 111 people were killed in a PNG-registered plane crash in the past two decades but none involved Air Niugini.
Analysts give a night timeline of women burned alive
Prosecutors eased Saturday's case in a reconversation of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett gave an explanation for several hours as an expert witness in the field of smart analysis.
He outlined to the jury how he used a cell phone record to compose the movement of 29-year-old defender Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night she was killed.
Rowlett said he received some location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers on the eve of his death, clashing with previous allegations, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed his cell phone along with Chambers's phone while he was indicting along with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford stood in front of the court and explained that he was out of town that day.
When asked if Tellis was right, that he was in a Sanford truck that night, Sanford said he had "deceived because my truck was in Nashville."
Trellis said he knew Chambers two weeks before the woman's death.
Mobile phone records show that they only know each other for a week.
Rowlett said after Chamber's death, Tellis had deleted Chamber's call text and contact information from his phone.
"He's wiped the woman out of his life," Hale said.
Lawyers are scheduled to begin a closing hearing on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the trial to go to the jury later that evening.
The High Breed: What is hip hop?
The hip hop trio want to change the negative views of this genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims hip hop has changed far from their original purpose, namely political message and dismissal of social problems.
They want to go back to basics and make hip hop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have seen the latest revival in the UK through artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black man?!
A police officer accused him of violating the law because of "racism."
A New York caregiver accused the couple of being discriminated against after receiving texts that had been sent from a widow who said she was "another black man."
The couple denied they were racist, equating the alleged act as "extortion."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two, expressed her disappointment when she learned that the new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, was black when she came to work on the first day in 2016.
"I don't want to see you," Ms. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband.
She wanted to send the text to her husband, otherwise she had sent the message to Maurice, twice.
After realizing his mistake, Plasco-Flaxman who felt "uncomfortable" had fired Maurice, and said that the former caretaker, an African-American, was not doing a good job and he expected a caretaker's presence from the Philippines, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for a day's work and sent home with Uber.
Now, Maurice bribed the couple to get compensation on dismissal, and demanded compensation in $350 a day for six months, in exchange for the loss of residence he had offered, despite no contract.
"I want to show them, look, you shouldn't do that," he told the Post on Friday, adding "I know it's discrimination."
The couple have responded to accusations that they are racist, saying the act of ending Maurice's service was reasonable because they felt the woman was unreliable after insulting the woman's remarks.
"My sister sent me something she didn't mean.
He's not a racist.
We are not racists," husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
"But will you put your child's care on someone you've done cruelly, even if it's a mistake?
Your new baby is born?
No, no."
Equipping the alleged act as "extortion", Plasco said his wife had only two months to give birth and was in a "difficult situation."
“You want to wear someone in a situation like that?
"It's not a good thing," added the investment manager.
As the case progressed, the public opinion court quickly condemned the couple on social media, attacking them against their actions and logic.
Paddington's publishers are worried readers will find it difficult to connect with talking bears, a new letter reveals
Bond's son, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the position of the person who reads the book first before the book is published.
It's really heartbreaking now that we know about Paddington's success."
She said her father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before inspiring to write a children's book, a little toy bear, was optimistic about her work being rejected, the woman added, the 60th anniversary of the book's publication as a "sweetheart" after her father's death last year.
About Paddington, he described as "the most important member of our family," he added, his father was proud of his success in the end.
"The father of a man who is silent, he is not a man who likes to talk big," he said.
"But, because Paddington's too alive for him, it's like you feel like you have a child who achieves something you're proud of even if it's not who you make it.
I feel like he sees Paddington's success like that.
Although the bear was his creation and imagination, he always gave credit to Paddington himself."
My son is sick and I need to say goodbye on the phone.
After landing, the girl is sent to the Hospital Louis Pasteur 2, Nice in a hurry where the doctor has worked hard to save her life.
"Nad calls me often to say that the situation is bad and he will not be able to be saved," said Mrs Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad saying he's going to die in two minutes and I need to say goodbye to him.
And I did that.
I said, "Tashi, I love you, honey.
I'll be by your side soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicine given by the doctor to pump his heart slowly out and leave his system.
He died before his time and this was all turned off.
I just sat there and waited, knowing this was all going to happen.
I can't cry or scream or cry because I'm in a situation surrounded by family and people.
I had to hold on."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now in, saddened by the loss of her child, boarded a plane with other passengers - who did not know about the bitter experience she had.
"No one knows," he said.
"I put my head down, and tears were pouring out at all times.
It was hard to describe, but on this journey I felt sympathy for Nad.
He needs my love and understanding.
I know how much she loves him.”
A woman sent a postcard to avoid suicide on a bridge.
Two women who lose a loved one who kills themselves, work to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted a letter on the Welsh bridge with an inspirational message and phone number to contact for support.
Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 years old when he began to experience depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any mom to feel the way I feel every day," she said.
Davis, 45, lives in Lydney, said his son was a potential junkie with an infectious smile.
"Everyone knows him with his smile.
They always say that their smile can liven up any room."
However, he stopped working before he died, because he was "in a really dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old sister at the time, met her brother after her brother committed suicide.
Davis said: "I'm worried that this will continue to cause the effect of other things to happen."
Davis created the card, "to inform people that there is someone you can meet and talk to, even if he is a friend.
Don't just sit still - you need to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs. Davies for many years, lost Mark, her husband for 15 years, shortly after the death of Mark's mother.
"He didn't tell me he felt sad or depressed or anything," he said.
A few days before Christmas we saw a change in his mood.
He's so sad on Christmas Day - When the kids open their presents, he's not looking at them or anything."
He said the death of his partner was a big trauma to them, but they had to get past him: "He made a big hole in the family.
It made us split up.
But we have to continue and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future depends on when the FBI launches an investigation.
"I think, if we can get what he wants - a limited-time investigation, a limited scope - we can lead to unity," Flake said on Sunday, adding that the "kiss-kiss" committee was in a stalemate based on beliefs that had been rooted in turmoil.
Why don't Kavanaugh and Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their pride is due to the appearance.
The midterm elections are due in just five weeks, and on November 6 - if, as expected, the Republican decision is not satisfactory, they will become weaker to get the people they want to run for the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush has made a call to the Senators, lobbying them to support Kavanaugh, who once worked in the White House for Bush and through Bush has met his wife Ashley, who became Bush's secretary.
What will happen after the FBI makes a report?
The polls will be held in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats meet.
It is not yet clear whether Kavanaugh will get 50 votes from the Senate seat, which will allow Mike Pence, vice president, to equalize the series and confirm his position at the Agong Court.
North Korea's number of smugglers 'down' under Kim
The number of North Koreans to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un took power seven years ago, according to South Korean lawmakers.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the ministry of Southern unification, said there were 1,127 respondents last year - up from 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said tighter border controls between North Korea and China and high rates of smuggling were a major factor.
Pyongyang does not give any public opinion.
Most of the North Koreans will be offered to South Koreans.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most fled through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the Military Free Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers the perpetrators as illegal immigrants rather than as political refugees and often sends them back forcibly.
Relations between the North and the South - technically still at war - have improved in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for a discussion centered on a sustained nuclear decommissioning negotiation.
This comes after a historic June meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed in a common sense to move towards a nuclear-free direction on the Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused U.S. sanctions that have slowed negotiations since the event.
"Without any trust from the United States, our country's security is not guaranteed and therefore, we will not begin the disarmament of nuclear weapons first," Ri said in a speech at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "emotional," and it's inappropriate to serve in Agong Court
Minority Council Chairman Nancy Pelosi called Agong Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh "emotional" and said his position was inappropriate to hold a position in Mahlamah Agong.
Pelosi made the following review in Saturday's interview at the Texas Tribune Party in Austin, Texas.
"I believe if a woman behaves like that, they will say the woman is 'emotional,'" Pelosi said of the reaction to Kavanaugh's statement before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh has emotionally denied allegations that he had committed sexual assault on Dr. Christine Blasey Ford while they were both teenagers.
During the opening of his reality, Kavanaugh was cheering, sometimes almost screaming and crying when talking about family and while in high school.
He also explicitly denounced the Democrats on the committee, calling the accusations against him "over and over the well-designed name pollution" handled by the still angry liberal Hilary Clinton killed in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said he believed Kavanaugh's statement confirmed that he did not deserve to hold a position in the Agong Court, as it showed that he was heavy on the Democrats.
"I feel that he has disqualified himself and his actions against the Clintons and Democrats," he said.
Pelosi was horrified when asked if he would try to sue Kavanaugh if he was approved, and if the Democrats got a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'm going to say this -- if he doesn't speak the truth to Congress and the FBI, he doesn't deserve to hold office in the Agong Court, but only in the court he's in right now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in D.C. Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, he was concerned about Kavanaugh's decision against the Able Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as he was framed as a conservative court.
In confirmation proceedings, Kavanaugh avoided answering whether he would change the Agong Court's decision.
"This is not the time for someone who is proud, hard on the side to go to court and expect us to say, 'It's a fun step,'" Pelosi said.
And women need to show it.
It’s a reasonable nista word, a month-long and years-long inflammation abounds, and he can’t withstand anger without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's anything special, do you agree?"
"I was helped by a woman, an executive in one place, who said she was also crying when she was angry, but had created one technique, if she was angry and started crying, she would say to the person she was talking to, "You may think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm getting angry."
And then he went on.
And I think that's a wise suggestion."
Crying is allowed as a way of expressing anger because it is always misunderstood.
One of the most memorable memories of the old work, in an office dominated by men, I found myself crying with an unstoppable sense of anger, I was pulled by an older woman on the side of the neck - a cold manager I was running - drew me into the staircase.
"Don't show them your tears," he told me.
"They don't know what you're missing.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy to make you sad."
Patricia Schroeder, a former congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart during her presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Hart was arrested for having a difficult relationship in a boat called Monkey Business out of the game, Ms. Schroeder, deeply disappointed, felt there was no reason to stop him from joining the presidential campaign.
"It wasn't a carefully designed decision," he said, laughing at me 30 years later.
"There are seven more candidates who compete and they don't need another candidate.
Some call it Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Due to the events at the end of the campaign, the woman was left behind in an attempt to set up a tube, and she vowed not to compete until she got $2 million.
It was a futile struggle.
He found his supporter who gave $1,000 to the man would give him only $250.
"Do they think I can get a discount?" he said.
When he spoke that he would not launch a formal campaign, he felt a variety of feelings - thankful to those who supported him, disappointed with the system that made it easier for him to ask for a donation and that targeted non-candidates, and angry at sexism - and he felt awkward.
"You're going to think I'm having a broken soul," Schroeder recalled about how the media reacted to him.
"You'll think Kleenex is my corporate agent.
I remember when I thought back then, what would I put on my birthstone?
"He's crying?"
The U.S.-China trade war could benefit Beijing
The outbreak of the U.S.-China trade war could be devastating, and even though the battle has not yet ended, the dispute between the two countries may be beneficial to Beijing in the long run, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump has issued the first warning earlier this year by imposing tariffs on Chinese exports including solar panels, iron and aluminum.
The most noticeable increase comes this week with a new tariff that will impact $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion) worth of items, the effect being like taxing over half of the goods entering the US from China.
Beijing responded in the same way every time, most recently, charging tariffs of five to ten percent on over 60 billion American goods.
China has pledged to repay the U.S. each for its actions, and the world's two largest economies are not impressed.
To make Washington retreat means submitting to the will of the United States, but subduing the United States in public is too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
According to experts, if Beijing plays the cards correctly, U.S. trade war pressure could positively support China in the long run by lowering the dependency between the two countries.
"A quick political decision by whether Washington or Beijing can initiate an uncontrolled economic situation in any country and seems more dangerous than what observers have been informed before," said Abigail Grace, a felow researcher who focused on Asia at the Center for New American Security, a think tank.
Syria 'ready' for return of political refugees, foreign minister says
Syria said the country was ready for the return of its political fugitives and asked for help to re-develop the country destroyed by the seven-year war.
Speaking at the United Nations Agong Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the situation in the country is improving.
"Today the situation in the country is more stable and safe, thanks to the progress made to combat terrorism," he said.
The government will continue to restore areas that have been destroyed by terrorists to restore to normal.
The situation is now ready for a voluntary return of refugees, to a country they are forced to leave due to violence and unilateral economic measures that affect their daily lives and eyes.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled since the war began in 2011.
Six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome aid to develop the destroyed country.
But he insisted the country would not receive conditional aid or aid from countries that support the insurgency.
Europe wins Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup by killing the U.S. team with a final score of 16.5, 10.5 dit Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The U.S. has now lost six consecutive European lands and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when Denmark's captain Thomas Bjorn got the 14.5 matches needed to beat the United States.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson, struggling throughout the match, released a tee blow into the water in the par-3 of the 16th hole, surrendering to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer excelled in all rounds, becoming 1 out of 4 players who were 5-0-0 since the format of the game began in 1979.
American player Jordan Spieth was drawn out in 5&4 by the player who is in the lowest position in the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's top player, Dustin Johnson, dropped 2nd and 1st to Ian Poulter from England who may have played the last time for the Ryder Cup.
The eight-time Ryder Cup veteran, Spanish player Sergio Garcia was the all-time European winner with a 25.5-point peak.
“I rarely cry but I can’t stand it today.
This is a difficult year.
I'm grateful Thomas chose me and trusted me.
I'm so happy to have the cup back.
It's for the team, and I'm happy to be able to help," Garcia said after the European Cup.
He has handed over the task to John Ram who has defeated U.S. legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in a single game on Sunday.
"The feeling of pride I feel, when I beat Tiger Woods, I grew up watching him play," Rahm, 23, said.
Woods lost all matches in France and now has a 13-21-3 Ryder Cup record.
Unusual statistics by one of the greatest players, won 14 major championships second place only on Jack Nicklaus.
USA teams struggled throughout the weekend to find a track, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played good golf games throughout the match.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk said after a disappointing performance from his team, "I'm proud of them, they're working hard.
Sometime this morning we gave a shoulder to the European troops.
We're trying our best.
Congratulations to Thomas.
He's a good captain.
All 12 players have played very well.
"We're going to regroup, I'm going to work with the American PGA and the Ryder Cup Committee and we're going forward.
I love all these 12 guys and I'm proud to be a captain.
You need to lift the hat.
We have been defeated."
