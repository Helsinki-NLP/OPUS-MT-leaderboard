Applauded.
We got together around noon.

I was inspired by your design.
I'm excited, Tom.
I'm stuck, Tom.
I'll be in Boston all week.
I'm in charge of the propaganda.
I'm inclined to believe you.
I am in love and confused.
I'm in love with Tom's girlfriend.
I'm in.
I am irreplaceable.

I'm not even sure he likes me.
I'm not even tired.
I'm not that warm either.
I can't find the equation.
I'm not a resident.
Tom doesn't give me enough help.
I'm not going anywhere.

I'm one of your students.
I'm only eighteen.
I'm just here to help him.
I'm on my way right now.
I am open to everything.
I motivated you.
I was left without a surprise.
I won't be in town next week.
I moved into a new house last week, and I studied the library yesterday.
I've been through the shock.
I don't mind waiting here at all.
I'm hungry for him.
I'm longing for him.
I'm pretty hungry!
I'm pretty sure Tom likes you.
I'm pretty excited.
I'm insisting.

It's all over my head from the French language.
I'm running out of wars.
I'm asleep.
I'm so scared.
I'm so glad I'm home.
How proud I am of you.
I'm sorry, but I'm not into it right now.
I'm sorry, but my answer is rejected.
I'm sorry, but you're wrong.
I'm sorry I didn't give you any more support.
I'm sorry I lied to you before.
I'm sorry I even said something to them.
I'm sorry I wasted your time.
I'm sorry I woke you up.
Forgive me for falling in like this.
I'm kind of hungry.
I'm starving.
I'm still mad at Tom.
I'm not ready yet.
I'm still at work.
I'm still thinking about her.
I'm still thinking about him.
I'm still worried about her.
I'm stronger than you.
I'm stuck here in Boston.
I'm studying French.
I study music.
What a coward I am.
How retarded I am!
I need to help them.
I'm sure he'll pass the exam as soon as possible.
I'm sure I can find him.
I'm sure I can find them.
I'm sure I'm right.
I'm not sure that's exactly what it was.
I'm sure Tom's never been to Boston.
I'm sure Tom agrees with me.
I'm sure Tom didn't know about that.
I'm sure Tom will know what's best.
I'm sure Tom's gonna do it this way.
I'm sure Tom would love to see you.
I'm sure you'll be fine.
I'm sure you'll make it.
I'm sure your intentions are clear.
I'm sure you've seen everything you need.
I'm sure.
I'm surprised it's so easy.
And I'm surprised myself.
I'm surprised that Tom went with Mary.
I'm surprised to see you here.
I'm going to lunch.
I'll take Tom for a walk.
I'm taking you to school.
I'm talking about him.
I'm in trouble.
I'm telling you, you could be a professional drummer.
I'm crazy.
I'm the crazy one.
He just wanted to meet me, Tom.
I got kicked.
I'm the one you want.
I'm the only one here who knows where you hid Tom's jewels.
I'm the only one who understands Tom.
I'm planning to go to Boston for Christmas.
I'm weak.
I'm thirty.
I'm thirty.
I'm three hours away.
Between me and Tom, it's perfect.
I'm fine.
I'm tired, I'm going to bed.
I'm tired of your constant complaints.
I'm Tom's neighbor.
I'm too low.
I'm too young to die.
I'm dead serious.
I'm hot.
I'm doing my best.
I'm trying to avoid them.
I'm trying to explain this to you in such a way that you understand it.
I'm trying to give you a chance to do the right thing.
I'm trying to help Tom.
I'm trying to work.
I'm 12 years old.
I'm not armed.
I have the impression that it rains all day.
I'm upset.
I need to put water in the radiator.
I'm probably losing my hearing.
I have to go shopping at home.
I need to find a way to help them.
I must have parked my car somewhere else.
I have to get some rest.
I have to go.
I need to talk to you.
I must've forgotten.
I'm so busy getting ready for the party.
I'm very busy here.
I'm very confused.
That's all I need.
I look forward to seeing the new version of Tatooine.
I'm so sorry, but I seem to have lost your sunshine.
I'm waiting for him to come back.
I'm waiting for it to turn green.
I'm waiting for the semaphore to change.
I'm walking with her.
It's hot.
I'm a tree.
I'm wet.
I'm willing to help.
I'm willing to pay you a lot of money to do that.
I'm with the one I want to be with.
I now work in Boston.
I'm working on it.
I'm at work tomorrow.
I'm working.
I'm worried about your health.
I'm afraid Tom's going to sneak in.
I'm writing my will.
I'm your new partner.
In accordance with our contract, he stopped asking me personal questions.
We did it.
Most likely, they won't pay the money back.
In case of emergency, what number should I call?
I almost had a heart attack.
I need a box of kids.
I need a clean shirt.
I need a musical instrument.
I need an ashtray.

I need to get us some help.
I need to help Tom.
I need to know who helped her.
I need Tom's address.
I need Tom.
I need to spend more time at work.
I need to understand.
I need you a little.
I need you for a second.
I need you more than you can imagine.
I need you to find them.
I need you to open the door for me.
I’ve never changed my sleep schedule.
I had no doubt about that.
I didn't lose hope for a moment.
I didn't get an answer from her.
I didn't get an answer from them.

I have not learned how to write.

I didn't want that at all.
I never meant to cheat on you.
I never wear a suit.
I'll never win.
In Hawaii, you can cruise all year.
In many ways, men and women are very different.
In my opinion, Tom is innocent.

I don't feel that way about you anymore.
In order to prepare the soil for planting, you need to prune it.
In the forest, the monkeys descended from the tiny ones.
In the middle of the city there is a fountain.

In what situations would you do that?
In what situations would you use it?

I owe a lot to Tom.
I owe Tom for this.

I love dogs more than cats.
I'd rather goat cheese than cow cheese.

I must sound funny.
I promise you I won't do anything to hurt you.
I punched him in the fork.
I pressed the button to turn the radio on.
I drew the word "Alice" to highlight it.
I suggested it.
I put three coffee spoons of sugar in your tea.

I've given up.
Growing goods.
The Iranians are a peaceful people.
I read his book.
I read Tom's story.
I knew I hadn’t eaten yet.
I'm really getting married.
I really do like you.
I really don't know.
I really like what your hair looks like.
I really like the wines.
I really like your web-page.
I really love your older sister.

The iron is stronger than the gold.
Isaac Newton died as a virgin.
I said I'd bring him.
I said maybe it'll shut down.
I told you to open the door.
I said we're closed.
I agree.
Is there anyone in there?
Is anyone surprised?
Did something go wrong?
I was carrying a spirit.
I saw an unidentified flying object.
I saw her a week ago.
I just saw him.
I saw him playing cards with all of them.
I saw him there.
I saw my sister drop the letter.
But I didn't see anything.
I saw that.
I saw them.
I saw the sweater in the sink.
I saw Tom do that.
I saw Tom and Mary.
I saw Tom.
Is Boston far away?
Is Buddhism a religion or a philosophy?
Is he aware of what he did?
Are Potatoes Caloric?
I don't see a conspiracy here.
"I see," said the blind man.
I see Tom every day.
I see you're awake.
I sent Tom to Boston with me.
I went early to catch the first train.
Are they all busy?
Are they all happy?
Is everyone having fun?
Is everything there?
Is he breathing?
Is his aunt eating an apple or a banana?
I said with my head.
I definitely need to buy you a drink.
I should be sorry for them.
I need to take her home.
I need to pack up.
I need to go change my clothes.
I should be going home.
I shouldn't have believed her.
I shouldn't have done it without you.
I shouldn't have eaten so much ice cream.
I shouldn't have gone to Tom's.
I should sue him.
I should have a look.
I should try to help them.
I should have asked her first.
I should have asked them first.
I should have asked you first.
I had to be cultured.
I should've checked.
I should've done it yesterday.
I should've known you'd be here.
I should've refused.
I showed her my room.
Are you studying outside?
Is it done?
Is it far from here?
Is Tatooeba really too slow today, or does it seem to me?
Is that the last lesson?
Is it time to go?
Is that true?

I'm sleeping standing.
I slept like a curse.
I was sleeping in the shed.
I slept on the bus.
In the face of it, I cut the sandwich.
Did Mike stop drinking alcoholic beverages? No.
I was smiling.
Isn't it exciting?
Is it not possible that Tom did this?
Isn't that unusual?
Isn't that dangerous?
Isn't that enough?
Isn't that too much?
Isn't that good news?
Isn't that the guy who wants to buy your house?
Isn't this great?
I kind of like it.
I spent the whole day cleaning the snow.
Is she a taxi driver?
Is she pregnant or just fat?
Is she really that beautiful?
Is that your mother?
I stared at the man.
I began to see him.
I started thinking about him.
I've done something weird.
Is that what Tom does?
Is that all we need?
Is that a rhetorical question?
Does that mean “yes” or “no”?
Is there a word at all?
Is that necessary?
Is that necessary?
Is that what I'm talking about?
Is that satisfying?
Is that Tom's coat?
Does Tom think that's what happened?
Is that what you did to them?
So that's where Tom is?
Is that why I'm here?
Is that why you're here?
Is that why you don't want to help him?
Is that why you don't want to help us?
Is that your package?
Is the bridge safe?
Is the coffee hot?
Is the house ready?
Is the lake deep?
Is it paid for delivery?
Is there a doctor here who knows English?
Is there food?
Is there anyone else?
Is there anyone else here?
Is there any sugar?
Is there anything else I can do for you?
Is there a problem?
Is there a reward?
Is there anything specific you want to see?
Is it about Tom?
Is this a good time to talk?
Is this in place?
Is it a real diamond?
Is that moral?
Is this exactly in English?
Is this Jupiter or a bull?
Is this our cabin?
Is it your radio?
Is anyone sitting here?
Is there a free space?
Was that all the excitement?
Is this your picture?
Is this your bag?
Is this your bag or his?
Is this yours, Tom?
I still can't believe Tom's gone.
Somehow he still doesn't believe me.
I still don't get it.
I still don't know how to do that.
I still don't understand women.
I still respect him, Tom.
I still want a horse.
I stole it from them.
Does Tom know how to swim?
Is Tom back?
Is Tom conscious?
Does Tom contribute?
Is Tom dead?
Is Tom dying of cancer?
Is Tom funny?
Is Tom in Boston?
Is he interested in Tom?
Is Tom looking for them?
Are you angry, Tom?
Is Tom safe?
Is Tom still alive?
You gonna talk to Tom?
Is Tom there alone?
Is Tom with you now?
I've stopped paying attention to Tom.
Burning cigarettes in prison.
I'm studying art history.
Suddenly, I felt old.
I'm suffering from asthma.
I suggest you learn more.
I suggest we focus on asking for a way out of the cave.
I suggest we go home.
I'm so hungry for you.
I suggest you send someone out to see what's going on.
I guess I should go and talk to Tom.
I guess that's okay.
That's what I doubted.
I suspect Tom's broken the window.
I was swimming in the river.
I swear it wasn't me.
I swear it was them.
I swear, I wouldn't get caught with you if I burned you down and you were the last bucket of water.
I'm drowning every day.
Are you still working on the freezer?
Is your head full of straw?
I'm taking this opportunity to thank her.
Italian cops are driving me crazy.
I talked to my advisors about what items to take.
This whole thing makes sense.
Seems pointless.
It always happens the same way.
It can't be a coincidence.
So it wasn't.
It's not possible!
They're for you now.
It was doing a lot more than I expected.
Never, never, never, never, ever could have happened here.
There's no way it was Tom.
That would be a disaster.
That would be good.
I didn't care.
We didn't mention that.
It didn't get that bad.
That disappoints him.
It would look good.
I don't mind.
It's not gonna get better.
It doesn't look very different.
It doesn’t matter that you don’t want to do it; in any case, you have to.
It doesn't matter.
It doesn't seem to help.
Doesn't sound like they know what.
That doesn't surprise me.
I teach Chinese.
I'm studying English.
It's right there.
That gave me an idea.
I have something to do.
It had to be done.
It must have come from somewhere.
It depends on your decision.
It happened too fast.
It's happening.
It's happening.
It's getting colder.
It has nothing to do with happiness.
It wasn't easy.
It has sentimental value.
I've been thinking all day.
I think about him every day.
I think he's right.
I think he's right.
I think he's hiding something?
I think I can.
I think I could get used to seeing you every day.
I think I'd better help him.
I think I'd better help them.
I think I found one of those.
I think I'm real.
I think I know him.
I think I know how to find him.
I think I know how to stop it from happening again.
I think I'm going out to eat.
I think I'm gonna go see Tom and see what he's like.
I think I love you.
I think I made a pretty good statement.
I think I write pretty well.
I think I'm a pretty normal guy.
I think it's possible for me to sneeze.
I think I'll be fine.
I think I'm supposed to sniff it out, Tom.
I think I should've called for help.
I think I speak French quite well.
I think it's precarious without any help.
I think it would be best to stay here for a while.
I think it's time we started to stop.
I think it's time to go.
I think it's time we started to stop.
I think it would be a mistake to borrow Tom's money.
I think I figured out what time it was.
I think I made a mistake.
I think I might be able to help her.
I think she's good at dancing.
I think so.
I think this hotel is going to be a little expensive.
I think it's terrible.
I think that's brilliant.
I think it's Tom.
I think you're right.
I think the box is empty.
I think they saw me.
I think Tom can help.
I think Tom's gone.
I think Tom's not breathing anymore.
I think Tom's soulless.
I think Tom's a conservative.
I think Tom's brave.
I think Tom's crazy.
I think Tom's dying.
I think Tom's funny.
I think Tom's wonderful.
I think Tom's tough.
I think Tom's hurt.
I think Tom's a villain.
I think Tom's fine.
I think Tom's fat.
I think Tom's a little shy.
I think Tom's a jackass.
I think Tom's rich.
I think Tom's right.
I think Tom's tough.
I think Tom's empty.
I think Tom's sensitive.
I think Tom knows who stole my purse.
I think Tom might have a boyfriend.
I think Tom's moved to Boston.
I think Tom needs a ride to the airport.
I thought Tom was just bluffing.
I don't think Tom's gonna go.
I think we can get him.
I think it's better not to drink water.
We'd better not go out in a storm like this.
I think we'll join in, too.
I think we're close to a solution.
I think we're ready.
I think we should call him.
I think we should help him.
I think we should hire him.
I think we need to wait a little longer.
I think we've had enough.
I think we found one.
I think you did it.
I think you did it on purpose.
I think you know the rules.
I think you know Tom.
I think you know what I'm interested in.
I think you know who I am.
I think you're gonna have to help them.
I think you should call him.
I think you're Spanish.
I think you're exaggerating the problem.
I think you're too sick to go to school.
I think you should pick her.
I think you should do this on your own.
I think you're gonna help me.
I think you've been here before.
I think you've lived in the jungle too long.
I think you've been extorted.
I think you're spending too much time with Tom.
I think you should go out on your own with this.
I think it's helped enough.
I thought about what Tom said.
I was thinking about you.
I thought she had bigger tits.
I thought he was there.
I thought I'd call him for help.
I thought I'd call them for help.
I thought I lost all my money, but it looks like I was wrong.
I thought I'd never find him.
I thought I'd never find Tom.
I thought it was causing me.
I thought you'd already found a place to stay.
I thought they found him.
I think this is over.
I thought Tom had a good time.
I thought Tom was going to retire.
I thought maybe Tom knew where Mary put the key.
I thought Tom might not want to come with us.
I thought Tom was from Boston.
I thought Tom was gonna be here.
I thought Tom was sick.
I thought Tom was gonna be busy.
I thought Tom wouldn't want any help.
I thought Tom wouldn't want to come with us.
Didn't we agree?
I thought we could help you.
I thought we'd sit here for a while and talk.
I thought we'd go to the museum together.
I think you're gonna have a gulp job.
You didn't want the prize, did you?
I thought you found someone else.
I thought you'd lost your watch.
You hate him, don't you?
He seemed tired to me.
I thought you might be able to help.
I thought you might be interested in finding out.
I thought you were only dating girls who were inferior to you.
So you didn't know how to play the piano?
Did you say you know how to swim?
So you didn't say you wanted to come with us?
I thought you played chess better than me.
I thought you were crazy about Tom.
I thought you were funny.
I thought you'd live with us.
I thought you were in Boston.
I thought you were planning on staying in bed all day.
I didn't think you'd be busy.
I thought you weren't gonna like Tom.
I'm in terrible pain here.
Mary gets nervous when Tom leaves the lid of the mug running.
It is a multi-phase process.
It depends on whether we buy it or not.
It's his first day at school.
It's impossible for me to answer the question.
There's no theoretical chance I'll finish the job in a day.
Today it's less humid than yesterday.
It's not cool at all.
It's not expensive.
It's not over yet.
It's not that bad.
It's not wrong.
Can I use that for you?
I'm paying.
He's not coming around.
They say the old chapel is damned.
It's starting to get into our head that we can't ignore nature.
Today is warmer than yesterday.
It is worth quoting a famous passage from his essay.
He writes on his forehead.
It's written on his face.
It kind of seems wrong to me.
I just don't feel safe about it.
It just sounds boring.
It's happening all the time.
It'll be all right.
It will be Christmas soon.
It will be hard to convince them.
It'll be all right.
It'll be worth it.
He looked terrible.
It looked funny.
Looks like you're right.
Looks very tasty.
It looks different.
It seems familiar to me.
It looks like an egg.
Looks like I had too much to drink yesterday. I don't care.
Looks like the two are in a relationship again.
Looks like these two have calmed down.
Looks like we're having a snowy Christmas this year.
Looks like we're the only ones here today.
Looks good.
That's how I got closer to Tom.
Fuck me.
I'm worried.
It could be dangerous.
Maybe it'll be hard.
Maybe it's too late.
It may sound like a proposal, but it was an order.
Maybe it'll turn tonight.
Maybe it's weird.
Maybe it'll be a long time before you see me again.
Maybe it's him.
It could be risky.
Maybe it's not just a coincidence.
It could be raining today.
It must have been her.
I must have been amazed.
It has to be perfectly symmetrical.
I told them when I saw them, and I told him.
I told the police that Tom was with me at the time.
I told Tom about you.
I told Tom he wasn't welcome here.
I told Tom the truth.
I told Tom to tell you that.
I told you I couldn't.
I told you it would be hard to do.
I told you my dad died when I was thirteen.
I told you this was going to be tough.
I told you the truth.
I'm a teacher, too.
I went on a trip to Boston.
I took care of that.
I remember.
I got back on the bus.
I took Tom to lunch.
I've got my pants off.
I couldn’t sleep all night.
I totally get it.
It probably won’t be worth waiting for.
He came back two days ago.
It resulted in a lot of difficulties.
I tried to explain it to him, but he didn't.
I tried to find Tom.
I tried to get him to come.
I tried to make them stop.
I tried to pretend to be something I wasn't.
Honestly, I'm sorry about that.
I trust the teacher.
I'm trying not to miss you.
I'm trying not to break up.
It's about to turn.
That's a classic.
It was a real disaster!
It is advisable to check if there may be any negative effects if you drink alcohol while you are drinking the medication prescribed to you.
It's a children's game.
It's a good system.
It's all in the file.
It's all in the room.
It's all over.
It's all over now.
That's all they're talking about.
It's all very strange.
Just a little while, and it'll be over.
It's gonna be midnight in Boston.
It's almost summer.
She's gonna have to go a little bit longer.
Epten is fun.
It's 7:00 already.
It's eleven o'clock.
It's already open.
That's a minor mistake.
It's a miracle you survived.
It's an honor.
There's nothing to think about.
It's a shame you ruined everything.
It’s about integrity.
That's a reasonable compromise.
That's a fake trail.
It's a risky plan.
It's a shame the concrete doesn't burn.
We're on foot now.
It's a simple thing.
It's a special occasion.
It's a stupid rule.
It's a great idea, but it'll take a lot of work.
They've unraveled it.
It's just Macy's got me.
It's been coming back for a week, up and down.
It's been three weeks since Tom moved to Boston.
It's been too long.
This week it's extremely warm.
It'd be best if you didn't talk that much.
You'd better be alone.
It is better to be optimistic and to lie than to be pessimistic and to be right.
"It's better to die on your feet than to live on your knees." "Then why are you still alive?"
It's empty.
The sauna's here.
It's new money.
You scared me.
There's no one.
It's time to close.
Study here.
It's generally known that you're not a dear Tom.
It's dark here.
It's deeper than that.
Definitely they are.
Definitely Tom.
It's different now.
It's hard to assess his ability.
It's hard to explain.
It's disturbing.
It's easier like this.
It's easier not to end up in prison than to escape.
It's easy to see why people love Tom.
You can easily distinguish them.
Looks like I misjudged it.
It looks like her style.
I think that’s the only possible conclusion.
Looks very well written.
It's empty.
That's what you need.
It's bad to crawl.
It's exactly ten o'clock.
That’s what happened to the previous one.
It's very rare.
It's fair.
It's Ferr.
It's to protect you.
It's from the Bible.
It's funny.
Watching TV is a lot of fun.
Get dressed.
It's dark.
It's getting harder to breathe.
It's gonna be cruel.
It'll get even cooler.
It's gonna happen soon.
It's good to see you all again.
It's a good training.
It's all right.
It's getting better.
It's so much fun.
It's happened before.
It's happening right now, isn't it?
It's hard to explain.
It's hers.
It's hot here in hell.
That should be possible.
It shouldn't even take this long.
I care what you think about Tom.
It is impossible for him to give up smoking.
It's impossible to get out of the cell.
It's a safe place.
She's in excellent condition.
He's in the basement.
I'm just guessing.
The simple question is de.
It's just fabricated.
Just sit there.
It's a little ahead.
It's locked.
It is made of leather.
It's up to me, Tom.
That's my only hope.
It's nice and fresh.
It's nice and warm.
It’s nice to have such gifts.
It's nice to feel like you need someone.
It's not a big miracle.
It's not a big miracle.
It's noisy here.
It's none of your business!
It's no secret that Tom disagrees with you.
That's not a big priority.
It's not a mistake.
It's not attractive.
It's not the other way around.
It didn't happen that way.
It won’t be easy to do this without a lot of help.
It's not hard to stand out if you're surrounded by fools.
It's nothing scary.
It's not just a guess.
It's not usually a pencil.
There is not enough light to read.
It's not that we're doing something.
It's not my decision.
It's not my fault.
You don't have to.
It's not absurd.
It's not that small.
It's not spring yet.
Don't surprise me.
It's not that deep.
It's not too early.
It's not up to you.
It doesn't happen very often that someone buys a thousand-dollar hat.
It's not worth much.
There was a snowfall.
It's obviously a typo.
It's obvious to everyone that he's in love.
It's just a temporary solution.
Sounds like Tom.
Sounds really loud.
Sounds very good.
It's our job to help them.
It's white across.
It's poison.
His presence is important to me.
It's probably hard.
It's probably true.
It's probably still there.
It's probably still available, though.
It's empty.
Actually, it's very often.
It's delicious.
It's possible I'm not right.
It's quite possible that Tom won't help us at all.
It's very simple.
It's really exciting.
It's really nasty.
It's a real damage.
It's really weird.
It's red.
It's so beautiful.
It's so complicated.
But it's strong!
It's the law!
It's so obvious we don't need evidence.
It's getting darker.
It's still dark outside.
It's still on sale.
It's still working.
It's still not okay.
It's still growing.
It's still there.
It's strange how people in tropical zones eat spicy food like curries.
It's stuck.
Its surface was as flat as a mirror.
It's time for that again.
This is the best steak I've ever tasted.
It's a spider cassette.
I'm so scared of you!
It's time to get to work.
It's time to get up.
It's Tom's office.
It's too impressive.
It's too late to help you.
It is too risky to fight them in a place of their choice.
Epten is strong.
It's bullshit.
It's wrong.
Can't stand the heat.
It is unique and irreplaceable.
It's unnatural.
It's really warm.
I need to see Tom right away.
It's very relaxing.
It's very easy to understand.
It's warm here.
I guess it's nothing.
There's a wind.
It's from work.
You're losing.
It's up to you to ask, Tom.
It's yours.
On the water and it only takes three minutes to scream.
It lasted all night.
It took a lot longer than I thought it would take.
It took me a long time to get rid of those ants.
Looks like you're unexpectedly eloquent.
I turned on the ventilator and directed it to the wall.
I turned on the lamp.
I turned off the TV.
I turned it down, Tom.
It was an honor for me to be asked to speak.
It was so beautiful.
That was a shame.
It was midnight.
This was an arena day.
It was a great series.
That was all my idea.
It was all right here.
It was all so easy.
It was an unbelievable evening.
It was a meeting.
It was a terrible sight.
It was an honor.
It was an offer that I couldn’t refuse.
It was an indebtedness to me that I spent the evening with a smart, spirited, beautiful girl like you.
It was an extraordinary experience.
It was a surprise.
It was a wonderful experience.
It was a tough test.
It was a warm night.
It was a wonderful day.
It was a wonderful day.
It's been a wonderful evening.
This behavior was childish on his part.
It was disgusting.
It was effective.
That was pretty funny.
It was too late.
It was for her.
It was from her.
It was one of them.
Yesterday was fun.
It was night.
It was getting dark.
It was ironic.
It was my fault.
That was my suitcase.
It's nice of you to buy Tom such a nice gift.
It was nice of you to let me stay here in touch.
It wasn't as hard as I thought it would be.
It was not easy for me to admit that I was wrong.
It was not easy to solve this problem.
It didn't matter.
It wasn't my idea.
It wasn't very good.
It was pretty disgusting.
It has been proven that fleas that live on dogs jump higher than those that live on cats.
It was very majestic.
That was pretty funny.
Epten was cheap.
It was really good.
It was really nice.
It was really nice.
That was really touching. That's all.
He smoked a lot.
It was amazing.
You had to.
It was seven and a half.
The day was so beautiful that we decided to go mountaineering.
It was so obvious.
It was disgusting.
He was still there.
Tom gave me the picture that was attached to the hook.
