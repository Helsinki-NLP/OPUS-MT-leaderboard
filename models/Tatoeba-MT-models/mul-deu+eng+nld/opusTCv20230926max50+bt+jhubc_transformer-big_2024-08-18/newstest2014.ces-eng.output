The black box in your car?
While U.S. road designers are trying hard to find money for repairs to the decaying highway network, many are starting to see a solution in a small black box that easily fits into your car’s dashboard.
Devices that track every mile a driver travels and pass this information on to the authorities are at the heart of controversial efforts by Washington and the state planning authorities to renovate the outdated U.S. highway financing system.
Typically, the fad design of highways suddenly sparked intense debate and the emergence of various associations.
The Libertarians met with groups of ecologists and were lobbying for the government to be able to use these small cabinets to record the mileage and perhaps even where you are going – and then use this information to compose a tax return.
The tea party is horrified.
The U.S. Civil Liberties Union is also deeply concerned and has mentioned a number of privacy issues.
And while Congress can’t agree on whether to continue, some states don’t wait for anything.
They find out how they can move over the next decade to a system in which the driver pays for the kilometre of the road he is driving.
Thousands of motorists have already taken the black boxes, some of which have GPS tracking, for testing.
This is a real necessity for our nation.
“It’s not a matter of when we can make a lot of choices,” said Hasan Ikhrata, executive director of the Southern California State Administration Association, which plans to start tracking the mileage of every Californian motorist in 2025.
The way we pay these taxes is changing.
This technology is used for this.
The impetus is the fact that the Road Trust Fund funded by the taxes that Americans pay at the pumping stations is on the bottom.
Americans don't buy as much gasoline as they used to.
Cars go a lot more miles per gallon.
The federal tax itself, 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased in the last 20 years.
Due to the current high price of gasoline, politicians are reluctant to raise taxes even by one cent.
“The gas tax is simply not sustainable,” said Lee Munnich, a transportation policy expert at the University of Minnesota.
His state recently placed a tracking device of up to 500 cars to test this payment system for the affected mile.
“It seems to be the most logical alternative in the long run,” he said.
Experts call it a user fee based on the number of kilometers captured.
It is not surprising that urban liberals like this idea, because taxes can be used to change drivers’ behaviour patterns, which can help, for example, reduce traffic jams and generate greenhouse gases.
California’s designers look at this system when planning strategies to meet the goals set out in the ambitious laws of global warming.
But Republican Bill Shuster (Pennsylvania’s representative), the chairman of the Transportation Committee, said he also sees it as the most functional long-term alternative.
The free market representatives of the Reason Foundation are also inclined to believe that drivers will pay for the miles they have hit.
“It’s not a tax that disappears in a black hole,” said Adrian Moore, vice president of strategy at Reason.
People pay directly for what they get.
The initiative is also supported by two former U.S. transport ministers, who in 2011 asked Congress to go in the direction of paying per kilometre.
Last year, the U.S. Senate approved a $90 million pilot project, which was to include about 10,000 cars.
However, the House of Representatives leadership rejected the proposal and did so due to concerns from rural legislators representing components of the population, whose daily life often means offending many miles for work outside the city.
However, several states and cities are still moving forward on their own.
Oregon is the most ferocious, and the largest experiment in the country included 5,000 drivers.
These drivers will soon start paying the state a tax on the affected kilometers, instead of a tax on gasoline.
Nevada has completed the pilot project.
New York is investigating the project.
Illinois is trying to do this to a limited extent with trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes 17 State Departments of Transportation, along with coastal states in the east (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Florida) is studying how they can implement this change.
However, this concept does not have only supporters.
In Nevada, where the facility was recently equipped with about 50 volunteer cars, drivers were concerned that the government was able to monitor each of their movements.
“The concerns regarding Big Brother surveillance and similar matters were a big problem,” said Alauddin Khan, who heads the management strategy and operations at the Nevada Department of Transportation.
It wasn't something people wanted.
As the pilot project continued, the U.S. Civil Liberties Union in Nevada warned on its website: “It would be very easy to turn these devices into full-fledged surveillance devices.”
There is no need to build a huge technological infrastructure that inevitably expands to record the daily departures and arrivals of individuals.
Nevada is among the few states that are trying to find available technology that would allow the state to track how many miles a car drives, but not exactly when and where.
If you can, Khan said, the public will be calmer.
The hunt for such technology brought some state agencies to a small company in California called True Mileage (true mileage).
This company was not originally involved in the action to help the government in taxing drivers.
She wanted to break through the emerging market for legal liability insurance, where drivers would pay based on how much they go in.
But this device, which is testing, attracts the attention of road network designers because it does not use GPS and delivers only a limited amount of information that is regularly recorded using a modem.
“People will be more willing to go if you don’t track their speed and location,” said Ryan Morrison, CEO of True Mileage.
In some of these pilot programs, there have been a number of major errors.
There are a lot cheaper and less inexpensive ways to do it.
In Oregon, designers are experimenting with giving drivers a choice.
They can choose a device with GPS or without GPS.
Or they may not have to take any facilities and instead decide to pay a flat fee based on the average number of kilometers taken by all the inhabitants of the state.
In other places, they hope that the cautious public will approach this concept if the device is able to do more, not less.
In New York City, traffic officials are trying to develop a tax facility that would be equipped so that parking fees can be paid in addition to providing mileage insurance and to collect data on the speed of other drivers, so the motorists can get off.
“The motorists will be willing to get involved because of the value of the benefits offered to them,” the city’s projection document states.
However, some transport designers would like to know if all the discussions about paying per kilometre are not just a huge crowded issue.
Officials from the San Francisco Bay Metropolitan Transportation Committee say Congress could solve the problem of a bankrupt Road Trust Fund very simply by raising a tax on gasoline.
A one-time or annual tax could be imposed on drivers of hybrid or other vehicles that do not consume a lot of fuel, so they will pay a fair share.
“There is no need for a radical operation when it is enough to take aspirin,” said Randy Rentschler, director of the Legislature and Public Affairs Committee.
If we do, hundreds of millions of drivers will be worried about their privacy and a lot of other things.
Sobotka negotiates for <0xC4><0x8C>SSD.
Social democracies are screwing up, people and grandparents are talking together and planning a joint procedure.
If the Social Democrats get confused within a few weeks, they will sit down at the negotiating table with perfectly-played partners who will put on the table a ready list of demands including ministerial posts.
The <0xC4><0x8C>SSD’s envoys will either swallow the acidic coalition grapes or whisk to a blunt minority government.
Bohuslav Sobotka crashed for the first time after four days, when he was carried on a wave of sympathy.
Yesterday, he failed to control the political guild and, above all, to force the convicted liars to resign.
For the time being, only he and the other team members will be the confirmed negotiator for the party until after the key meeting of the Central Executive Committee (CEC).
I apologise to the members of the Grammy and now to the citizens.
He is not lying, in his personal life or in public.
"It was a mistake," said Michal Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek, after a speech by the narrowest leader of social democracy.
He added that he is not in the position of First Vice-President.
"I will communicate my decision on November 10 to the <0xC3><0x9A>VV," Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek said.
The vice-president of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k <0xC5><0xA0>kromach, and the head of the parliamentary club, Jeron<0xC3><0xBD>m Tejc, also spoke.
However, he said that he was elected just two days ago.
The two MPs said they would do everything possible to make the 50-member <0xC4><0x8C>SSD club sound with one voice.
To the absurd theatre, Michal Hasek imposed the crown with the phrase: "I have been a member of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD for fifteen years, I have always been loyal to its brand and I have respected the decisions of the party bodies."
Or another lie in the live stream.
Or did he forget, in his call for Sobotko’s resignation and his removal from the negotiating team, that the August <0xC3><0x9A>VV decided that Bohuslav Sobotka was the party’s candidate for prime minister?
The head of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, however, by summoning the <0xC3><0x9A>VV until next Sunday, made a powerful army of enemies.
His opponents have ten days to flood the emails of 192 members of this body and the media with a dream of various gossip and rumors, possibly recalling the real mistakes of Sobotk’s political career.
There will be strong washing of dirty laundry, there will be signs of dark alliances between the charcoal baron Zdenek Bakala and the Sobotkov wing.
The friendly relationship between Bohuslav Sobotka and the influential lawyer Radk Pokorné will be discussed.
Conflicts are sparked in the South Moravian or Moravian Silesian organization <0xC4><0x8C>SSD.
The words of the Ostrava mayor and Sobotk's ally Peter Kajnar are a warning: "I have signed Charter 77 so that the country is not ruled by idiots."
If the <0xC3><0x9A>VV were to meet this weekend, the liars would probably be forced to sacrifice their functions ritually.
The traitors will smash their heads with ashes and stay.
And the currently winning <0xC4><0x8C>SSD boss will then end up with the nickname Bohuslav Pyrrha.
Martin Doctor on the problems with OH in Sochi: Communication with the Russians is challenging
The corners of his mouth point to a small smile and then only deep breaths: "It's challenging."
Collaborating with the organizing team of the Sochi 2014 Olympics is a bit more complicated, according to Martin Doktor.
We can forget about what happened at the last Olympics.
“Nothing works the same way,” says the head of the Czech Olympic mission.
What exactly is going on?
A lot of things work slower and not so precisely.
It's so confusing.
In terms of invoices, they are relatively fast, in terms of providing information about essential things, not so much anymore.
Maybe we’ve been hanging out with them for three months to give us how the individual villages will be officially labeled so that we can do a whole host of things accordingly.
We're still waiting, and they're still saying they're communicating this thing.
They are still communicating in a number of ways.
Is there at least an Olympic village already in existence?
But it is no longer a disastrous situation.
A month ago, we were walking around empty rooms.
Fortunately, the houses stand.
What does it mean to be empty?
Is the floor ready?
Just basic concrete, so that was the condition a month ago.
But they still have time.
Even though there is a danger that we will come there on January 26th as a preview, there will still be glue there.
And if they didn't hunt, what would happen?
Do you think President Putin would have the military there?
That's the way it's gonna work.
Just so it's not that Olympic Village <0x3D> Potemkin's Village.
They are more likely to fail, for example, to adjust the roads, not to give details.
Maybe they'll have trips in such a state that we'll have to take the girls from the London games with us.
But I believe they put it together somehow.
How many Czech athletes can go to Sochi?
Now there are about 78 of them, although depending on the nomination criteria, this number changes.
Maybe the snipers are probably going to go in the threesome they got out.
No one has to doubt Martina S<0xC3><0xA1>bl<0xC3><0xAD>kov<0xC3><0xA1>, but otherwise it is in development.
Are you still on your way to Sochi?
No, if nothing happens, I should be flying there until January 26th.
What will the houses in the Olympic Village look like?
We even measured some things ourselves by the meter, so that we did not believe only the drawings.
We are also preparing a number of other things, including transportation.
And what does the head of the mission do a hundred days before the Olympics?
I prepare for the annual evaluation of the individual Olympic sports plus I make a regular agenda in terms of communication with the organizing committee in Sochi.
Putin has promised an ecological Olympics, his plan hates giant secret dumps
Winter sports fans are already cutting the meter before the start of the Olympic Games in Sochi, others look to their preparations with increasing concerns.
The Russian Olympic Games, even though it will start in February, are facing another scandal.
According to reports, the Russians fail to fulfill the promise that the preparation and holding of the games will not disturb the nature of the Krasnodar region at the foot of the Caucasus, where in four months thousands of athletes and tens of thousands of visitors will go.
By the way, after the Olympics in Vancouver, the Russians had a very high pitch, and the Canadian Games were listed as the most environmentally friendly in the history of the Olympics.
However, it seems that Russian President Vladimir Putin’s commitment to organise games with “zero waste” has long since taken over.
Reporters of the AP agency last week discovered a huge litter of construction material in the village of Ach<0xC5><0xA1>tyr near So<0xC4><0x8D>a.
Ecologists found the landfill full of building materials, tyres, canisters and insulating foam as early as August, which they immediately reported.
The Russian authorities have boiled and the garbage is gone.
But only for a moment.
Last week, reporters were given a look at a garbage dump the size of three football pitches.
It’s not the only one, there are several in the area of such places, described the British newspaper The Times.
The Russian Railways, a state monopoly, are working on the site, which is building a roughly sixty-kilometre-long road between the Sochi airport and the sports resort.
The company, which already amounted to 280 billion rubles, was led by one of Putin’s close associates Vladimir Yakunin.
In August, the railways prevented the landfill from being founded by one of the subcontractors.
But the locals are already desperate.
According to the inhabitants of Ach<0xC5><0xA1>tyr, the village has been driving trucks full of waste material for three months during the day and at night.
According to experts, the waste threatens to contaminate the local river Mzymtu, other streams and, ultimately, the Black Sea.
“Water from here contaminates Sochi’s water sources for the next ten to fifteen years,” Vladimir Kimayev, an environmental non-profit at EWNC, told the British newspaper.
Illegal landfills are not the only problem of the Russian organizing committee and the government.
The most expensive Olympics in history, according to the opposition, are one big tunnel.
For comparison, the Sochi Games will cost $51 billion, while the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing stood at $43 billion.
Last year’s games in London cost just 19 billion and the aforementioned Vancouver nine billion.
In addition to corruption scandals, project delays and concerns about whether there will be enough snow in the end, there have also been reports that human rights are not respected when working at the sports venues and infrastructure exhibition.
Last month, one of the workers closed his mouth to protest that he had not been paid for two months.
Many are also concerned about how Russian organizers are tampering with a new law that prohibits the promotion of homosexuality during games.
Some visitors are going to support the Russian gays at the Olympics.
Young couple matured to live with parents, new house offers privacy for both generations
The Japanese studio Tai and Associates has been given the task of designing a house on a plot lying on the corner of two streets, with the plot itself somewhat sloping.
In addition, the requirement was that two generations would live in the house, who would like to live together, but at the same time each should have their own clearly separated space.
The younger couple also needed a small office.
The house stands on the corner of two streets and on slightly sloping land.
The architects therefore decided to place each household in one of the floors of the house.
"In creating the design, we respected the family ties, history, and memories associated with the place."
“Three different features of the house are connected by several paths through the exterior of the building, so that everyone is aware of the presence of others, but at the same time they have their own privacy,” the designers explain.
The parents' home is at the level of a garden with an old pine tree, to which family traditions and memories are attached.
The individual parts of the house are easily recognizable from the outside, because they differ in different final layout of the facades.
While the main segment of the building is made of concrete, the surface of which was created using panels from tiles, the part where the office is, is plastered white and the remaining elements remain in a clean concrete design without further modifications.
Many of the walls of the house are completely glazed, thanks to which the interior of the house is very tied to the exterior.
The parents’ home, specifically the kitchen, dining room and living room, surrounds a small garden with a tree that is of great importance to the family.
The connection of the interior with the exterior emphasizes the side wall, which begins in the garden and continues until the living room.
Kitchen space in the home of a young couple.
The young couple enters the house through the main entrance to the hall and then climbs up the stairs to their rooms.
Stairs are the main dominance of the interior of the house.
Their construction allows a lot of natural light to pass through them cascadingly.
This is how the architects tried to distinguish the house from the others and impress it with something unique.
The home of a young couple is treated as one open space with a kitchen, dining room and living room together.
From the terrace it is separated only by a glass wall with sliding doors.

The second floor is composed as one large open space, which freely passes onto the terrace, from where there is a nice view of Tokyo Bay.
The office itself on the top floor is conceived in a pure combination of white and black.
The staircase is the dominant element of the interior of the house.
The young couple enters the house through the main entrance, finds themselves in the entrance hall and from there climbs up the stairs.
Defend academic freedoms, this applies to Zeman and the SDGs.
In recent months, I have repeatedly called on open letters to students, educators and leaders of secondary and higher schools in several regions to defend academic freedoms from the election campaigns conducted by President Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Zeman in schools.
I’ve come across more or less success.
The rector of the Masaryk University in Brno, who refused the lecture of the honorary president of SPOZ - Zemanovci in the pre-election period, even received retaliation in the form of a non-invitation to the celebration of the national holiday of the Czech Republic.
Here is a list of the representatives of schools that were no longer so brave and allowed a visit to Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Zeman: Technical Higher Education in Brno, Hladnov Gymnasium in Ostrava, University of Business in Ostrava, Business Academy in Cologne, University of J.E. Na Ladbe in Purkyna.
Now in Pardubice we are meeting with the continuation of the policy in higher education.
Simeon Karamazov, newly elected Member of the ODS, Dean of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Informatics of the University of Pardubice, refuses to resign from his academic position and, moreover, it seems normal to him.
Professor, it's really not the same as if you were staying in the office of mayor of a smaller town, for example.
Do you want to join the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD Heathmen, who simultaneously perform the function of MP and Heathman and, like them, degrade both professions?
In other words, you tell people that they can handle both of these demanding functions from the left back.
I know, here's an example of Michal Ha<0xC5><0xA1>k, who can even do dozens of functions at once.
But that’s probably not exactly an example of the person you should be driving.
We will also find the opposite and a positive example of MUDr. <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>p<0xC3><0xA1>nky Fran<0xC5><0x88>kov<0xC3><0xA1>, who preferred to leave the parliamentary post in order to be able to fully devote herself to the leadership of the city of Pardubice.
However, the main reason for my recommendation to leave the dean's office is that during the functions you violate the apoliticalness of the academic land of the University of Pardubice.
The management of the Pardubice ODS sees your current position in both posts as an advantage for the University.
However, you will be able to help "your" school even without remaining a dean.
I think your students will have a similar opinion as I and Rector Miroslav Ludwig.
So consider your resignation and keep your face.
Otherwise, you may be counted by the electorate in the next election.
And it doesn't have to be long.
In Kunovice bubble cabbage, chemistry does not add to it
In the coming months, more than a thousand tons of soured cabbage are expected to be produced in the Slovak Fruta Kunovice, which belongs to the Hamé food group.
The season here started in October and lasts about half a year.
Since 1925, he has been producing a healthy treat here in the traditional way, i.e. by stepping straight into big dances.
In modern industrial times, this is a rarity.
Our employees will find in exchange for a nearly ten-kilometre route.
Fifteen to thirty tons of cabbage will fit into each of the ten tanks, filling one takes three shifts," said Slovak Fruta director David Kladroba.
Heads of cabbage drive to the company’s premises directly from their fields farmers mainly from Ostro<0xC5><0xBE>ska and B<0xC5><0x99>eclavska.
The employees of the Fruit then clean the vegetables, remove the skewers and throw them into the turntable.
From here, the already cut cabbage falls into six-meter-deep pools, where boots dressed in white clothes and panties work tirelessly.
In this way, they expel undesirable air.
The last layer of cabbage is coated with sail and loaded with water.
"The green currant then ripens for six to eight weeks for spontaneous milk fermentation without any additives supporting fermentation," the director of Kladroba stressed.
The natural process corresponds to the production in domestic conditions, the individual layers of the workers are injected with salt and chimney.
After flowering, the grass travels to the filling line.
It is packaged in a sweetened infusion into bags or glasses and is sterilized.
Hamé supplies soured cabbage mainly to the domestic and Slovak market.
Interest in it is also registered in some other countries, such as the UK, Ireland and Canada.
Snowden is willing to “cooperate” with Germany in connection with U.S. surveillance
Edward Snowden, a whistleblower for U.S. intelligence services, has announced he is willing to go to Berlin to hand over evidence to the German parliament unless the U.S. National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander are able to provide active answers to questions.
German MP Hans-Christian Strebele met with Mr Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he was granted asylum, and negotiated with him on the possibility of testifying in Germany.
In a letter from Mr Snowden, which he delivered to the media on Friday in Berlin, he said: “Although the result of my efforts has been demonstrably positive, the government has continued to treat the opposition as runaways and is trying to criminalize the political expressions that it does not pursue by demanding lawsuits.
But speaking the truth is not a crime.
In the letter, Mr. Snowden said he believed that the support of the international community could convince the United States government to withdraw the charges against him.
Indictments made by the U.S. Department of Justice include espionage and theft of state property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, German Interior Minister, told Zeit Online: “If Mr. Snowden is ready to talk to German officials, we will find a way to do it.”
Tensions between the U.S. and Germany began to escalate when allegations emerged that the NSA was answering Chancellor Angela Merkel’s phone.
Thomas Oppermann, a member of parliament who heads the parliamentary panel overseeing the intelligence, said that if there was any opportunity to hear Mr. Snowden as a witness “without putting himself in danger and completely destroying relations with the United States,” this should be done.
Mr Sträbele, a member of parliament for the German Greens, posted a photo of him on his Twitter account with Mr Snowden.
On his way to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr. Strebele said that according to a former contract lawyer, Mr. Snowden would not have been able to return to Russia if he left once.
If Mr Snowden were to testify in Germany, he would need reassurance that he would be “safe there,” a member of parliament said.
Mr. Snowden said in his letter that he faced a harsh and persistent campaign associated with the persecution that forced him to leave home.
However, he said that the world’s reaction to his “act of political expression” gave him courage.
Citizens across the board and senior officials – including those in the United States – have assessed the unwarranted disclosure of the ubiquitous surveillance system for the benefit of the public.
The letter includes an offer to cooperate with the German authorities "until the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved."
Killing we are sorry, but we are innocent, defended by representatives of the Khmer Rouge
Nuon Chea was number two in the Khmer Rouge hierarchy and Khieu Samphan is the former head of state.
Under the Khmer Rouge government, which relied on a mixture of Maoism and nationalism between 1975 and 1979, more than three million Cambodians, or at least a quarter of the population, died as a result of exhaustion, hunger, disease, torture and execution.
The infamous S-21 prison commander was sentenced to life imprisonment by the International Criminal Tribunal for Cambodia in 2010.
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan are accused of genocide and crimes against humanity including torture, slavery and murder.
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan defended each other by believing that they were acting in the best interests of the nation and had no idea what the real scope of killing was.
"It's easy to say that I had to know everything, understand everything and therefore intervene and fix the situation," Khieu Samphan said in court on Thursday.
Do you really think I wanted this to happen to my people?
The reality is that I didn’t have any authority,” he added.
Nuon Chea said he had never ordered the Khmer Rouge squads to "mishandle or kill people, refuse food or commit genocide."
But he acknowledged "moral responsibility" for the dead.
"I would like to sincerely apologize to the public, to the victims, to their families, to the entire Cambodian people," he said.
Fifty-year-old Bin Sivla, who lost eleven relatives under the Khmer Rouge regime, told AFP she could not accept Nuon Chea’s apology.
"He lied to us."
"He just wants to be acquitted."
"He doesn't care about the other one," she said.
"If he did not issue orders, his subordinates would not be killed," she added, adding that the leaders of the Khmer Rouge are "worse than the monsters."
The Khmer Rouge's "Minister of Foreign Affairs" Ieng Sara, who died in March, was also due to appear before the court.
In September 2012, his wife, Ieng Thirith, the then Minister of Social Affairs, was found unable to file a dementia trial.
The leader of the Khmer Rouge Pol Pot died in 1998.
Frontier Airlines plans to charge for hand luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to US$100 for placing hand luggage on board at its age.
Frontier Airlines plans to introduce a fee of up to $100 for hand luggage and $2 for coffee or soda, although in its announcement on Wednesday they said passengers would be able to keep the entire can.
The new carry-on baggage charge applies to luggage in the upper storage area, so small luggage under the seat will continue to be free.
Frontier says it will charge $25 if the fee is paid in advance, and $100 if passengers with the payment will wait until they arrive at the gate.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said the $1,000 toll is intended to encourage passengers to pay in advance.
"We wouldn't like to pick this fee," she said.
The airlines began charging the first and second checked baggage in 2008.
Passengers tried to avoid these charges and packed in hand luggage hidden in the storage space as much as they could, so there was often a lack of space in this space.
Fees are one of the ways in which passengers can learn to take fewer things on board.
O'Malley said that the purpose of this new fee is really not to make more money.
The point is that Frontier’s most loyal customers have made it quite clear that it is increasingly difficult to find a place in the upper storage space.
Passengers who purchase tickets on the company’s website will not pay.
This means that one front passenger at Frontier’s gate can bring luggage for which he will pay nothing, while the other front passenger will pay $100 for the same luggage.
O’Malley said the website and billing procedures will be adjusted to ensure that passengers are informed of the fee before they arrive at the gate.
Frontier’s new carry-on baggage charge will not be valid until the summer, but the date has not yet been set.
Passengers often complain about baggage charges and other charges, but the airlines love them.
They claim that handling luggage costs money, and passengers who request this service should pay for it.
Many on Wall Street see an additional baggage charge as a sign that airlines are trying to pick up enough money to cover the cost of air traffic after years of losses.
However, most of the charges for hand luggage were not met.
Spirit Airlines was the first to charge for hand luggage three years ago, and another low-cost airline Allegiant Air followed suit later.
The only company that also has such fees is Hungarian Wizz Air, says aviation advisor Jay Sorensen, who carefully monitors the additional fees.
In his December 2011 report, he estimated that the charge for Spirit’s hand luggage would bring in $50 million a year.
Sorensen, a former head of Midwest Airlines, recently flew with Spirit and wondered what he saw at the gate when passengers encountered an unusual fee for Spirit’s hand luggage.
"Getting on the plane was the smoothest thing I've ever seen in my aviation career," he said.
I was waiting for the gate to see my teeth scribble and quarrels.
The plane was full, he said, "and the landing took place in the mud."
Frontier will also apply fees for coffee, tea, baking soda and juice according to the Spirit model.
Frontier said that passengers who receive lemonade or juice can keep the whole can and the coffee will be supplemented free of charge.
The water will continue to be provided free of charge.
In 2008, US Airways briefly tried to impose beverage charges, but after complaints from passengers, it withdrew seven months later, and no other major airline was able to replicate it.
Frontier’s last move to charge for hand luggage, unless a passenger buys a flight directly from this airline, is its last attempt to direct customers directly to its website.
Airlines pay online travel vendors, such as Orbitz, from $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.
This has prompted all airlines to lead passengers to purchase directly from them, rather than to do so through online travel agencies.
However, Frontier has gone further in this area.
In September, it began giving customers who bought through an online travel agency only half a mile under the loyalty program.
On Wednesday, she cut the reward for flying miles to 25 percent of the way.
So the 1000-mile journey with Frontier purchased through an online travel agency means a reward of 250-mile.
The company also allows customers to choose their seat in advance only if they make a purchase directly through the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base in its home town of Denver, but its business is starting to crumble and losing money.
According to the financial results reported on Wednesday by the company partner Republic Airways Holdings, revenues fell by 9 percent and transport capacity decreased by almost 13 percent in the first quarter.
With the sale of this airline, Republic is trying to solve the financial problems of Frontier.
The NSA does not blame hackers for website crash, but an “internal error”
The secret national security agency said last Friday that its websites fell for several hours last week due to an internal error, not because of an attack by hackers, as some have claimed on the Internet.
“The NSA.gov pages were not accessible for several hours tonight due to an internal error that occurred during the regular update,” the spy agency said in an email statement.
The problem will be resolved during this evening.
The claim that the failure was caused by a DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack is not true.
Earlier this evening, online server sensors noted that NSA websites were not functioning for at least six hours, and the sites are still unavailable to some users.
An NSA spokesperson for ABC News said the agency's internal sensitive networks were not "at all" threatened.
The spokesperson said no classified information was at risk.
At least one group of hacker activists on the Internet claimed that it is responsible for blocking the NSA’s websites through a DDoS attack.
DDoS attacks are designed to flood the target website with information until the servers overload and the page crashes.
This cyber-tactic is relatively simple and the purpose of attacks is not to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
The former super-secret agency of the NSA, which was once nicknamed No such agency, in recent months has become the focus of the public’s attention after a string of foreign and domestic surveillance programs have been revealed, and by targeting the scathing criticism of their agents.
This growing controversy surrounding the agency has sparked earlier speculation that today’s crash was the result of a targeted cyber operation.
Bombardier's profits have fallen due to a decline in deliveries and orders
Canadian aircraft and train manufacturer Bombardier on Thursday announced a 15 percent drop in net profit, which is due to fewer orders and deliveries of aircraft in the third quarter and contract problems in the train unit.
Bombardier, headquartered in Montreal, has also not released any test data for its new CSeries aircraft, nor has it provided up-to-date information as to whether this aircraft will comply with the ambitious plan to start commercial operations from next September.
After the initial test flight about a month and a half ago, the aircraft only flew three times, so the question arises whether the test phase is progressing well.
The results did not meet estimates and stocks on the Toronto Stock Exchange fell by 8 percent.
State-owned bank analyst Cameron Doerksen on Thursday lowered the rating from “higher returns” to “sector performance” with the expectation that the stock market will experience limited growth over the next quarter or two.
“While we generally expected smaller aircraft deliveries, the profit margins in the transport sector disappointed us significantly,” Doerksen said in a report to customers.
As the pilot program continues, we believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for CSeries aircraft.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we assume that market sceptics towards this program will increase.
Bombardier hopes that CSeries aircraft will enter the bottom of the market, which is now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was detected in March, and the first flight took place in September after a few months of delay.
However, the number of binding orders for CSeries aircraft reaches modest 177, as potential buyers are waiting for the test flight results to verify the company’s claims regarding the low consumption and cost savings of this transport aircraft.
There are currently a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and operators.
Pierre Beaudoin, CEO, expected Bombardier to reach its target of 300 binding orders when the first aircraft was put into commercial use.
The leaders also assured analysts and media on Thursday that the program is proceeding according to plan.
"The test aircraft did not stay on the ground longer than expected," Beaudoin said in a conference call, noting that ground tests and software updates were scheduled during the aircraft's break.
Every manufacturer has a different plan.
We decided to complete the first year and then focus on the updates and we did.
This will happen throughout the entire flight program.
According to Bombardier, the second of the five test aircraft is expected to take off in the coming weeks and the rest soon after.
Analysts are skeptical that the first customer could start operating the CSeries aircraft 12 months after its first flight.
Bombardier claims that it has evaluated its plan to put the aircraft into operation and will provide updated information in the coming months.
“This slow pace of flight tests – although consistent with Bombardier’s internal plan – is likely to reinforce our view that the commissioning will be postponed to the first quarter of 2015,” Doerksen said.
From $172 million, or 9 cents per share in the previous year, Bombardier’s net profit fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, in the third quarter ending September 30.
Adjusted earnings per share remained unchanged at 9 cents.
Turnover fell marginally from $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion.
According to Thomson Reuters’ IBES system, analysts expected a return of 10 cents per share and a turnover of 4.56 billion.
The fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer said it had delivered only 45 aircraft in the quarter compared to 57 aircraft a year earlier.
Net orders fell from 83 planes to 26.
Unfulfilled contracts in the Air Division amounted to 32.9 billion as of September 30, which does not change as of December 31.
“The results in aviation were in line with our outlook, but the low order intake and overall market condition disappointed us,” said Beaudoin.
Revenue in the aviation industry fell by 13 percent to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world’s largest manufacturer of trains, said revenue in this division increased by almost 11 percent to $2.1 billion.
Unfulfilled contracts in transport amounted to 32.6 billion at 30 September, which is a marginal growth compared to 31 December.
The profit margin in the transport division was affected by the problems with the implementation of several large contracts.
Heads of staff said that new outlooks will be provided in the fourth quarter.
Bombardier’s shares, which also announced the arrival of Google Chief Financial Officer Patrick Pichette, fell 8.5 percent during trading on Thursday afternoon to $4.83.
Brazil’s Embraer SA, the third-largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and Bombardier’s closest competitor, announced a 10 percent loss in quarterly profit on Thursday.
Cocaine Addict Who Warned Mafia Before Police Investigation Is In Prison
Basharat Ditta (42) was to pass the information to the King of the Underworld to Neil Scarbrough.
The lawyer feared that his drug addiction would come to light.
The Liverpool Crown Court sentenced him to three years in prison.
A top lawyer who informed the drug mafia about a major police investigation because he feared his drug addiction would be revealed was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, had to pass sensitive information on the investigation of his drug trafficking activities to the underworld boss Neil Scarbrough after he became a cocaine suspect.
The lawyer, whose nickname was “Bash” (party) and who was celebrated by criminals as the best lawyer, was arrested at his home in 2011 after police surveillance of Scarborough, whom he represented in previous drug trials.
Police spotted Sarborough, 32, as he left three bags of cocaine in a law firm in Blackburn, Lancashire, who was just having dinner with colleagues from the Law Society.
Based on tests in which traces of cocaine were found in his hair, on his wallet and on his credit cards, the investigation revealed that Ditta was a regular user of Class A drugs.
During a period of eight months, from January to August 2011, he attempted to gain information about the arrest of two men in favor of Scarborough and his companion.
At the time, all four suspects were tracked as part of a major investigation into the trafficking of heroin and cocaine in the areas of Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
After police detained heroin and cocaine worth around <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million along with <0xC2><0xA3>200,000 in cash during a series of raids, another 32 people ended up in prison with them.
Ditta (42) passed on information to criminals for fear of his addiction to cocaine.
Today, Ditta, who works for the Blackburn-based law firm Forbes Solicitors, experienced a humiliating moment before the Liverpool Crown Court when, after a three-week trial, he was found guilty of obstructing justice in two cases.
During an earlier hearing, he admitted to possession of cocaine.
The lawyer’s fall came after a police investigation into Scarborough revealed that he was in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two detectives tracked the suspect, recorded his arrival at Ditt's house, and saw him put 60 percent pure drugs under a lawyer's basket in a black golf glove.
Subsequently, Scarborough was in a regular telephone interview with Ditta, who was at a dinner at the Blackburn Rovers football stadium in Ewood Park.
The lawyer returned home where he found the drugs, and there were nine interviews between the two people.
The court heard that traces of Class A drugs were found in his hair, wallet, and on his credit cards, and that Ditta was a "regular user" of cocaine.
Ditta was later arrested, but denied cocaine use, and said he spoke to the suspected dealer because he was his client, arguing that their conversation fell into "confidential communication."
During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and tried to extract several credit cards from it, but all were detained and samples of his hair were taken.
During a police interrogation, he said that he operated the office both at his home address and at the workplace, and that his clients visited him at home because of work issues.
However, the court heard that after key arrests, it had contacted major players in the drug supply chain, some of whom it had previously represented, to tell them what the detectives knew about them.
As Anne Whyte said, “Who else is more aware that they must not violate the law than a lawyer in the criminal field?”
Mr. Ditta is accused of misusing his position as a lawyer and of getting into too close contact with a particular client.
The relationship we are talking about here is not just about a drug dealer, but a drug dealer who supplies his own lawyer with drugs.
Some of his interviews were undoubtedly legitimate because he was his lawyer.
But it went far beyond the usual relationship between a lawyer and a client.
The police investigation did everything they could to allow them to continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta did not bring good reputation to his profession, on the contrary, he abused it.
He was too close to certain of his clients, especially Scarborough, and allowed his independence to be disrupted.
Ditta’s offence was rejected and declared, “If I were a corrupt lawyer who I am not, and I wanted to pass on information to Mr. Scarborough, I wouldn’t wait 15 hours, but I would do it immediately.”
However, Lancashire Police Inspector Lee Halstead said: “Mr Ditta, from a criminal law enforcement attorney, himself became a criminal at the time he started getting drugs from organized criminals.”
His dependence on cocaine has made him hopelessly weakened and vulnerable to the intentions of the leading leaders of organized crime groups, who have given him the task of gathering valuable information about the police investigation.
Lawyers must adhere to the highest principles of integrity and must raise public confidence and the feeling that they can rely on them.
Mr. Ditta betrayed this trust and tried to hide behind the cloak of his profession.
The Serious and Organized Crime Unit in Lancashire conducted an investigation into Mr. Ditt, who was also convicted of three cases of cocaine possession and now of deterrence of justice, demonstrating our commitment to bring criminals to justice.
This case should serve as a warning to all criminals that no one is outside the reach of the law.
We'll find you and bring you to our courts.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after he was found guilty of socializing for the purpose of delivering heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
A further thirty-five people involved in trafficking were jailed for a total of 153 years for drug offences.
On his website, Ditta organized an online interview about himself, in which he said his dream job would be to legally represent clients from the death row in America, as a guest at dinner would wish for Muhammad Ali, and as a motivation for the job to state inequality.
He negotiated the government with Klaus and <0xC5><0xA0>pidla.
Now the people of Jan Kasala have sent against Babi<0xC5><0xA1>.
The People’s Party won fourteen MPs in the election, or just a third of the number of Social Democrats or representatives of YES.
But they are entering into government negotiations with at least one advantage.
In the team, which has already begun to assess the outlines of a possible coalition, there is Jan Kasala - a man who under the leadership of the people has complied with the conditions of government participation in the years 1992, 1996, 2002 and 2006.
The Social Democrats and Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1> do not have such a matador on their side.
Perhaps this time it will be reminiscent of the first negotiations in 1992, when the ODS was also a completely new party.
"The experience was minimal at the time," Kasal estimates how the talks will develop this year.
Kenyan press upset by controversial media law <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
“It is a terrifying report and it is on the spot to ask what will prevent Parliament from simply disrupting the independence of the judiciary tomorrow,” the newspapers said, calling the bill unconstitutional.
“This law is strict and very repressive and we reject it,” said Cyrus Kamau, CEO of Capital Group, which includes CapitalFM, one of the most respected independent radio stations and news websites.
He said that the new media tribunal “will always be pre-empted because it is an extended hand of the government” and that restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya’s position in the global economy.
"I hope the president will listen to us, and we will ask him to reject this bill and return it to MPs," he said.
According to the Star newspaper, the bill actually passes to the government "full control over the media" and Standard newspapers state that democracy and freedom of expression in Kenya "has sustained a hard blow," and criticise the bill as "strict."
The approval of the bill comes amid a series of measures aimed at strengthening national security immediately after the September attack by an Islamic shooter at the Westgate shopping mall.
Authorities’ anger was turned on by Kenyan media when they broadcast a security camera recording on which soldiers sent to the scene of the attack allegedly looted the luxury goods trade.
The chief of police responded by calling on two journalists and the head of the media for questioning, but the call was later withdrawn after pressure from the media.
According to the new bill, media companies could be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and individual journalists up to one million, along with the risk of being “off-listed” or denied official press accreditation.
The Tribunal shall also have the right to confiscate the property of the perpetrator if the fine is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, “one fine is enough to eliminate most of the radio stations.”
It is also stated that these measures can have a liquidating effect on what is called the Kenyan “living blogosphere”.
Politicians know that if they silence the media, they can do what they want with impunity.
“You never know what can happen,” wrote Nation Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist who described the Kenyan media as a key source of a system of mutual control and balance in public life.
“If we leave it to the politicians, they will bankrupt the country and throw us back into the hunt and collect,” he wrote.
Lawmakers in Kenya have been the target of public criticism in the past.
In May, they voted to abolish the cuts ordered by the national wage agency and to restore their fat wages to around 532,000 unsold shillings per month, which ranks among the highest in the world.
The young Czechs know that they have to save.
Most of them don’t even know what the interest rate is.
More and more Czechs are putting money aside.
Still, they don’t reach the savings champions in the region.
The most money is deposited by Raku<0xC5><0xA1>a, who saves an average of 181 euros per month.
People in Slovakia also save a little more than Czechs.
This is the result of a survey by the Erste Savings Barometer Group in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe.
It also showed that the mood of the organizers is improving and two-thirds of the respondents are planning to give more money away.
While the Czechs are about in the middle of the rankings, in Romania and Serbia, people consuming products still use very little.
For example, almost every second Serb, according to the survey, saves at home "under a pillow".
In the country this year, the number of those who save higher amounts per month is increasing.
Last year, 26 percent of respondents put between CZK 1,000 and CZK 2.5 thousand each month for various types of savings, which is five percent more this year.
The average monthly instalment, however, fell slightly to CZK 2078.
The biggest hit amongst the savings products is pension insurance.
This is preferred by 54 percent of Czechs, while three years ago it was the most popular way to estimate savings for only 36 percent of people.
On the contrary, the popularity of construction savings is decreasing, compared to last year, interest in investment funds has also fallen significantly.
Only 16 percent of respondents used it, compared to nearly a quarter of people last year.
The survey also found that while people consider it important to save, most of them don’t know what returns they make on individual products.
Especially young people under the age of 30 do not know how their money is borrowed.
On the contrary, the oldest group of respondents is best aware of the profitability of their deposited money, with 73 percent of respondents over the age of fifty.
In an international comparison, the Erste Czechs lead in the use of online banking, which 44% of people regularly use.
They are followed by Slovaks and Raku<0xC5><0xA1>ane with a 12% spacing.
UN Celebrates New Goals to Fight Poverty
The United Nations is working immediately on a new set of targets to replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which were introduced 12 years ago in order to tackle global poverty.
Prior to the UN Sustainable Development Summit, which began overnight in Rio de Janeiro, Australian diplomats played a key role in the implementation of the “sustainable development goals” to replace the MDG, which expires in 2015.
They were included in the final concept of the document, which will be approved by world leaders, including Mrs. Gillard, during the summit.
UN Secretary-General Mr Ki-mun said overnight at the summit that now is the time to “raise above national interests.”
“I am pleased that the Member States have agreed to launch and take over a process to implement the overall SDG targets,” he said.
The SDGs will build on the progress made within the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-2015 development agenda.
I will make every effort to fulfil the mandate given to me by the Member States and to realize our vision of the Sustainable Development Goals that build on the success of the MDG.
Security concerns in Mozambique escalate due to conflict of strong personalities
Under the guise of Samora Machely, Mozambique’s founding president, thousands of people gathered in the center of Maputo to call for peaceful slogans at a rare public demonstration.
“We want peace back; we want stability,” said Vanessa de Sousa, CEO of the investment company.
Fearing for the future of her country, she exchanged corporate clothes for a t-shirt decorated with the words “we demand security” in Portuguese and joined the crowd on Independence Square in the capital on Thursday.
After two weeks, almost daily reports of conflicts between the government forces and the Renamo side, some of the worst clashes since the peace deal more than 20 years ago, came.
Renamo was once an infamous insurgent movement, originally supported by the Belarusian government in Rhodesia and then the apartheid government in South Africa as part of efforts to destabilize the country's independent government.
After a peace agreement in 1992, it became an opposition party.
Analysts are convinced that it is unlikely that an open conflict will erupt in the country, but recent events have been recommended by foreign investors and locals.
At stake is the rapidly growing economy, as discoveries of vast coastal oil reserves and coal deposits in the northwest could bring in the next few years from companies such as Brazil’s Rio Tinto and Vale, Italy’s Eni and the U.S. Anadarko, an investment worth more than 50 billion dollars.
The ruling Frelimo party, the dominant political force since 1975, and Renamo accuse each other of rising tensions.
The Renamo Party claims that the government triggered the latest conflicts by launching an attack on their members in the province of Sofala, the traditional bastion of the Renamo Party on September 17.
Violent attacks by former rebels subsequently culminated when government forces attacked the Renamo party base and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlakam, the group’s leader, Renamo Fernando Mazang, spokesperson for the Financial Times said.
The government accuses Renamo of launching the conflict for attacking the soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has sought to alleviate concerns about instability.
Mr Guebuza told AFP on Wednesday that Mr Dhlakama saw himself as a “distruster” who wanted to use “whatever remains of his power to try to prove that he can order his own decisions to the government.”
Both Frelimo and Renamo say they want to avoid war.
Concerns, however, grew when Mr Mazanga’s words were quoted that the Renamo party was departing from the 1992 peace agreement.
The FT letter said it meant that Frelimo no longer complied with the agreement.
"Our goal is to return to the negotiations, but with seriousness," Mr Mazanga said.
Previous talks between these parties have done little to alleviate tensions between these parties, fueled by a number of clashes this year.
It is a rift between two great personalities (Guebuza and Dhlakama), said a lecturer at the Open University and a Mozambique expert Joseph Hanlon.
Neither of them is a good negotiator, and neither of them is prepared to make the necessary concessions.
The Renamo party, which was seeking a change in the election, has already said it would boycott the municipal elections scheduled for November.
The presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of force as an effort by the demise of the movement to gain benefits and financial returns from the government.
The Renamo party's electoral share has been decreasing since 1992, while the newer party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (DHM), which was founded by a former member of the Renamo party, is expected to improve its electoral position.
Mr. Mazanga says that Mr. Guebuza, who ends his second term next year, wants to destroy the democracy of this country.
“The democratic system doesn’t want more parties, it doesn’t want transparent elections, it doesn’t want peace, because it doesn’t want to let go of the presidential office,” Mazanga said.
It is unclear what options the Renamo party has, but it has carried out counter-terrorism attacks on police stations and vehicles on a key road between the north and south.
Most of the clashes took place in the province of Sofala, which is several hundred kilometers away from the capital Maputo, but where the city of Beira, the port on which mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, rely, are exporting coal.
In June, Rio suspended the use of the railroad for about a week when the Renamo side threatened to attack the line.
Mr Mazang did not want to comment on the question of whether Renamo would repeat his threat.
Renamo wanted to "forge the international community that the situation in Mozambique is not good," Mazanga said.
Instability has heightened frustration from the government, says Fernando Lima, head of independent media company Mediacoop, and many people are also concerned about corruption, slow development and the recent flooding of kidnappings.
“People think that the responsibility for the future of the country lies solely with the government and the president and that he should be the one to find solutions to the problems,” he says.
Demonstrator Omar Sultane says people just want stability.
“No one cares about Renamo or Frelimo, people just want peace, they want free access to the roads,” he says.
Children should learn myths and legends as “models for a way of life,” says the author.
The stories of Thor may show that “rough power cannot equal cleverness,” while Arthurian legends reveal how important it is to have a dream.
“A large part of the myths would be too wild for school, too scandalous, and in some cases too obscene,” said Crossley-Holland, who advocates for a careful selection of works corresponding to age.
“I think it’s great that myths and folk art are already part of education,” he said.
I've been defending this plan for 20 years.
He added that “openly-teaching” authors and teachers are at the heart of compelling stories with a “powder” message for children as a “switch.”
Crossley-Holland, who translated the epic Beowulf from the English language and who also writes the Norwegian Myths (Penguin Book) and the British National Book, says: "You can have good intentions, but you'll do better if you keep them to yourself."
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult author who writes for adults and an adult author who writes for children needs some sense of hope.
Not that everything has to be simplified or end up happy, but there has to be a natural sense of good and evil.
And he must be subconscious; revealed through the story, not openly determined.
The old truth is that it is better to show than to describe.
The Brno Observatory will take visitors to space in a new digital spacecraft
At first glance, it is clear that the hall of the great planetarium has changed in the last six months.
There is a new stage, visitors can get into new comfortable seats and above their heads has added a projection area of 17 meters in the shape of a dome from the American company Spitz.
In the middle of the hall is its most important part, a new projector from Japan.
In order for the picture to be perfect, other smaller projectors are located in the hall.
Another important part of the whole facility is hidden behind the walls of the hall.
"It's about twenty-one computers that generate an image," said director of the Brno Observatory Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Du<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
Computers ensure that the image of several projectors does not overlap, but gives an overall impression.
"The performance of computers is thirty to forty times higher than that of conventional personal computers," said Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Hlad<0xC3><0xAD>k, a technician at the zodiac.
Digitary can enchant the extremely realistic and plastic model of the night sky, the human body or the bottom of the ocean.
The spectators will be in the middle of the universe or the human brain.
Another similar facility is closest to Warsaw or Hamburg.
The management of the zodiac plans to project the purchased shows and their own creations in the hall.
There are two shows on the program from Saturday.
The first is called Astronaut and is designed for adults.
In it, people will learn about the training of cosmonauts, fly out into space, turn around at the centrifuge, and then see on visual examples how the astronauts face the challenging conditions in space.
The second show is for children and is called Magic Rock - Kaluoka'hina.
It tells the story of a cliff whose colorful inhabitants lived a quiet life until the moment when a nearby volcano erupted.
The entire digitization cost about 50 million kroner, which was mainly paid by the Ministry of Education.
The city of Brno and the Stargate also contributed smaller amounts from its budget.
The projection area cost ten million kroner, the projector twelve million.
"The rest of it was audiovisual technology and computers," Du<0xC5><0xA1>ek explained.
The digital installation was followed by the reconstruction of the entire building, which the zodiac department passed two years ago.
According to the director of Du<0xC5><0xA1>ka, between 25,000 and 30,000 visitors could arrive by the end of the year.
We've studied 11 INSERATION TICKETS!
We know where they want you to work!
In November last year, the analysis caught more than 11,000 job offers, of which 4,300 were posted in the daily press and 6,800 ads (62%) were posted on the Internet.
Thus, the Internet is becoming the most important medium for the publication of job offers.
In 2005, when the survey was conducted for the first time, its share was 26 percent.
In the last two surveys (2007, 2010) it stood at about 60 percent.
The advertising of job opportunities in itself, according to the analysis, reflects the current situation in the labour market.
An example could be a simple comparison of the number of advertisements published in the period of economic prosperity and in the period of economic crisis.
For example, in 2007, almost 25,900 advertisements were published in the same period, less than half in 2012.
The offer of jobs on the Internet is oriented towards a narrower, in particular more qualified group of professions.
On the other hand, the job offer in the daily press covers a wider range of professions, including those of workers, said the author of the analysis Pavl<0xC3><0xAD>na <0xC5><0xA0>tastn<0xC3><0xA1>.
The level of representation of the selected professional groups is different in both media.
The Internet’s leading advertising sites have attracted search managers and executives, business representatives, programmers and financial experts.
The position of programmers or managers of small businesses was only on the Internet.
In the daily press, the proportion of these professional professions is significantly lower, on the contrary, a large representation belongs in particular to the service and labor professions.
One of the most frequently mentioned requirements that employers express through an advertising offer is, of course, education.
Other areas under observation included the knowledge of foreign languages, especially English, as well.
In the daily press, the requirement for knowledge of a foreign language was stated in three percent of advertisements, on the Internet in 37 percent.
In only two percent of the ads, employers demanded active knowledge of two foreign languages.
Claims for 'computer literacy' appeared in 40 percent of ads (in the daily press in 11 percent, on the Internet in 57 percent).
Practice in the field was required in 54 percent of advertisements.
Requirements for practice are in all respects associated with qualified professions.
This is especially true of production managers and other executives.
Workers’ professions are mainly mechanics and repairers or manufacturers and processors of food products or repairers of electrical appliances, the study author Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Tillner added.
Employers also indicate in half of their advertisements the requirements for the characteristics and skills of potential candidates.
As the most requested skills in advertising, communication skills have been emerging in the first place for a long time.
Employers also demand flexibility, adaptability and dynamism, independence, accountability, organizational ability and reliability.
Ben Greenman: 10th Anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: New Yorker
It could be argued that New York City is the place where a solo comedy performance was born in America: almost a hundred years ago, the varied artist Frank Fray, who worked as the president of the ceremonies at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began to tell the gathered people a joke.
Fay's innovation has expanded over the years, most recently through the New York Comedy Festival.
Founded and managed by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the Carolines solo comedy institution, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year – along with more than sixty performances in small clubs and large theatres.
“Most of these titles have appeared in Carolines and have become successful to the extent that they are too big to play at the club,” Hirsch said.
We created this festival as an opportunity to continue working with them.
This year's event includes performances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as "Stand Up for Heroes", an annual musical comedy benefit performance at Madison Square Garden, featuring, among others, Bills Cowar, Jonce Springste, and Bills Cowar.
As the festival expanded, so did the world of comedy.
Several comedians participating in this year’s festival came from non-traditional channels such as shows in smaller radio and television companies such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll got off with his sitcom (heavy spicy "League" on a fantastic-football theme on FXX) and now has his own comedy show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was a member of both "Saturday night live" and "Parks and Recreation", but she was most famous for the rapidly spreading video series "Marcel the shell with shoes on".
Both Kroll and Slate, as well as other young comedians with clearly recognizable voices (surreally pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, agile, race-oriented W. Kamau Bell), are the product of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the highlights of the festival will be the interview: David Steinberg will talk to Larry David.
Steinberg began as a solo comedian, but became a successful television and film director, as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he hosted the TV show "Sit down comedy with David Steinberg".
The meeting takes place at Town Hall in downtown Manhattan.
“This city is definitely in the comedy DNA of Larry’s entire work,” Steinberg said.
He told me that when he's here, he sometimes walks down the street between two buildings and says, "Man, if I lose all the money, maybe I'll live here."
The price of oil has fallen to $96 per barrel.
Oil prices continued to fall on Friday as fears of high supplies outweighed a report showing the strengthening of China’s energy-hungry manufacturing sector.
The U.S. oil supply index fell by 14 cents to $96.24 per barrel in European e-commerce on the New York Stock Exchange late in the morning.
On Thursday, it was down 39 cents and remained by 5.8 percent for the month of October.
Wealthy oil stocks in recent weeks have burdened the price.
The U.S. Department of Energy said on Wednesday that U.S. supplies had increased by 4.1 million barrels in the past week.
In five weeks, stocks have increased by more than 25 million barrels.
On Friday, however, two reports of Chinese production triggered increased demand, which showed growth in activity.
This suggests that China’s economic recovery could continue to strengthen after growth, which grew to 7.8 percent in the third quarter after the previous two weak decades.
Oil Brent, an indicator for international oil also used by U.S. refineries, fell 26 cents to $108.58 per barrel on the International Trade Exchange in London.
That's not it, Mr. Haskell.
We have a unique opportunity to tell politicians not to do so.
It is necessary to develop such pressure that Martin Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek is stripped of all political functions and leaves the parliamentary mandate.
Any other solution will reduce the level of political culture that is already so vanishing.
Martin Hasek is shielded by the promise he made, but each and every politician in particular must be aware of the consequences of that promise and carefully consider what can be promised.
Confidence is the only capital a politician has (Mr. Babi<0xC5><0xA1> also has the material one, but it is a question of whether he is a politician).
A better program advocated by a liar is unbelievable.
He does not apologise in politics, he resigns in politics.
Mr Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ka, if you think that well with this country (and your frequent statements confirm me, if you are not lying - here you see how complicated it is to lie), you will leave politics alone, as a man.
People will then accept your apology as an expression of the man who made a mistake and is responsible for it.
Otherwise, you will be perceived as a backless weakness, whose words and actions cannot be trusted.
You either want to be a proud person, or you want to be a lifelong skeleton.
It may seem unfair to you to speak only to you, but you are the leader and they are only the misguided sheep.
And you're a leader, and you always wanted to be.
I understand you're trying to fold your ears for a moment, regroup your forces, sit down that shame, and then attack again, but that's how they act partisans or subverts.
You are, I repeat, in your eyes a leader, an alpha male, so act like that.
Take responsibility and step out of the policy.
The court blocked the regulation on the procedure for arrest and search of persons by the police department in NY
A federal appeals court on Thursday blocked a court order calling for changes to the arrest and search program at the New York Police Department and appealed the case to the judge.
A second U.S. federal appeals court said Judge Shiry Scheindlin's decision would be postponed until the city's appeals decision.
In August, the judge decided that the city had violated the Constitution by implementing its program to stop and interrogate people.
The city of its conclusions and its remedial regulations considered, including a decision to allocate supervision, which would help the police department to change its procedures and its training program associated with them.
The appeals court heard the arguments for the postponement requested on Tuesday.
The appellate court said that the judge must be dismissed from the case because she got into conflict with the rules of conduct for the judge, by not acting as a judge according to the requirement to avoid the appearance of entrepreneurship, partly because of a series of reactions to the media and a public statement.
The judge ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people when they unfairly targeted blacks and Hispanics as part of their program to stop and search people.
It established independent surveillance to oversee major changes including reform in procedures, training and surveillance, and ordered the launch of a pilot programme to test cameras worn on the body in certain areas where the most frequent arrests of persons occur.
In August, New York City agreed to end the method of retaining the names and addresses of people whose cases were rejected after a police search.
The oral reasons for the city’s appeal are planned sometime after March 14, 2014.
The tactics of arresting and searching people have been criticised by a number of civil rights defenders.
In a certain form, there have been arrests and searches of persons for some decades, but the surveys recorded under the administration of the independent mayor Michael Bloomberg dramatically increased to a record number of 684,330 in 2011, in most cases blacks and Hispanics.
In 2004, four men, all of whom belong to the minority, filed a lawsuit, which became a case of a group lawsuit.
Supporters of the NYPD’s program of arresting and searching individuals claim that the changes will end unfair practices, increase the trustworthiness and effectiveness of the police corps, and may affect how these procedures are used by other police departments.
Opponents claim that the changes will reduce police morale, but not crime, and thus waste money, but will not solve a broader problem when the police corps is under pressure after its numbers have dropped by several thousand people over the last decade.
The judge noted that she did not end the practice of arresting and searching people, which is constitutional, but reformed the way the NYPD conducted searches.
One-fifth of shopping malls face low attendance
This is based on data from real estate consulting firms Cushman & Wakefield and Jones Lang LaSalle.
The shopping centre of Krak<0xC3><0xB3>w will be opened to the public in Bohnice, Prague, and it will be the 19th shopping centre of Prague.
There are now a total of 90 large shopping centers in the Czech Republic.
Dissatisfied performance concerns about 20 percent of medium-sized and large centres.
The main problems are an inadequately large center against locality and poor layout, i.e. too many floors or complicated and opaque arrangement of passageways, or dead places of the center," said Michal Sot<0xC3><0xA1>k of Cushman & Wakefield.
Also, according to the head of retail real estate Jones Lang LaSalle Sylvie Samadi, about a fifth of the shopping malls face low attendance.
The main reasons include, among other things, poor accessibility of transport, low income categories of local residents or market oversupply in a given place.
Some of the projects opened up almost fully occupied, but their results were mostly unsatisfactory at first.
Nowadays, customers are a little conservative and do not like to change their shopping habits.
New shopping malls need to make more efforts to ‘attract’ their customers to new brands in the market, entertainment, services and marketing events,” said Samadi.
The availability of shopping centers is generally stable, according to Sot<0xC3><0xA1>k, even in some centers it increases, because tenants were willing in the crisis to deduct from the rent and rent some units.
"It is true, however, that some projects have recently opened that are not fully occupied and the average occupancy is thus decreasing (for example, Breda & Weinstein in Opava, <0xC5><0xA0>antovka in Olomouc), "said Sot<0xC3><0xA1>k.
The shopping malls opened in the last two years are pushing the market very slowly, according to Sylvie Samadi.
There is room in the market for new projects.
The number of places suitable for the construction of a successful project is very limited.
For example, in Prague we see a space for the construction of a project that would serve the inhabitants of Prague 6.
There is certainly room on the market for the construction of smaller local projects, so-called 'convinience centres', aimed at shopping and services of daily needs for the population living in the immediate vicinity," said Samadi.
Also, according to Sot<0xC3><0xA1>k, there is a place on the domestic market for other shopping malls.
Both for small 'service' centres, for large projects in Prague, or medium-sized projects, or expansion in regional cities.
"Cities like Kladno, <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice, Brno or Pilsen have room for further growth," Sot<0xC3><0xA1>k added.
In Prague, he sees a space for a ready-made shopping center on V<0xC3><0xAD>t<0xC4><0x9B>zné n<0xC3><0xA1>m<0xC4><0x9B>st<0xC3><0xAD>, furthermore, according to him, they have a clear potential of Na P<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>kop<0xC3><0xA1> street and Wenceslas Square.
"Intensively developing the expansion of retail parks, which allow traders to cover and expand to smaller cities at favorable rental and operating costs, the space is also still in some locations for smaller local or residential companies that are domiciled in a local shopping mall.
In the Czech Republic, there are currently 90 modern shopping malls with a total of more than 2.2 million square meters of gross rental area.
A quarter of these shopping centres are located in Prague.
Among the 20 largest shopping centers, according to the number of tenants, nine of them are in Prague, according to the data of Incoma GfK.
In the number of shopping parks, the Czech Republic is below the EU average, compared to values from Britain and France, the Czech Republic is lagging by about 50 square meters per thousand inhabitants.
Coulson hacked into his phone to check his tip
Former News of the World (NotW) editor Andy Coulson reportedly used the method of “telephone hacking, surveillance and confrontation” to confirm a fraudulent tip on a love affair that was supposed to involve then interior minister Charles Clarke.
Attorney General Andrew Edis at the Old Bailey courthouse said News of the World caught fake news in May 2005 that Clarke was seen with his "attractive special counsel" Hannah Pawby.
The newspapers commissioned private investigator Glenn Mulcaire to hack into Pawby's voice box and penetrate her privacy, but it was heard that Coulson also called her and left her voicemails.
“The D.A. suggests that Mr. Coulson, who is now the editor of NotW, is not a person who stands in front of the house and hopes to catch people outside, but a person who likes to tell people stories to see what they’re saying,” Mr. Edis said.
He said NotW newspapers used three ways of exploring stories: hacking into the phone, watching and confronting.
The editor is personally involved in the third method.
Obviously, he knows about the other one, surveillance, he has to know about it.
What about the first one?
Does he know about breaking into the phone?
He says no, we say, "But of course he does."
Fantasies of the love affair Clarke is involved in were first caught up in the NotW News Reporting Department when a source who was sexually interested in Mrs. Pawby was told, “You’re just wasting your time, she’s with Charles.”
A recording of voice messages taken from her phone on at least three occasions was taken at Mulcair's house in August 2006.
Investigators also found records on a private investigator's computer, where Ms. Pawby and her sister were labeled "Projects."
During the time Ms. Pawby was investigated, her grandparents received anonymous phone calls asking for information about the Pawbys, Mr. Edis said.
In the meantime, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup monitored Ms. Pawby's movement.
On June 18, 2005, Coulson left her a voicemail saying, "I've got a story we're about to publish tomorrow that I'd like to talk to Charles about."
Mr. Edis says Coulson’s involvement in the story was the same model as with other prominent personalities, including former Interior Minister David Blunkett.
On Thursday, it was heard that Coulson confronted Mr. Blunkett over a love affair with a married woman, while he himself met the co-accused Rebecca Brooks, who was then married.
Coulson and Brooks refused to associate with other people in order to break into their phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup confessed to hacking into the phone.
The NSA Revealed Increases Social Paranoia of State-Based Monitoring
One peaceful day at the end of August, a German police helicopter crashed over the U.S. consular office in Frankfurt, the capital of the German economy.
On the instructions of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), the German domestic intelligence agency, the purpose of the mission was to take photos of the roof of the U.S. advance guard, which is located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
German media say the BfV hopes to be able to identify the presence of the surveillance antennas, and the move triggered an exchange of views between the US and German foreign ministers in Berlin.
James Clapper, the US director of national intelligence, reiterated in September that the United States does not use its foreign intelligence capabilities to “steal the trade secrets of foreign companies in favor of American companies and thus strengthen their international competitiveness.”
But ever since Edward Snowden, who became a co-worker informant, began to reveal his valuable collection of covert surveillance by the United States, European governments, and leading entrepreneurs, they no longer know if they can trust the CEO’s words.
After reports that the U.S. National Security Agency has conducted espionage at a Brazilian oil company and gained access to data available to U.S. cloud providers including Google and Yahoo, general paranoia about state surveillance of the new dimensions has become apparent.
The last drop came with the revelation that Chancellor Angela Merkel’s phone may have been listened to for ten years.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be the target, then there are certainly potential targets for leading entrepreneurs.
Snowden has outlined the intensive cooperation between U.S. intelligence services and companies.
I would say that it is possible that these data are used for mutual benefit.
“Germany needs to wake up,” said Oliver Grün, president of BITM, which represents small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
According to a survey released in July by the EY advisory service, German companies are convinced that in terms of industrial espionage and data theft, the US now poses as much risk as China.
However, there is no evidence in Mr. Snowden’s entire documentation so far that the United States has passed on the trade secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians expressed concerns that the EU lacks certain IT and internet capabilities, and said it should try to limit its dependence on the US:
Leading entrepreneurs are skeptical of this.
There are voices from the German parliament that we should make a German Google.
All I can do is close my eyes and slowly open them again.
That’s not the way, says Hasso Plattner, chairman of German software company SAP.
If someone wanted a strong European IT industry, they shouldn’t have let him die 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is done, from coal to cars and farmers.
Everything except for the IT industry.
The scope and technical complexity of the US spy agencies revealed by Snowden is shocking for some companies that have so far considered China to be the biggest threat to surveillance.
There is a big turnover in cloud computing, where European representatives on a broader scale have realized that data stored in the U.S. falls under the jurisdiction of the U.S., and is therefore potentially attackable.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud security alliance, about 10 percent of non-US members after the discovery of the U.S. Prism program for data mining have canceled plans to use a U.S.-based cloud provider.
Jim Snabe, one of the CEOs of SAP, says, “We have this new customer question that wasn’t here a year ago – where are my data stored and can you guarantee that they will stay in this jurisdiction physically?”
Many German high-ranking officials argue that the latest reports are only a confirmation of what they already knew: that powerful states want to steal their most precious secrets and that data must be protected at all costs.
The fact that economic espionage is being carried out is no surprise.
It's always been.
“This has been a key topic for many years and it hasn’t changed significantly during the current discussion,” says Kurt Bock, CEO of BASF.
Americans are spying on us at a commercial and industrial level, just as we are spying on them because it is in our national interest to defend our businesses.
Generally speaking, business leaders do not want to boast about the countermeasures they have taken to avoid giving the attacker an advantage.
In the case of large companies, it has long been remembered that taking a free USB flash drive at the fair or leaving an unprotected laptop in the hotel room is at least unreasonable.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of Audi’s board of directors, says it has been common practice for many years to collect mobile phones before a board meeting so that they can not be used as a listening device.
The German BfV agency advises executives to consider not to use simple prepaid mobile phones on foreign trips because of the risk that smartphones can be misused.
Prepaid mobile phones are then discarded.
However, there are concerns that small and medium-sized enterprises will continue to be vulnerable to hacking and tracking.
In Germany, many of these companies are at the forefront of the global market in their specific areas.
“Small and medium-sized enterprises often lack the experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect business secrets from unauthorised access,” the BfV said in its report.
The US warns its own companies against economic espionage from other countries.
According to the Washington Post, the US National Intelligence Estimate documents in February listed France alongside Russia and Israel in the second row of perpetrators who engage in hacking activities for economic reporters, right behind China.
A member of the board of the German risk-free society concluded that in terms of economic espionage, "the French are the worst".
Bernard Squarcini, the former head of the French internal intelligence agency DCRI, said this month in one of the interviews: “The services are quite well aware that all countries, even though they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, carry out espionage on their own devices.”
The parents of a Georgia boy who died in a strange accident, believe he was murdered.
The parents of a young Georgia boy, whose body was found inside a battered fighting ghost in his high school gymnasium, believe their son was murdered, a family lawyer said on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, from Valdosta, Georgia, was found on January 11 in a mentally aligned staircase at the gymnasium where he was attending.
Investigators from Lowndes County have concluded that Johnson died by accident, but the 17-year-old's family denies it.
“They are clearly convinced that their son was murdered,” Benjamin Crump, a lawyer representing Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, told FoxNews.com.
They never believed he was dead, as the sheriff said.
“They are convinced that this is contrary to logic, to the laws of physics and also to common sense,” Crump said.
They believe that this is meant to encourage what really happened to protect the person responsible for the death of their son.
“As usual, they sent their son to school, and he returned to them in a bag of corpses,” he said.
Attorney General Michael Moore said on Thursday he was conducting a regular investigation into Johnson’s death, noting that several key questions remained unanswered.
What was the cause of death?
Was his death the result of a crime?
Moore said at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I'll follow the facts, wherever they take me.
My goal is to find out the truth.
“I think there is a sufficient basis for a regular investigation,” he said.
Moore told reporters that the original whistleblowers suggested that Johnson died as a result of “suffocation.”
However, according to Moore, another cause of death was reported.
“There are a few questions that need to be answered or confirmed,” he said.
Moore added that if in Johnson’s death case he reveals enough evidence for a warrant to investigate a crime or violate civil rights, he will ask the FBI and its enforcement.
The deputy sheriff's office in Lowndes County was not immediately available for comment on Thursday.
A judge from South Georgia on Wednesday ordered the authorities to make available all the video footage from the surveillance cameras that the investigators had viewed.
The teenager's parents hope that the videos will contain a clue to how their son died.
CDC Center Issues Allergy Guidelines for Schools in Children
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC) issued a set of guidelines to help children with food allergies at school.
This is the first set of such guidelines issued by the U.S. government, due to the fact that the number of school-age children suffering from food allergies is increasing.
One in 20 children in the United States has a food allergy.
The CDC found that the incidence of food allergies in children increased by 18 percent between 1997 and 2007.
The guidelines provide information for schools on how teachers and staff should be aware of children's food allergies and how to respond to an allergic reaction if they occur.
Schools are also advised to have adrenaline – most often used by the EpiPen auto-injector – to be able to respond to life-threatening hypersensitivity.
State legislatures have recently updated rules that make it easier for schools to store adrenaline.
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms that appear in conversations with children who have an allergic reaction.
The child can say, “It’s like someone pissed me in the tongue,” “I feel like I have hair on my tongue,” or “My tongue is itchy.”
Parents of intersex children may choose “indefinite sex”
Germany has become the first European nation to recognize the third sex of children born with ambiguous sex systems.
Newborn children will no longer be classified solely to either the male or female sex.
The new law does not require parents to indicate any sex for such children, and allows them to indicate gender as “unspecified” or “unspecified” on their birth certificates.
The purpose of the law is to stop pressure on parents to make their child opt-out for a gender-determining operation, and to combat discrimination against those who are intersex.
One intersex person, according to the BBC, after many years said, “I am neither a man nor a woman.”
I'm going to be a mess made by a doctor, confused and intrigued.
It is estimated that every year, out of 2,000 children, one is born that is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersex, part of a group of about 60 facts that fall into the diagnosis of sexual developmental disorders, covering the term for those who have atypical chromosomes, sex glands (ovaries or testicles) or unusually developed genitals.
Intersex could have been Wallis Simpson.
The definition of gender is not yet fully understood, but most experts in the United States say that when sex cannot be determined, it is better to use the best available information and to determine it, rather than wait and watch the child’s psychological and physical development until the opera is performed.
New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in gender issues, said the new German law “seems like a good thing.”
Intersex children are an ethical dilemma.
“Some people are in a life-threatening condition that requires surgery, but most children are not,” he said.
Gender identification can be performed without surgery and then you can wait for the identity to develop.
The knowledge of how sexuality develops in a child is not very accurate.
No one can answer the question of why this is happening.
It's like a mystery why some people are gay.
The report, submitted to the European Committee in 2011, described intersex persons as being different from transgender or transgender people because their status is not tied to gender, but to their biological structure, which is neither exclusively male nor female, but typically consists of both.
These features can be manifested in secondary sexual characteristics such as muscle volume, hair growth, breasts and character, in primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and sexual system, or in the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
This report also provides an overview of the discrimination experienced by intersex and transgender people in the workplace, as well as levels of harassment, violence and prejudice.
Boys who don't match any gender now have a special camp.
Australia and Nepal already allow adults to label male, female, or “third sex” in their official documents.
Norrie May-Welby, a 52-year-old Australian, became the world's first recognized "sexless" person in June when she won a court appeal to be able to retain the status of "uncertain" sex for the rest of her life.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, German passports besides M (male) and F (female) will have a third designation, X, for intersex persons.
In neighbouring France, according to a news report on France 24, the issue of gender is still controversial.
In 2011, dozens of French lawmakers from this heavily Catholic country signed a petition to remove “gender theory” from school textbooks.
The American website Catholic online also defined against the German law, writing: “With the way the world is drawn to a new state, when sex is a matter of choice, but sexual activity is not, we are overthrown by two other pillars of civilization.”
A newborn mother from Maryland also told the Baby Zone that she would rather see her children have sex at birth.
“Parenting itself is stressful and without further restrictions, especially if you don’t know the gender of your child,” she said in a statement.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children with both male and female sex were called hermaphrodites, according to the beautiful River, which had double sex.
And about a decade ago, the medical community believed that sex was something like a board that could be erased and re-drawn.
But now many question the ethical basis of surgery with the fact that sexuality is a complex matter and doctors may sometimes make the wrong decisions because they do not know how children will feel about their sex when they grow up.
"In the middle of the 20th century, it was called psychiatric emergency," Drescher said.
When these children were born, you didn't call a psychiatrist, you called a surgeon.
Continuing theories on how to treat children with ambiguous sex were presented by Dr. John Money at Johns Hopkins University, who argued that sex is subjective.
He created a new concept of “sexuality” and argued that the social causes and influences of the environment—how parents raised their child—affected the child’s genes and hormones and formed the child regardless of whether it was identified as a man or a woman.
But in one 1966 case, known as "John/Joan", his theory became controversial.
The parents of the boy, whose penis was damaged due to a poorly performed circumcision, recommended that they let their child be fully castrated, also remove his testicles and raise him as a girl.
“The media presented this case as a successful case of transformation, but the reality was different,” Drescher said.
When the boy was 15 years old, he had surgery back on the boy and married his wife.
At the age of 38, he committed suicide.
Drescher said that some doctors "use this model" to this day.
But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, survivors of these operations emerged “dissatisfaction with the result.”
Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, was born with male chromosomes but an ambiguous sex system.
Doctors were not sure if he had a large clitoris or a small penis, and were convinced that as a man he could never live a “satisfactory life.”
And so shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce was surgically removed from the external organs and testicles and was raised as a girl.
At the age of 12, she received female hormones.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," he told ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was very hard to ask.
At 18, he was sent to a vaginal plastic.
But because he was depressed and knew something was wrong, he asked for medical records.
What he found was terrifying.
After birth, I was sterilized and no one ever told me anything.
Bruce was born with Sexual Developmental Disorder (DSD), which prevented the body from producing enough testosterone in order to properly develop its sexual system.
After learning the truth, he turned back into a man, took doses of testosterone and let his breasts be removed,
The surgery caused his infertility.
Today he represents others in an organization called the Interface Project and tries to normalize the perceptions of those who are intersex.
However, Anne Tamar-Mattis, director of the California-based law group Advocates for Informed Choice, fears that German law “calls for scrutiny and stigma.”
“Many activists fear that German law will achieve by encouraging parents to make quick decisions and choosing ‘uncertain’ for the child,” she said.
We're afraid it'll lead to intervention.
We believe that it is better to assign the male or female sex and then wait.
But we don't know how the law ends up, so all we can do is speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said her organization supports Australian law because it “allows adults to choose to be included in the third sex.”
“Adults should be able to make their own decisions about the legally valid sex,” she said.
The German law intends to allocate it at birth.
This is a battle that a small child should not be seduced at this point.
When they grow up, they can make their own decisions about their own bodies.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a Pittsburgh-based chest radiologist who has a daughter with a sexual developmental disorder and helps hundreds of others in the support group, said the German law would "give powers" to both parents and children.
Baratz's daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but she has a DSD called androgen insensitivity syndrome.
Because her androgen receptors are defective, Katie's feminine traits developed.
She has a vagina, but she has no uterus and no ovaries.
Now 29-year-old Katie is married and works as an intern in pediatric psychiatry while studying at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although she is infertile, she hopes to become a parent through adoption or surrogacy.
“The law gives parents a certain space not to rush into their decision,” Baratz said.
It gives them time to take certain tests and change their mind, and it gives them time to write “man” or “woman.”
In this respect, everything is fine – you raise your child and love him.
You have an amazing baby and you're happy about it.
You do not have to rush with an operation that is irreversible.
“It brings an opportunity to involve the child in the decision making and takes away the anxiety that binds parents because they are not sure they are doing the right thing,” she said.
In the end, the child decides which sex he or she identifies with more – and that’s a great thing.
This gives children the power to make their own decisions.
The drunk sniffed the whole house with gasoline: He threatened to burn it even with his own family!
Tension increased, fear escalated.
The man threatened to set the whole house on fire.
All available police patrols in the area, as well as a fire brigade from Mlad<0xC3><0xA1> Boleslav and a volunteer fire brigade, went to the scene.
A police negotiator also arrived at the scene, who tried to express his irrational behavior to the men.
The man threatened to set the house on fire.
An interception unit must have entered the house, which damaged the man and tied him up.
The aggressor then ended up in an examination at the Mladoboleslav hospital, from where he was transferred to an anti-alcohol arresting station.
The firefighters finally flooded the house polished with gasoline with a sorbent, which they later cleaned.
In addition to people, all the pets were also rescued from the house.
The police negotiator did not give a man, so the command came after him.
Report: Obama’s Campaign Considers Replacement of Biden for Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama’s closest adviser, according to the New York Times, secretly considered replacing Vice President Joe Biden’s 2012 candidate for Hillary Clinton.
This revelation is the most significant sensation of the impatiently anticipated book about the 2012 campaign by Mark Halperin and John Heilmann "Double down: Game Change 2012."
The Times obtained a copy of the upcoming book and announced on Thursday evening that the president’s top collaborators had held intensive group meetings and surveys at the end of 2011 to assess whether the removal of Biden would help revive Obama’s dazzling hopes.
According to the national-political correspondent for the Times magazine, Jonathan Martin, the book offers a thorough record of the efforts of leading officials within the campaign and in the White House, namely the former head of the Cliprendent b-ministerial office of the White House, to vote for Bill Daley.
The potential change was a closely guarded secret within the Chicago campaign's infrastructure and within the Oval Office.
Only a few close presidential advisers — including Daley, former Obama campaign chief Jim Messina, and former White House chief advisers David Axelrod and David Plouffe — knew that this change was under consideration.
The book "Double down" claims that Daley was the leader of efforts to replace Biden, despite their close personal relationship, until they finally decided not to make that move when the data showed that adding Clinton to the candidate would "not give Obama a chance".
In an interview with Martin Daley, he confirmed that the administration was really considering replacing Biden Clinton.
“I’ve been researching a lot of things, and this was one of them,” Daley said.
You mustn't forget that the president had a terrible prospect at the time, so we were like, "Christ, what are we going to do?"
While Daley characterized the research as “appropriate care,” Martin told CNN’s Anderson Cooper that the re-election campaign had spent considerable investment to see if the move was worth it.
“Campaigns don’t involve such money for elections and qualitative research unless something is really seriously considered,” Martin told AC360.
However, it is not clear whether Obama knew that his team was considering this exchange.
Martin told CNN that he had asked Daley if his then boss knew about the potential card mixing.
While Daley said he did not think the president was "aware" of the potential changes, the former head of the office admitted that it was "possible" that Obama knew about it.
Martin added that the book "Double down" definitively does not answer the question of whether the political probe got all the way to Obama's desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he really thought Obama didn’t know about the research involved in removing Biden from the candidate.
"Perhaps," Martin replied.
Fantastic ice cream that shines in the dark?
A British businessman made the first ice cream that glows in the dark – using jellyfish.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of this marine animal and developed a luminous sparkle.
He came up with the idea when he read his expert treatise on jellyfish, and convinced scientists in China to chemically produce proteins that cause lightening.
This ice cream reacts with the language of the consumer – it increases the pH level in the protein and then causes its radiation.
Chris says ice cream glows when it reacts with the warmth of your mouth, and therefore the more you lick, the brighter it shines.
Charlie, the founder of the ice cream company "Lick me I'm delicious", says: "It's an amazing substance, but when it comes to manufacturing, we're at the beginning, so for 200 GBP you get about 2 g of this substance."
The protein we use in ice cream reacts with your tongue at a neutral pH.
So as your mouth heats up the protein, the pH rises and the ice cream starts to glow.
We’ve been testing it over the last few months and it seems to be a great idea for Halloween because it causes this fantastic glowing effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever made, because lightening jellyfish is four times more expensive than gold.
And so every penny costs me about <0xC2><0xA3>140.
But it tastes great.
Charlie’s Bristol-based experimental company is known for its unconventional flavors of beer, cheese, beef and gold leaves.
But his next product is going to be even more ambitious.
He says, "I'd really like to make an invisible ice cream."
In essence, it's impossible because of the breakage of light caused by the ice crystals that make up the ice, but I'm counting on us to find some way to do it.
Ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of jellyfish, artificially made by Chinese scientists.
Halloween 2013: According to the numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were able to eat sweets, stay up for a long time, and introduce ourselves to our neighbors in disguise.
Today I feel like I've become a caretaker.
For two years, no candy appeared in my apartment and this year it probably won’t be any different.
However, statistics show that I am, as far as Halloween is concerned, a black sheep.
According to the State Retail Federation (NRF), this year, most Americans – 158 million of them – will celebrate Halloween and spend a total of $6.9 billion on sweets, costumes and jewelry.
But what I’m always looking forward to on Halloween are the trends.
According to the NRF, the $6.9 billion spent on costumes is expected to go to 1.2 billion.
This year is the last shot of fashion sexy inanimate objects.
Sexy can no longer be just women; sexy can be foods like pizza, hamburger and carrots.
When it comes to men, I expect to see a lot of zombies through the passage of the dead, and I bet the space men from Daft Punk will reach out to our Instagram channels this year.
According to Google, the most sought-after costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I guess there's nothing wrong with going according to tradition.
Last year we wore our dogs in costumes and to my surprise we were not the only ones.
In fact, according to the NRF, Americans will spend $330 million this year on pet costumes.
So he'll see a lot of funny dogs.
When it comes to sweets, we don’t waste time.
According to Nielsen, Americans will spend $1.9 billion.
That's about 300 million kilograms of Hershey tablets, licks, sweets Milk Duds and Twizzlers and Clark bars.
This is an amazing report for the 41 million college students who, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce, are about to invade our neighborhood.
In fact, during Halloween, we buy, and believe me, we consume, 45 million kilos of chocolate.
The only thing we don’t want is corn candy, and yet, according to the National Sugar Association, almost 16,000 tons are sold around Halloween.
That's about 9 billion individual corn candy.
That's a secret I've never solved.
There is nothing more typical of Halloween than scary houses.
They have the best titles such as "Terror behind the walls", "Howl-O-Scream" and "The House of Shock".
In fact, there are in the United States officially dedicated 1,200 scary houses that, according to the American scary houses company, have a profit of $500 million, and this includes those amazing photos that you're afraid of, and that you're like, "shouldn't let your friend take a picture of you on Facebook, and you can't take them off."
And finally, a little bit about pumpkins.
When we were little, Charlie Brown introduced us to the Great Pumpkin, and carving a pumpkin candle is like decorating a Christmas tree – we’ve been doing it since we were little.
Luckily for us, the “baby in a pumpkin” trend started thanks to the Pinterest app only last year, so most of us grew up on the fact that we were cutting out the plug instead of sitting in it.
This year, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins.
The pumpkin lantern with a flaming flame on your front porch probably comes from Illinois, where 245,000 tons of pumpkin grew this year.
If you’re looking for something extra, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon from Napa, California, and try to cut their pumpkins weighing almost a ton.
Announced a series of Land Rover races
The interior has racing seats and six-point seat belts as well as intercommunication equipment.
There is a choice of improved brakes, a service package providing access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistical support and vehicle storage between races.
Drew Bowler, Technical Director of Bowler Motorsport, said: “The race participants who come to Bowler have changed.”
Not all are experienced racers, but they are people who want excitement and adventure and also a reachable path to world-class races.
We are delighted that we can offer them this journey in collaboration with Land Rover and MSA, and we believe that this format offers a new way to experience different racing disciplines in the UK and overseas, and that it will prepare competitors for the toughness and reality of the Rally Raid races.
We really enjoyed the development of the Defender Challenge – it will be a really exciting competition.
The Defender Challenge will also offer a training and testing day in February, as well as an opportunity to compete in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
Schwarzenberg: We have early elections here in two years
Karel Schwarzenberg, the president of TOP 09, is expected to hold early elections.
A week after the latter in the interview for Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz, he said that there is no other way out and every government came out of the vote last Friday and Saturday is an impossible blind man.
"It can't last long," said Karel Schwarzenberg, with an estimate of the lifespan of the beginning of the term of office in two years.
With the objection that voters will hardly choose completely differently next time, they disagree: "I think it will be a bit more balanced decision making."
At the same time, the TOP 09 president does not admit that his party could still lose voters in the next election as this year (about 300,000 votes were lost compared to 2010).
Schwarzenberg estimates that if it were clear that early elections would take place within two months, the ANO 2011 movement Andreje Babi<0xC5><0xA1> would strengthen it.
Otherwise, according to Schwarzenberg, Babi<0xC5><0xA1> will lose.
The turbulent situation in the Czechoslovak Republic, where President Bohuslav Sobotka after a secret meeting of the party’s leadership stated that he or Michal Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek will remain in the leadership of social democracy, comments Schwarzenberg after his:
"Democratic party officials like little boys go after the head of state to allow them to overthrow the party."
"I thought Mr. Haskell was smarter and smarter."
"Because I've never seen anything so unexpectedly stupid done in my life," the president added.
And towards President Zeman (who he faced in the struggle for the presidency) he struggled: "The role of the head of state is clear: he wants to take over that party."
The first laws have already been introduced by TOP 09.
What was the biggest surprise of the election for you?
TOP 09 has already formally submitted its first draft laws in the House, including the Faroe Islands Register of Treaties, which was discussed by the House committees before the elections, but fell under the table with early elections.
The president of TOP 09 in an interview for Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz claims that such speed is due to the fact that "these laws are necessary".
At the same time, however, TOP 09 clearly wants to prejudge similar attempts from other sides.
For example, the leader of the ANO movement Martin Kom<0xC3><0xA1>rek accused the TOP 09 in the pre-election struggle of the idea of introducing a register of contracts "stealing" the program of the ANO movement.
TOP 09 has now taken advantage of the leap forward - it has simply dusted the proposal, which had already been moved to the second reading of the House.
Firefighters arrived to rescue a lost puppy who was trapped 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous cliff in a quarry
Cochrane Ruby escaped after a small car accident.
Three days later, when he was imprisoned in a quarry, he saw a man marrying a dog.
Firefighters slammed into a rock wall to save the dog from a certain death.
The puppy was liberated by firefighters who came to liberate him after somehow trapped himself on a dangerous protrusion in a quarry 15 meters above the ground.
A nine-month-old cockroach, Ruby, escaped after a small car accident on Sunday afternoon, and survived for three days until he was released from the quarry on Wednesday.
Its owners Scott Alderson (25) and his girlfriend Becky Hall (20) were at the Flappit quarry in Denholm, West Yorkshire to meet Ruby again and thank the fire and rescue service from West Yorkshire.
After he ran away, when he got into a small accident, feverishly searched for his lost dog and placed challenges on social networks.
On Wednesday around 2:15 p.m., a sharp-eyed dogman spotted Ruby trapped on a cliff in a quarry 15 meters above the ground.
A technical rescue team from Cleckheaton fire station rushed to the scene and slammed down to free Ruby, using an animal transport bag to pick him up on the rock.
Andy Clayton, the technical rescue team’s chief of staff, said: “The dog was in a dangerous situation.
It was right in the middle of a rock wall – 15 meters from the top and bottom.
At the rescue he did not shake his eyebrows – he was completely frozen.
But now he's fine.
Then he got the cookies.
It was a very unusual trip.
The fact that someone saw the dog is unbelievable.
The technical rescue team's chief of staff, Peter Lau, said: "Ruby was very lucky during his escape."
There was a possibility that he would be seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to the veterinarian for inspection, and in addition to exhaustion and dehydration he was fine.
Ms. Hall from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: "I was afraid when I looked at the rescue operation."
Above all, I couldn't believe how he got there.
It was wonderful to hold him in his arms again.
The veterinarian said that if it was too exhausted and collapsed, it would probably fall.
The firefighters did a great job.
What they did was very daring.
We are very grateful to them, they were all just huge.
Mr. Alderson of Keighley added: "We thought it might fall, but he stayed there."
Firefighters were great.
We just don't understand how he got there.
Mick Jagger claims that Katy Perry did not go out after 18 years of age.
During an interview for the Australian radio show this week, this pop star said that Jagger's song "Old Habits Die Hard" from 2004 was sung by accompanying vocals.
Perry said when she was 18, she had dinner with this rock veteran and he went after her.
And she added, "It was a long time ago and now he's very kind to me."
In a statement Thursday, Jagger’s (70) representative said he categorically refuses to ever make Katy Perry proposals.
The agent said, "Maybe you're confusing him with someone else."
Perry was one of the guest singers (singers) who appeared on the Rolling Stones concert line this year.
Her new album “Prism” debuted at number one this week.
George Kerevan: Divided Europe Gives the Scots a Choice
The next day, another terrifying story of independence.
This time there is a warning that a condition for an independent Scotland to join the EU would be its entry into Schengen.
This gave rise to the stories of passport checks in Berwick and the sharp wire along Hadrian's Valley.
The truth is that the Strathclyde newspapers mentioned the possible economic benefits of free movement with the rest of Europe, but – as could be expected – it did not reflect in the headlines of the newspapers.
No one has also mentioned that EU Member States are spending a lot of time adapting their official laws, if they do so.
Given that Scotland is not currently in Schengen, the offer of continuing inconsistency would be a cheap concession for Brussels in return for anything they really want from the Scots.
So it's a pretty weak story.
And besides, so old that it became an excavation. A journalistic duck that "independence means passport control," I heard at least 40 years ago.
Yet, in this bearded tale, there is one interesting thought.
Why should an independent Scotland be expected to listen to Europe at all?
Why exchange the London hamster for the Brussels hamster, especially now?
This is a true European story: the great post-war plan to unite Europe has finally failed.
The impact of the euro crisis is the so-called Project Europe officially dead.
Throughout Europe, parties dedicated to resistance to the EU or the abolition of the euro as a common currency are gaining influence.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic party Alternative for Germany – founded this year – came as if from nowhere and already in the September federal elections seized almost five million votes, thus essentially “ejecting” the Liberal Democrats from the Bundestag.
On domestic soil, there has always been opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis has become a decisive moment.
The resilience dictated by Germany and the European Central Bank, together with the closure of the Kazakh economy by clinging to the common currency, has led many people to believe that the Europe project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with the fact that national governments are dealing with a high budget deficit – this was true only in the case of Greece.
Rather, it is a system of the euro that blocks its members at exchange rates favourable to German exporters – and that is what German politicians want to keep.
Without the possibility of devaluation of the domestic currency, southern Europe has a disadvantage in the area of domestic production compared to Germany.
The only help is to reduce revenues and public spending – which is what Germany is proposing.
With the current budget and currency problems, the deeper the cause of Europe's poor performance is.
As a result of a “green” energy policy supported by Brussels – a code to support French and German companies at consumer expense – European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times more for gasoline than it does in the United States.
This is a paralyzing disadvantage in terms of costs, as we have seen in the case of Grangemouth.
Not even all the freezing of wages in the world would prevent the suffocation of the European petrochemical industry with cheap U.S. shale oil.
The result is a staggering uprising, especially in France, once an enthusiastic supporter of the EU.
After the war, the political elite in France saw the EU as an instrument that would keep Germany on track and allow Paris to stand in the world at the level of Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a proof of political legitimacy, and it has put its own economic policy in Europe and left the worn-out French economy to its fate.
Result: The right wing of Marine Le Pen, the anti-European National Front, has just won crucial additional elections and pushed the ruling Socialists to third place.
The Front is now the most popular party in France with 24% of the votes – a timely warning to British workers that they can’t argue that splitting the right will automatically be positive on the left.
How does Le Pen cope with its newly acquired popularity among the working class of Belarus?
She would like to use the European elections next year to create an anti-European bloc against the common currency across the European Parliament.
If the anti-European parties do well in these elections, which is likely, such a bloc can dominate the European Parliament for the first time in its history.
It strikes me that in the foreseeable future, the growing anti-European sentiment and attitude towards the common currency will unite and the euro will be destroyed.
The EU will not disappear, but rather become something more free in the sense of “Europe (sovereign) nations”, already preferred by General de Gaulle.
Germany and several of its satellite economies may retain the euro, but France and southern Europe will restore their own currencies.
I expect the UK to distance itself from this project and stick to the United States.
However, Washington’s increased interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be left to the Atlantic cold.
Where will Scotland be?
We can choose to be an area (in principle) of Little England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – this includes the possibility of announcing to Berlin and Brussels when they should leave us.
I assume that Scotland would do well in a relaxed European arrangement, provided that it retains its own currency.
Cooperation with other similarly-minded countries would be easier in a non-federal Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should take the example of Norway and keep our economic independence in mind.
The SNP government in Scotland is – oddly enough – the most successful political movement in Europe not promoting austerity measures, which won a large majority in 2011 thanks to the opposition stance against the cuts planned (and implemented) by the Liberals and Liberals of Labour Chancellor Alistair de N<0xC3><0xA1>cling.
It would be ridiculous if Scotland now voted for independence just to take the austerity measures dictated by Berlin and Brussels.
Early Puberty: Adults Before
Research has shown that African-Americans and Hispanics reach puberty earlier than their white layers.
Physical changes do not mean that puberty is approaching
It has not been proven that hormones or other chemicals are behind it.
Experts claim that one of the triggers of earlier puberty may be an obesity epidemic.
The trend of early puberty is not so noticeable in boys.
Former CNN reporter Pat Etheridge is a journalist who specializes in child health and family problems.
Should a mother be scared when her daughter starts growing breasts and shaving at the age of 7 or 8?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatric Physicians this week in Orlando, Florida, pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these physical changes are quite common among American girls and represent a new standard.
“I spent a lot of time assuring my parents that this is usually not a sign of rapid development towards full puberty,” Kaplowitz said.
Visible signs of development, such as breast growth, hair loss on the armpit and in the forearm and body odor, appear earlier in girls.
In the last forty years, however, there has been only a small shift in the age at which the first menstruation occurs.
In the United States, the average age is now 12.5 years old compared to 12.75 years old in 1970.
“When breasts begin to develop, it will take at least two to three years for the first menstruation to occur,” said Kaplowitz, who is also the author of Early Puberty in Girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem.
The most reliable test of how puberty will continue is time.
It is debated about what activates the actual onset of puberty, but if breast growth is accompanied by a growth spurt before the age of 8, the girl is considered "premature".
In most cases, the process slows down or stops – which pediatricians can carefully monitor.
Faster growth may be the reason for an endocrinologist to perform tests to rule out serious problems such as a tumor or cyst.
There are therapeutic procedures that delay early menstruation and prevent further consequences: premature aging of the bones, which can eventually lead to a halt to growth and curvature in adulthood.
Recommendations regarding medications and hormonal treatment depend on the age of the child, the rate of development, the rate of growth and emotional maturity.
Psychosociological aspects are also important.
When it comes to drug use, Kaplowitz is cautious, but admits that “the suppression of puberty can alleviate a girl’s behavior problems and her feelings of being different from her peers.”
Of course, there is another big problem: parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have menstruation.
"They're worried she might get pregnant, or how she'll handle hygiene," Kaplowitz said.
“It was a shock,” recalls one woman whose daughter started menstruating at the age of 10.
Although there were signs and we talked about menstruation together, she wasn’t emotionally prepared.
She came home from school scared and angry that she was the first of her friends.
There are many well-known theories about the causes of premature puberty.
However, there is still no correlated set of evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment, or sexual messages in the media are at fault.
Boys – like girls – reach puberty sooner.
Kaplowitz argues that the most serious reason is the obesity epidemic.
In 2001, he helped carry out a study on girls aged 6 to 9, which combines body fat with puberty timing.
Further findings support this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.
In this country, African-Americans and Hispanics tend to reach puberty before their white counterparts.
The explanations are different.
From a global point of view, early puberty patterns seem to be affected by everything from economic conditions to climate to genes.
Another riddle: Although hair loss appears in boys at a young age, the trend towards the full bloom of early puberty is not as evident as it is in girls.
Other doctors attending the conference of the American Association of Pediatric Physicians (AAP) added additional complexity to this topic.
Acne and hair loss is common even in infants and toddlers.
“We need to be careful about how we identify the real onset of puberty,” said Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at the Goryebs Children’s Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to get instructions from their pediatrician on how to talk to their child.
“It may mean having to talk to the child before you think about it,” Kaplowitz said.
If you stay calm, your child will likely respond well.
Girls who develop earlier need to be assured that even if this happens prematurely, this process is a common part of life.
Nadia Konvalinkov<0xC3><0xA1> as a waitress.
Does he have a new job?
Actress Na<0xC4><0x8F>a Konvalinkov<0xC3><0xA1> (62) appeared behind the scenes in the role of a waitress and she was very happy.
That a popular Czech actress would plan a career change and go on business in a hospice?
Nadia Konvalinkova showed up at the James Joyce Irish pub and made beer there.
I did it for the first time in my life and it worked.
The boss even offered me to hire me and I could feed myself by rotating the beer.
But I refused, I'd rather stay with what I'm doing today, with acting," Konvalin, who was a guest on the 20th anniversary of the Irish pub, said with a smile.
"I like Irish beer and I'm going to get Irish whiskey here," the actress said.
A long-time friend and colleague Pavel Nov<0xC3><0xBD> also appeared at the event.
I am after death, and in my new life, I am not allowed to suffocate.
I'm allowed one beer or one drink a day, and I'm trying to stick to that," the actor added.
Aircraft manufacturers are shy about the width of the seats, at stake are large orders
A dispute over the width of second-class seats between top aircraft manufacturers in the long-distance flight industry sparked a bitter exchange of views this month at the Dubai Air Show.
The subject of the dispute is the width of the seats provided on long-haul flights for the economy class – not exactly the one that would normally precede the airlines, but whose allocated space is the key to the efficiency requirements for the latest aircraft offered by Airbus SAS and Boeing.
Airbus this week called for industry standards that would offer at least 46 cm wide seats in the economy class, but U.S. main rival Boeing says it is up to airlines to decide.
The dispute arose at a time when aircraft manufacturers compete in the sale of the largest version of their two-engine long-range aircraft with a potential record number of orders expected during the event from 17 to 21 November.
The way in which the rear of the aircraft is distributed – especially if there are 9 or 10 seats next to each other – is the basis of economic performance requirements for the design of the new “mini-jumbo” aircraft.
Boeing says the improved 777X will transport 406 people in economic seats with a width of more than 43 cm spread over 10 in each row.
Airbus says a competing version of its A350 will transport 350 people in 46 cm wide economy seats spread out over 9.
Giant planes often attack each other in technical issues through advertisements in the professional media.
Airbus now appeals directly to the public ahead of the Dubai Air Show, where the 777X is expected to gain dominance with more than 100 orders.
He recently previewed what could be the start of a new advertising war when he showed financiers a picture of three people crowded in a restaurant with the caption “Would you like it?”
“Boeing is promoting long-haul flights in seats that are narrower than those in regional turboprop aircraft,” said John Leahy, chief sales officer of Airbus.
As dietary allowances change, people are larger, but the seats on airplanes have not changed radically.
Since the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 jumbo defined modern long-haul air transport, by the turn of the century, the weight of the average American between the ages of 40 and 49 has increased by 10 percent, according to the U.S. Department of Health.
According to American health statistics, the average American in the 21st century has a waist of 100 cm.
Airbus claims its rival is sticking to the 1950s concept of seating, when the average seat width of a newly-baptized aircraft was lower.
Airbus says it has conducted research suggesting that a 2.5 cm seat extension will improve sleep quality by 53 percent.
Boeing denies Airbus’ seat dimensions and says it is not in the power of aircraft manufacturers to decide how the airlines export fees and equipment.
The company also says that research shows that the cabin experience depends on more matters than just the width of the seat.
“It’s really about giving airlines flexibility and enabling them to do things they believe they need to do to be successful,” said cabin space expert Kent Craver.
They don’t want us to dictate to them what profits them.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For passengers, more elbow space is essential, but for suppliers it is a growing problem that can affect revenues.
Behind this dispute, the race to order planes with estimated trade in the next decades is worth at least $700 billion in catalog prices, enough to fluctuate the gap in weight of American and European exports.
As Reuters reported in July, the layout of the seats is exactly what drives the battle between the last planes.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim to achieve 20 percent better efficiency in their latest designs of two-engine long-haul aircraft than the market leader in this segment, a 365-seat Boeing 777-300ER.
The performance requirements of Boeing depend in part on the comparison of the design of the 777X with 10 seats in a row and the 777 concept with 9 seats in a row.
The profit in unit costs is weaker than the 10-seat concept.
“The reason Boeing is doing this is to pave the way for more seats, and make its aircraft more competitive than our products,” said Kevin Keniston, Airbus’ Head of Passenger Comfort for Europe.
On the other hand, analysts say that 10-seat cabins in a row for existing 777 models are consistent with the fact that many passengers are for a denser layout that can go hand in hand with lower fees.
“The forty-five-centimeter-wide seat would be great for passengers, but the reality is that Airbus’ business-driven design is motivated by the threat of the 777,” said Mary Kirby, founder and editor of the Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not provide seats, but offer airlines a catalogue of suppliers to choose from.
On-the-go aircraft sellers even carry a measuring band with them to check the competitive arrangement.
While being comfortable, all manufacturers also offer high-density aircraft for low-cost companies and regional travelers.
Airbus offers the A350 with 10 seats in a row, but says it has not sold it yet.
Airbus has recently emphasized the need for more cabin modifications by offering wider seats in the alleyways for some of its aircraft.
Experts say that without the support of a single additional manufacturer of large modern aircraft, the call for new industrial standards will remain unheard of, but can discourage the wave of sales of the 777X.
The number of infected with HIV exceeded in Prague a thousand
In the Czech Republic, the number of infected people is growing every year.
For example, in 2002, tests confirmed the infection in 50 people, five years later there were 121 and in 2010 there were 180.
Last year, 212 people were infected and this was a record number.
"The fact that the total number of newly diagnosed cases this year will exceed 200 is no doubt in my opinion," said AIDS expert Miroslav Hlavat<0xC3><0xBD>, who led the Prague House of Light for Patients for years.
According to him, from January to September last year, there were 165 HIV patients in the country, and this year, there were 176 in the same period.
Since the beginning of the surveillance until the end of September this year, tests have confirmed HIV in 1,710 men and 353 women, with the most infected in Prague.
The number reached 1005 in September.
In the Central Bohemian Region, 206 people were infected.
156 people from the South Moravian Region, 130 from Moravian-Silesian or 116 from <0xC3><0x9A>stek, were also diagnosed.
The least infected people come from the Highlands, there were 19 of them.
A total of 88 percent of patients were infected with sex.
Fourteen people have been infected with blood transfusions in the past.
However, such a case has not appeared in the Czech Republic since the beginning of testing, i.e. in more than a quarter of a century.
Six children were also born with HIV, transferred to them from their mother.
The nonsense in the film Gravity is, but when viewed it is beautiful, say experts
A fantastic film from the Gravity universe sold out cinema in the Czech Republic some time after its premiere.
In October, according to the Union of Film Distributors, it was seen by almost 150,000 viewers and earned more than CZK 26 million.
Most of the reviews rate the image positively.
Others, however, find some inequalities in it.
The Lidovky.cz server asked astronomers and astrophysicists how they liked the film and whether they noticed any nonsense that appeared in the film.
Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Du<0xC5><0xA1>ek (director of the Brno Star and Planetarium): I like science-fiction films, which I consider to be modern, dream fairy tales.
The film Gravity does not exclude, although it is considered a "physically real" performance.
No, but that doesn't mean he's bad.
I enjoyed it a lot.
You may notice Sandra Bullock’s hair, which somehow does not appear to be in a state of weightlessness.
Hubb's space telescope and the International Space Station are moving along significantly different orbits, so they can't be seen in one shot.
Some viewers of the film count the unrealistic effect and the entire behavior of the fire in a state of no difficulty.
According to them, the lockers would not withstand such wounds.
The heroes in the film Gravity often get into a collision with different objects and the outfits without much trouble will withstand everything.
Criticism has not been spared, either.
Such an extensive tragedy in Earth’s orbit is, according to some debaters, unrealistic.
Also, she wonders why the doctor was sent to space to repair the technique.
People are also arguing on the forums about "unrealistic" lan behavior.
It looks like it's meant for bungee jumping.
Marcel Grün (director of the Starship and Planetarium of Prague): I have only seen him so far on a wide canvas, but I can clearly say, I was fascinated.
I'm glad it wasn't a documentary, but a science fiction film.
And in such a story, the author has the right (almost an obligation) not to consistently adhere to reality.
"More than the inequalities you mentioned, I was touched by the three-time display of a space station with a degrading level of technology (last Chinese)."
“Chinese will be at the end of the decade and will probably look better than in the movie.”
Vladim<0xC3><0xAD>r Karas (director of the Astronomical Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic): In computer-generated scenes, the authors very successfully try not to violate the laws of physics, and so the physics-oriented spectator will appreciate that in the course of various cosmic collisions and collisions, the physics-oriented spectator will appreciate that at the moments of the phys.
Inequalities will certainly be found in a more detailed examination.
In addition, for example, when I read the comments, I found that the preferred direction of circulation of various cosmic garbage in the orbit appears to be reversed in some scenes than it should actually be (from west to east).
Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>p<0xC3><0xA1>n (an employee of the Astronomical Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic): Some things have been adapted by the creators to their needs, but no fundamental and heavenly sins against logic or the laws of nature have been recorded in the film.
Of the moments that make no sense, it is worth mentioning the fact that Hubble’s space telescope orbits in an inclined orbit other than the ISS.
As a result, the speed varies greatly, and the rescue operation could not actually take place as it was shown in the film.
Furthermore, at the time of the division of Kowalski (Clooney) and Stone (Bullock), I did not notice that the entire ISS would rotate, so there is no clear origin of the force acting on Kowalski, which forces both actors to let go at the moment when they no longer move towards each other.
New Nicotine Vaccine May Take Away the Pleasure of Smoking
Scientists have developed a nicotine vaccine that can take away the pleasure of smoking cigarettes.
A single dose of the vaccine has been able to protect the mouse from nicotine addiction for a lifetime.
Before testing in humans, it is necessary to carry out further tests that will take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of the Weill Cornell School of Health in New York says the first signs are good.
“We firmly hope that this type of vaccination strategy can finally help millions of smokers who have tried to quit and exhaust all the methods available on the market today, but found that their dependence on nicotine is so strong that it overcomes all current approaches,” said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been compiled to carry genetic information to create anti-nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects liver cells, which then begin to form a flowing stream of these antibodies.
Antibodies hunt down all the nicotine molecules in the bloodstream and neutralize them before they get into the brain, preventing the smoker from getting a nicotine attack.
In tests of vaccinated mice that were additionally supplied with nicotine, they continued their normal activities.
But mice that weren’t vaccinated “sedated,” the researchers said, which is a sign that nicotine got into their brains.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
The previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies to the drug.
Injections had to be given so often that sufficient levels of antibodies were maintained, so they turned out to be expensive and impractical.
The cost of a new vaccine should be much lower, as they turn liver cells into factories for the production of antibodies.
Professor Crystal said that if future vaccines are completely safe for people, they could be given to children before they’d like to try a cigarette, and nicotine addiction would be avoided.
However, it is much more likely that smokers would use it to stop smoking.
“They’ll know that if they start smoking again, they won’t be able to enjoy it because of the nicotine vaccine, and that will help them get rid of this habit,” he said.
The British scientists said the results were interesting, but they note that further research is needed.
Tripodi denies he was influenced by both.
Former Labour Minister of New South Wales (Australia) will be investigated by the State Corruption Oversight Committee.
Former New South Wales Minister Joe Tripodi denied he would change the policy of coastal rentals at the request of his political adviser Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three properties on government-controlled land.
The Independent Anti-Corruption Committee (ICAC) on Friday extended its search to whether Mr. Obeid was lobbying several state ministers to hire him on Circular Quay, where the Obeids owned two restaurants and a coffee shop, reopened without having to reopen the bar after his 2005 expiration.
The committee is now investigating allegations that Mr. Tripodi knew of Mr. Obeid's secret interests in these properties, based on evidence submitted on Thursday by Mr. Tripodi's former deputy head of office, Lynne Ashpole.
During the years of talks started in 2005, the government pushed for rents to go to public competitions.
The tenants were against it and also wanted longer-term contractual terms.
In 2009, rentals for businesses in Circular Quay, which brought Obeid $2.5 million a year, were renewed without the need to participate in a public competition.
Mr Tripodi, who served as Minister of Ports from February 2006 to November 2009, was originally a supporter of public competitions.
He denied, however, that the changes had been made at the request of Mr. Obeid, who, as Mr. Tripodi admitted, insisted on a shift in government rent policy.
A transcript of the calls submitted to the ICAC showed the August-September 2007 calls between Mr. Both and Mr. Tripod and Steve Dunn, a senior official who came to the port resort after working under Mr. Both in the Fisheries Department.
“Was the subject of the interviews during these phone calls the development of commercial rental policy?” asked Deputy Commissioner Anthony Whealy, Mr Tripodi.
"No," Mr. Tripodi replied.
I can't remember what we were talking about, but definitely not this.
Definitely not between me and Mr. Both.
Israeli military planes attacked a target in Syria, said the official.
Israeli military planes hit a target in the Syrian port of Lazik on Thursday night, a senior administration official told Fox News.
This responsible person did not specifically say what the goal was, but said he was at least one.
According to the Associated Press, the target was Russian-made SA-125 missiles.
At least twice earlier this year, Israel carried out an aerial attack on missile deliveries in Syria.
A lot of things have moved, and it's different.
Perhaps Pe<0xC4><0x8D>inka’s commentator spoke in such a way that he could agree with it, while President <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>ch was inciting controversy.
Heytman Chovanec was a suspect to me as soon as he was elected to the presidency, and he confirmed it.
President Sobotka has always been, and continues to be, a symbol of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD’s poverty.
The rest of the men showed their weaknesses.
Senator Dienstbier is principled and readable and unusable, and Vice-President Zaor<0xC3><0xA1>lek has made himself impossible by the most conversation on television.
On this basis, I do not see a better option than for the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD to propose the vice-president of the Senate Gajd<0xC5><0xAF><0xC5><0xA1>ko as prime minister, the only one who would not have an initial handicap and I think would have carried out a standard performance.
This is such a good solution that hardly anyone in the management can support it.
I add that this solution is the only way to forget what was done and continue without tearing the party apart.
Alena Gajd<0xC5><0xAF><0xC5><0xA1>kova could, without fear, form a minority government with a mere blessing from the president of Babis and without the people, but with the People’s Health Minister Hovorka, who is actually a believing social democrat.
This minimum-sized government would have great stability, as it would promote a proper referendum law and pledged to support the president of the Okamura Dawn.
President Babi<0xC5><0xA1> would eventually settle for the progress of taxation, because he is clever and will see that it cannot be done without it.
The people would not bring problems, because the Speaker is the bearer of the best they have, and they would not be in the government otherwise.
The same is true of YES, there would be a valuable minister here, but if they do not reasonably want to enter into risky government participation, but provide support, well, too.
Let's give Alena Gajd<0xC5><0xAF><0xC5><0xA1>kova courage!
Foreign workers with a visa permit may be subjected to a “legacy” test
With the government’s intention to extend police interventions, it is considering the test of “eligibility” for foreign workers with a visa authorization 457.
The test, if adopted, will be applied through criteria to prevent the 457 program from being used to fill unqualified jobs, or as a back door for family and friends to move to Australia.
When a government discussion article was published today, former Labour MP Maxine McKew condemned the government’s rhetoric about foreign workers, saying it could offend Australian neighbors.
“The vocal statements ‘foreigners at the end of the front’ and ‘work first for Australians’ are a very unpleasant relic of a time when the unions demanded a protected labour market,” she told the Australian-Indian Institute.
Historically, this meant that the white labor force was to be protected – and I wouldn’t be surprised if anyone in this region recorded the sound of this historic artifact.
The article discusses the 12 measures previously considered by former Immigration Minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday, where he is negotiating with officials over smuggling people, implemented five of the recommended changes and the others remain to be considered.
If the ‘eligibility’ criteria are accepted, visa applicants may be examined in detail whether ‘the nomination is eligible for situations where the candidate is in a relationship or personal relationship with the owner or relevant person of the sponsoring undertaking.’
After previous experience with companies that intended to sponsor a small number of employees, but then employed hundreds of them, companies may also be required to justify the number of visa holders 457.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan man seeking asylum died on suspicion of a heart attack after arriving on an asylum boat on the Christmas Islands this week.
The man’s frightened nine-year-old son traveled to Australia with him and, after his father died on Wednesday, was comforted by an adult cousin who was also on the ship.
Australian authorities and a man rushed to a hospital on the Christmas Islands, where he died.
The UK government has announced a study aimed at increasing the benefits of the HS2 rail project for Scotland.
HS2’s work suggests that high-speed services for Scotland and Northern England will begin as soon as the first phase is launched in 2026.
The Minister of Transport, Baroness Kramer, said the project would “connect the UK together”.
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was “satisfied” with the British government on the plan.
The first phase will consist of a new high-speed train line between London and the West Midlands.
After the completion of Phase two, the line will lead from Manchester to Leeds.
In June, the government reassessed the estimated cost of building a high-speed line between London and northern England from <0xC2><0xA3>32.7 billion to <0xC2><0xA3>42.6 billion.
The UK government, which has conducted interviews with the national transport agency Transport Scotland, has commissioned HS2 to identify additional rail capacity and the possibility of improving travel times for northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of possible travel times from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London corresponding to three hours or less.
Baroness Kramer said: “Our goal for HS2 is a truly national network that will better connect the UK and its cities.”
We gave SH2 green, because the benefit that it will bring is huge.
Without this, we are facing a crisis in the capacity of our railway network.
But it’s also a connection – HS2 will make 18 cities better connected across the UK, including Glasgow and Edinburgh.
Scottish Minister Alistair Carmichael added: “Today’s announcement is good news for Scotland.”
Under the Scottish government, Keith Brown called on Mr Carmichael to “unambiguously” support Scottish integration into the HS2 network.
Mr Brown said: "The high-speed line has the potential to bring Scotland immeasurable economic benefits, but it also adds to Scotland's economic weight in the overall case of high-speed rail across the UK."
We are therefore excited to work with the British government to explore the possibilities of bringing high-speed rail to Scotland to bring benefits to everyone and complement the Glasgow-Edinburgh line, which the Scottish government is planning to do.
I look forward to reviewing the report on this study together with the British ministers next year and to making a joint decision on the next steps.
Together with B<0xC3><0xA1>rta arrested inspection and anti-corruption police analyst
Information about the arrest of V<0xC3><0xAD>t B<0xC3><0xA1>rty began to spread on Thursday evening, when the news was brought by the server Prv<0xC3><0xAD>zpravy.cz.
MF DNES soon found out that the case was taken over by the General Inspectorate of Security Corpses (GIBS), its people were supposed to arrest B<0xC3><0xA1>rt in the centre of Prague.
It was in front of the Four Seasons Hotel.
The inspection deals with cases where there are amongst the accused police officers, but its powers also apply to civilians.
According to MF DNES, one of the officers of the anti-corruption police - chief analyst and computer scientist Jan Petr<0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD>lek.
He worked for the Security Intelligence Service in the past.
Anti-corruption police spokesman Jaroslav Ibehej, however, refused to comment on the information with the suggestion that the media must address GIBS in this regard.
Her spokesperson, Radka Sandorov<0xC3><0xA1>, did not want to say anything about the case, but instead referred to the City State Prosecutor’s Office in Prague.
"We will not comment on this question with regard to the protection of hidden facts," said the spokeswoman of the ministry, <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>p<0xC3><0xA1>nka Zenklov<0xC3><0xA1>.
Also from this non-specific reaction can be derived that the event took place, but it is in a mode of secrecy that does not allow the speaker to say anything specific.
In a similar situation, Bart's lawyer, Old<0xC5><0x99>ich Pooroba, is also present.
The media said he represented B<0xC3><0xA1>rtu "even in this case", but given the fact that it was classified information, he could not confirm or refute B<0xC3><0xA1>rt's arrest.
Some media outlets initially speculated that Bart's arrest could be related to former police president Petr Lessy.
This was promoted to the position of B<0xC3><0xA1>rta together with the former chairman of the VV Radk John, who was in charge of the Ministry of the Interior.
The dispute, which sparked as a result between Prime Minister Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as and VV, had even to be resolved by then-President V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Klaus.
I have no idea where this connection to my person came from.
No one contacted me, I was not interrogated.
"I really don't know anything about it," said iDNES.cz Lessy.
In January 2011, Lessy became chief of police.
Radek John, the real head of the party, was officially beating him, but he was B<0xC3><0xA1>rta at the time.
B<0xC3><0xA1>rta was now running for the Sunshine Movement, with the parliamentary mandate only narrowly escaped - by 175 votes.
Dawn leader Tomio Okamura said he had no idea what it was all about.
"Vitat B<0xC3><0xA1>rta was one of the many candidates of many parties on our candidacy and, as I have repeatedly said before the elections, he was not even a member of the Dawn of Direct Democracy Tomia Okamura," he distanced himself from B<0xC3><0xA1>rta Okamura, because of the problem of <0xC3><0x9A>hlt<0xC3><0xA1>e, who told <0xC3><0x9A>mot<0xC5><0xA1> before the elections that he had given the candidate room for B<0xC3><0xA1>rto.
V<0xC3><0xAD>t B<0xC3><0xA1>rta was in court in 2012 with his former associate from VV Jaroslav <0xC5><0xA0>k<0xC3><0xA1>rka.
The rules on the use of electronic devices in the aircraft will remain in force in Australia for the time being.
Passengers of Australian airlines will continue to have to turn off their tablets and smartphones during take-off and landing, regardless of changes in the U.S., in order to mitigate the regulations regarding these devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has given U.S. carriers the space to change their practices so that passengers will be able to read e-books, watch videos, or play games on their devices during critical phases of flight if the device remains in flight mode.
Passengers can already do this during the majority of the flight, but many people are upset that they cannot access their e-books during take-off and landing.
Australian carriers are investigating this decision, which requires a large piece of work from U.S. carriers to meet these requirements, but they have indicated that they do not plan to change their procedures anytime soon.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) also said it had examined the notification, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic equipment in critical flight phases are still in force in Australia.
“CASA does not currently have any specific regulations regulating the use of electronic devices in aircraft,” he said.
This issue shall be covered by rules which require aircraft operators to ensure that safety is maintained throughout the period and that passengers are acting in accordance with the safety instructions they receive from crew members.
Virgin, which has already spoken with CASA about expanding the use of its on-board Wi-Fi entertainment system, was inclined to change, but announced that it will be subject to a decision by the regulatory authority.
“We would welcome CASA’s analysis of permission to use electronic devices, because we really think that now that we have (wireless on-board entertainment) it would improve the customer experience,” the spokesperson said.
Qantas has announced that it will comply with the current regulations for the time being.
"Our current policy is that electronic devices must not be used during take-off and landing, and we do not intend to change that in the near future," he said.
The FAA regulations apply to U.S. airlines.
However, we are constantly interested in developments in the regulatory field, which may be useful for our passengers, and we are certainly looking closely at FAA’s decisions and the reasons behind them.
In the case of U.S. airlines, the impact of the regulations will vary from the airline and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Carriers will have to prove that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference from mobile phones, and also revise manuals, training materials, hand luggage programs and passenger information.
“Once the airline confirms the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use portable and lightweight electronic devices such as tablets, electronic readers and smartphones at any altitude,” the FAA said in a statement.
In rare cases of low visibility, the crew orders passengers to disable the equipment during the landing.
The group also recommended that heavier equipment be safely stored under the seats or in a storage space above the head during take-off and take-off.
With the growing misery of the middle class, the warehouses in Singapore are experiencing a flourishing
Janani Amirthalinga stops her gold bracelet, ring and earrings at the Bendemeer shopping mall in Singapore to pay her daughter a tuition fee.
“My husband and I just bought a house and I put all my money into it,” says Mrs. Amirthalinga.
Although she receives $2,400 every month as an administrator and her husband also works, the family’s monthly income is insufficient, she says.
Demand across areas in Southeast Asia – where household debt is on the rise – is in fact such that ValueMax, where a woman conducts her transaction, has this week become the third stop on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
Stopping jewelry is not only a quick way to borrow cash – 1,300 SGD in Mrs. Amirthalinga’s case – but it’s also almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
Flagship stores in Singapore typically apply an annual percentage rate of 17 percent, just above the 15.4 percent rate offered by United Overseas Bank, a local bank with a branch in the same mall.
However, locksmiths have the advantage that they do not require verification of the person (payment history) or proof of income, and can provide a loan faster than banks.
And that’s why, as families feel pressured by the rising cost of living and the growing debt of households and consumer debt, millions of people across the region are turning to landfills.
After five years of tremendous growth from the global financial crisis and cheap loans backed by liberalized monetary policy in advanced economies, low- and middle-income families are turning to charities to cope with the deteriorating financial situation.
This week, the rating agency Standard & Poor's cited the increasing use of household loans as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
She said that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest household debt in Asia due to their gross domestic product.
Malaysia is at the top of the ranking with a ratio of 80 percent of GDP, which is an increase compared to 60 percent in 2008.
Economists also feared high levels of consumer debt in Thailand, which this week just got out of the technical recession.
On Thursday, data showed continued weak exports and a weakening of consumer demand.
“It’s important that with the rising costs, people from the middle to the low [income scale] will try to supplement their income wherever they can,” said Song Seng Wun, an economist at Malaysia’s CIMB bank.
The historically high prices of gold over the past two years have contributed to the momentum of people stopping their personal belongings and taking advantage of the opportunity to exchange for cash for their family jewellery.
About 70 percent of the items stopped in 200 city warehouses are gold.
People say the price of gold looks good, we stop Grandma's gold necklace and get it back next month.
Thailand’s largest stop shop operator, EasyMoney, has seen a 20 percent increase in the number of customers using its stop shop in recent months.
The growth in the staging industry is so great that ValueMax, the operator of a branch in the center of Bendemeer and 15 others in Singapore, plans to expand not only to neighbouring Malaysia – where it has four branches – but also outside Asia, says CEO of LeYeah Value.
The company will fund 60 percent of the 66 million SGD it earned this week on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some discount creditors have been under fire from critics over high interest rates, Ms. Yeah says the bond offers not only lower rates than other creditors, but also does not directly raise debt.
“Customers stop the items they already own, and financing personal property doesn’t raise household debt,” he says.
In the company, the security of assets is increasingly accepted as a means of securing short-term, secure financing.
Moreover, among those who use landfills are not just people in financial distress.
Wealthy Singaporeans also use ValueMax branches when they stop gold bars or Rolex watches, so they can get up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash.
Our customers are from all sorts of circumstances.
“These include wealthy individuals who need to borrow in the short term because of their daring businesses or investments, or small businesses who need help to solve the problems in their cash flow,” she says.
Sometimes they just need money as quickly as possible.
<0xE2><0x86><0x90> $325 million bailout package for Tasmanian health care
The federal government insists that the $325 million bailout package for Tasmania’s declining health care sector should contain tough conditions to ensure that the state government doesn’t disrupt funding.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek said the Australian Federation is taking "accelerated measures" to counter the crisis caused by the island's aging population, a higher number of chronic diseases and systemic disorders.
Financing for four years was decided after government consultations with independent Tasmanian MP Andrew Wilk.
“The government has come with an emergency rescue package, which we believe will solve the specific problems that the state is facing,” Plibersekov<0xC3><0xA1> said today.
The $325 million package includes $31 million for surgery at the request of the patient.
Another 2,600 surgeries, including orthopaedic surgeries and glaucoma surgeries, will help eliminate debt.
The money is also available at freely accessible clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better postoperative care, training of health professionals, mental health services, and personal electronic health records systems in local hospitals.
“These investments respond to the ideas that leading clinical doctors have told me that they will help the Tasmanian health system in the best way possible,” Plibersek said.
She stressed that the Tasmanian government must demand a strict reporting regime and a record-keeping obligation.
The state will have to maintain the current level of funding in order to receive money from the Australian Federation, and report monthly on where the additional funds were spent.
A three-member committee will be set up to ensure that the state provides services as efficiently as possible.
Mr Wilkie said today that $325 million will be of no use until a real reform is followed to lay the foundation for a more sustainable Tasmanian public health system.
Still, he praised the government for responding to his request for urgent assistance, which he first raised during talks with the prime minister in early May.
“I believe that the federal aid package will be able to free state public health from a critical condition,” Wilkie said.
According to the state government, these additional chosen procedures will significantly reverse the recent cuts.
Peter Dutton, a spokesperson for the federal health opposition, believes that today’s statement is just a “patch.”
“The reason I’m here is because the Labour government is taking $430 million out of our health care system,” he told ABC TV.
You can’t have a state government that takes almost half a billion dollars, and an Australian union that spends $300 million, and pretend it’s good news.
Mr. Dutton called on Mrs. Plibersek to ensure that not a single dollar of the bailout package would be spent on higher bureaucracy.
Guillaume Nicloux adapted Denise Diderot’s novel, which brings an exceptional film tour and remake of the time, but is also more boring than it should be.
Set in France in the 18th century in the 1960s, she tells the story of Suzanne, a young nobleman who is sent to the monastery by her family.
When she rebels, she experiences extremely cruel treatment from the criminally perverted mother she introduces and, for another, becomes the object of sexual passion.
The film never slips into a dullness or sensationalism, and that's his problem.
The ceremonial spirit of this story leads to the fact that even the spectators will experience torture similar to the wearing of a weave shirt.

Syria Has Destroyed Its Resources for Chemical Weapons, Surveillance Authority Says
Syria has destroyed essential equipment for the production of chemical weapons and ammunition with poisonous gas, the committee for global supervision of chemical weapons said on Thursday, as sharp conflicts erupted in the north of the country, not far from one of the places where the slump is supposed to be.
On Thursday, the Syrian activist group also said that more than 120,000 people have been killed since the start of the civil war nearly three years ago.
Notification of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons came the day before 1 November,
The deadline set by the Hague-based organisation for the destruction or disabling of the operation of all chemical weapons production facilities and chemical mixing machinery for the production of poisonous gas and for the filling of ammunition.
The completion of this initial phase of destruction is an important milestone in the ambitious timetable, which aims to destroy all chemical weapons in Damascus by mid-2014.
The destruction of the equipment means that Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons.
Damascus, however, has yet to begin the destruction of existing weapons and supplies.
The country is estimated to have about 1,000 tons of chemicals and weapons, including yperite and nerve gas sarin.
The announcement came at a time when fighting raged in the city of Safira on Thursday, which experts speak of as the headquarters of a chemical weapons and storage plant, the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.
A group of activists, which monitored the total number of victims through a network of activists in Syria, announced on Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
There are 61,067 civilians, including 6,365 children.
The government has 29,954 members of Bashar Assad’s armed forces, 18,678 government fighters and 187 Lebanese Hezbollah militants.
Among those killed are 2,202 government fugitives and approximately 5,375 opposition fighters, many of whom are foreigners.
On July 25, the United Nations estimated that 100,000 people have died in the conflict since March 2011.
Since then, this number has not been updated.
The conflict forced about 2 million people to leave the country.
Assad’s forces have been fighting rebels in Safir, many of whom have been associated with al-Qaeda for weeks.
The observable said on Thursday that the losses were on both sides, but had no specific numbers.
The fighting has underscored the dangers faced by chemical weapons inspectors who, during their mission to get rid of the chemical arsenal amid Syria’s ongoing civil war, have to deal with tight deadlines.
In a statement from the OPCW Office, which is working closely with the UN, it was said that its team is now “satisfied to have verified – and monitored the destruction – of Syria’s declared essential equipment for production and mixing/filling”.
He added that “no further control activities are planned at the moment.”
Earlier this week, the inspectors said they had completed the first round of verification work when they visited 21 of the 23 sites declared by Damascus.
The inspectors said they were unable to visit two sites due to security concerns.
On Thursday, the OPCW said the two sites had been “released and ... the items of the chemical weapons program it contained were moved to two other declared sites that were checked.”
It was not immediately clear whether the facility in Safir was one of those places that the OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has approved a plan to completely destroy its chemical weapons, which is due to be approved by the OPCW Executive Committee next month.
“I commend the courage and courage you have shown in fulfilling this most demanding mission that this organization has ever had,” said OPCW Director of Observation, Ahmet Uzumcu.
Now, in its third year, in the civil war, mainly Sunni Muslim rebels and the Assad government with its security forces, which are full of members of the Alawit sect, stand against each other than Shia Islam.
As for further development, Observable Rami chief Abdul Rahm<0xC3><0xA1>n said there was a strong explosion inside the air defense facility in the Syrian coastal province of Lazik<0xC3><0xAD>ja on Wednesday.
He said the cause of the explosion was unknown.
Anger over the verdict of the founder of the bombing of Bali
The survivors and relatives of 202 people killed in the 2002 bombing of Bali reacted furiously to the verdict handed down by the last of the founders who were brought to justice and said Umar Patek was to be executed.
Patek, who spent nearly 10 years on the run as one of the most wanted people in Southeast Asia, was sentenced yesterday to 20 years in prison for building an explosive device used in the bomb attack.
He could be released on parole in 15 years.
The 45-year-old man was found guilty of mass murder in an attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist area of Kuta, after which 202 people were killed, including 88 Australians, and many wounded.
He was also found guilty of several other terrorism-related charges, including a series of bombings of churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
The indictment claimed life, although it could insist that a man with the nickname "Demolition Man" (breaker) was given the death penalty thanks to his reputation as an expert in the manufacture of explosives.
This decision revived the painful memories of June Corteen, a mother from Perth, who lost her 39-year-old twins Jane and Jenny in a devastating attack by Patek and other founders almost ten years ago.
With tears in her eyes, she said Patek should be sentenced to death.
I really think he should follow in the footsteps of the others.
Ms. Corteen told AAP: "It should be built in front of a criminal gang."
Every day I have to live with the fact that I don't see any more grandchildren and my daughters.
The Sari club was compared to the country when a heavy load placed outside a parked truck was fired on 12 October 2002 shortly after 23:00.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's bar, where just 20 seconds earlier, a suicide bomber fired an explosives-filled backpack.
As a result of the explosion, he fell into a coma on the moon, and while he was kept alive, doctors “died” three times.
Mr Hughes said Pateka should face the same fate as the three other members of the Islamic Jamahiriya terrorist cell responsible for the massacre – Amrozi, Muchlas and Imam Samudru – who were executed four years ago.
This guy should get the death penalty like nobody else.
Keeping him alive... there's no reason to keep him alive.
To get 20 years for killing 202 people and injuring hundreds of others, it's not that much.
Patek was the last of the terrorists in Bali.
The arrest was avoided for nearly a decade, but was eventually struck in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad in January 2011, where less than four months later U.S. forces killed former al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.
During the trial, an FBI agent said in his testimony that intelligence reports revealed Patek was in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden in an effort to re-establish links between terrorist groups from Southeast Asia and Al Qaeda.
"He didn't give up voluntarily," said Mrs. Corteen.
To this day, he did not feel regret for how much grief he caused to others.
The verdict comes before the 10th anniversary of the attack, which will be later this year and which will include ceremonies in Bali and Australia.
"We'll see a lot of tears this year," said Mrs. Corteen.
Patek can still appeal against the judgment.
FAA: Air Transport Passengers Can Now Use Technology Expenses in Aircraft (But Cannot Call From Their Mobile Phones)
Airline passengers will be able to use their electronic devices “from gate to gate” – in addition to calling from their mobile phones – to read, play games, watch movies and listen to music on the basis of unexpected new rules, which was released on Thursday.
However, passengers should not expect the changes to occur immediately.
How quickly the change will be implemented will vary according to individual airlines, FAA administrator Michael Huerta said at a news conference.
Air carriers will have to demonstrate to the FAA administration the extent to which their aircraft comply with the new rules and that they have updated the on-board crew training manuals and equipment storage guidelines to comply with the new rules.
The FAA said it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft.
Among the companies that have already submitted the plans are Delta and JetBlue.
“Depending on the status of such a plan, we can improve the widespread use of electronic devices very quickly,” the FAA said in a statement.
At present, passengers are required to turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the aircraft doors close.
They can't turn them on until the plane reaches a height of 3 kilometers and the captain issues a permit.
Passengers are expected to turn off their equipment again when the aircraft crashes to land, and do not turn them on until the aircraft is on the ground.
Under the new rules, airlines whose aircraft are properly protected from electronic disruption can allow their passengers to use their equipment during take-off, landing and commuting, the FAA said.
Most new transport aircraft and other aircraft, which have been adapted to allow passengers to use Wi-Fi at higher altitudes, are expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Stewards, welcomed the changes.
“As soon as the new rules are safely introduced – and we will work closely with transport companies on this – it will be a success,” Glading said in a statement.
Frankly speaking, we get tired of looking like “watchers.”
However, surfing the internet, sending e-mails and sms or downloading data will continue to be banned below 3 kilometers of altitude, the agency said.
Passengers will be notified to switch their smartphones, tablets and other devices to flight mode.
So still no Words with friends, an online scrabble game played by actor Alec Baldwin on his smartphone in 2011, when he was, as is well known, kicked out of an American Airlines plane because he refused to turn off his device when the plane was parked at a bar.
And heavier devices like laptops will still have to be stored because of fears that they might hurt someone if they were flying around the cabin.
Calls from mobile phones will continue to be banned on board.
The rules for the use of mobile phones are not determined by the FAA, but by the U.S. Federal Telecommunications Committee.
The FAA may lift the ban on some electronic devices during take-off and landing.
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the State Transportation Safety Committee, a national transportation safety expert at CBS News, said that mobile phones continue to be considered a risk.
“Mobile phones are really a problem, not only because they can potentially cause interference with navigational devices, but we also know from FCC data that they can cause interference in the air of broadcasting towers,” Rosenker said.
The industry advisory committee set up by the FAA administration to investigate this problem last month proposed that the government allow wider use of electronic devices.
In recent years, pressure has been developed on the FAA to ease restrictions on their use.
Critics such as Senator Claire McCaskill, a Democrat from Missouri, argue that there is no legitimate security reason for the ban.
Restrictions are also increasingly difficult to enforce because the use of such devices is ubiquitous.
Some studies suggest that up to a third of passengers forget or ignore the obligation to turn off their devices.
The FAA began restricting the use of electronic equipment by passengers in 1966 in response to disruption of navigation and communication equipment when passengers began to carry FM radios, a technical gain of the time.
The new airlines are much more referenced to electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also constructed, and approved by the FAA to be resistant to electronic interference.
For several years, airlines have been offering passengers the use of Wi-Fi at travel altitudes.
Plans adapted for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference.
The vast majority of airlines should adapt to the new rules for greater use of electronic devices, Huert said.
Today’s electronic devices generally emit much less intense radio broadcasts than was the case with devices of previous generations.
For example, electronic readers only emit a minimum broadcast when turning the page.
But broadcasting is stronger when devices download or send data.
Among those who are pushing to loosen restrictions on the use of these devices by passengers, is Amazon.com.
In 2011, representatives of this company loaded the transport aircraft with their Kindle electronic readers and conducted a test flight, but no problem emerged.
The members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings as to whether these devices pose any risks.
Douglas Kidd of the National Airline Passenger Association said he believes that disruption from these facilities is real, even if the risk is minimal.
Other members of the committee have stated that there are only fragmentary reports from pilots to support the fact that such devices can cause disruption to aircraft systems, and most of these reports are very old.
However, the Committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to order passengers to turn off the equipment during low-visibility flight.
The Group of the Travel Industry welcomed these changes and believes that it is a sensible process for the travel public, which uses technology to a large extent.
“We are delighted that the FAA has recognized that a pleasant travel experience is not inconsistent with safety,” said Roger Dow, executive director of the American Travel Association.
The bird was transported by air from a drilling rig in the North Sea and released back into nature
The bird was transported to the coast after being found exhausted on an oil platform in the Black Sea, and released back into the wild.
One of them was transported by helicopter to Aberdeen last month after being previously treated by the Scottish company SPCA at a rescue center until he recovered.
Operations Center Colin Seddon said: "This thunderstorm probably migrated from northern Europe when it was caught by a strong wind over the North Sea."
Apparently, he ran out of strength and found shelter on the oil rig.
Mr Seddon added: "He was unable to take off again, so we were contacted for help."
At the time he was discharged, he was in good condition and healthy.
Is the European elite ready to trade with Britain?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with a promise to connect businesses and define what changes in the relationship with the EU UK entrepreneurs and job-creating companies want to see.
To this end, we have provided the largest and most comprehensive survey in which we asked leading British entrepreneurs for their views on Britain, trade and the EU.
YouGov surveyed 1,000 leading entrepreneurs representing UK companies of various sizes and from different sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will be a surprise to many.
We have found that the overwhelming majority of businesses are now trying to export outside Europe and are focusing on countries that are modernising and growing while EU countries are stagnating.
They want to see how the government prefers new trade ties with countries such as China, India and Brazil, rather than avoiding a long and strenuous process of reforming Europe’s secret institutions.
When we asked about their views on specific policy areas – from monopoly regulations to product laws – most entrepreneurs expressed the view that the control of these key competencies should be returned to Westminster.
There was widespread dissatisfaction with the single market, and entrepreneurs said that the costs of Brussels regulation now outweigh the benefits of being part of the European business area – the agreement was expressed even by 40 percent of large enterprises, that is, traditionally the most pro-European companies.
And finally, our survey of leading companies revealed the most outspoken knowledge, namely that the unequivocal majority wants Britain to seek to change the treaty and the relationship with the EU, which should be based on trade, not politics.
The findings, which have identified companies of different sizes and major business groups, show that the business sector is pushing for a ‘meaningful change’ that will transfer its influence back to the UK.
There is a lot at stake – achieving a treaty change and a better deal for Britain can mean a profit of up to 16% when voting in a referendum to stay in the EU.
The prime minister should not hesitate: this survey shows that British trade supports his plan to renew the terms of British membership in the EU.
It also shows that the business sector expects that this reform will mean a significant shift from the current balance of forces back towards the UK.
A better deal for Britain is possible, and as the eurozone embarks on a journey towards a narrower economic and fiscal union, it is increasingly necessary.
Jobs and growth in the UK must be a priority, and as the results of our survey show, for business this means a refocus on trade and a fundamental change in the regulatory approach in Brussels.
John Kerry admits that spying has gone too far.
The United States has sometimes gone "too far" into espionage, according to AFP, US diplomacy chief John Kerry, during a video conference between Washington and London.
According to the minister, the gathering of information was used to deter terrorist attacks.
The "first confession from Washington" was heard amid fierce controversy on both coasts of the Atlantic over scandalous revelations of mass surveillance by the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA), which has also been targeted by U.S. allies.
"In some cases, I admit, as President Barack Obama has done, some of these actions have gone too far and we make sure it doesn't happen in the future," Kerry said.
In the interview, however, he defended the practice so far.
In his view, the gathering of information is necessary to combat terrorism and prevent terrorist attacks, such as the September 11, 2001 attacks in the United States, the Madrid attacks in March 2004 or the London attacks in July 2005.
“We prevented planes from falling, buildings from exploding and people from being killed because we were able to be informed in time of the incident,” Kerry said.
However, he again admitted that the gathering of information "in some cases went disproportionately far".
The affair around U.S. intelligence, which allegedly watched hundreds of millions of phone calls, broke out in Europe this month.
Among other things, it turned out that the Americans were also watching the cell phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
The European leaders did not hide their anger, and some of them called on the European Union to try to reach an agreement with the United States that would prohibit or significantly limit monitoring.
Alexei Miller of Gazprom says pipelines in Bulgaria are beginning a new gas era
The start of the construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria means the launch of one of Europe’s largest energy projects, said Gazprom’s director.
“Today, we are witnessing a milestone: the construction of the Bulgarian part of the South Stream pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, has begun,” President Alexei Miller told Gazprom in a statement.
This project is a key element of the energy security of the entire European continent.
The South Stream pipeline is expected to add diversity to Russian export routes across Europe.
The contractual dispute between Gazprom and its partners in Ukraine, which brings the majority of Russian gas to Europe, adds to the risk of conventional routes, officials say.
According to Miller, a direct connection to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are “forever” eliminated.
As soon as the entire project starts operations in 2015, Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from the South Stream pipeline at a discounted price.
Gazprom says construction is scheduled to begin in other countries towards the end of this year.
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.
Hezbollah has sent thousands of troops to Syria.
A decisive battle awaits them.
The Lebanese Hezbollah movement deployed 15,000 of its fighters north of Damascus in preparation for the decisive battle for the Kalamun mountainous region.
According to ongoing reports, Israel destroyed rockets aimed at Hezbollah in Wednesday's airstrikes at two locations in western Syria.
This Lebanese Shiite organization is fighting in Syria on the side of the local army.
Its agenda is also the fight against Israel, which does not interfere in the Syrian conflict, but has made it clear that it will prevent the transfer of arms to Hezbollah’s hands in Lebanon.
Reports of Wednesday’s Israeli airstrikes on weapons depots in western Syria are yet to be clarified.
Israel did not comment on the attack, but it was confirmed by US sources.
According to the Syrian website Dampress.com, rockets fired from the Mediterranean area hit the Syrian missile base Sn<0xC3><0xBA>bar Jabla south of Latakia.
The al-Arabiya news station says two warehouses were hit, in which the missiles were ready to be transported to Lebanon.
According to its sources, these were missiles of Russian production SA-8.
Israel declined to comment on the report, but military analyst Ron bin Jishay said Syria is constantly trying to supply Hezbollah with missiles and the Syrian Air Force is teaching members of the Hezbollah armed section how to handle missiles.
The SA-8 is an outdated missile that the Syrian army has had since the 1980s.
They are placed on a movable chassis.
Although they are quite primitive, thanks to their mobility and small dimensions it is easy to hide them.
They are equipped with a radar, which turns off after the missile is fired, so it is difficult to target them.
Latakia is located in western Syria, in an area inhabited by the ruling Alavas.
This is a well-guarded area and Hezbollah has been involved in the fighting in western Syria in the past.
He claims to be helping to protect the Syrian Shiite community, which includes the al-Qaeda.
It is now reported that 15,000 of his fighters are ready to help the army recapture Kalam<0xC3><0xBA>n.
Along with Hezbollah, the Syrian army is also strengthening its forces there.
Kalam<0xC3><0xBA>n lies between Damascus and Homs, the third largest city in the country.
The battle is said to be a response to the recent attack by the opposition on the command of the Syrian Shiite brigade of Abu Fadla Abbas in the Shiite part of Damascus.
This year, Hezbollah helped the Syrian army fight back the city of Kusajr on the Lebanese border.
Many of the rebels from Kusajr just left for Kalam<0xC3><0xBA>n.
Even recently, it seemed that the majority of citizens in the Czech Republic wanted early elections.
Corruption, money laundering for overburdened purchases and government contracts, tax hikes and, last but not least, government scandals were cited as the reasons.
According to the results of the elections, it can be concluded that the majority of citizens met this condition.
That they didn’t really care, and with the state that was here (the robbery and the debt of this state), they were actually satisfied.
Otherwise, I cannot explain that 3,413,497 voters did not go to the polls, 596,357 voters voted TOP 09,384,174 voters voted for the ODS, so a total of 4,394,028 actually supported the original government coalition, representing 52.16% of all voting rights.
That's the majority of them.
When the above-mentioned parties added 1,016,829 <0xC4><0x8C>SSD voters, then with the old order (since all these parties participated in the "theft" and debt of this state), then this state actually agreed to 64.23% of eligible voters.
In fact, the majority of voters have shown that they are not to punish the perpetrators of the robbery and the indebtedness of this state.
Or do you think that the members of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD who participated in it are based on the relevant laws?
Is there anything we can do to help?

The Royal Commission has learned that two employees of the Christian Young Men’s Association (YMCA) have been charged before lawsuits against Jonathan Lord
The Royal Commission on Sexual Abuse of Children learned that before charges were filed against Jonathan Lord, a child educator from Caringbah, in 2011, two employees of the Christian Association of Young Men’s Association (YMCA) from Wale<0xC3><0xAD>n, New Zealand.
But it was heard before the commission that in its opening statement to the commission, the association stated that in its organization they never solved the case of sexual abuse of the child.
Executive Director Phillip Hare was questioned about a case where one of the YMCA employees was charged with offences related to child pornography, and another when a Caringbah gymnast from the YMCA was convicted of sexual harassment of his children in 1991.
Mr. Hare told Gaili Furness, the commission's advisor, that he knew about the first case, but not about the second.
He admitted that the YMCA’s initial statement was also inaccurate when it stated that the YMCA had conducted external audits that rated the organization as a leading advocate for children’s rights.
The evidence submitted by the commission suggests that the YMCA was alerted to the fact that in the audit of the Ministry of Education and Society from August this year it received the second lowest of four possible assessments.
Mr. Hare, who began working with the YMCA when he was 21, admitted that the leadership from him had failed downwards when Mr. Lord accepted without making sure staff were aware of the duty to report violations of child safety rules.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sexual harassment of 12 boys, whom he admitted during two years working for the YMCA.
He was imprisoned for at least six years.
Mr. Hare, however, rejected the claim that the YMCA had a cultural problem that prevented staff from reporting violations of child safety by Mr. Lord.
Staff members provided evidence that they witnessed such violations, including the fact that the Lord was with the children alone, privately guarding them, letting them sit next to him on the bench, telling them he liked them, and letting them play with his mobile phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was Lord's subordinate and asked for a child safety training because she was concerned about his behavior, testified that Jacqui Barnat, head of child services at the YMCA in Caringbah, who was Lord's superintendent, was "very intimidating and often horrifying."
The director-general said he did not accept evidence from staff that they felt faint if they should contact their superiors and report the actions.
Instead, he said that their friendship with the Lord had obscured their judgment, and therefore they did not report the problem.
Mr. Hare said he told the YMCA Board in New South Wales that the lesson from the “Jonathan Lord case” for the organization was that the staff “did not submit any message,” and the board agreed with him.
Mr. Hare said the decision to let staff sign the secrecy agreement shortly after the charges were made was made by YMCA General Manager for Children’s Services Liam Whitley.
He said the goal was to avoid distortion of evidence, but it was “excessively passionate” and misguided.
Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University told the commission that the YMCA in New South Wales was not an organization that would be safe for children between 2009 and 2011.
He said there were serious problems in recruiting, auditing, hiring, training, and managing staff.
The hearing was postponed to December 20.
Tony Blair said he would take the opportunity to return to the post of prime minister, but admitted that the return is unlikely.
In a nightly interview on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his resignation, the 59-year-old politician expressed his views on various areas of domestic politics.
Since June 2007, after ten years in office, Mr Blair has mostly avoided discussions about British politics and has limited his comments to foreign affairs and his role as an ambassador of the Eastern Peace Quartet.
Asked if he would return to the post of Prime Minister, his response to London's Evening Standard read: "Yes, of course, but it's hard to do that, so..."
While a team of horse show experts gathered in Cardiff to fight for the Horse of the Year award, it was clear to everyone that the competition would not be easy.
But no one was ready for the three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Although he is not yet going to school and only a few months ago he took the first steps, this boy and his pet, Shetland pony Toffee, smoothly squeezed three wheels to finally win the main prize and leave behind 30 pulling adults.
This inseparable couple – of the same height – was praised at the annual competition run by the Sunnybank Riding Centre in the village of Rudry near Cardiff for their appearance, behavior and style.
He stood up to the men and women in elegant hats, tilted his beret into a cheerful corner, and let his two-year-old Toffee stroll around the circle.
Fenton was praised by the jury for his natural ability to control horses that far exceeded his age.
And Toffee earned the highest marks for insight and personality.
Fenton Toffee had his third birthday in March and has been practicing daily with this Shetland pony ever since.
His mother Donna (30) said, “Fenton and Toffee are working great together.”
They didn’t have much hope, but eventually they left with a golden cup and a flower.
It was only the second time he competed with Toffee, and when he won, we were thrilled.
Everyone considered him phenomenal, and completely strangers wanted to take a picture with him.
A boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale in South Wales is following in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been riding horses for more than 10 years.
Mrs. Howells says: “There was an exciting atmosphere and everyone encouraged and thanked.”
He ran through the sand along the entire length of the arena, and although he seemed so small, he did a great job.
Fenton is obsessed with animals – he loves horses, tractors and a farm and got in charge of two chickens.
Given how he started, he'll be back at the Horse of the Year competition soon and I'm sure he'll be doing well.
A spokesperson for the annual horse show competition said: "There are only three of them, but he already knows how to control a pony."
They make a great team together.
The jury picked up Fenton and Toffee for their excellent speech and the way they performed on the circuit.
They’re always watching how good teamwork is between the ponies and who runs them – and Fenton and Toffee were the best at the oval.
I'm sure Fenton's got some nice clothes, too, and he really got in there with him.
Too Curious Newspaper to be Examined
Chinese newspapers, which on the headlines requested the release of a reporter accused of slander, will be thoroughly investigated, the official said.
Guangzhou-based New Express newspapers have made a rare public request for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
However, Chen later admitted on television that he had taken bribes to invent stories about a company partially owned by the state.
The administrator said the New Express newspapers would now make a “full correction.”
The order for “correction” came from the State Administration for press and publication, radio, film and television in the province of Kuang-tung.
Preliminary investigations have shown that between September 2012 and August 2013, the Yangcheng Evening News newspaper issued several false reports about Zoomlion.
"The editorial staff of the New Express newspaper was unorganized," the administrator said in a statement.
He said he had to decide “to impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou in the form of the cancellation of a journalistic license.”
He also ordered the Yangcheng Evening News group to carry out the overall correction of the New Express letter, and recommended that they investigate the person in charge of the New Express and immediately change the management of the New Express letter.
Mr. Chen wrote for the New Express several articles on financial inequalities in a construction equipment company called Zoomlion.
After he was arrested, his newspapers issued two requests for his release on the headlines and claimed that he was behind his journalistic work.
Mr. Chen, however, appeared on state television and admitted to publishing false stories in return.
“In this case, I have done damage to Zoomlion and the entire media industry and its ability to gain public trust,” he told state-run CCTV.
I did it mainly because I was afraid of money and fame.
I realize that I've been wrong.
After Mr. Chen's apology, he issued a New Express letter on the cover of the apology, stating that he failed when he failed to adequately check his messages.
Recently, he made a confession on television by a number of sharply watched suspects.
Experts say confessions are still being enforced on a regular basis, regardless of the amendment to this year’s law, which prohibits authorities from forcing anyone to blame themselves.
A U.S.-Mexico drug smuggling tunnel with its own railway has been found.
One of the most industrial drug smuggling tunnels between the U.S. and Mexico has emerged, complemented by its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail.
U.S. authorities have described a tunnel about one meter in size as one of the most industrial secret corridors they have ever discovered.
The tunnel, which clicks to the length of nearly six football fields, connects a warehouse near Tijuana in Mexico and in San Diego, USA.
This area is full of indefinite warehouses where trucks can easily be hidden before they are loaded with drugs.
Authorities said the tunnel had been closed before drugs could have been transported unnoticed.
Along with the discovery of the tunnel, authorities also detained eight and a half tons of marijuana and about 150 kilograms of cocaine, according to court records.
Three men, who reportedly worked as drivers, were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine in order to distribute them.
In the case of a conviction, he faces sentences of imprisonment from 10 years to life.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers penetrate extensive drainage ducts.
The tunnel is the eighth largest corridor discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered in October after the harvest of marijuana in central Mexico, which in front of drug cartels poses a problem of how to get your product to consumers as quickly as possible.
In 2010, authorities found a 650-metre-long corridor equipped with rails that led from the kitchen of one house in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
Economia and the Centre combine management.
They offer, for example, joint advertisements.
The new integrated newsroom of Economia in Prague, Karl<0xC3><0xAD>n.
Economia has taken another step towards transforming the holding of the Centrum into its media house.
Since Friday, Economia and the Centre have shared top management.
"The unification of the organizational structure and the personnel union are essential for the integration of both publishers into the joint media house," commented the changes made by the Vice-President of the Executive Board of the Economy and the incumbent CEO Kamil <0xC4><0x8C>erm<0xC3><0xA1>k.
<0xC4><0x8C>erm<0xC3><0xA1>ka, who will lead the joint management, will be supplemented by Andreas Demuth, CEO of Centrum Holdings.
Pavel Voparil was appointed as the new joint director of the business, to which the advertising director of the two companies, Zuzana Tyl<0xC4><0x8D>erov<0xC3><0xA1>, is also subordinated.
The new head of information technology was <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>p<0xC3><0xA1>n Burda.
The joint editorial director is Vladim<0xC3><0xAD>r Pisk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek, whose team includes Jakub Unger, Director of Transformation.
Adéla Pitts was appointed as Marketing Director.
V<0xC4><0x9B>ra Lhotsk<0xC3><0xA1>, a separate department of corporate communications, is newly managed.
The joint chief financial officer is Karel <0xC5><0xBD>alud, the management of human resources for both publishing houses is led by Petra Slab<0xC3><0xA1>.
"The new organisational structure will allow us, among other things, to come to market with a common offer of advertising products, to better connect the creation of the content of all issued titles and, last but not least, to significantly further streamline the business management of the company," added <0xC4><0x8C>erm<0xC3><0xA1>k.
The company Economia, owned by the financier Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k Bakala, entered into a contract for the purchase of Centrum Holdings and its Czech subsidiaries at the end of April this year.
The portfolio of Centrum Holdings consists of the servers Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz, <0xC5><0xBD>ena.cz, web portals, an extensive e-mail base under the brands Centrum.cz and Atlas.cz and SMB agency Najisto or the portfolio of almost two dozen other smaller websites.
Economia is the publisher of Economic Newspapers, the news server IHNED.cz, the weekly newspapers Respect and Econom and a number of printed and internet B2B titles.
Among the Czech publishers, it is the most successful in the long term in the sale of digital versions of its main titles.
This year in June, the publishing house moved to the newly built modern spaces in Prague’s Karl<0xC3><0xAD>n.
CME is focused on television business.
It will release nearly a quarter of people.
The CME media group will be fired.
By the end of the year, he wants to kill a thousand people.
He intends to feel all the side activities and wants to focus only on his main business, television broadcasting.
The group, which owns Nova TV in the Czech Republic and also operates in Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Slovenia, employs a total of approximately 4,500 people.
That’s how nearly a quarter of people lose their jobs.
The media group operates television in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Slovenia.
CME is part of CET 21, which holds a license to broadcast TV stations Nova, Nova Cinema, Nova Sport, Fanda, Sm<0xC3><0xAD>chov, Telka and the Czech version of the music station MTV.
How much the savings will affect the Czech Republic, where the group employs about 650 people, and what this will mean for domestic TV Nova, it is not yet clear.
"It's premature and we can't really comment on it," said Novy communications director Josef Koukol<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek.
According to MF DNES, the Czech Republic will certainly not be exempted from significant dismissal, but it should have the biggest impact on the staffing status of CME branches in Romania and other countries.
Both new Novy CEOs Christoph Mainusch and Michael Del Nin, who joined after longtime CEO Adrian Sarbu, spoke during a Wednesday conference call with analysts that they wanted to limit all activities that were not directly related to the television business.
It is therefore quite likely that it will significantly reduce, in particular, the cost of producing its own shows, filming and production activities.
In the industrial site of <0xC4><0x8C>KD in Prague, a cooling tower burned at night
In the industrial area of <0xC4><0x8C>KD in Prague, a large-capacity tank was burned, according to firefighters, apparently a cooling tower.
"The firefighters went to the fire on Thursday before eleven o'clock in the evening, and this morning they extinguished the fire," said Pavl<0xC3><0xAD>na Adamcov<0xC3><0xA1>, a spokeswoman for Prague firefighters.
The amount of pollutants in the surrounding air did not exceed the permissible limits according to the measurement.
The extent of the damage and the cause of the fire is not yet known.
About five dozen firefighters gradually arrived at the site in Kolbenov street.
"It's a large-capacity tank fire, probably a cooling tower," Adamcov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
"There is no functional hydrant network in the site, so we burn it by means of a transport line from the cisterns," she added.
According to the server tn.cz, the extinguishing of the poorly functioning network of hydrants was complicated, so the firefighters had to transport the water from somewhere.
The firefighter has declared the second stage of the fire alarm.
There are four levels in total, in the most serious situations the fourth is declared.
The chemists also went to the site to check the level of hazardous substances that could have entered the air during the fire.
“But they didn’t measure the amount of harmful substances in the air that would exceed hygiene standards,” a firefighter spokeswoman said.
British police have given Assange a notice of extradition.
British police today delivered an announcement of the release of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who found refuge at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, where he applied for asylum.
Scotland Yard said it had delivered a “disclosure notice” to the 40-year-old Australan asking him to arrive at the police station and that if he did not, he could face arrest.
Under British law, Assange exhausted his options when the Supreme Court overturned his appeal against extradition this month, thus facing extradition to Sweden on charges of sex crimes.
Fearing that Stockholm would send him to the United States, he sought refuge at the Ecuadorian embassy in London on June 19, where he applied for asylum from the South American country.
Scotland Yard “delivered a notice of release to a 40-year-old man asking to arrive at the police station on the day and hour that were assigned to him,” the spokesman said.
Assange is still violating bail terms.
The Embassy refused to comment on the delivery of the notice of issue.
Assange fears he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States, where he may face espionage charges because he has posted 250,000 U.S. diplomatic documents on his WikiLeaks website.
The driver was fined <0xC2><0xA3>1,000 for driving over 200 km/h with a hot drink between his legs.
The driver was fined <0xC2><0xA3>1,000 for driving up to 210 km/h with a hot drink placed between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, of Tiptree, Essex, was spotted on May 27 in his Mercedes Benz on the A120 in Braintree.
When the police stopped him, she found out he had a drink stick between his thighs.
In the Colchester police court, Howie confessed to the charge of driving recklessly and inattentively.
Seven points were added to his account, as a result of which he received a six-month ban.
Howie was also ordered to pay a fee of <0xC2><0xA3>90 and a surcharge for the accused <0xC2><0xA3>100.
As a result of the tax on foreign property owners, the Prague London bubble
The Ministry of Finance has provisionally calculated the tax on the income of financial assets, but is awaiting a final decision by Mr. Osborne, who in the 2012 budget represented a 7% fee for the transfer of real estate for buildings at a price of over <0xC2><0xA3>2 million and annual fees for buyers who own properties not as one, within the company.
Revenue from the real estate transfer fee in Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea, which reached <0xC2><0xA3>708 million in tax year 2012/13, already exceeds the total for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, Northeastern, Northwestern and Yorkshire.
Mr. Cook said: “Given the increase in the transfer of property at high-value homes and the introduction of related legislation to prevent tax evasion, it is very difficult to argue that high-value property is little taxed regardless of the effect of the outdated dam system.”
He added that “this move could have caused some foreign investors to be reluctant to buy property in London, or the existing owners to be reluctant to sell.”
Front-end real estate – top 5% to 10% of the housing market by price – in the rich belt ranging from Fulham to Wimbledon, recorded a record 11.8% increase last year.
Prices in central London continue to show year-on-year steady growth of 5.6 percent, but were overshadowed by the booming “domestic market” in which the Savills real estate office survey experienced growth in the southwest, north (7.4 percent) and east (6.5 percent).
Scientists shed more light on how tail movements are related to a dog's mood
Previous research has shown that happy dogs throw a tail more to the right (from the dog’s point of view), while nervous dogs throw the tail mostly to the left.
Now, however, scientists say that other dogs are able to detect and respond to these subtle differences in tail movement.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neurobiologist at the University of Trento, said: “People are well aware that the left and right sides of the brain have different connections to stimuli that arouse positive or negative emotions.”
We have tried to observe the same in other species.
He added that, like humans, the right side of the brain is responsible for left-hand movements and vice versa, and that these two hemispheres play a different role in emotions.
In an effort to get more information about how dogs react to disproportionate tailing of other dogs, the researchers monitored the animals who watched movies about other dogs.
They measured the tempo frequency of these animals and analyzed their behavior.
Apparently it won't be long before we understand why their tail sometimes goes on one side, and sometimes on the other.
Professor Vallortigara said: “We have projected dog films—whether in the natural version or in the form of a silhouette—to get rid of any mating stimuli, and we have also been able to adjust the movement of the tail and illustrate more to the right or to the left.”
When the animals saw the otherwise insignificant dog moving with the tail to the right (from the dog’s point of view of the tail), she remained completely calm.
However, when she recorded the tail shooting mostly to the left (again from the dog’s point of view of the tail drilling), their heart rate increased and the animals acted uncertainly.
Professor Vallortigara said he did not think that dogs would communicate with each other consciously through these movements.
Rather, it is believed that dogs have learned from experience what movements they must and do not have to pay attention to.
He said: “If you meet dogs several times and the movement of their tail in one direction is repeatedly associated with rather friendly behavior and the movement of the right produces less friendly behavior, you will respond based on that experience.”
Researchers say the findings can help dog owners, veterinarians, and trainers better understand the emotions of their animals.
Dog Behavior Expert John Bradshaw, a university professor of veterinary medicine at the University of Bristol, said this was not the first study to examine whether the left and right sides are important for dogs.
Last year, a team at Lincoln University found that dogs turn their heads left when they observe an aggressive dog, and right when they look at a cheerful dog.
And in another expert paper from the University of Victoria in Canada, he said: “Dog robots were more likely to meet dogs when they drilled a tail to the left than to the right, when they became rather uncertain – just the opposite of the Italian study.”
According to him, the difference may be due to the fact that dogs in these different studies of animals in movies or dog robots did not fully behave like dogs.
He explained that it could help studies on how dogs react to real dogs.
“Although there is good evidence in the case of many different mammals that both sides of the brain are used for different purposes, many details still need to be clarified – and dogs are no exception,” he said.
But given how easy it is to record their behavior, it probably won’t be long before we understand why their tail sometimes goes on one side and sometimes on the other.
Arctic Monkeys postponed concert in Glasgow due to Alex Turner's illness
Rock band Arctic Monkeys postponed a concert in Glasgow after the lead singer was diagnosed with throat inflammation.
The Sheffield group was scheduled to perform on Friday at the Hydro urban complex.
However, Alex Turner's illness forced her to move the show.
The group's announcement came after it was similarly forced to postpone Thursday's performance at the LG Arena in Birmingham.
In a statement on its official website, Arctic Monkeys said: “Following the decision to postpone today’s performance at the LG Arena in Birmingham and on medical advice, Arctic Monkeys must also postpone the performance at the Hydro complex in Glasgow to the 1st floor plan.”
"Alexi Turner was diagnosed with throat inflammation and unfortunately he will not be able to step out."
The performance will take place at the LG Arena in Birmingham on November 20, and the performance will take place at the Hydro complex in Glasgow on November 21.
All tickets for these performances will remain in effect.
We would like to apologise to everyone who bought tickets for the inconvenience that caused them.

Pope Francis Appoints First Cardinals in February
On Thursday, the Vatican announced that on February 22, Pope Francis will nominate new cardinals for the Catholic Church for the first time.
The cardinals hold the highest position in the clergy of the Catholic Church immediately after the pope and are the ones who elect the pope, so Francis will establish his first group of men who will eventually help select his successors.
There are now 201 cardinals.
However, once the cardinal reaches the age of 80, he can no longer participate in the election of the pope – the group is thus reduced to 120 electing cardinals.
In a statement announcing the report, Father Federico Lombardi, a spokesman for the Vatican, said that before the celebration of the promotion of the new cardinals, a meeting of the current cardinals known as the Consistory will take place.
“Pope Francis has decided to announce his decision to convene the February Consistory in advance to facilitate the planning of other meetings that require the participation of cardinals from different parts of the world,” Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said the number of electing cardinals is likely to decline by February.
He said that the pope usually appoints as many cardinals as it takes to increase the number of electors again to 120, and as many cardinals over the age of 80 as he wants.
The Consistory next year will be significant because it will be the first since Francis was elected in March of this year, Valero said.
At this point, there is a certain orientation towards Europe, and especially Italy.
“It will be interesting to see if the new pope appoints cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance,” he said.
Forty percent of Roman Catholics are in South America, but they have only a small number of cardinals.
It will also be the first choice of cardinals since Francis established the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from all over the world, tasked with finding ways to reform the Church.
In the past, the Pope decided everything for himself.
"Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him," Valero said.
He said it was “possibly possible” that these cardinals the pope would ask for advice.
But we haven’t been in this situation before – it’s a complete novelty.
Valero said that the popes traditionally promoted the position of cardinals to bishops from large places, but Francis is “full of surprises – so we don’t know who he names.”
GM is pulling down some new light trucks in the U.S. due to repair of seat backrests
According to a Friday announcement from the U.S. Automobile Safety Authority, General Motors is pulling off nearly 19,000 of its 2014 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra light trucks to fix a fault with manual bending of the backrest.
In some of these vehicles, the tilting mechanism of the front seats may have a fault.
As a result, seat backrests are not compliant with federal automotive safety standards for headrests.
A notice posted on the website of the State Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) says that “if the car gets a collision from behind, the head restraint may not properly protect the passenger, which increases the risk of injury.”
Downloaded models were made between August 1st and September 10th.
GM launched its supply in June, and for this leading U.S. automaker, it is the most important vehicle to be marketed since restructuring after bankruptcy in 2009.
GM informed the owner of the shipment of the defect in the first half of October.
NHTSA was unable to review notifications to owners due to a 16-day government shutdown that weakened auto sales growth in October.
Sales of Silverado and Sierra, which were reworked for the 2014 models, rose to about 20 percent in the first 10 months of this year, GM said on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverados and 16,503 Sierras.
Stocks on the New York Stock Exchange rose 1.4 percent to $37.47 on Friday afternoon.
Obama's desperate outcry
I voted for Obama twice – I shared the hope of a possible change
He says Obama’s sincere efforts have eased the Republican Party’s obstruction
Obstructive policy cannot apologise for the passion of Obama’s health care websites or drone attacks
Obama’s 2008 campaign memoirs are a sad reminder of what could have happened
Nathaniel P. Morris studied medicine at Harvard in his second year.
I have been reading a very sad book these days.
I thought about this book that during the cloudy days of my second year of medical school, I would be encouraged and restored to a pinch of hope in me.
It is called “The Audacity to Win” and is a memoir of Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign.
When I finish my patient assessments in the evening and go to bed, the book takes me back to a time when politics inspired millions of people and speeches took your breath away.
The elections ended in a vicious domination, and television news forced us to think about the historical value of this moment.
My classmates were crying with joy, and my parents were hiding the newspapers they got.
A young team of visionaries headed for the White House and the nation was ready for change.
During his inauguration in 2008, Obama had 82 percent of support.
And here I close the book.
Moving into the present is a harsh awakening, like waking up from a dream.
It’s hard to remember these optimistic days – they seem to be distant memories, sad reminders of missed opportunities.
In the years after I dropped my first ballot, there really was a change.
It certainly wasn't anything I could have imagined.
I recognize that Obama has achieved a number of great and diverse successes – from the law on available care to the withdrawal of our troops from Iraq and the end of the policy “to ask nothing, say nothing” after the assassination of Osama bin Laden.
Moreover, I am convinced that party obstructions have reversed so many efforts to move our nation forward: among other things, it is immigration reform, the ability of the public to choose health care and the closure of the Guant<0xC3><0xA1>namo base.
But after many situations when I defended the Obama administration in front of my colleagues and friends, I have reached an absolute limit in terms of the explanations they can provide.
I found myself in a place of political despair.
The obstruction of the Republicans cannot explain the consent to listening to foreign leaders or to drone strikes that kill innocent children overseas.
They can’t explain that the National Security Agency is collecting data on the privacy of Americans, or that it’s chasing those who expose the government’s misconduct.
They cannot be held responsible for the execution of Anwar al-Awlakhi, an American citizen, without a proper trial or for limiting public contributions and spending during presidential campaigns.
They cannot justify the finding of a report that says the White House’s efforts to silence the media are “more aggressive ... than the Nixon administration.”
And most recently, they can’t even apologize for the inability to create more than 3 years after the signing of the law on accessible care a simple website.
I don't know if something like that could have been expected.
Whether I should have known at the age of 18 that the government might be at odds with the political campaigns that preceded it.
The elected office obviously does not have a predictable course, and our public conversations will form an opposition political party and random events such as the Newton Massacre.
However, all of the examples I have mentioned above seem to be largely the result of the administration's own decision.
And that bothers me the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney represented a confusing and untapped alternative and seemed unable to consolidate his policy or position.
I had the feeling that the second term for Obama, liberated from the pressure of the next election, would fill the hopes we’ve ever heard of.
Yet the return to 2008 – with Obama’s support falling below 45% this week – through this book is getting harder and harder.
It forces me to remember the many promises that have been fulfilled.
This week I read in the book a chapter about how Obama suffered a crushing defeat with Clinton at the Pennsylvania primary.
At an additional meeting during the campaign, he told his staff that he needed to get back in pace and stay true to his mission.
"I want our magic back," he said.
We must not forget who we are.
It's been five years, Mr. President, and I totally agree with you.
The views expressed in this commentary are solely the views of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer Claims Prime Minister Tony Abbott Is In A Conflict Of Interest Over Parental Leave Program
Billionaire and MP Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in a conflict of interest over the parental leave program because his daughters can get pregnant and benefit from it.
The Minsk magnate, who is leading the dispute over the payment of a $6 million carbon tax, voiced this claim when he tried to get the question out of the table whether it was in a conflict of interest.
Palmer's United Party can control up to four votes in the Senate, which play a crucial role in deciding whether to collect taxes on coal and mining activities.
But Mr. Palmer argued that only ministers could be involved in the conflict of interests, and added that Abbott's daughters were in a position where they could benefit personally from the policy.
“He got into a big conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave, because if any of his daughters got pregnant, he would have a direct interest in whether she would get parental leave,” Mr. Palmer said.
Two months after the election, after counting the votes, Mr. Palmer was officially declared the winner in the Fairfax County seat battle for the Sunshine Coast by 53 votes.
Mr Palmer called for a review of the election results to speed up the process.
Tony Abbott's daughters Frances and Bridget.
Should these elections be decided two months after the closure of the polling stations?
“We have to have a better system,” he said.
Why can't we have a system where you can come in, tap the details into the computer, vote immediately, and have the results in the middle of the seventh night?
Mr Palmer also criticised the use of pencils to label ballots.
Is it possible to get rid of the results if someone doesn’t like it?
In these days and at this time, the use of pencils seems unbelievable.
The Electoral Commission has studied the possibilities of electronic voting and has recently made a joint contribution to the debate with New Zealand.
Mr Palmer (59) said that his political programme also applies to the Sunshine Coast airport and that he would take his new job "very seriously".
Public authority is a public service.
“We don’t seek any rewards other than being able to serve society at this critical time,” he said.
Do you wash your hands?
Scientists have found that washing your hands will change your condition as well.
The experiment was attended by 98 people, divided into three groups.
The first two had the task of solving the insoluble task.
Of course, they both failed.
But the group, who had failed to wash their hands, had a much more optimistic impression than the one where the participants had not washed their hands.
Also, the group "with washed hands" performed better in the next test than the other one.
Those who washed their hands, however, achieved worse results in other tests than those who had not washed them.
The results of the "waste" were at the level of the third group, whose participants did not experience any previous failures.
According to psychologists, the results of the test indicate that physical purity really eliminates negative feelings after failure.
At the same time, however, the motivation decreases, the testers have to concentrate much more in other tests.
If we were to transfer the results of the research to the Czechs, we would probably be the most optimistic after returning from the toilet.
After using the toilet, not only one percent of Czechs and Czechs wash their hands, but it is already one-fifth of the way by public transport.
Hygienic practices are often followed by work in the garden or in the workshop, where 85 percent of people wash their hands.
Pet flushing motivates 78.7% of people to wash their hands.
A recent survey has revealed that there is a difference in the perception of Czechs and Slovaks how much it is necessary to wash your hands after giving your hand to a stranger.
In this situation, 28.8 percent of Czechs and 40.3 percent of Slovaks wash their hands.
Research has shown that both nations wash their hands about ten times a day.
"Although it would be on the spot, I'm afraid the reality is different and people are trying to make it a little better," said dermatologist Klaudie Kom<0xC3><0xA1>rkova.
RBS Suspends Two Foreign Currency Traders
According to two people familiar with the situation, the Scottish Royal Bank (RBS) suspends two traders in its foreign currency division, which is another indication that global investigations by supervisory authorities into suspected currency market machinations are becoming more common.
Some of the world’s largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are cooperating with competent authorities on investigations of the world’s largest financial market, where every day they change owners of $5.3 trillion.
The two traders would be the first RBS employees to be suspended as part of an expanding investigation, which is a response to the LIBOR (London Interbank Interest Rate) manipulation scandal.
The bank declined to comment on the suspension, but confirmed that it received a request for information from the authorities this month.
“Our ongoing search for this issue continues and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and our other authorities,” the bank said in a statement.
Last month, people close to the event reported that RBS had forwarded to the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority records of emails and instant messages sent from accounts and to accounts of a former trader.
This trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and is expected to be sacked from his current position as European president of foreign exchange trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, the European president of cash trading at Citi, took a vacation this week, while Matt Gardiner, the former head of currency trading at Barclays and UBS, was suspended this week by Standard Chartered.
None of these traders have been charged with any offences.
Mr. Usher’s group to send quick messages included bankers from Barclays and Citigroup, the people involved in the event said.
UBS said this week that after the Swiss supervisory authority Finma announced that it had investigated suspected foreign exchange market machinations in several Swiss banks, it had taken steps against some of its employees.
Globally, at least six authorities – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss antitrust authority Weko, the FCA, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are investigating claims that these bankers have joined forces to move with the currency market.
People familiar with the situation said that HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse also launched an internal investigation or received a request for information from the competent authorities.
Banks are scrambling for years with instant messaging and emails to find cases of some crimes.
Investigations reports have alarmed traders in the area, which has been one of the biggest drivers of profit-making in investment banks’ lockdowns in recent years, but has been disrupted by the small volatility of currencies that has limited opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to reduce the seriousness of the situation by claiming that with a large and highly liquid foreign exchange market it is essentially impossible to manipulate, but high-ranking traders say that may not necessarily be true.
A high-profile trader said that despite the significant volume of day-to-day foreign exchange trading sniffing liquidity between different trading platforms and banks increasing the use of their own internal platforms means that “you can start to have an impact on the market at a relatively low price.”
The report came on the same day that Credit Suisse announced that it had released a trader from its stock trading department this week, which caused a loss of nearly $6 million at the end of last year.
The Bank shall immediately notify the competent authorities and shall cooperate with their supervisory authorities.
“We are convinced that this trader acted alone and that this problem has been solved,” said Credit Suisse.
The number of HIV-infected people in Prague exceeds 1,000
Doctors in Prague have already seen more than a thousand people with HIV.
From the start of surveillance in 1986 to the end of the third quarter of this year, tests confirmed the infection in a total of 1005 people from the metropolis.
This is according to the statistics of the National Reference Laboratory for AIDS of the State Institute of Health.
According to her, 2,063 people have been infected in the Czech Republic so far.
In 396 cases, the immune system has failed.
198 people died.
The number of people infected in the Czech Republic in the last decade is increasing every year.
In 2002, tests confirmed the infection in 50 people, five years later there were already 121.
In 2009, the study revealed 156 new infections, and in 2010, 180.
The proposed number fell to 153, but it was a record high last year.
According to the lab, there were 212.
"The fact that the total number of newly diagnosed cases this year will exceed 200 is no doubt in my opinion," says AIDS expert Miroslav Hlavat<0xC3><0xBD>, who led the Prague House of Light for Patients for years.
From October to the end of 2011, tests revealed the disease in 39 people and last year in 47, Hlavat<0xC3><0xBD> said.
In September, doctors saw 21 new patients and three patients.
From the beginning of the follow-up to the end of September, HIV tests were confirmed in 1,710 men and 353 women.
AIDS has been reported in 161 men and 37 women.
The most infected were in Prague.
If you really want to get to know a city, you should go to the cemetery.
His visit reveals more than a stroll through a crowded center with monuments, churches and galleries, more than the Bedecr would reveal.
Many people read from the graves.
The cemeteries are slowly rolling and gaining an intimate insight into the local reality.
They find out what kind of people live here, what nationalities, what religions are, how big and cohesive families belong to, what age they die here, how rich they are, how important their titles and professions were to them.
The way they express their social status, the way they taste.
And from the state of the graves he will find out how they care for their dead.
Supreme Court Approves Obama's Health Care Act
The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that the health care bill signed by Barack Obama is in line with the constitution, a key victory for the Obama administration.
By a 5:4 vote ratio, the court ruled that the individual regulations of the Patient Protection and Accessible Care Act – which order citizens to buy health insurance by 2014, otherwise they are threatened with a fine – do not contradict the Constitution on the basis of government tax powers.
Judge John Roberts was on the side of four more liberal members of the court, while Judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito, and Kennedy were in opposition.
The court also endorsed the remaining parts of the 2700-page law and further ruled that the legal requirement for health care, which mandates states to extend the possibility of obtaining health insurance, otherwise there is a risk of deprivation of all funding of health insurance and non-insurance from federal resources.
The lawsuit was filed by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Enterprises to block the Act.
During the 2012 primaries, the law strongly rejected each of the major Republican candidates, including the supposed proposed candidate Mitt Romney.
“Mugabe is a hot ass” no longer threatens jail, court repeals law
Until now, Zimbabweans have had to pay close attention to the public talk about the ninety-eighty-year-old Mugabe, who has ruled the country since the beginning of the 1980s, and since the end of 1987, he has been at the forefront of it.
According to Section 33 of the Criminal Code, a fine of $100 could be imposed for defamation of the presidential office for up to one year of imprisonment.
“State representatives should not be proud of people commenting on the president in pubs or other public places,” the Constitutional Court said.
Nine judges unanimously agreed that the law undermines the freedom of expression.
It is likely that the government will appeal against the court’s decision, the BBC reported.
A number of injured Zimbabweans, including Tendai Danga, who was arrested by police two years ago for allegedly insulting the president in a bar fight with a policeman, were vocally opposed to the law.
In May, he ended up in jail by an opposition activist who used to call Mugabe a “funny ass” in public.
In August, the prosecutor accused the 26-year-old man of his intention to use a poster with Robert Mugabe's face as toilet paper.
The court also declared an unconstitutional law restricting freedom of the media.
"The state cannot punish people whose statements will later prove to be untrue," Deputy Justice Minister Luke Malala said in a statement.
Until now, Zimbabwean law has allowed a person who publishes false information to be sentenced to 20 years in prison.
“The existence of a law that allows criminalizing someone for a false statement has a freezing effect on the right to free speech,” Malala said.
Despite Mugabe ruling the country with a hard hand for more than 33 years, Zimbabwe adopted a new constitution with broader civil liberties on the basis of a referendum in March.
Small steps toward the dictatorship of one man in the country came in 2009, when the agreement between Mugabe and the opposition took Morgan Tsvangirai to the prime minister's seat.
The country, however, continues to suffer from the economic crisis and until 2008 the highest inflation in the world, which exceeded 100,000 percent.
In 2009, the government completely abolished the national currency.
Today, only other countries’ currencies are used in Zimbabwe.
The deteriorating economy is at the forefront of Mugabe’s reckless agricultural reform.
In 2000, he redistributed the land of white farmers among his supporters and war veterans.
Most of them, however, did not have any experience with running a farm.
Central Banks Will Maintain Swap Lines
Temporary and bilateral agreements between the European Central Bank (ECB), the U.S. Fed, the Bank of England and the central banks of Canada, Switzerland and Japan will become a permanent instrument that will allow banks access to global currencies whenever they need.
Banks have stated this in their joint statement.
“This is a very reasonable step,” said Julian Callow, the chief international economist at London’s Barclays bank.
“All transitional instruments of this type have gradually become permanent, so it’s no surprise to me,” adds Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch Benda, chief economist at BH Securities.
Central bankers are reinforcing the bond that began in 2007 when the international credit market crashed for the first time.
Central bank agreements have allowed access to euros, dollars and other currencies for anyone who needs them.
The central bankers’ decision comes at a time when the U.S. Fed is preparing to end its program to support the U.S. economy, which could drive the price of money on the global market even higher.
The swap contract is used by default to overcome the lack of liquidity of one currency while the current liquidity surplus of the other currency.
It can be understood as a depository of one currency and a loan of another currency.
The ECB is launching a third attempt to restore confidence in European banks.
The EU has agreed on banking supervision, the ECB will oversee 150 banks.
How Tipsport (not) collects personal data.
More than a year ago, I registered on the site Tipsport.cz.
However, I did not finish here afterwards, because there was just someone sitting at the branch who could not complete the registration from the internet.
And because I didn’t want to drive to another branch, the registration went down, then I moved and this changed my address and ID number.
When I wanted to complete the registration later, I was told that it is not possible, because I have a different OP number, address and that it is simply not possible to complete and that I have to request the deletion of data and make a new registration.
So I did and on 24.10.2013 I wrote to the technical support that I request the deletion of all my personal data from the database according to the applicable law on the protection of personal data.
On this ghost day, technical support wrote to me that I had to complete my registration at the branch.
He started an email marathon for technical support, where after the 4th Urgency 25.10. they wrote that they deleted personal data at my request.
So one would think that he could make that new registration and here the problems started again first it wrote to me that my username is already occupied (I understand it was not deleted - it is not personal data, but in the end they also deleted this).
I have therefore used a different username and it emerged that my personal data is already stored in order to complete the registration at the branch (how can they have stored something that claims to have been deleted?), so I contacted technical support again.
When I was asked how I could have been deactivated, the personal data actually deleted on 25.10. and to send an e-mail with that error.
I did this (yesterday around 3:00 p.m.) and I was notified today that I registered the same day (31.10.2013) at 13.22 and that this does not work because I used the same name and date of birth.
I've been in touch with technical support for a week now and I've decided that it's still not working.
And what about the fact that if it were true what it claims (if it is not) no one could be registered with the same name or the same date of birth if this is already registered.
Just by the way, in those 13.22 I actually registered, for the same name and date of birth, but I used the imaginary email and phone number and the world was amazed, I got a page that emailed me a link to complete the registration.
But how is it possible if you cannot register for the same name and date of birth?
Probably because Tipsport binds the registration to email and phone number and data just didn’t rule out as they claim.
So again I told the technical support that they are just lying (either intentionally or they don’t know what they’re writing), because what they’re writing is not true.
I proved several screens that the problem with registration was already before 31.10. so "fake" registration has no effect on this.
Tipsport wrote me a harsh sentence - I'm sorry, but by having you re-registered, we can't verify your claim.
And the communication ended.
The relative repeats around the same sentence that the registration is tied to the name and date of birth.
They can’t even accept the fact that the registration was not completed by clicking on that link in the email and so it didn’t actually happen.
So to sum it up, Tipsport not only did not erase the data as it claims, but still lies when it claims the opposite.
What’s worse is that you can easily prove how they lie and try to make it look like the error is on the customer’s side.
By the way, after putting this issue on my personal blog, things got a little moving and from Technical Support came an email that the matter was forwarded for review and I will be informed (after a week of emergency and consultation and warning of the same error).
Music is playing in the Metro on the Bridge
The transport company hl. m. (DPP) Prague launched the project Music in the metro.
The first vestibule, where reproducing instrumental music is played continuously during the operation of the subway, is the Bridge of Line A at the exit to Wenceslas Square.
The test operation will take six months.
Michal Hor<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek presented his new double album, band and three singers
Textor Michal Hor<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek brought not only his completely new duoCD Czech Calendar to the Hall of the Cologne Municipal Social House, but also to the show between us singers Lenka Nova, Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ka Segrad and Ondra Rumla accompanied by the excellent Orchestra of Mat<0xC4><0x9B>ja Mat<0xC4><0x9B>ja.
After an initial intro and an acting eulogy about a late musician, Michal Hor<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek gradually invited all three singers to the stage, he himself came with a candle in his hand and recalled the story of how they last played in Cologne and in the theatre and throughout the city.
"Otherwise, in Cologne, there were two types of cards that I had a lot of contact with," he recalled.
The same is true of President Zeman’s cousin.
"Perhaps we could do a tour of the Laws or the Dubravka at Bratislava," he joked about the parents of other presidents.
Several times a evening, Hor<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek, who did not leave the stage and if he did not speak, sat at the table with a glass of wine, touched his new musical activity.
Josef M<0xC3><0xA1>nes also made the calendar, who put it on the watch, about ice hockey, but at the time he had no idea how we meet in those squares and scandado, who does not skip, is not Czech.
That's the name of a song from the Czech calendar, but we're not going to play here today," he said.
Ondra Ruml, however, from this record, said he sang a very suitable song for him Sleeping in the day, singing at night and accompanied him on guitar.
Otherwise, if he did not sing, he played percussion, then all three singers were accompanied by a band composed of keyboards, cello, guitar and contrabass.
All three singers sang together a little reverberation to the side of the heart, which immediately dissipated the viewpoint.
"I'm glad that you were fascinated by the song, which did not surprise me in the city of Kmoch," said Michal Hor<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek.
After the memory of Peter Hapk, she heard in the performance of Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek Segrad, in the original by Richard Müller, rewarded with a huge applause, Han Hegerov's song recalled that Dad loved L<0xC3><0xAD>da B<0xC3><0xA1>arov<0xC3><0xA1> as well as the West's Maéu<0xC5><0xA1>kov<0xC3><0xA1>'s explanation of Maéu<0xC5><0xA1>kov<0xC3><0xA1>'s play and the communist ban.
The composer Michael Koc<0xC3><0xA1>ba recalled Sebasti<0xC3><0xA1>n's song, Segrado then sang the beautiful song of Prague composed by Jard Svoboda, an infamous native and a former Cologne.
But that was the conclusion, the applause in the stands and the addition in the form of an optimistic song We live in a wonderful time.
Another addition was prepared on the playlist, but the fans did not get it.
Almost immediately after the concert, all four of them sat at the table to sign not only the Czech Calendar, but also the older CD, Michal Hor<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek their books and even the packaging from the legendary LP and took pictures with potential interested parties.

The Czech representatives defend the trophy, but go to play on the opponent's field to the Belarusian arena, where the match will take place on a hard surface from 15 to 17 November.
This is the third time the Czechs have been in the finals in five years.
"We know we're going on hot ground, it's going to be wild, and we need to focus on our performances as always."
"We will go there with only one goal - to get three points and sell the best," said <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>p<0xC3><0xA1>nek, the keeper of the winning point in last year's final with Spain.
Secret Wars: Syria, Libya and Iran.
Obama's training on how to bomb Syria.
The U.S. team in Libya.
TOP GUN in the Persian Gulf.
The Israelis have shown exactly what the bombing of Syria will look like.
Without unnecessary humbucking, threats, and millions of statements, they sent planes, they hit the target and they came back.
They would not let themselves be discouraged by the official removal of chemical weapons in Syria.
They refuse to confirm the whole action and are no longer expressing themselves.
The exact opposite is confusing and grandiose, unsupportive actions of Obama’s Syrian policy.
And the most dissatisfied of all the attacks was what the Israelis bombed.
Don’t let the media get confused by their claims that they were bombed by a “Syrian base” or “supply for Hezbollah.”
I recently wrote here that while U.S. aid to secular rebels in the country remains only on the rhetorical level, Russia continues to happily supply weapons to Syria.
And it was the fresh shipment of Russian missiles unloaded in the port of Latakia that became the target of an Israeli airstrike.
A clear message.
And note that Israel once again bombed the Assad regime, not the rebels, although according to popular internet theories it should be the opposite.
The U.S. government has designated two members of the space forces, probably the Delta Force.
It was not known until now that they were distinguished during the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi.
The heroic deaths of two former SEALs defending the CIA area in the city were known to me as members of the secret CIA command, which is made up of former soldiers.
For a long time, it was speculated what the SEALs were doing at the consulate or even in another CIA residence.
Now it's clearer.
In any case, the information that the CIA has its offices in Libya protected by machine-gun nests (it is on one of these SEALs that both members were killed by a minomet attack) is quite surprising.
But even more surprising is the information about those two previously unknown heroes.
They were part of the U.S. command in Tripoli, and as soon as they received the report of the attack in Benghazi, they volunteered to intervene and, together with five private contractors, made their way to the CIA site in Benghazi.
Obama’s administration is blamed for the fact that during that attack, that command was not deployed officially and in its entirety and that it simply hesitated to do so.
Commander, so without orders, he'll probably release these volunteers.
In any case, the fact that the country operates not once, but permanently by the U.S. command, CIA agents and private contractors is quite interesting information.
And this is because until recently, nothing was officially admitted and even now we are talking only about some sort of NATO advisory mission in Libya.
It is good, though, that the US is trying to fight terrorism in Libya by half.
Even though it would require much more help to resolve the nationwide situation.
The last place of the secret and permanent conflict I want to write about today is the coast of Iran.
It’s not so long ago that the media almost chanted the Iranian air force for pursuing U.S. drones.
However, little is known about how Americans effectively protect their drones.
Of course, if he accidentally manages to appear his drone in the airspace, there is nothing to do with it.
However, if an Iranian drone is discovered in international space, the situation is completely different.
And so it happened that the Iranian F-4 Phantom was chasing a U.S. drone in international space over the sea, when there was perhaps the first sharp deployment of the U.S. super fighter F-22 Raptor in history.
He flew under Phantom to visually verify his armament without Phantom registering it on the radar or simply noticing it, and then when he suddenly showed up at him and called the Iranian pilot home, he listened without hesitation.
No wonder the Phantom is an American-made aircraft that remembers the Vietnam War.
It can't be compared to a raptor.
We want to show that Pilsen can still win, Rajtoral promises
It's kind of paradoxical.
While his team is mostly unsuccessful as a result in recent times, defender or backer Viktoria Plze<0xC5><0x88> Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek Rajtoral has a form that has brought him back to the national team after a year.
He manages to shoot, he boasts of activity, after the procedure he was ordered a penalty kick in the match in Teplice.
Viktoria scored in the last two rounds against Slavia and in Teplice after the victory, but in the end she took a single point from these two duels.
Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek Rajtoral believes that his team in the match with Jablonec breaks an unpleasant series.
We want to show that we can win.
"I believe that we will defeat Jablonec at home," promises Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek Rajtoral.
The team is preparing for a tough match with the North Bohemians, who play offensive football, carefully.
Everything is geared towards the match with Jablonec, the coach prepares us well, as we always draw a lot from the video game of the opponent.
"I believe it will be an excellent match on Friday night," the Czech representative of the fans at the Doosan Arena Tribune says.
Pilsen's last matches didn't go as she'd like, but the word of the crisis defender Victoria refuses.
That's how it goes in football, sometimes you're in good shape and sometimes worse.
But I wouldn't talk about the crisis at all.
"I believe we will win on Friday and it will be good again," said the defender of the West Chechens.
The Victoria team will once again rely on the support of the fans.
"It's Friday night and that's what I'd like to invite our fans who are great."
"I believe that we will reward them with a win," Rajtoral adds.
Jana Pétov<0xC3><0xA1>: Step back.
So I decided to take a step back, but when I think about it that way, it's not really a step, but a big leap - a leap a few years back, into my memories, into my childhood.
It’s a memory of what it was like, not having any worries and just coming out of school and washing dishes, deluxe and do your homework.
Although these "duties", it was mostly just a theory, the wishes of the parents.
The practice was completely different - to run out of school, throw a bag in the corner and run out.
Playing with other kids ball games, jumping drunk.
Then in the series Helena and her boys embroidery a festive napkin for Grandma's birthday.
And then after several warnings finally wash this dish, deluxe, in winter apply wood to tile stones and do the tasks until after dark under the lamp (or rely on the student and instead of tasks to write the beloved verse addressed to school love).
Breakfast in the morning with homemade strawberry marmalade (from real fruit, not the jams that are sold now, the contents of which were not lying next to strawberries) and drink it with tea from dried herbs, which my mother and I so enjoyed collecting.
I also remember those magical evenings when there was a grave silence in the room, when my sister and I were recording songs from the radio on tapes that were loud in the old cassette tape after my mother.
And then we swiped the tapes on the pencil and played the same song all the time, our favorite, and they drank the siphon.
Or we telephoned over the table using cans that were tied to each other by a rope - and when we were already on the phone in order to hear better, it was necessary to thoroughly clean our ears, then the chef was a circus <0x2B> wata.
The minimum wage was more than three times lower than it is now and my parents were able to live from it so that we lacked nothing.
We didn’t need those iPhones, iPads, even mobile phones and laptops, or branded clothing.
Clothing was inherited from generation to generation and the best "accessory" to the wardrobe was a batiked T-shirt made by domestic production using SAVA.
From the electronics it was enough to satisfy us the mentioned mum’s cassette and most of all the Walkman, which we shared with my sister and which, by the way, we used the same only on the train on the school trip.
We found it more interesting to play with Aunt Hop or Man, don't get angry, or as I've already mentioned to go "just" out.
When I was a little older, we got a video player under a tree, sure my parents saved a long time on it, but unfortunately it didn’t heat up for a long time.
My younger sister had a squirrel in it, he said he was so beautifully popping the tapes, so she tried to see if he was sleeping and squirrel.
Unfortunately, he slept, but it was his last crush.
Well, and he's got this happening to this day, poor man, on his dad's plate all the time.
She says that when Lenka was a little girl, she put a squirrel in the video and thought she was playing the recipe and didn't play it, so she can't bake it until today.
I remember how we were all able to communicate together, to make arrangements without a cell phone, a computer.
My sister and I had an appointment with our neighbour’s granddaughter for the holidays at Grandma’s, where we will meet again next summer at Grandma’s – and so it was, so it was.
We've met.
Do you promise to see someone in a year’s time?
I also remember the winter when we and the whole village were running outside, building snowmen, riding on a snow-capped grave near the church on bags filled with mustard.
Then we had dinner with the whole family and talked about the day before.
Of course, my sister and I were listening to the famous phrase before every dinner: "Don't wash your hands!"
Yes, that’s true today, but you definitely don’t have a soap attached to the tap in the lemon net in the bathroom.
After dinner, when my father in the garage "worked" at a beer with Jarda from the village, my mother and I lay on the floor, put our feet on a brick stove, opened the door and looked at the flames, and listened to the cracking of the wood that was lining up from the stones.
We were closer—really—we didn’t count how many friends we had on social media, we knew how many friends we had, the real ones!
We communicated together - we talked - we didn't text each other daily through various chats, SMS.
There was no such thing, and yet we knew much more about ourselves.
And so I could go on for a long time.
It is nice to remember, especially if I supplement these memories by looking at the albums, where the black-and-white photos are neatly glued to the black corners.
And if I didn't know how old I was at the time, the photo is always written in the back of the photo.
I see that although the cuts according to the pot did not listen to us very much and in addition we had pants after the cousin by two numbers larger, no one had laughed at us before, it was so normal (not IN).
And I'd rather go back that step forward - into reality.
Until 2013 and I will be waiting for what the modern era will invent once for my children.
What I know for sure is that these memories of mine are now at least "one hundred years behind the monkey" for the younger generation, and I think a lot of them are missing that they won't live this "pre-dop" time either.
I would wish them that!
Google, Samsung and Huawei sued for Nortel patents
The group, which owns thousands of patents lost to Nortel, filed a lawsuit on Thursday for patent infringements against mobile phone manufacturers including Google, a company it overridden during the auction in the context of Nortel's bankruptcy.
The Rockstar consortium, which bought Nortel’s patents for $4.5 billion, has sued Samsung Electronics, HTC, Huawei and four other companies in Texas for patent infringement.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of infringing seven patents.
Patents include a technology that helps link search terms on the Internet with relevant advertising, the lawsuit states, which is the core of Google’s search business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not immediately reached.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC are manufacturing phones that run on Google’s Android operating system, which competes strongly with Apple’s and Microsoft’s mobile products.
In 2011, Google made a $900 million initial bid for Nortel’s patents.
Google increased its bid several times and eventually offered up to $4.4 billion.
After Nortel was defeated by Rockstar in the patent battle, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a trade motivated in part by Motorola’s patent group.
“Despite the failure to obtain the patents that are the subject of the dispute, Google has infringed the patents and continues to infringe,” the lawsuit said.
Rockstar is seeking increased damages from Google because it believes that Google is intentionally infringing the patent, according to the lawsuit.
Miloslava Cejpkov<0xC3><0xA1>: The November Smile
She came from outside, from 4 degrees Celsius, which we're not used to yet.
At first, she put off her smile, the one that she was always putting on display as a defense against the pleasures of a friendly environment.
This relieved her a lot, because it was a mask that she decided not to wear in public.
He was honest at home only on the days when she was granny and had grandchildren around her, Elinka or Ad<0xC3><0xAD>k.
And, of course, when her sons called.
She remembered very well the lesson from the endless courses of business skills.
Now they're really good at it.
So as not to embarrass your loved ones.
Then he flew into the corner.
Like a disguise on a mask.
November, no other month can do that miracle to make her smile really like when they were on a trip with someone who hasn’t been here for almost three years.
Egypt appoints first freely elected president to office
Muhammad Mursi took an inaugural oath, but his triumphant day would hardly end the political unrest in Egypt.
ISLAMIST Muhammad Mursi promised a “new Egypt” when he was formally introduced to office as the country’s first freely elected president, after Hussein Mubarak, who was deposed 16 months earlier.
In his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Mursi also became the first freely elected Islamic president in the Arab world and the fifth Egyptian head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy about 60 years ago.
He swore an oath before 18 judges dressed in black talars in a mansion built with a view of the Nile, reminiscent of an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We are striving for a better tomorrow, a new Egypt and a second republic," Mursi said at a ceremony broadcast live on state television.
“The Egyptian people today laid the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom, true democracy and stability,” said Mursi, a 60-year-old engineer graduated from the U.S. and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that has been unified and illegal for most of its 84 years.
When Mursi arrived shortly after 11 a.m. local time in a small column of cars, hundreds of soldiers and policemen were guarding the building.
Only a few hundred supporters met in front of the courthouse to celebrate the president, and unlike Mubarak’s presidential show, the traffic was only briefly stopped so that the column could pass through a usually bustling road connecting the city centre with suburbs to the south.
Mursi’s personal prestige, ridiculed as the Muslim Brotherhood’s non-charismatic “reservation tyre,” grew sharply from his victory and his Friday speech, which aimed to present him not only as a candidate of Islamists, but also to all those who want to take in account.
"Egypt is now a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," Mursi said, dressed in a blue social suit with a red tie, to judges in a wooden-covered chamber, where he took an oath.
Mursi later went to Cairo University, where he was to give an inaugural speech.
While he was standing in the spotlight, he received an official greeting from the military band that played the national anthem.
The military commander of the field Marshal Husayn Tantavi was present.
His arrival was accompanied by a scandalous “army and people are one hand” from the mouths of hundreds of people gathered in the main lecture hall of the university.
The University of Cairo was founded in 1908 as a center of secular education and later became a bastion of Islamic student movements in the 1970s.
Mursi took a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahrir Square, where a revolution was born that ended last year’s authoritarian government of Mubarak, and vowed to recapture the presidential power taken from his office by a military council that took over.
But by agreeing to make an official oath before the court, rather than before the parliament, as is customary, he has cheated the will of the army, suggesting that the struggle for power will continue.
Mursi’s speech in Tahrir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.
In the ghettos, police specialists will probably have to ease tensions.
In the ghettos in the Czech Republic, police specialists should work in the future.
They'd spend up to half of their bounces there.
They'd watch the order and solve the problems.
Thanks to their knowledge of the environment, they should contribute to reducing tensions between people from poor places and residents from the surrounding area.
In its proposal to reduce security risks, the Ministry of the Interior counts on this.
According to him, the improvement of the situation in the country would mainly help "accelerate the security of social housing".
The document was discussed by the government.
According to the analysis, there were about 300 poor homes and quarters in the Czech Republic a few years ago.
There were 80,000 people living in them, mainly Roma.
Adults in the ghettos were unemployed, families were dependent on benefits, children ended up in "special" schools.
It's a white light.
According to the experts of problem locations, in the meantime, it has increased by a hundred.
Relationships between their people and others are intensifying.
Anti-Roman marches took place in several places.
People from around the country joined the extremists.
According to the interior, it is challenging for the police in areas with ghettos to maintain security and order.
According to him, the essential condition is "consistent application of equal access in law enforcement".
However, this cannot be achieved without detailed knowledge of the place and the people.
A specialist would go to funerals in the ghetto, where he would spend up to half of his service, the rest would serve in his district.
In a problem location, he'd be overseeing order.
He would also know the locals, so he could better deal with problems or violations.
"Thanks to the trust, specialists will be able to more easily prevent a number of illegal acts," the ministry said.
Specialists in ghettos would receive supplements of 500 to 1000 kroner a month.
The introduction of special police officers into problem areas is to be paid from Norwegian funds.
The budget is about 600,000 euros (now about 15.5 million kroner).
The Czech Republic pays 15 percent of the sum, the funds 85 percent.
Preparations began this year, now a detailed proposal is being elaborated.
The project will last until 2016.
The authors were inspired by their neighbors.
This mechanism has been successfully applied for several years in Slovakia, where the problem of socially excluded sites is incomparably higher than in the Czech Republic.
"There are so-called Roma settlements here," the authors of the report said.
How many specialists should be in the Czech Republic is not yet clear.
The answer is to give an analysis that determines where a special police officer would be needed.
It will also depend on how much money for these members the police will be able to release each year after the completion of the project.
According to the project proposal, selected police officers first complete an internship in Slovakia.
Five dozen people are expected to attend this training each year.
They will be the most suitable candidates.
There should also be special training for police officers who will be active in the ghettos.
According to the authors, social housing would help to improve the situation.
It should motivate and lead to integration.
According to the ideas of the interior it should have three categories.
The minimum standard would be met by hostels with precisely defined rules, such as the number of people per room.
The middle standard would be in smaller apartments.
A higher standard should be social flats that would be comparable to normal housing.
Tenants would have to complete an integration plan that social workers would draw up with them.
They would have to comply with housing rules, take care of their health, send children to schools, requalify and actively seek work.
If they tried to integrate, they would move on to a higher standard of housing.
According to the interior, the transversal housing system should work for at least 30 years until the next generation grows "in a pro-integratively motivated environment".
The social housing model is being prepared by resorts for local development and work.
They have to propose it by the end of the year.
Karel Dr<0xC3><0xA1>bek: Uhl<0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0x99>sk<0xC3><0xBD> vrch - one of our youngest volcanoes.
Uhl<0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0x99>sk<0xC3><0xBD> vrch is a striking hill 3 km southeast of Brunt<0xC3><0xA1>l.
Along with a few others, the evidence of volcanic activity in Nizhniy Jesen<0xC3><0xAD>k at the time (from a geological point of view) is recent.
The last eruptions here were at the beginning of the quarter.
Looking from a greater distance, on the top of Uhl<0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0x99>ské vrch there is a striking white plastered baroque pilgrim church of Our Lady of Help, built between 1755 and 1765.
He replaced the original wooden pilgrimage chapel.
The inn that stood next to the church did not survive.
Shortly after the completion of the church, an alley of four rows of lip was planted, about 1 km long.
The crossroads on Uhl<0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0x99>ské vrch is already the third version, the original stood here after 1916, the second, from 2001 it lasted only until 2004.
On the fifteen stops are wooden plastics made by the local artisan Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek Nedomlel.
He used different types of wood from the Low Autumn area.
Similarly, the bases from the rocks from the area constitute an interesting geological exposure.
The name of the sponsor is also mentioned at each stop.
The charcoal peak is the remnant of a young volcano.
Although data from radiometric measurements of age vary slightly, the last eruption here was about 1.5 million years ago.
It is thus younger than the Great Red (aged 3.3 million years) and older than Venus's volcano (aged 0.8 million years).
The volcano was born with an explosion.
With it she threw out a considerable amount of volcanic ash along with fragments of rocks from the ground, which by burning got a reddish-brown color.
At the end of this stage, the lava surfaced - today it is a layer of porous rod up to 13 meters strong.
The second eruption threw out red, brown-red and black tuff spots.
Their layer is powerful up to 50 meters and its part is accessible in the wall of the break.
In the tufts are noticeable volcanic pumes up to 1 meter tall. The second eruption was completed by the spill of lava.
At the end of the activity, a lava has emerged from the volcano, which today forms up to 50 m of a strong layer of ostrich rodent.
Volcanoes that alternate the ejection of volcanic ash with lava outlets are the most common type of volcanoes.
Because they are actually composed of layers, they are called stratovolcanoes.
The original volcanic cone was gradually eroded.
However, it was endangered until the mining of the mines in the breach on the south side.
The most intense mining took place here between 1953 and 1962.
Tuffs were added to the concrete, which was then lighter and had better thermal insulation properties.
Under the pressure of experts and the public, it was possible to stop the mining and thus preserve this unique place.
The problem, however, is the porosity and small coherence of the rocks, which rapidly vent, disintegrate and collapse down the slope.
Lom disappears pretty quickly.
To make the situation even more complicated, it is a warm, south-facing slope ideal for some rare species of plants and animals.
Correction is therefore problematic, but over time it will be necessary to select and maintain a characteristic geological profile.
This is nothing new, similar profiles are maintained in a number of important locations.
You can reach Uhl<0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0x99>sk<0xC3><0xBD> vrch by the green tourist mark from Brunt<0xC3><0xA1>l, or from Silesian Ko<0xC4><0x8D>ov.
Drivers can use the free parking space at the beginning of the lip avenue, where a short learning path begins.
She moved from the villa to the panel.
Ivana grew up and spent most of her life in a business villa with a garden and a swimming pool in one of the most beautiful Prague villa districts on Orechovce.
The original owners of the house, however, got it back in restitution and the tenants had to move with a small distance.
Ivana was therefore quickly looking for a replacement housing for herself and her then-older mother.
She got a tip for an apartment 3 <0x2B> kk in an older panel house on the opposite side of Prague.
“At first it was a shock, but the view from the fourth floor of the vast forest park and the dam on the other side inspired me,” Ivana recalls at first impression.
At first, I thought it was going to be a three-year provisorium.
“We’ve been living here for more than 13 years now and I wouldn’t change it just because of the gradual reconstruction,” adds the owner.
The mother and daughter then moved from a one hundred-twenty-metre apartment to a smaller apartment with an area of 62 m2 and distributed almost all the equipment.
The action was not easy, things were stored with friends and the gradual arrangement took almost a year.
The new apartment was in quite good condition, but necessary modifications had to take place, such as varnishing the doors or replacing the windows.
The previous owner broke out the nucleus, but the owner most defected in the impractical and unnecessary large hallway, and vice versa a small bathroom.
By combining two rooms, a multifunctional living space was created.
The architects used plasterboard to define the individual zones and classify the room, which allowed the new placement of the lights.
The first intervention, which she decided to do after a few years, was to remove the barrier in the living room.
This changed the layout of the apartment to 2 <0x2B> kk, but the room got to the atmosphere and opened up a panoramic view of the surrounding greenery.
The next step towards a partial improvement of the standard was replacing the PVC floor with the laminate floor.
Ivana didn't know the advice with the bathroom.
For years, I took magazines about housing and sought inspiration.
In one of them, I recently discovered an interesting realization.
Therefore, on the recommendation, I addressed the young architect Kamil Doud<0xC4><0x9B>rov<0xC3><0xA1>.
"It was actually the most important step in the future," says Ivana.
Thanks to the renovation of the bathroom, it was also possible to modify the available hallway.
The architect combined the toilet and bathroom space and replaced the two doors with open wings with one sliding one, saving space.
The bathroom is timeless and also sufficiently barrier-free.
Quality linings mimic sandstone, there is also a comfortable seat in the shower, a bidet shower closet.
The successful cooperation with Kamila Doud<0xC4><0x9B>rov<0xC3><0xA1> continued.
As part of the show How to Build a Dream, a quick but fundamental transformation of the living room took place, in which the architect Martin <0xC4><0x8C>en<0xC4><0x9B>k also participated.
In the space that was created by connecting two smaller rooms, we had to get three functions, dining, living and sleeping, without using the classical principles of optical division, such as semi-transverse or Japanese walls.
"This would, as a result, violate the openness and uniformity of the space," explains the architect.
It was originally possible to separate the bedroom and the living area.
It was enough to turn the backs of the two sofas and build a custom made quilt cabinet between them.
The dining area defines the shades of the floor and paintings.
On the floor in the kitchen and dining area, the architect used high-quality marble, the sliding door revived with a wallpaper with a pattern.
The kitchenette covers sliding panels with wallpaper if necessary.
The new anti-allergic marble floor has a number of advantages over the previous laminate: a softer non-slip surface without mating and better sound insulation.
The system of tilts and ceilings made of plasterboard highlighted in color is an example of how to work with the space in the panel.
I left the colors on the architects, I wished it would be fun.
"I like orange, I had the same shade in the previous apartment," says Ivana.
The grafoscal lining with the motif of blossoming magnolia is practical and creates a significant aesthetic element.
To a warm energetic tone, the architects chose white, which underlined the modern functional style.
In the small apartment it was possible to store books, among other things, in the space under the window sills.
Everything is within reach, the lamps are comfortably controlled remotely.
In the redesigned interior, the contrast between the new and the older works excellently, for example with a decades-old crystal mirror and with quality art objects that Ivana collects all her life.
The last one was the kitchen.
The closets had previously been placed on both sides and the owner felt a bit like in the tunnel.
The architect took their numbers and repositioned the layout.
Furniture in a simple design is made to order, the white surface softens slightly pearly surface.
They fit into a small space thanks to the ingenious solution washing machine, dryer and dishwasher.
The appearance of a small kitchen revived the full-glass cladding of the walls above the worktop.
The unique graphic glass with a digitally printed motif is attractive, in addition, it is perfectly maintained.
Ivana chose the flowers of magnolia, which remind her of a favorite neighborhood where she lived for years.
Now she seems to be happy here too.
In the original bathroom was a small bath and sink, for the new owner she chose a neutral shade of the lining.
The large shower room has a glass door Ronald.
The task was to create from the given environment a clear, simple space in which functions and equipment will be in harmony.
We combined the interior material and color and tried for its elegant, cozy, not too crowded look.
"Another condition of the assignment was a barrier-free solution with minimal obstacles and the possibility of easy movement around furniture and the accessibility of items of daily need," adds Kamila Doudërov<0xC3><0xA1>.
The Supreme Court has ruled that time can be prosecuted.
The Supreme Court has ruled that former Prime Minister Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as can also be prosecuted for possible crimes that could have been committed before the dissolution of the House of Representatives in August.
He was protected only by procedural immunity, which applies to speeches in the House.
In the case of former ODS MPs Ivan Fuksy, Mark <0xC5><0xA0>najdra and Petr Tlucho<0xC5><0x99>e, on the other hand, he decided that they could not be punished for any criminal offences until they surrendered their mandate last November, Supreme Court spokesman Petr Knötig said.
With this decision, the court rejected the proposal of Prosecutor Iva Istvan, who wanted to continue the criminal proceedings with the MPs.
According to him, they accepted a bribe in the form of lucrative posts in state firms for relinquishing their mandate and not going to be a problem in passing the laws.
On the contrary, it is possible to pursue a former prime minister who offered them these posts.
V<0xC3><0xAD>t B<0xC3><0xA1>rt<0xC3><0xA1> also arrested an anti-corruption police officer
B<0xC3><0xA1>rt<0xC3><0xB3>’s lawyer, Old<0xC5><0x99>ich P<0xC5><0xAB>doba, who also represented him in the case of alleged corruption of the VV members, also did not want to comment too much on the case, but said: “Yes, I represent the client in this case too, but because of the protection of the hidden facts.”
According to the law, the case is handled by the General Inspectorate of Security Corpses (GIBS).
The tn.cz server said that B<0xC3><0xA1>rta could buy secret information from the police.
According to the server privnizpravy.cz, the case may have been related to the case of former police president Petr Lessy, whose appointment to the post of B<0xC3><0xA1>rt allegedly sought.
The latest information, however, shows that V<0xC3><0xAD>ta B<0xC3><0xA1>rta's arrest has nothing to do with Petr Lessy.
Police spokeswoman Eva Krop<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ov<0xC3><0xA1> refused to comment on the case with the Prague city attorney’s office.
"We will not comment on this question with regard to the protection of classified facts," said a spokeswoman of the Prague City Prosecutor's Office, <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>p<0xC3><0xA1>nka Zenkl<0xC3><0xB3>.
It is B<0xC3><0xA1>rtov’s case that the plaintiff is there to watch, and thus it is indirectly apparent from her words that the file or criminal proceedings are conducted in secret.
Reporter Novinek managed to reach his wife V<0xC3><0xAD>ta B<0xC3><0xA1>rta Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Klasnov<0xC3><0xA1> in the morning before their residence in Kl<0xC3><0xA1>rov, Prague.
She just packed her suitcases in the car and left.
She refused to comment on the whole event.
On Friday morning, Tomio Okamura, the leader of the <0xC3><0x9A>svit movement, spoke about B<0xC3><0xA1>rt’s arrest.
According to him, he has no idea what the case is about.
"To take B<0xC3><0xA1>rt was one of the many candidates of many parties on our candidacy, and as I said repeatedly before the elections, he was not even a member of the Dawn of Direct Democracy Tomia Okamura," he added.
V<0xC3><0xAD>t B<0xC3><0xA1>rta, who in the past premature elections to the House of Commons in the Pilsen region unsuccessfully ran for the Tomia Okamura Direct Democracy Dawn movement, is known for his corrupt cause of paying MPs Public Affairs.
In April 2012, he was falsely sentenced to 18 months with a delay of 30 months.
Later, the verdict was changed and B<0xC3><0xA1>rta was acquitted.
I want a contract in the NHL.
I still have the juice, the desire and the enthusiasm
For Prospala, the family was always in the first place, so she wants to completely subordinate herself at the age of 38.
Either he gets a job overseas and he's still extending his career, or he's definitely going to quit hockey.
"I want to play the role of father and husband."
“I’m looking forward to it,” says the hockey player, who is still waiting in vain for the offer.
Despite the fact that he is a well-known worker who never hurts anything.
Despite the fact that every time he leaves his heart on the ice, he is able to crush his teammates.
And also despite the fact that he was the most productive player of Columbus last season.
"But the desire to show everyone in me is still there," he says resolutely.
Maybe he's coming, he's supposed to be the New York Rangers, who haven't made it into the season, and they also have two backers injured - attackers Rick Nash and Ryan Callahan.
What does your arrival to the Rangers look like?
It's just speculation.
As long as I don't have anything on paper, it's not worth it.
I know there was an article in the New York Post that they should sign me, but that's all.
Nowhere else was it added that it really happened.
Unfortunately, I'd like to announce myself that I have a contract, but it's just not.
Didn't they even call you from the club?
This kind of communication in the NHL takes place 24 hours a day.
That’s where we get into a situation where the contract really comes in.
When a player is injured or someone else is injured, the manga will not work.
There are a lot of different factors that need to come together in order to get the contract.
But in New York, there are similar circumstances, right?
Rick Nash is injured with Ryan Callahan and the team didn't get into the season, so there's a chance, don't you think?
Of course, that chance is always there.
But the second thing is that you always need two sides to do it.
I'd take a lot of offers today, but I haven't got one yet.
This is the reality that I have to live in.
You’re flying to America on Friday, and you’re expecting something to happen?
I have those expectations since July 5th, when the NHL opened the free-player market, and still nothing.
Are you going to New York City to be remembered?
It's definitely not, I'm going to Tampa for the kids and the wife.
I'm looking forward to the sun and seeing you again.
Do you have a plan for your program?
It's because I'm a father and a husband, and that's what it's all about.
I'm not a hockey player at the moment - I don't have a contract and I don't play games.
So I'm going to play the role of father and husband, and I'm looking forward to it.
Yours has two hockey matches already on Sunday, it is a holiday for me and my whole family, when we can go and support our children in what they want to do.
Do you think you could do this on a full-time basis?
Sure, one can think about a lot of things.
This can happen, too.
I tried it three years ago, when I missed 50 games because of knee surgery.
And I had a lot of fun.
Once it gets to such a stage that all the goals, wins and draws will not replace what you have at home.
Because family and children, that's the meaning of life.
Whatever job you have, whatever you want.
I had a job that was the most beautiful thing I could find, apart from my family.
You’ve had a lot of offers from Europe: do you want to play the NHL just because it’s the NHL, or is it because of the family that you want to be in America?
As a hockey player, the first place - apart from family - also includes sporting success.
The NHL is the best competition in the world.
And that's what family life is all about.
My kids, so sorry, our kids -- my kids and my wives -- grew up in the United States, started going to school there, and so on.
And we'd be so happy if they continued this trend.
Because what we're going to argue about, in America, the possibilities are quite somewhere else.
We should give them a chance like that.
Are you planning to stay in the U.S. permanently?
We're going to practice it like we've done so far.
This means that in the summer we will be in the Czech Republic on Hlubok<0xC3><0xA1> and around <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice.
And in winter again in Tampa or where our steps will lead us.
It’s perfect to be warm at all times.
I've had a lot of luck in my life.
It can be said that I went against him, it cost a lot of strength and renunciation, and it took me a lot of things that I missed.
But hockey in return offered me a lot of options and this is one of them.
My wife and I can choose where we want to live.
There are a lot of people in the world who are going through this so that they can choose what they are going to do and how they are going to live.
How long in yourself will you have the will to fight, train hard and wait for an offer at your age?
Yeah, so that's a question I can't answer.
I still have it in me today, the juice, the desire, the enthusiasm, the passion for the sport. The desire and motivation to prove to people that you still have at the NHL that I am always better than anyone else.
But I can't tell you how long it's gonna be there.
That can't be planned.
So you can say that this season you're gonna wait for it to roll out and then you decide what's next?
I'm in a phase where I go day by day.
Recently, the Director General of <0xC4><0x8C>EZ announced that the decision on the construction of the 3rd and 4th Temel<0xC3><0xAD>n power plant is postponed to the end of 2014 or 2015.
He justified this by waiting for a new State Energy Concept and approving the Contracts of Difference by the government.
For these reasons, the current <0xC4><0x8C>EZ leadership is trying to transfer its responsibility to the government - i.e. as a majority shareholder.
However, a qualified manager should give recommendations to shareholders and not hide behind them.
Babi<0xC5><0xA1>: I only rule with Sobotka.
Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1> begins to calm down that his YES movement will not have time to learn the political craft in the opposition and that he will have to go straight to the government in order to create any.
The President of the European Union has admitted this in an interview for Law, which will come out tomorrow.

Police evacuated part of Los Angeles airport after shooting
A gun was fired at the Los Angeles International Airport this morning.
The police evacuated part of the airport, which is said to have been Terminal 3.
Reuters, referring to California media, said the men of the law had shot an armed man with a rifle.
The Los Angeles Times, citing police, said there was a shooting in which two to three members of the Transportation Safety Administration were injured.
How many people have been injured and whether there are any victims is still not clear.
Firefighters are talking about an event with a greater number of injured.
CNN: Israel bombs a military base in Syria.
The target was to be Russian missiles for Hezbollah.
Israeli military planes reportedly bombed a military base near the Syrian port of Latakia on Thursday.
With reference to the unnamed agent of the U.S. government, CNN reported.
The Israeli press has widely reported the explosion in the alleged missile storage facility, but the Israeli government has not confirmed the attack.
A spokesperson for the Israeli army, CNN, declined to comment on the incident.
"We are not commenting on foreign media reports," she said.
According to a U.S. government source, rockets and related equipment were the target of the Israeli airstrikes, which the Israelis believe could be transported to the militant Lebanese movement Hezbollah.
The AP agency, referring to another U.S. security agent, reported that the target of an Israeli attack on Syrian territory was Russian SA-125 missiles.
A second Israeli television channel reported that the target of the attack was allegedly a highly modern Syrian air defense system.
Satellite images of the attack area, but according to the DPA, showed the battery of Russian S-125 Neva missiles.
In addition, they were said to have seen batteries of SA-3 missiles including a command center with radar to track the missiles and their targets.
The missiles, recorded on Israeli television, have a range of 35 kilometers and could carry 70 kilograms of heads.
Israel has reportedly bombed missile deliveries inside Syria at least twice this year, CNN and AP said.
The Israeli military has never responded to such reports, but has repeatedly declared that it will target any supply of weapons intended for Hezbollah or other groups designated as terrorists.
Does the internet mean the end of travel agencies?
The Flight Centre seems to be successfully resisting this trend.
The company has updated its annual earnings estimate and expects record earnings from recreational workers in Australia and the UK.
The travel agency now expects its annual base earnings before tax to range between $325 and $340 million compared to $305 to $315 million from the previous forecast.
If the current trend is maintained, it will represent a twelve to seventeen percent increase from the record-breaking profit of $290.4 million from 2011/12.
Flight Centre CEO Graham Turner said Flight Centre generated an eight percent profit in the first half of the year and began a sharp growth in the second half, especially in Australian and British off-the-job travel.
"To date, our 10 countries are profitable and several are heading towards record annual earnings before interest and taxes," he said.
This includes Australia and the United Kingdom, which are traditionally our biggest earners.
Recreation business has grown in Australia during the second half of the year, offset by a slightly weaker domestic travel market.
Similarly, in the UK, Flight Centre performed well in the recreation area, while business clients spent less on it.
The U.S. trade has recovered after a loss during the seasonally weaker half-year and is expected to bring in year-round profits for the third time in a row.
Flight Centre’s shares were 3 cents higher yesterday at $38.20.
Greenpeace activists detained in Russia transported to St. Petersburg
Environmental activists detained since September in Russia for protesting planned oil mining in the Arctic were transported from Murmansk to St. Petersburg.
This was reported by the AFP agency today with a reference to the international environmental organization Greenpeace.
At the same time, it claims that the original accusations of its piracy activists have not yet been dropped.
"Greenpeace International has learned from diplomatic sources that 30 men and women detained in Russia after a non-violent action against the Arctic oil platform have been transported from a correctional facility in Murmansk to a prison in St. Petersburg," the organization said in a statement.
The reasons for the relocation of detained activists are unclear; according to the DPA, it was a planned relocation.
Ecology officials initially accused them of piracy, which threatened them with up to 15 years in prison in the event of a conviction.
Last week, however, they announced that the charge would be replaced by a milder outcry, for which a lower sentence with an upper limit of seven years of deprivation of liberty is threatened.
Greenpeace, however, said in a statement that the allegations of piracy by the authorities have not yet come as promised.
This means that the detainees are now charged with two criminal offences.
Last week, the powerful Investigative Committee announced that the piracy charges would replace the piracy charges.
However, when 30 inmates stood before the committee this week, the charge of piracy was not withdrawn.
Instead, a new charge has been made against everyone,” Greenpeace quoted AFP as saying.
The Russians detained three dozen Greenpeace members from 18 countries at the Gazprom oil platform in mid-September.
Ecologists were aboard the Arctic Sunrise, which was flying the Dutch flag.
Since then, they have all been held in custody, against whom they have appealed, but the court has rejected them all.
Ecologists are complaining about prison conditions.
Greenpeace CEO Kumi Naidoo said on Wednesday that the move to St. Petersburg would facilitate meetings with detainees and consular staff.
However, there is no guarantee that the conditions in the new prison will be better than in Murmansk.
"In fact, they can be worse," he said.
Dutch King Willem-Alexandre, one of the detained activists Faiza Oulahsen, asked for help.
In a handwritten letter published today by the Algemeen Dagblad, she urged the monarch to talk about their situation at a planned meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
He claims Maliki has a large share in the resumption of sectarian violence in Iraq, which is said to be part of the fighting in neighboring Syria.
Schools should focus more on mathematics, spelling and grammar
In the course of English literature, you will have to study at least one Shakespearean play, a 19th-century novel, romantic poetry, and contemporary British beauty from 1914 onwards.
The exam will also include “hidden text” to motivate you to read deeper;
Combined courses of English literature and language will be cancelled.
Starting in 2015, students will be required to have a master’s degree in the language, and will be encouraged to choose English literature as an elective subject.
The Ministry of Education is expected to release new drafts for English and Mathematics tomorrow – the first subjects to undergo a radical change.
For other key topics, changes are expected next year.
In a separate step, Ofqual, which oversees the graduation exams, reveals changes in the structure of the graduation exam, together with a new marking system and a smaller volume of projects for students.
In his summer speech, Education Minister Michael Gove said that there is "a broad consensus as to whether we need to reform our testing system in order to regain the trust of society", and that we need to insist that the graduation exam be "more demanding, more ambitious and more ambitious".
The study shows that English schools devote less time to mathematics – 116 hours a year or three hours a week – than most other countries.
For comparison, schools in Australia spend an average of 143 hours a year in mathematics and about 138 in Singapore.
Although there will be no official requirement to devote more time to mathematics, coalition sources have said that a comprehensive graduate exam in mathematics – coupled with a greater emphasis on this subject in the result rankings – will likely encourage schools to make a profit.
The curriculum will focus more on “real-world problems,” including financial mathematics.
Ostrava Mayor Kajnar: Cancer in the Czech Republic is not me
Before the elections, a long-standing dispute between the two wingmen fighting for influence within the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD of Ostrava broke out.
It all culminated when the mayor of Ostrava, Petr Kajnar, turned to the court for undemocratic composition of the candidates.
However, the actors of the causa did not want to express themselves too much, so as not to harm the party even more before the elections.
The votes of the voters are now counted.
The leadership of the Ostrava <0xC4><0x8C>SSD called on the mayor of Ostrava to step down from the party on Monday evening, and it is likely that he will also press for his loss of office.
Petr Kainar, however, wants to keep fighting.
What the controversy is about and who is on whose side, he described in an exclusive interview for The Journal.
How do you see the outcome of the election?
The <0xC4><0x8C>SSD certainly expected a much better result.
Did it hurt us that before the election, there was a media dispute within the party?
I can imagine that a social democracy could have a better election result.
But on the other hand, it corresponds to the state in which the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD is now.
It’s a party that has its own internal problems, it’s internally sick, and people feel that it’s not all right in it.
They made it clear in the election.
What are the internal diseases of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD?
In my opinion, the ODS has been going through a fall for some time and unfortunately, such things are now taking place in a social democracy.
It is so that lobbyists, influential people who had previously expected to find their biases at the ODS, have moved to the people in the Czech Republic and have an influence on them.
This has to do with the fact that the police are walking through the offices of the Ostrava Magistrate and collecting computers.
This shows that the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD is not just composed of people who want the good of everyone else, but many of them think primarily of their own good.
The <0xC4><0x8C>SSD is divided into two relentless camps also in Prague, as can be seen in the current power struggle between Ha<0xC5><0xA1>kovci and Sobotkovci.
But it has been preparing for a long time.
What happened before the elections in Ostrava was just an announcement of what is happening now in Prague.
Hasko's wing gradually occupied its position, so that after the elections it could trigger a situation that weakens Sobotko's wing.
A person is in a situation in politics where sometimes he has to compromise.
But everyone has an internal frontier, when those compromises will no longer be made, and that is my case.
Initially I did not want to run for the House, but when I saw the whole thing inside the party, I agreed with Lubos Zaor<0xC3><0xA1>lk that I would try to get to the regional candidate to strengthen Sobotko's wing as the mayor of Ostrava.
But the wing of the hatch made it stop.
Why do you stand on the side of Bohuslav Sobotka and not Michal Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ka?
Sobotka is, in my opinion, a person who always talks mainly about the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD program and to a certain extent also about visions for the party and for this country.
I must admit, I have never heard anything like that.
Michal Hasek is only fighting for power.
I do not understand how the Presidency, which is a lower body than the Central Executive Committee, can only begin to dismiss the chairman of the party.
This is a struggle for power regardless of everything and against the tents of the parties.
In my opinion, with what Michal Hasek now performed in Prague, he ended his political career.
How did you feel that the Ostrava leadership of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD did not approve of you as a candidate?
The political parties are based on the competition, which of their members will be placed.
This competition should largely be based on programme visions and the ability of those people to fulfil those visions.
Of course, there are also people who do not have the ability or the vision, but the political party is for them an elevator to money that they would not get elsewhere.
The problem is, when these people start to get ahead by violating the rules, violating the statutes of the party, without scrupulously.
They make the political parties into the mafia by their practices, and in my opinion they violate the laws of the Czech Republic.
To draw attention to this problem is more important to me than to consider whether any Kajnar has a political future.
It is important that the parties begin to respect the statutes.
That is why, before the elections, you submitted a proposal to the court for a preliminary measure against the form of a candidate of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD in the Moravian-Silesian region?
The current district executive committee of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD in Ostrava consolidates its power by being able to abolish organizations that do not comply with it, purposely establishing new organizations, gradually expelling uncomfortable members of the party.
An example is that they wanted to exclude Richard Bedna<0xC5><0x99>ek from the club of representatives, but he filed a lawsuit against it and they then preferred to cancel the resolution on his exclusion.
This shows that seeking compliance with the statutes of the party through the courts is the last option, but at the moment when the other means and control authorities within the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD have ceased to function, it is the only option.
The aim of the leadership of the Ostrava <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, headed by MEP Adam Rykala, is to remove you from the position of mayor.
It is a public secret that the mayor of Poruby Lum<0xC3><0xAD>r Palyza has a note for this post.
That's right, Adam Rykala and Lum<0xC3><0xAD>r Palyza are trying to do everything in their power to get me fired.
They promise people positions, they get votes, and for those votes they consolidate their power in the side.
When I go back to the past, all that happened around the Ban<0xC3><0xAD>k Ostrava football club and the purchase of the Bazala stadium was just an excuse for them to attack me.
It was artificially staged so they could label me a person who gives money where it doesn't belong.
The city bought a property that was of strategic value to him.
So how do you see it going on with your continued role as mayor?
The district committee already called on me and other people on Monday to consider our continuation in the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD.
But I think it's like when a thief yells, "Catch a thief!"
When we look at the results of my work over the last eleven years, I see no one in Ostrava’s social democracy who would initiate and push, sometimes even against the members of the party, the emergence of so many developmental things, such as industrial zones or the expansion of scientific and technological parochialism.
Still, I'm getting uncomfortable.
I don’t read it any other way than to prevent others from entering the places they desire.
Will you continue to fight these efforts in any way?
Because if this republic is to work well, then political parties must also work well.
I can hardly believe that any party will be able to control the state effectively when they can’t even control themselves.
So I don’t think I’m going to leave the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD now, because I think it’s not me who causes this side’s cancer, it’s these people who are trying to make me angry.
Olomouc to open a public slide in the historic center
Pavel Sp<0xC3><0xA1>len<0xC3><0xBD>, the organizer of the Olomouc Christmas markets and winter skating, said that the preparatory work on the ice rink was started on October 26 and since Wednesday the ice-making aggregates are in operation.
The ice sheet is already strong seven centimeters and by Friday morning the area will be ready for the first visitors.
The slide has an area of 375 square meters, the podium took up 358 square meters.
Scouts and passers-by will also have two booths with a punch.
“We expanded the floor area, enlarged the space in front of the booths, and almost the entire floor area is covered so that the skaters can comfortably resurface,” Burnen said.
The streets of Olomouc are already reminiscent of Christmas approaching.
Last year, due to the repair of Lower Square, the slide was installed directly in front of the main entrance of the town hall on Upper Square.
The repair of the Lower Square was completed in the course of the summer, so that the ice surface could return to its original location.
For the first time, people were able to skate right in front of the town hall in 2009, when the slides were in operation from January to March.
The ice area then became an integral part of the Christmas markets in the city.
The Christmas markets, which are part of a rich cultural program, will be opened on Upper Square a month before Christmas Day.

The brutal murder of a senior in Zl<0xC3><0xAD>nsk will be retrialed by a regional court
The Regional Court dismissed the charges of the twenty-five-year-old Slovak and twenty-year-old Czech for lack of evidence.
The men refused the blame.
They face 15 to 20 years in prison or even an exceptional punishment.
Spokesman Petr Angyalossy confirmed that the Supreme Court had annulled the district court’s decision and returned the matter to him again.
The reasons that led to this, the judge refused to comment on the fact that the decision had not yet been handed over to the parties.
According to the charges, the young men attacked a seventy-year-old man in his house.
The senior died of a horrific death.
According to the charge, the men cut, beat and dig all over his body, and also with a metal object, apparently a gas gun, put about three dozen wounds on his head.
The man suffered serious injuries, such as fractures of the skull bone, swelling of the brain, or bleeding into the brain to which he was lying.
The young men reportedly took about 3,000 crowns and jewelry worth about 14,000 crowns from the house.
According to the district court, they were the only, moreover, indirect evidence against the defendant’s odor traces, which the expert assessed as not fully established within the meaning of the legal guidelines.
The odor marks from the scene and on other matters were consistent with the defendants in more than ten cases, but the police initially treated them as odor marks and not as odor marks.
In addition, there were some mistakes in dealing with them.
According to the Senate, the guilt of the defendants was unquestionably proven.
However, the court acknowledged that the police had very difficult conditions.
A dead senior with a broken head was found by relatives who thought he had apparently fallen down and wounded himself.
Neither did a doctor call the emergency services to notice the violent deaths.
The criminals contacted Olomouc doctors after a few days, who discovered signs of violent death during the drinking.
The police could no longer work with all the traces of the crime scene that the relatives had cleared.
No DNA of the defendants was found at the scene.
The young Slovak lived in Uherskohradi<0xC5><0xA1>tsk.
He is now serving an 8.5-year sentence, which was confirmed by the Olomouc Supreme Court last year.
According to him, the man was the head of an organized group of six youths, who have a conscience of a robbery of gold.
The robbery took place in October and November 2011, shortly after the murder of a senior in Slopné.
The youngest of the accused for the murder of the senior lives in Uherské Hradi<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC4><0x9B>.
He was released from prison in August after 11 months.
Znojmo begins with the reconstruction of the stadium
At the beginning of November, the reconstruction of the football stadium will begin in Znojma.
On Thursday, the stadium was taken over by the builders, who will carry out the reconstruction of the lawn.
The reconstruction of the city stadium in Znojmo is divided into four stages to meet the standards for the first football league.
Living legend Wayne Shorter closes next week Strings Autumn
Saxophone giant and jazz legend Wayne Shorter will score a spot next Wednesday for the 18th anniversary of the Struna Autumn Festival.
Shorter will perform on November 6 in the Great Hall of Lucerne together with his quartet composed by Danilo Perez, John Patitucci and Brian Blade.
In the second half of the evening, a spontaneous jazz improvisation PKF - Prague Philharmonia under the direction of Martin Kum<0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xA1>k will be added to Shorter.
In Shorter's arrangements for the symphonic orchestra, Pegasus from the novelty album Without A Net, as well as his older compositions Lotus and Prometheus Unbound, will play.
Although he celebrated his 80th birthday in August this year, Shorter is still full of strength, which also proves that the Prague concert in Strun<0xC3><0xA1> is starting his world tour in the autumn.
Wayne Shorter entered the world of music more than sixty years ago.
The list of performers he collaborated with ranges from Miles Davis to Herbie Hancock, Joni Mitchell to Carlos Santana.
On his musical journey, he also met the Czech musician Miroslav Vito<0xC5><0xA1> and the Vienna native Joe Zawinul, with whom in the legendary Weather Report for more than a decade they set out the direction of the new style of fusion.
For the past 13 years, he has performed mainly with the Wayne Shorter Quartet.
After the festival, there will be a spotlight night at the Roxy/NoD club on November 9.
In addition to the charismatic singer Andrey Triany, the Manchester trio Go Go Penguin with its jazz-influenced electronics and young jazz talent Ian Mikyska will introduce the electro-jazz formation Profound Bass inspired by dance styles.
Damkov<0xC3><0xA1> says UEFA has banned the publication of penalties for referees.
Dagmar Damkov<0xC3><0xA1>, chairman of the board of referees of the Football Association of the Czech Republic, has stopped publishing penalties for judges.
She is banned by UEFA rules, which she said in an interview for the Law Journal.
Otherwise, it would threaten the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R.
Damkov<0xC3><0xA1> also denied that in her role she would side with footballers Pilsen, where she came from.
These speculations are really pointless.
It is true that I live in Pilsen, but other members of the commission are from elsewhere, for example from Prague.
So in the event of a vote, I can lose 1:6,” Damkov<0xC3><0xA1> said in response to the criticism that was outraged after Pilsen had played twice as many penalties as the other league teams.
Therefore, although in recent months the Czech Republic has stopped publishing penalties for the arbitrators, Damkov<0xC3><0xA1> assures them that they are judging for their mistakes.
"Believe me, if the commission finds out that the referee made a mistake, it will limit his delegation, no matter what match it was," Damkova said.
The reason why the penalties are not published is the ban on women’s football from the European Union.
"UEFA prohibits the disclosure of such information and the violation is severely punishable."
“We have a lot of suspicions and we are looking for something for every mistake.”
"We published the restriction, but I received two very strong warnings that if we don't stop it, there will be tough sanctions," Damkova said.
Other countries respect the ban.
"We were really the exception," she added.
If the information continues to be published, the commission said it could lose money from UEFA for the education and development of referees.
"And they're very important to us."
"Without them, we would not be able to fulfill the program for the education of the arbitrators," Damkov<0xC3><0xA1> added.
B<0xC3><0xA1>rta’s arrest is related to Janou<0xC5><0xA1>ka and Béma: Is it worth the escape of the listeners?
The President of Public Affairs V<0xC3><0xAD>ta B<0xC3><0xA1>rt was arrested by police on Thursday.
Jan Petr<0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD>lek, the head of the anti-corruption police analyst and informatics department, was also arrested.
The arrests are related to the affidavits of the lobbyist Roman Janousk and the former mayor Pavel Bém (ODS).
The information about the follow-up received by the server Novinky.cz has been confirmed by a reliable source.
Janou<0xC5><0xA1>ka and Bém's phone calls, published last March by the newspaper Mlad<0xC3><0xA1> fronta Dnes and in which both men address each other "Maz<0xC3><0xA1>nka" and "Kolibr<0xC3><0xAD>k", show Janou<0xC5><0xA1>k's influence on the steps of the city under Bém's leadership.
The newspaper reported that they were acquired in 2007 by the Security Information Service (BIS), from which they escaped to the security agency ABL two years later.
At the time, he owned Bart.
The server Novinky.cz warned that the detained criminal Petr<0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD>lek was working for the BIS before he joined the anti-corruption police.
Petr<0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD>lek moved to the anti-corruption unit, which was subsequently engaged in the hearings, at the same time they were published.
“With regard to the law on the protection of classified information, I cannot confirm anything or say anything at all,” said prosecutor Michal Muravsk<0xC3><0xBD> of the Municipal Prosecutor’s Office in Prague.
He refused to confirm that he was monitoring the case.
The case does not want to comment on the inspection for the same reason.
Six out of ten companies are preparing for the new Civil Code
Six out of ten companies are intensively preparing for the imminent effectiveness of the new Civil Code and the Commercial Corporations Act as of January 1, 2014.
Only eight percent of the company’s representatives surveyed said they hadn’t dealt with the issues related to both key codes in their company at all.
This is the result of a survey by the law firm Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal, which examined the opinions of 108 Czech companies.
In the context of the imminent validity of the two key codes, it is only now that, at the last moment, a number of managers are beginning to realize what a significant impact they can have on the business of their companies.
The biggest changes in private law in the last 50 years will, in our opinion, affect all citizens and companies in the Czech Republic.
Because of the lavishness of politicians, the business sector has long lived in uncertainty as to whether or not revolutionary changes will eventually take place.
“But now they have only a few weeks left to make the transition to the new law work for their companies without complications,” commented the results of partner Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal Jan Sp<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>il.
Of the 61 percent of companies that are intensively concerned with the new legislation, 26 percent said their companies had already taken all the necessary measures to be prepared in time.
In addition, 35 percent of companies out of this number are planning to take the necessary measures in the near future.
In contrast, one in five companies has not yet dealt with recodifications, yet they have a concrete idea of how to prepare for them.
In total, 11 percent have no opinion and cannot judge the issue.
Only eight percent of companies admit that issues related to recodification have not yet been resolved.
The most important legal issue related to the new Civil Code is for the largest number of companies asked to conclude new contracts (21 percent), followed by the solution of business conditions (16 percent) and further changes in the property cadastre and liability for damage (ten percent).
In the case of contracts, one of the most important innovations of the entire recodification takes place, namely the unification of the provisions of contracts only within the framework of the new civil code.
The current parallel regulation in the Civil and Commercial Code will disappear, as a result of which the contract law should become more transparent for citizens and businesses.
"In the case of entrepreneurs, the new regulation will offer a lot of news with an emphasis on greater freedom to organize relationships," said lawyer Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Poddan<0xC3><0xBD>.
In the context of the Commercial Corporations Act, almost a quarter of companies consider the issue of increasing the responsibility of statutory bodies to be the most important issue.
The following are topics related to changes in the convening and running of the general meeting (15 per cent) and the representation of the company (14 per cent).
The new legal regulation means tightening the obligations and potential impacts for the statutory authorities, especially in situations where the company is at risk of a downturn or falls into it.
"In practice, this means that if board members and corporate executives do not take care of the proper economy and do not return the imminent downturn of the company, they may lose the benefit of performing the function until the last two years," he added.
Pierre Rainero: I try to develop Cartier’s style as a living language
My task is to preserve the tradition and at the same time lead our brand to modern things, so that it does not remain a dusty relic, explains Pierre Rainero, director of style at Cartier in an interview for HN.
This French luxury house was founded in 1847.
Travels through the mud, river and jungle and provides free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free medical care in the villages of Cameroon.
Bwelle and his team treat hundreds of patients almost every weekend
There are not too many doctors in the countries of West Africa; only one in every 5,000 inhabitants.
Vote here, or via your mobile phone.
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 candidates for the 2013 CNN Heroes Award.
In the 2013 CNN Heroes of the Year contest, you can vote for him or for any of the top ten candidates.
The winner will receive $250,000 in order to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched his father fall unconscious over and over again and drive to hospitals that were not equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident near the Cameroonian capital Yaounde in 1981.
At first he was treated only with a broken hand, but then he developed an infection that spread to the brain, and there created a hematoma that caused problems for his whole life.
“There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon,” says Georges Bwelle.
We'd have to take him out of Cameroon if we had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years transporting his father to overcrowded clinics and hospitals, where he received treatment that was simply available.
“It’s not easy,” Bwelle says.
You can leave the house at five in the morning, rush to the hospital to be there first, but you're not the first.
There's a lot of patients out there.
Some people die just because they have to wait.
Since Bwelle's father died in 2002, the situation hasn't changed much.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one doctor per 5,000 inhabitants in Cameroon.
Just for comparison, the ratio in the United States is one doctor per 413 inhabitants.
And even if the Cameroonian doctors could visit, many would not be able to afford it.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and nearly three-quarters of healthcare spending in the country is private.
“The only problem they have is poverty,” says Bwelle.
Because of poverty, they can't enjoy life.
When Bwelle saw his father and many of his compatriots suffer, he decided to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers performed 700 free surgeries last year.
He himself became a vascular surgeon at Yaoundé Central Hospital.
And he founded the non-profit organization ASCOVIME, whose members visit rural areas over the weekend, where they provide free medical care.
Since 2008, his group of volunteers has helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 people rush for supplies, attach themselves to the roofs of medical supplies, and travel rough terrain to villages in need of help.
They are not always accompanied by happiness.
Sometimes the vehicles have to push through the river and mud.
But when they arrive, they are greeted as true heroes: a feast, singing and dancing and the best accommodation the community has to offer.
In these villages, free medical care is really a reason to celebrate and Bwelle – with its wide smile and unwavering energy – is very willing to engage with the local joy.
The next day, the team started treating hundreds of patients.
“We have 500 patients on each expedition,” says Bwelle.
They come to the village from a radius of 60 kilometers, on foot.
During each of these weekends, doctors provide a variety of medical care.
Many are treated with malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasitic diseases and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others can get a berle or gifted glasses or birth certificate for free – a document that the school demands but that many poor families simply can’t afford.
In the evening, the team performs a simple operation under local anesthesia.
Surgery is usually done in the school building, in the town hall or at home; after surgery, the patient gets up and goes to the recovery site to free up space for the next patient.
Using the light from the generator, operating room and hygiene equipment, Bwelle and his volunteers work until early in the morning.
It’s exhausting, but village musicians usually help the team not to lose their motivation.
“In order to stay up and keep working, they’re playing drums all night,” says Bwelle.
On Sunday, the team will head back to the city, tired but proud of their work.
This group – consisting of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students – carried out 700 free surgeries last year and realizes that their help can mean a lot to the local population.
One man said he'd be able to work again after surgery.
"It will change the future for our family," the man said.
In addition to organizing these weekend clinics and working as a surgeon at Bwelle Hospital, he also works at night for private health clinics around Yaounde.
He says that it is this second thesis that finances about 60% of his non-profit activities; the rest are covered by private contributions.
“I’m not sure when she’s actually sleeping,” says Katie O’Malley, a second-year medical student at Drexel University in Philadelphia who works as a volunteer for Bwelle’s group.
He is always either in the hospital or trying to make money for the organization to be able to do these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students like O’Malley who came from the United States or Europe to join Bwelle on his mission, it’s a great practice they wouldn’t get at home.
“We thoroughly washed Dr. Bwell’s hands and removed blood stains or held his tools,” says O’Malley.
You will never experience this as a medical student in your second year in America.
Students volunteers usually pay for their trip to Cameroon themselves and often arrive with donated medical needs.
But as soon as they arrive in Yaoundé, Bwelle provides them with food, transportation, and study.
“He’s a hero,” O’Malley said.
This organization gives its life and its desire to help the people of Cameroon is endless.
For Bwelle, constant constipation is not a burden.
Helping others live a happier life, fulfilling the promise he made to his father, is something that brings him great joy.
“I’m so happy doing this job,” Bwelle says.
And I'm thinking of my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
Laughing at people, alleviating their pain – that’s why I do it.

Minister Holc<0xC3><0xA1>t re-established the role of Principal Nurse for the Czech Republic
The main nurse for the Czech Republic should represent the interests of nurses whose number in the Czech Republic exceeds 100,000.
“I think it is essential that these functions are clearly defined and formalized so that the nurses of their representative within the structure of the office have a representative to whom they can always turn when needed,” explained Martin Holc<0xC3><0xA1>t, Minister of Health.
I appreciate the work of the nurses and I think that the field of nursing deserves due attention from the Ministry as well.
In the performance of this profession, you need not only high professionalism, but also a human approach and personal conviction.
"It is with great pleasure and with all responsibility that I will try to push for those steps that can improve the position of nurses."
"We have excellent and skilled nurses in our healthcare, but I would also like to appeal to those colleagues who do not help us with their approach to patients to fulfill their vocations with all empathy and help us to improve the image of the nurses in the eyes of the public," Ale<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> said.
The newly appointed Principal Nurse for the Czech Republic, Alena <0xC5><0xA0>m<0xC3><0xAD>dov<0xC3><0xA1>, also stated on the occasion of her introduction to the position that she wants to deal with various aspects of the working position of nurses and intends to cooperate with, among other things, professional associations, professional societies, non-educators.
“I basically don’t want to separate the professions of doctors and nurses, but on the contrary, I see them standing next to each other, each having their own skills and together with other healthcare professionals they form a playful working team that provides health services for the benefit of the patient.”
"I myself have a number of problems that occur in the performance of the profession of nurses, I perceive these difficulties and I intend to participate in their solution."
These include, for example, the simplification of nursing and medical documentation.
"From my own experience, I know that some administrative actions of the nurses overload and take them the time that they could and should rather devote to patients," says Alena <0xC5><0xA0>m<0xC3><0xAD>dov<0xC3><0xA1>.
Other areas to which it intends to focus include improving working conditions, finding ways to improve cooperation in the team and with the managements of health service providers, adapting competencies, as well as working-law issues such as non-compliance with the labour code.
We often hear anonymous snippets, but for fear of possible disability, they are not documented on a specific case where there may be a violation of the rules.
"Where there is no prosecutor, there is also no judge, and thus the function of the Principal Nurse of the Czech Republic could serve in this case as a guarantee of the anonymity of such complaint and allow the specific case to be examined by the competent authorities," concludes Alena <0xC5><0xA0>m<0xC3><0xAD>dov<0xC3><0xA1>.
Mgr. Alena <0xC5><0xA0>m<0xC3><0xAD>dov<0xC3><0xA1> graduated from the Higher Medical School in the field of Nursing (she graduated in 1978) and the Faculty of Philosophy of the University of Charles in Prague in the study program Nursing - Pedagogics (she graduated in 1992).
Since 2010 he has been the head of the Department of Nursing and other non-medical disciplines and recognition of qualifications in the Department of Education and Science of the Ministry of Education and Science of the Czech Republic.
During her professional career, she worked as a nurse at the bedside of the internal department, she also worked as a teacher at the High School of Health, where she was also a statutory deputy director for 8 years.
From 2004 to 2009 she served as the main nurse of the Prison Service of the Czech Republic.
She has published several professional textbooks of nursing and articles in professional journals, devoted to lecture activities in the field of nursing.
He is not a member of any political party.
So that I don't shy away from hate
The writer V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Kahuda returned to writing after twelve years.
After many years of reading, living, but not writing, V<0xC3><0x81>CLAV KAHUDA (1965) publishes a new novel Wind, Darkness, Presence.
That it will not be a narrow volume, he predicts the number of pages comparable to his most famous work in Hou<0xC5><0xA1>tina (Petrov, 2001).
Another prominent Czech writer of the present day - Emil Hakl, testified for the Salon Kahudu.
What moved you to write a novel after 12 years of silence?
I did it so that I didn't get caught up in hatred.
To see around himself constantly new and new clones of the human insanity of smallness, young organisms affected by blind selfish effort.
I’m not even talking about the elderly, the faces ruined by powerlessness, the clumsy soul and vice versa, the ideologues who are trying to sell their “product” with the expression of a small sales bitch.
At the beginning of the millennium, I bought a small digital camera and filmed my legal friends, bizarre and hidden devices.
I've been through it.
Sometimes I feel like my brain is burning out of life on this planet.
I prefer to go for a walk and then read books at the lamp shop in the evening.
You're talking about a feeling of boredom, hate.
Was there any breakthrough in the past that affected you, or are you just getting old, like all of us?
The breakup happened a long time ago, about ten years ago.
It didn't have a name then.
Well, and then I lived.
But there's still a quiet boy in there somewhere.
I see other lonely squirrels, each in their own tornado of anxiety.
It saved me from writing books.
I am taking part in this huge, thousands of years-long movement of the system of life on this planet—the birth of an incomprehensible future.
The immense, breathtaking complexity of life, when every stone is the direct heir to our presence.
We are players of sad and beautiful games, where the trial-and-error path creates the next and next generation of beings, which in trillions of interactions per second creates some superhuman, artificial intelligence.
Twelve years is a relatively long time.
Do you see your writing as a continuous process, or have you started completely from scratch?
The self-talk, or rather the dialogue that leads the right and left half of the brain, sometimes rises to the level and forms in the book.
Just as peace periods are interspersed with the silent metastases of wars that may one day awaken – so the book has twelve years of silence clothed in words.
I felt the avalanche of life grow in my brain, and if I don't do anything, one day it's quieter.
It is a set of questions that the brain has formulated and places them in layers that are stored in the darkness "under the level of consciousness".
Neocortex, a gray crust, is a question of older evolutionary structures, goes to the ancient flight cycles of the brain tree.
He speaks to the furry beasts, asks the serpents, seeks the answer in the flight of birds, raises his eyes to the clouds in the sky.
Yes, the moral law in me and the starry sky above me.
Finally, the brain asks the world.
Relatively often you express yourself to the ego metaphorically - could you define it biologically?
The brain stores in its billions of connections and electrochemical bonds all the memories, experiences, and experiences that the person in question has experienced.
This forest, logically and emotionally exposed and branching with trees of information, memory registers, uses the brain in its recognition, cognitive, process, you are exposed to constantly changing presence, in an unceasing effort to name and understand your surroundings.
Sometimes there will be overloading disorders.
Analogously - as if you were "falling" your PC, from the program of the speech emulator and translator from foreign languages you would get entangled first in the operating environment, for example Windows, and after several unsuccessful restarts, it ended up at the processher at the pulse of the dark green-approaching pulseboard, the system of the screen in the Bios,
For those who have not yet understood what we are talking about, I am talking about a psychospiritual crisis.
You talk about it often - why do you care about this type of regression on a regular basis?
Because it's a pit.
In the decoration of the functional mechanisms of our thinking, feeling and behavior - there will be a breakthrough.
Here it is good to quote Nietzsche: "He looked into the abyss so long that the abyss looked into it."
The feeling of being lost is that if all hope is lost, mentally "dead" and a new quality emerges.
And why do I care about it personally?
I'll answer the parable.
Once a man fell into a dungeon and got warmed up, days, months and years went by, he got warmed up and read, and the books taught him how to swim - so to live.
He became a “diver.”
Hopefully someone will help some sentence written by me, as Hrabal's texts used to help me.
To what extent do you think of the reader, the specific person who will read your text?
The one about which nothing meaningful can be said, some call it consciousness, another super-ego, but in my opinion it was best characterized by Arthur Rimbaud in a letter to a friend:
"I'm someone else - this reader is directly involved in the process of wording and sentences."
From an early age he read the books of old Czech fairy tales, he sailed in the submarine of Captain Nema, he ran through the Shadows in the dark streets.
In the end, behind all this branching of the authors and their message, it is said: "The Sun brightens the worlds of other Karl Hynk Macha".
What if the book is out?
Do you care about the reader’s opinion?
On the backdrop that gets to you through the people who read the book?
Of course, I care about the opinion of people who will take three hundred crowns and are willing to read five hundred pages of the text.
And then, perhaps after years, I am contacted by chance on the street and they thank me for helping them with my book in some of their difficult life decisions.
Books are actually "life" or, better, "worlds."
They are encoded into characters of letters, carry experience, history of regions of which language.
We can awaken them to life at any time by letting their sentences flow into the brain.
It’s actually, in a way, something forbidden divine – to awaken more and more life stories, small universes and temporary planets.
It is a fact whose DNA is stored in magic - according to the old demonological books, we will commit witchcraft.
After the publication of the book, you - as it is - are waiting for a chain of author readings.
I remember you used to like to read.
Are you going to get into it again with joy, or do you feel it differently after years?
I'd rather just tell you today.
And what did I find out about that?
There are good intelligent people everywhere.
Their basic sign - they are inconspicuous, they do not notice themselves too much, they have friendly radiance, you do not feel lonely with them.
I will give an example - in the town of <0xC4><0x8C>erven<0xC3><0xBD> Kostelec lived (and I hope he is still alive) one furry book buyer (it is incidentally called <0xC4><0x8C>ervenka), a cheerful buddy and a good girl bull.
At one drunken party he introduced me to the individual articles of the chain of readers of my book Hou<0xC5><0xA1>tina.
I looked them in the eye and then I was shown a broken, read copy of my book.
In despair, I put aside the just counted barley and briefly cried in a manly voice.
We all stood there silently, whistling, and drunkenly with a sense of tears.
Then the young blonde man couldn’t stand it, and with a squirrel he jumped over his head from the window into the snow curtain.
It was on the ground floor.
We ran into the night landscape and swarmed with the happy rage of the sentients, the painful soul of the countrymen and the narrowness of the fallen natives - they swarmed and roared like werewolves until the morning.
Each of your books is formally and in content different from the previous ones.
The same applies to the text Wind, Darkness, Presence?
It's a story.
It is a fairy tale about one country behind nine rivers and nine mountains.
Ivan Bunin in his novel Suchodol puts into the mouth of the folk healer the words of one old Russian fairy tale: On the sea, on the ocean, on the island of Bujan.
There's a cat with a gray chest on it.
Horror, horror, mystery.
It never happened, but we all know it from somewhere.
Maybe we used to be the devils in hell once, and we lied about what role we're going to play on this earth.
Are you going to keep writing, or are you going to leave it on the free flow of inspiration again?
The answers are eternal - Otokar B<0xC5><0x99>ezina.
Writing is a wonderful way of dialogue.
Something huge and unnamed, similar to the movement of the continents on the planet, affects our desires from such depth and in such a width that it completely exceeds our horizons - and so we do with absolute self-evidence exactly in the intentions of our programmed task.
We are rewarded by the influx of dopamine, a mixture of endorphins and other substances.
We're biological machines.
We want to mate, we die defending and gaining new personal territories.
Sometimes there is a disorder and we express compassion.
Only then do we have the right to be called human beings.
That's the answer to your question - the biological robot is already full of various disorders, standing on the coast of an ocean of unconsciousness and into a hollow sail made of dirty pockets catching the tides of wind blowing.
I have to write in order to be human.
Obama Resigns from Health Care
After a wave of criticism, President Obama resigned yesterday from his often-repeated and ambitious promise that “if you like your health program, you can keep it.”
Referring to hundreds of thousands of notices of resignations from suppliers, the Republicans have accused the president of cheating the American public in recent days.
Yesterday, Mr. Obama made his own promises.
“The vast majority of people who have working health insurance can keep them,” he said in a speech in Boston.
Taking into account what he called a “media disruption” about the statements, Obama called on the Americans who received the announcements to look for new insurance in the market.
Most people will be able to have a better, more comprehensive health care program at the same price or even cheaper than expected.
"You'll get a better offer," he said.
His administration says it should not be surprising that 5 percent of the population who bought insurance for themselves may be forced to change the program because their insurance does not meet the new requirements set by the Accessible Care Act.
“I’m telling these Americans on the same level: you deserve something better,” Sebelius said in her statement before the Energy and Trade Committee in Washington.
Sebelius, who oversees the implementation of the Accessible Care Act, said the launch of the online market was “slow” since October.
"I'm disappointed and angry like everyone else," she said.
I'll try to regain your trust.
Agitated Sebelius said this sentence, captured by the microphone on, yesterday to the advisor sitting behind her at yesterday's committee meeting, which took place after a stormy exchange of views with Republican Billy Long, a representative from Missouri, who was also involved in the program.
For more than three hours during Sebelius’ hearing, he repeatedly asked why the “architect” of the Accessible Care Act did not voluntarily give up government-sponsored insurance, and did not purchase a program through HealthCare.gov, which now imposes millions of Americans.
Which billionaire will you call next year?
Kellner, the owner of the PPF group, wants to buy the operator O2.
Both firms have confirmed the negotiations and according to various sources from agencies and from behind the scenes, they are already hand in hand.
The transaction is expected to be announced in November, probably before the start of the frequency auction for LTE networks, i.e. before November 11.
Kellner's competitor Karel Kom<0xC3><0xA1>rek owns the KKCG group.
This one was auctioned under the Sazka Telecommunications brand for LTE networks.
To the general surprise, until then, there was no talk about the company’s taste to penetrate into telecommunications.
But Sazku is now led by a very experienced telecommunications lube Robert Chv<0xC3><0xA1>tal.
He started out as the marketing manager of Radiomobil (now T-Mobile), then became the director of the Slovak T-Mobile and for the last time he headed the Austrian branch of the same operator.
The rate plays several cards at once.
She signed up for the auction and now she admits she wants to run a virtual at Vodafone.
And it makes sense.
If the auction succeeds, it will be able to move existing customers from its own virtual operator to its network.
This would probably not be liked under the normal circumstances of Vodafone, but according to the Economic Newspaper it may be part of a much closer cooperation between the two companies.
Vodafone currently suffers from the agreement of competing operators O2 and T-Mobile, who will fully share their networks.
Vodafone needs a partner.
And that might be the rate.
If it succeeds in a tender on the LTE network (as a novice can auction a specially designated spectrum), then Vodafone does not have to go to the auction at all, or it will not bother to throw only a limited spectrum (there are not enough frequencies for everyone).
Vodafone can share the network with Sazka.
Vodafone will release Sazku into its 2G/3G network (respectively the newly built LTE network at 900 MHz frequency), allowing the company to quickly start the network.
The rate in between will begin to build an expensive LTE network, which Vodafone will also be able to use.
Both companies can be satisfied.
The saved money could then be spent by Vodafone on some fixed-internet or cable TV provider.
The Kellner?
The purchase of the Czech and Slovak O2 (the Slovenian branch is the daughter of the Czech) immediately acquired a full-fledged operator with still decent profits and a wide range of services.
But on the other hand, it's a big moloch that's gonna wait for restructuring.
In the auction, Kellner would have already acquired the LTE network for O2 and very likely in collaboration with T-Mobile.
The two companies have already announced that the networks will be shared.
The auction could eventually be a success, but most likely not with the high amounts that the state budget is looking forward to.
And from next year, customers in the Czech Republic could choose between calling with Vodafone, T-Mobile, Kellner or Kom<0xC3><0xA1>rk.
Or two titans of the Czech business against the global giants.
Will Czech TV ever go around without signing events?
She has entered the era of President Zeman with a legendary ashtray scene, so it is not difficult to listen to the complaints that collect documents of bullying the castle family.
In the past, the treacherous influence of Ivan Langer or Jaroslav Tvrd<0xC3><0xAD>k has not been documented in this way, let alone to sign it.
The truth is, the editors are gone.
Of course, the cases described do not provide an answer to the question, where does such a propensity of some journalists to the landlords come from - whether it is a reaction to a direct order, or not to use vulgarism, a typical manifestation of inappropriate empathy.
And when we assume that there is a general bias, we cannot forgive the question of whether there are other, not less scrupulous, power interests that have not yet been given the opportunity to change the conditions in television.
Those who say that there are no blatant attempts to intervene politicians in broadcasting in developed countries are right.
The truth, of course, is that this does not mean that there would be no complaints to the public media.
Complainants do not question their independence.
On the contrary, they criticize mainly what they consider to be their own tendency, which is the fruit of their subculture.
Maybe we just haven’t reached this civilizational stage yet, and we don’t have this situation here.
But perhaps even in a country that thinks itself to be the most corrupt in the world, black and white stories of bad politicians and good journalists are spent more comfortably than more complicated descriptions of an opaque situation in which the behavior of many imperfect humans is met.
JAN JANDOUREK: Curse of this country: Presidents on the edge of power
It is almost a rule that at key moments in a country the head of state was not in such a form as to be able to fulfill its state duties.
If T. Masaryk had been physically and mentally five years younger, he would have experienced the end of his presidential term and the events around Munich would have been a little different.
We probably wouldn’t win the war, but after symbolic resistance, the air force could fly beyond the borders, heavy weapons could be destroyed, and the government could flee to London right away and not bother hard about its legitimacy.
And above all, the nation would not have a cat from that capitulation to this day.
Bene<0xC5><0xA1> was not a statesman and he was still in shape for Munich, but during the wars it started to go from the hill and in February 48 he behaved accordingly.
To be better at it, he could go into exile for the third time and break the legitimacy of the Communists and their coup.
It's a shame to talk about H<0xC3><0xA1>ch.
They elected him by saying that "the president will not get into the situation to make a decision."
But he had to, even though the big decision with a knife on his neck at Hitler's chancellery probably wasn't.
The Chief of Intelligence, Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek Moravec, said in the last days of March 1939 that everything should be done to ensure that the occupation, which he knew about the day, did not pass the Germans so smoothly and with such profits.
The senile president and the cowardly government did nothing, on the one hand they did not believe him, on the other they were afraid.
Gottwald had his fellow flight attendants executed by human care, as ordered by Moscow.
Ludv<0xC3><0xAD>k Svoboda was definitely unable to participate in the normalization and had to be planted, already completely senile.
The fact that Hus<0xC3><0xA1>k was a helpless and sick depressed old man in November 89 made it easy, but that's the only lie.
Havel was lucky he hadn't met in office in recent years, he was spared the worst.
Although Klaus is still a fresh tennis retiree, many of his actions suggest that thought processes are no longer what they used to be.
Well, here we go.
The head of state and the commander-in-chief of the armed forces look what he looks like, and we don't know everything yet.
Fortunately, there is no external threat to the country.
Or maybe it's in danger, just not so visible.
Then the question is, is it not exceptionally (historically) good that the president is not entirely in power?
But that is not the normal state.
Wouldn’t we be able to elect a president in this country once again to be someone acceptable to think and acceptable to be healthy?
Remote planets, black-and-white movies, or a bit of fantasy about extraterrestrial life on Earth are not topics that American jazz saxophonist Wayne Shorter would overwhelm the icebergs.
In the concept of his quartet, which on November 6th in the large hall of Prague’s Lucerne will finish this year’s festival Struna Autumn, because everything is related to everything.
The score of the quartet of jazz saxophonist Wayne Shorter are the current feelings of musicians.
According to his instructions, two generations of younger colleagues have to play what they are currently experiencing.
They approach music as a completely improvised chamber matter and think not of harmony or rhythm, but of film images.
This principle, of course, is not explained by the recently 80-year-old Shorter - an extraordinary composer, a nine-Grammy bearer, former co-player Miles Davis, and probably the biggest living jazz saxophonist today.
He doesn’t talk much about music, although his overall view of life is closely related to music.
In my eighties, I came to the conclusion that it is best to let life surprise me.
“Too many people plan everything, and then they’re disappointed when things change,” Shorter says.
How Insects in Thailand Raised Paris Bar Sales
You may be coughing on an insect, but you have no idea that you are eating about half a kilogram a year on a voluntary basis.
For example, peeled in flour.
If you consume it consciously, then you are clearly trending: it is ecological, nutritious and you have also taken care of a unique experience.
In early October, Elie Daviron, chef and bar owner Le Festin Nu, was the first to place the insect on his business' menu in Paris.
The bar, named after William Burroughs’ book Naked Lunch, would be a popular tourist in the fashionable 18th arrondissement near Montmartre.
With fresh avocado, roasted red peppers, ginger and cranberry egg, guests can taste not only different larvae, cabbage or watermelons, but also scrambles.
Careful and specially packaged deliveries (so that the insect does not damage its wings, legs or eyes) are sent to Daviron from Thailand.
Europe is just learning to eat insects, elsewhere it is common.
The owner of a Parisian bar with a pioneering menu immediately lists several reasons why to consume insects.
The first is the ecological benefit, because the production of insects is much less expensive for our planet (in terms of finance, space and water consumption) than traditional meat.
"In addition, the insect is an excellent source of protein and omega-3 fatty acids," Daviron told Reuters.
At the same time, the young chef does not deny his profession, he simply aims to offer his customers a unique culinary experience.
According to him, the right restaurant makes pleasure, a sense of sin and the atmosphere of the environment.
"I'm not saving the world, I'm just passing on a new experience," he explained.
By no means everyone would have had an idea of how to consume a pest-decorated beetle, but the reactions of customers of the Paris bar to the served insect are very positive according to the owner.
Even skeptics say they end up tasting it, even though they start with the smallest clusters and eventually choose a scorpion.
The prices of these tasting plates range from five to nine euros.
V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Maty<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1>, President of the Federation of Construction Entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic: New green savings should continue
Since 2008, the Czech construction industry has been facing a continuous decline in the volume of contracts and the lack of interest of the state to address the issue of investment construction.
The announcement of the New Green Savings programme was a positive signal for our construction sector, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises in the individual regions.
It is a great opportunity not only for citizens who, after implementing the measure, will save significant amounts for heating, but also opportunities for construction companies and manufacturers of building materials.
Each billion invested will bring more than 2,700 new jobs to the state.
From the point of view of the fiscal policy of the state, significant leverage and multiplication effects are also one of the most important growth measures.
The Association of Construction Entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic therefore fundamentally disagrees with the government’s decision and calls for the implementation of such steps that would allow the programme to continue, so that further challenges could be announced within the framework of the programme.
R<0xC3><0x81>VO, November 1, 2013
The dog shrugged the carpet, the president sneezed and ended up in berlins
On Thursday, President Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Zeman left the Motul hospital in Prague, where he spent the night in bed, and went to the castle in L<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC4><0x9B>.
What state of health is he in?
In an unprecedented statement, John Kerry said that U.S. espionage had “walked too far.”
John Kerry pointed to a weakening of the U.S. defense stance on his surveillance programs, and in an unprecedented statement said that in some cases, espionage “has gone too far.”
The foreign minister also admitted that he and Barack Obama were responsible for acting as an “autopilot” in view of the insidious revelations about the NSA’s espionage activity, which emerged thanks to the informant Edward Snowden.
The leaked information triggered a diplomatic storm between the U.S. government and its allies.
Mr. Kerry, via a video link to an open government conference in London, said: “There is no doubt that the president and I and others in the government have really learned about some things that have happened from the cold, because the cold was going on in the past, because there was the possibility, with reference to the Second World War.”
Thus, he became the first high-ranking member of the U.S. government to admit that U.S. espionage had crossed the border, but stressed that it had not been violated.
He said, "In some cases, it's gone too far."
And the president is determined to try to explain and clarify it to the people and is already conducting a thorough review so that no one feels that there has been abuse.
I assure you that in this process there is no abuse of the rights of innocent persons.
Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA is working for the good and that its surveillance operations have saved many lives.
He added: “We are facing a new world in which people are willing to burn themselves up.”
There is radical extremism in the world that is firmly committed to killing and throwing people into the air and attacking governments.
And what if you were able to capture it and stop it before it happens?
In fact, we have prevented planes from crashing, buildings from exploding, and people from being executed because we are already able to find out about these plans in advance.
The chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said on Thursday that U.S. legislators are going to Europe to respond to concerns from abroad about alleged U.S. espionage and convince the Europeans that they need to continue to sit down.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said this week he spoke to members of the European Parliament and other people and that he was concerned about their threat to stop participating in counter-terrorism organizations because they were disappointed by the National Security Agency (NSA) monitoring.
For the national security interests of the United States, it is really important that Europe stays on the same boat with us, given the joint efforts in the fight against terrorism, said in a Washington interview Murphy, a member of the Democratic Party and chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Foreign Relations for Europe.
And I am heading to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to cooperate in the fight against terrorism despite their anger at NSA programs.
Reports in the media that the NSA has collected millions of phone records in Europe have disrupted relations with some of the U.S. allies, although the head of the agency said this week that they were inaccurate and reflected a misunderstanding of the metadata the NATO allies collected and shared.
Another revelation cited documents revealed by Snowden that the NSA was tracking German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s mobile phone and up to 34 other world leaders.
National Intelligence Director James Clapper defended the espionage of the allies as necessary and said it was a common affair on both sides.
In the midst of the storm, Murphy said his office is planning a parliamentary route to take place this year and hopes that members of both parties and the chamber will appear in the delegation.
In the coming days, the names of the other legislators who intend to be involved will be published.
He said he was still working on the program.
Although Murphy said the purpose of the trip was to help repair relationships, he added that “well-meaning educational measures will also be prepared.”
He said European leaders must be honest with their own people when it comes to spying programs that they have been using for years.
“While we are adjusting our surveillance programs to better protect the rights of Europeans, they must also be aware that we are not the only ones doing espionage here,” Murphy said.
Meanwhile, Mr Kerry is heading to the Middle East this weekend and to Poland to respond to the non-violence already triggered by US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as US surveillance.
Australian woman appeals against stay in Thai prison
A twenty-one-year-old woman from Sydney, who was sentenced to fifteen days in prison on the island of Phuket when she falsely claimed to have been attacked by a taxi driver, appealed against the verdict and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was originally charged on June 15 by a country court on Phuket Island on a misdemeanor charge when she told Thai police that the taxi driver, along with two other men who allegedly detained her, attacked her in the early hours of Sunday 10.
However, a footage from industrial television later revealed that after she broke up with her Australian friend, she returned safely to her hotel.
The Phuket police conducted interviews with Bamford two days before she learned that she had made up the incident.
Before the trial, she was held in a local police cell.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days in a low-security correctional facility on the outskirts of Phuket, rather than being placed in adult women's prison.
She is the daughter of former Australian league player Peter Tunks, who asked for help from the Canberra Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the case of his daughter.
Tunks told the Sunday Telegraph that the whole family was "extremely concerned" about her daughter's fate and wanted her back in Australia.
"Obviously it's a challenging period, but we hope to get back to us safely as soon as possible," Tunks said.
Bamford appealed against the verdict and was released on bail of 50,000 baht.
According to reports from Australia, she has spent a holiday in the resort area of Krabi in southern Thailand.
Thailand’s legal sources say Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket, but she was warned that appeals could lead to court proceedings that would increase her sentence and result in her being placed in adult prison.
However, after the recent murder of the Australian travel agent Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand can also try to fix the shattered image for tourists, which may have been behind the release verdict.
J<0xC3><0xA1>gr joked: Goal from the barricade?
In the defensive zone, he got a kick and no one caught him anymore.
In addition, the leak turned into a quick forensic call.
Jarom<0xC3><0xAD>r J<0xC3><0xA1>gr scored against Tampa on Wednesday night, and on Thursday night the 119th NHL winner commented on Facebook.
"After watching this video, my agent Peter Svoboda was called by the director of the Czech Railways and asked him if I should not be interested in making an advertisement for their most modern Pendolino train!" he wrote at the opening with an oversimplification of Jagr.
We're pretty much like each other.
I guess I'll have to finish my night workouts so I don't get any faster.
"I'm afraid he might call the Minister of Defense and he'd like to advertise the sprayers!" he added.
New Jersey also won the second in a row in a row.
"And most importantly, you have noticed - the treatment of Maria Rottrov<0xC3><0xA1> is taking place," concluded Jagr.
Place of election candles election goulash
The October elections, rather than the winners, brought a bunch of losers.
It is not only the parties that did not even enter the Chamber of Deputies (e.g. SPOZ), but also the previous governmental parties (ODS, TOP 09) and finally the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD because of their internal split.
Politicians served us an election goulash on the weekend instead of a holiday candle.
The springboard of the elections was the Andrej Babis movement, which promised voters to change the political style of government so far.
The fragmentation of the election result and the fragmentation in the winning party captures the political (z) cause of President Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Zeman, regardless of the wishes of voters who have neither voted for the party, which President Zeman publicly supported, nor in the House of Representatives.
While the president has lost a strategic leap ahead of other politicians due to an unpleasant event, he still has several ways to get it back - for example, by choosing a future prime minister.
While the chances of obtaining a prime minister’s chair in my eyes are far away, entrepreneurs approach Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1> on the contrary.
Although the election development is still miles away from the early and smooth creation of a stable government, compared to the communist-backed pre-election scenario of the left-wing <0xC4><0x8C>SSD government, this development for business in the Czech Republic and therefore the economy is only a better news.
Because of the strong opposition of YES to join the ODS or TOP 09, it is still the most probable variant of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, YES and KDU-<0xC4><0x8C>SL coalition (total 111 members).
Due to the split in the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, which has thus become an unreadable and weak party in the negotiations, the result of the coalition negotiations can be quite distressing for the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD.
The minority government of the Czechoslovakia, composed of "non-Germans" at the Castle, is unlikely to pass.
In addition, any government in which the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD will participate will be threatened by the dissatisfied ambitions of many Social Democrats, which may sooner or later lead to another split in the party.
So I ask myself, "Are we not going to make a self-sacrifice to the next election?"
The next election would already be a referendum on the strength of the electoral mandate of the YES movement.
The plans of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD for the introduction of sectoral taxes, a more significant increase in income taxes or the construction of a state bank fell, hopefully, under the table.
The parties of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, ANO, KDU-<0xC4><0x8C>SL and <0xC3><0x9A>svit, on the other hand, agree, for example, to support business, moderate fiscal policy (government deficit below 3% of GDP), to support the employment of disadvantaged persons, to reduce the lower rate of VAT for selected goods.
The area of friction is most common in terms of social policy and the size of the state.
Yes, but now he has the top, so the program, so far the most likely coalition of Yes, <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, KDU-<0xC4><0x8C>SL, would lean rather to the right.
Which, in my view, is ultimately a better result than a left-wing program with taxation on everything that is still moving in the economy.
