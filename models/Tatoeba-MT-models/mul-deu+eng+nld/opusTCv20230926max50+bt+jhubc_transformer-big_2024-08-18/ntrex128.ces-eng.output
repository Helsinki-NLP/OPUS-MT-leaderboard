Members of the Welsh Assembly fear that they will “look like Mupeti”
Some members of the Welsh Assembly are dismayed by the proposal that their title should be changed to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament – Member of the Welsh Parliament)
The reason for the proposal is the plans to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
The members of the assembly across the political spectrum are concerned that the name could cause ridicule.
One member of the Labour Party said his group feared that “it’s rhyming with Twp and Pwp.”
For readers outside of Wales: In Welsh twp means stupid and pwp means bitch.
Plaid said the group as a whole was “not happy” and suggested alternatives.
The Welsh Conservative said his group was approaching a change of name "with an open mind", but noted that the MWP is close to the word Muppet.
In this context, the Welsh letter "w" is pronounced similarly to the letter "u" in Yorkshire English.
The Commission, which is now preparing legislation to change the name, said: "The final decision on how the members of the Welsh Assembly will be called will, of course, be on the members themselves."
The Welsh Government Act of 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public consultation on proposals, where it received broad support for a variant called the Assembly of the Welsh Parliament.
As for the title of members of the assembly, the commission preferred the title Welsh Parliament Member, or WMP, but the MWP variant gained the greatest support in the public debate.
Members of the assembly are obviously proposing alternative options, but the struggle to reach consensus may be of concern to President Elin Jones, who is due to submit a draft legislation within a few weeks.
Reform laws will include further changes to the functioning of the assemblies, including rules for disqualification of members and a proposal for a committee system.
The members of the Assembly will vote on the issue of their title as part of the discussion of the new legislation.
Macedonians will vote to change the name of the country
On Sunday, voters will decide whether to change the name of their country to “Republic of North Macedonia”.
The referendum is expected to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of the northern neighbor constitutes a claim to Greek territory, and repeatedly protested against the country’s requests for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes a plebiscite to change the name, said he would not follow the vote.
Supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue, however, that changing the name is simply the price for joining the EU and NATO.
The bells at St. Martin's will be silent as churches in Harlem fight for survival
“The old people I talked to say there used to be a bar and a church on every corner,” says Mr. Adams.
“There’s not one today.”
The disappearance of bars is understandable.
“People are dealing with each other in a different way,” he says.
“Bars are no longer living quarters where people regularly go.”
As for churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of property will not be enough for as long as their representatives expect, “and sooner or later they will be exactly where they started.”
As he adds, churches could be replaced by apartment buildings with apartments full of such type of people who will not help the remaining shrines in the neighborhood much.
“The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these houses will be white,” he says, “and that is why the day will soon come when these churches will close completely, because it is unlikely that most of these people who move into the apartments will become church members.”
Both churches built white congregations even before Harlem became a black metropolis – the Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin ten years later.
The original Belarusian Methodist Congregation moved away in the 30s of the 20th century.
The building was taken over by the Negro congregation, whose devotions took place nearby.
St. Martin took over the Black Congregation under the leadership of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, the main shopping boulevard in Harlem, who refused to hire or promote blacks.
The fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but when Father Johnson's parishioners planned to rebuild it, they also ordered a bell toll.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the bell ringer "the bells of the poor".
The expert, who played the bell in July, called it "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
This expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first bell tower in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to a larger bell tower at a church in Riverside 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather says no one replaced him at St. Martin's.
In the last few months, St. Martin’s was a complicated story of architects and builders, some of whom were summoned by the laity leaders of the church, some later by the episcopal diocese.
In July, the Council of Elders – the governing body of the parish consisting of lay representatives – sent a letter to the diocese expressing concern that the diocese “will try to pass the costs” on to the council of the elders, even though it did not hire architects and builders who were dignitaries.
Some parishioners complained of insufficient transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark Injured 13-Year-Old Boy Who Dived for Humera
According to an official report, the shark attacked and injured a thirteen-year-old boy who dived for lobsters in California on the day of the start of the lobster season.
The attack occurred shortly before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy calling for help, and then paddled to him with a whole group to help get him out of the water.
Hammel said he first considered the call to be the joy of catching the lobster, but then “he realized he was screaming ‘Biss me!
He bit me!”
When Hammel got to the boy, he noticed that "he had a torn entire area of the key bone."
“I shouted, ‘Let everyone come out of the water, ‘There’s a shark in the water!’” adds Hammel.
The boy was transported in critical condition by helicopter to the Children's Hospital Council in San Diego.
It is not known what type of shark is behind the attack.
Swimmer Captain Larry Giles said at a press conference that the shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks ago, but it was determined not to be a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered a traumatic injury to the upper body.
Investigation and security authorities have closed access to the beach for 48 hours from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the cosmetics market in the UK
Sainsbury's wants to build the Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams chain with a shop-style cosmetic street where specialized retailers will be available.
As part of the strong rise in the UK cosmetics market, which is worth <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion and continues to grow, while fashion and household goods sales are declining, the streets with cosmetics will be tested in 11 stores across the country.
The investment in cosmetics is associated with the effort of supermarkets to find use for shelves that have previously been used for televisions, microwaves and household appliances.
Sainsbury’s says it will double the range of cosmetic products to 3,000 products and will introduce brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing range from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also gain more space thanks to branded locations similar to those in stores like Boots.
The supermarket is also re-introducing its make-up lineup Boutique, so most of the products will be vegan, which young customers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, at two Saintsbury’s stores, Fragrance Shop will test the concessions of the perfume retailer. The first such store was opened last week in Croydon in south London and next year will be in Selly Oak in Birmingham.
Shopping over the internet and moving towards everyday shopping for a small amount of food in local stores means that supermarkets have to make more effort to get people to attract.
Sainsbury’s CEO Mike Coupe says stores will look more and more like shopping malls as the supermarket chain strives to better offer services and non-food products to fight off discounted retailers like Aldi and Lidl.
Sainsbury's opened hundreds of stores at Argos and also introduced a number of Habitat departments, which are the chains he bought two years ago. As a result, food sales have increased and acquisitions are even more profitable.
The previous attempt to renovate the department of the supermarket with a cosmetic and pharmaceutical assortment ended infamous.
At the beginning of the millennium, Sainsbury’s tested a joint venture with Boots, but the merger ended after a dispute over the distribution of revenues from drug sales in supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Saintsbury’s three years ago sold its 281 pharmacies for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million to Celesio, which owns the Lloyds pharmacy chain.
Lloyds is set to play a role in the plan by adding an expanded range of luxury skincare brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy to four stores.
Sainsbury’s Chief Commercial Officer Paul Mills-Hicks said: “We have changed the look and style of the streets with cosmetics to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues, with whom customers will be able to consult.
Our range of brands should meet all needs and the attractive environment and convenient location means that we are now an attractive place to buy cosmetics that change the old ways of shopping."
Peter Jones Is “Fucked” After Holly Willoughby Resigns From <0xC2><0xA3>11 Million Contract
Dragons Den's star Peter Jones is "waking up" after TV moderator Holly Willoughby resigned from an $11 million contract with his lifestyle brand to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their brand of clothing and accessories True.
The couple's business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop.
A thirty-seven-year-old moderator of the show announced her departure on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby angered Dragons star Peter Jones by leaving their lucrative lifestyle business at the last minute to focus on her new big contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to informed sources, Jones “wrapped” when the TV star at a tense Tuesday meeting at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, admitted that due to new contracts – worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million – he would no longer be able to devote enough time to the knower.
The company was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was able to double Willoughby's estimated wealth of <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she was leaving the True brand, Jones left the UK for one of her summer residences.
The unnamed source said: “The True brand was a top priority for Holly.
It was supposed to be her long-term future, which would secure her for a few decades ahead.
Her decision to leave was a shock to all those involved.
No one could believe what was going on on Tuesday, the launch was so close.
At the headquarters in Marlow there is a full stock of ready-to-sell goods."
Experts believe the departure of This Morning, one of the UK’s most profitable stars, could cost the company millions due to a fat investment in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and household clothes and possible further delays.
And it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby's three-child mother and husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends of Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby founded True with Tary Capp in 2016, and the seventy-year-old Jones joined the board in March.
The couple go on vacation together and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby is set to become M&S ambassador and will replace Anta McPartlin in moderating I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
A source close to Jones said last night: “We will not comment on his business affairs.”
Difficult action “and then we fell in love”
He joked about the criticism he received from journalists for a remark some consider “unworthy of the president” and for how positively he speaks of the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so many things?
Trump responded with his ridiculous “voting” voice.
“I didn’t give up anything.”
He noted that after their first meeting in Singapore in June was seen by Trump as a major step towards denuclearization of North Korea, Kim is interested in another meeting.
But negotiations on the elimination of nuclear weapons are stuck at a dead end.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, prominent North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see a “suitable response” from the US to its first steps to disarmament.
Instead, the U.S. continues to impose sanctions aimed at increasing pressure.
In his speech, Trump expressed a much more optimistic view.
"We're doing great with North Korea," he said.
“We were on the brink of war with North Korea.
It would cost millions of lives.
We have a great relationship now.”
His efforts to improve relations with Kim, he said, have brought positive results – ending missile tests, helping to free hostages, and returning the remnants of U.S. troops to their homeland.
And he stopped his unusual approach to informing about his relationship with Kim.
“It’s so easy to act like a president, but instead of 10,000 people trying to get into this crowded arena from outside, we’d have about 200 people standing right here,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastated the island and killed hundreds of people
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs learned that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok has been driven out of their homes, it has not been declared a national disaster, which is a prerequisite for accelerating international aid.
“Unfortunately, in many cases, they have made it very clear that they do not require international assistance, so it’s a bit challenging,” says Ms. Sumbung.
While Save the Children is a team that travels to Pal, it is not yet clear whether foreign staff can work here.
A spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, Mr Sutupo, said Indonesian officials were evaluating the situation in Paula to see if it would be possible for international organizations to help.
Due to the fact that earthquakes are very frequent in Indonesia, the country is still sadly unprepared for the anger of Mother Nature.
Although shelters have been built in Aceh against the tsunami, it is not common in other parts of the coast.
The apparent lack of sirens warning of the tsunami in Paul probably contributed to the loss of human lives, even though the warning was issued.
Even at the best time, travelling among many islands in Indonesia is problematic.
And in the case of natural disasters, logistics is even more difficult.
The hospital ship, which anchored in Lombok and helped the earthquake victims, is now moving to Paul, but it will take at least three days to get to the site of the new calamity.
Improving Indonesia’s poor infrastructure was the main point of President Joko Widodo’s election campaign and the president spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
He will seek to run again next year, but his government is plagued by funding failures.
President Joko is also facing pressure from ongoing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority take on a more conservative form of faith.
The street battles between Christians and Muslims, in which gangs use swords, bows, arrows and other primitive weapons, have already claimed the lives of more than thousands of people and tens of thousands of people have fled their homes.
Watch: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool shoots off the equaliser goal against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge scored in the 89th minute at London's Stamford Bridge on Saturday, saving Liverpool from losing to Chelsea in the Premier League.
Sturridge got a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri about 27 metres ahead of Chelsea's goal when his team lost 1-0.
He threw the ball on the left and fired at the remote bar.
The bullet flew high and headed to the top right corner of the gate.
The ball eventually jumped over the jumping Kepa Arrizabalag and ended up in the net.
"I was just trying to get to the right place to get the ball, and players like Shaq are always playing as far ahead as possible, so I wanted to get as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kant approaching me, so I didn't think too much about it, and I shot at one touch."
Chelsea led 1-0 to Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The Blues sent the passport back to Mate Kovacic, then turned in the middle of the pitch and sprinted to half Liverpool.
Kovacic played the ball quickly.
Then he sent the ball down Hazard's beautiful street to the limestone.
He escaped defensively and ended up with the left to the remote bar next to Alisson Becker of Liverpool.
On Wednesday at 15 pm, Liverpool will play in the Champions League group at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy with the local team.
Chelsea will play Thursday at 3 p.m. in London with Videoton in the UEFA Europa League.
The number of victims of the tsunami in Indonesia increased to 832
According to the Indonesian Disaster Response Authority, the death toll from earthquakes and tsunami surged to 832.
The 7.5-degree quake struck Friday, triggered waves of up to 6 meters in height and imprisoned many people in the rubble of destroyed buildings, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference.
The city of Paula, which has a population of over 380,000, was visited by ruins of destroyed buildings.
Police Arrest Twenty-Two-Year-Old Man Suspected of Drunken Woman
A woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside, and the police immediately started an investigation into the murder.
A 44-year-old woman with stab wounds was found at 7:55 a.m. on Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have called on people in the area who have seen or heard something to sign up.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is only at the beginning, but I would like to appeal to all those who were moving near John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard something suspicious to contact us.
I also ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, whose on-board cameras may have recorded something to contact us because they may have important information for our investigation."
A police spokesperson confirmed that a dead woman was living in Birkenhead and the body was found in the building.
This afternoon, friends arrived at the scene of the crime, who think they know the woman, to ask where she was found this morning.
Police said an investigation was underway and are now informing relatives of the victims.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews was just trying to get back to his apartment, but police told him no one was allowed in or out of the building.
When he found out what had happened, he was unable to speak.
The residents have now learned that it will take several hours for them to be able to return home.
A police officer told one man that the entire area is now considered a crime scene.
A crying woman appeared on the spot.
He kept saying, “It’s terrible.”
At 2 p.m., two police trucks were behind the scenes and others were waiting outside.
In the enclosed area, there are a number of police officers who monitor the house.
Anyone with any information can send a message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or anonymously contact Crimestoppers at 0800 555 111 and enter the code 247 of September 30.
Cromwell's statue in parliament has recently become a hit because of a dispute over "rewriting history"
His expulsion would be a deserved punishment for the fact that his fanatical puritanical Taliban-style followers destroyed many of the English cultural and religious artifacts.
But the Cromwell Society called Mr. Crick's proposal "a folly" and "a dream of rewriting history."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “In the current debate about removing statues, it was imperative that one of the goals would be the character of Oliver Cromwell in front of the Palace of Westminster.
Cromwell did not command or carry out iconoclasm in the English Civil Wars.
Perhaps the incorrect Cromwell will be sacrificed for the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century."
The quality of Cromwell’s portrayal, authored by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is evidence of the 19th-century view and part of the historiography of the character that many believe still deserves to be celebrated.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Many people consider Cromwell, although somewhat less than at the end of the 19th century, to be a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case, of course, by the monarchy.
The accuracy of this interpretation is the subject of inexhaustible historical debates.
It is certain that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century formed the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a well-identifiable figure who represents one side of this division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and remembering."
Chinese farmer's homicidal pig smashes
According to local media, a pig farmer has been attacked and killed in a market in southeastern China.
As the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday, a man with only the surname “Yuan” was found dead with an artery in a blood clot near a pimple market in Liou-pchan-shuej in Kuej-chou province.
The pig breeder is preparing to apply the vaccine to pigs in pork on May 30, 2005 in the city of Si-ning in the Chinese province of Ching-hai.
He reportedly came Wednesday with a cousin from the neighbouring province of Jün-nan to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and found that the door to the next pier was open.
According to him, there was a big pig in the manger with a blood clot.
According to the information, during the forensic investigation, it was confirmed that 250 kilograms of pork was torn by the farmer.
“The cousin had bloody and broken legs,” said the cousin of Guiyang Evening News, nicknamed “Wu.”
On the security camera footage, Yuan came to the market Thursday at 4.40 to feed his pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousins.
The market manager told Evening News that the pig was closed so no one else could think when the police were gathering evidence at the crime scene.
Market officials are reportedly negotiating with Yuan's family on compensation for his death.
Although swine attacks on humans are rare, they have already occurred in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in Massachusetts, and her husband was critically injured.
Ten years earlier, 300kg of pig pushed a Welsh farmer to the tractor and drove it to the farmer’s wife.
After an Oregonian farmer ate his pig in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can function as a “sucker.”
“They’re just playing.
They're curious... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to give them enough respect," he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will bring heavy rain to the southwest of the United States
Hurricane Rosa is forecast to weaken and move over the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
In the coming days, however, it will bring flooding rain to the north of Mexico and the southwest of the United States.
At 5 a.m. eastern time, Rosa reached wind speeds of 137 km/h, representing a Category 1 hurricane, and was located 620 km southeast of the city of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move to the north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low-pressure swarm forms over the Pacific Ocean and moves east to the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday, it will take the form of a tropical storm and begin to push tropical humidity northwards to the southwestern part of the United States.
In some parts of Mexico, Rosa will bring up to 250 mm of rainfall on Monday.
Tropical humidity then with the approaching low-pressure gusts in the coming days will cause heavy rains in the southwestern United States.
Precipitation of 25 to 100 mm locally will cause dangerous flooding, mudslides and possible landslides in the desert.
Strong tropical humidity will cause precipitation to approach 50 to 75 mm per hour, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
In some places in the southwestern United States, especially above most of Arizona, 50 to 100 mm of precipitation is expected.
In rapidly deteriorating conditions, tidal flooding may occur due to the scattered nature of tropical rainfall.
Given the danger of tropical rainfall, it would be very unwise to go on foot into the desert.
Heavy rains can cause the canyons to become raging rivers, and storms will bring local impact winds and flying dust.
The approaching low-pressure braces will bring heavy local rainfall on some parts of the southern coast of California.
Total precipitations above 13 mm may occur, which could result in smaller sutin flows and slippery pathways.
It will be the first rainy season in the region.
On Sunday evenings and Monday mornings, lone tropical storms begin to approach Arizona, and on Monday evenings and Tuesdays, the rain will spread.
On Tuesday, heavy rain will spread to the Four Corners and will last until Wednesday.
In October, we can expect intense changes in temperature throughout the United States, as the Arctic will begin to cool, but in the tropical zone it will still be quite warm.
This sometimes leads to sharp changes in temperature over short distances.
A great example of significant differences in temperature is the U.S. average on Sunday.
The difference between Kansas City in Missouri and Omaha in Nebraska and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa is almost 11 degrees Celsius.
In the next few days, they will again try to expand the rising summer heat.
In most areas in the middle and east of the United States, a warm beginning of October is expected with temperatures around 27 <0xC2><0xB0>C from the southern sheets to the northeastern part of the United States.
In New York City it could be 27 <0xC2><0xB0>C on Tuesday, which is about 6 degrees above average.
Our long-term forecast shows a high probability of above-average temperatures in the east of the United States in the first half of October.
Brett Kavanaugh's interview was watched by more than 20 million people
More than 20 million people watched on six television channels Thursday the compelling remarks of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual assault allegedly committed in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, political turmoil continued, and voters interrupted mainstream programs with reports of a sudden Friday turnaround: an agreement brokered by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake that the FBI would conduct a one-week investigation into the charges.
Christine Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh was drinking at a high school party and trying to get her clothes off.
Kavanaugh said in his excited remarks that he was 100% sure it didn’t happen.
It is likely that the event was watched by more than 20.4 million people, according to the Nielsen agency.
The company calculated average tracking on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Numbers for other stations that were broadcasting statements such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network were not immediately available.
And Nielsen usually has trouble counting people who look in the office.
For comparison, it is a similar number of spectators who watch football matches in play-offs or Oscars.
The Fox News Channel, whose moderators strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, had the highest number of views on all stations when, according to Nielsen, it was watched by an average of 5.69 million viewers throughout the day's hearing.
The second was ABC with 3.26 million viewers.
Nielsen states that CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million viewers.
He continued to be interested even after the negotiations had ended.
The main character of Friday's drama was Senator Flake.
After the moderate Republican’s office issued a statement saying he would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning captured how protesters yelled at him when he was about to go by elevator to a jury hearing.
CNN broadcast live how he stood with his eyes closed for a few minutes and let himself sing.
One woman said, "I'm standing right here in front of you."
“Do you think the earth is telling the truth?”
He also said, “You have power, while many women are helpless.”
Flake said his office had issued a statement, and before closing the elevator door, he added that he would say more at the committee meeting.
All cable and television networks later broadcast live when the Judiciary Committee was to vote on Kavanaugh's nomination to vote for the entire Senate.
But Flake said he would only do so if the charges against the candidate were investigated by the FBI by next week, which was demanded by a minority of Democrats.
Flake was partially convinced by the interviews with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After an interview with Coons and several other senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake's vote was important because it was clear that without an investigation, the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "politicians" about Brexit
In a Sunday Times interview, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union of "politicians" about Britain's future and undermining national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May attends a Conservative Party conference in Birmingham on September 29, 2018.
In another interview, which was close to the Prime Minister on the headlines, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson attacked her so-called Chequers plan when he said that the proposal for Britain and the EU to select their tariffs against each other is “absolutely nonsense.”
Waydea Sims Shooting: Police Arrest Dyteon Simpson, Suspected of LSU Player's Death
Police have arrested the suspect in the shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU player.
The Baton Rouge Police Department said Dyteon Samson, 20, was arrested and imprisoned on charges of second-degree murder.
Authorities released a video of a confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and according to police, Sims lost his glasses during the match.
According to the WABF channel, which belongs to CBS, police secured the glasses at the scene and found Simpson's DNA on them.
Simpson, according to police, admitted to the interrogation that he shot Waydea.
According to the lawyer, the bail was set at $350,000.
On Friday, the East Baton Rouge Coroner's Office published a preliminary report stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The Department thanks the Louisiana State Refugee Police Unit, the State Police Criminalistic Laboratories, the Southern University Police, and local citizens for assisting in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked the local police for the “dust and the pursuit of justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
A two-metre striker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
Last season, he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 jumps per game.
LSU basketball coach Will Wade said on Friday morning that Wayde’s death had “shocked” and “shocked” him.
"This is what you're still afraid of," Wade said.
Volcano rocking ash in Mexico City
The ash, which flows from the Popacatépetl volcano, hit the southern district of the Mexican capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday not to approach the volcano after the volcano's activity increased and 183 emissions of gas and ash were detected within 24 hours.
The centre was watching a series of turmoils and shocks.
On social media, images of the windshields of cars covered with a thin layer of ash appeared in some neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have recorded an increase in the activity of the volcano, which is located 72 kilometers (45 miles) southeast of the capital. The last earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017 and had a strength of 7.1 degrees.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
On the eve of the independence vote, the police clashed with Catalan separatists.
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after protesters clashed with regular police and thousands of people took part in competitive demonstrations on the occasion of the first anniversary of the independence vote that divided Catalonia.
Regular police blocked a group of masked separatists who threw eggs and powdered paint at them, which in the streets, which are usually flooded with tourists, created a dark cloud of dust.
Later, clashes broke out, for which the police had to use shells to calm them.
Within hours, independence groups chanted “We will not forget, we will not forgive” in the face of protesting Union supporters who shouted “Long live Spain”.
According to local media, 14 people were lightly injured during the protests.
A year after the October 1 referendum, which Madrid considers illegal, but is celebrated by separatist Catalans, tensions remain high in the region seeking independence.
Voters voted for independence by a large majority, but participation in the elections was low because opponents of the crackdown boycotted them.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting in polling stations in violent clashes across the region.
The independence groups stayed out on Friday night to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place, but she had to choose a different route.
The 80-year-old electrician Narcis Termes, who took part in a separatist protest with his wife, said he is no longer looking forward to gaining independence for Catalonia.
“Last year we had one of the best moments.
“My parents were crying with joy that they could vote, but now we’re in a blind alley,” he said.
Despite the important, although narrow victory in the regional elections last December, Catalan independence-supporting parties had to fight to keep things going this year. Many of their most well-known leaders have either gone to exile in their own rallies, or they are waiting to be tied up in exile.
Forty-two-year-old monteur Joan Puig recorded a protest in support of the police on his phone and said the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
“The situation is getting more and more tense,” he adds.
Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been awaiting trial since the end of last year, announced on Saturday that he will run for the European Parliament next year.
"Candidacy in the European elections is the best way to condemn the decline of democratic values and the repression we witness from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men jailed after car crash at home
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after they repeatedly ran into a house in Londonderry.
The event took place at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at approximately 7:30 p.m. local time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the gate and the house were damaged.
At one point, someone might have shot the car out of the car.
Mengo's hit ensured Livingston a 1-0 win over the Rangers
Dolly Mengy's first goal for Livingston secured victory
Livingston, who relegated from the lower division, shocked the Rangers and gave Steven Gerrard a second defeat of 18 games as manager of the club from Ibrox.
Dolly Mengy's hit proved decisive when Gary Holt's team reached the Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's team has not yet won the Premiership on the guest field this season, and next Sunday will be the first Hearts to lose eight points.
The Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the European League on Thursday.
Livingston has extended a series of unbeaten games in the division to six games, so head coach Holt, who replaced Kenny Miler last month, has not yet experienced a defeat.
Livingston did not take advantage of the odds against the insignificant guests
Holt's team was to lead long before the goal, because his straightness caused the Rangers many problems.
Scott Robinson penetrated the defense, but failed in front of the gate, then Alan Lithgow in the slip just narrowly passed Craig Halkett's head in front of the gate.
The home team had to watch the Rangers play in front of them because they knew they could handle standard situations.
And so came the key goal.
A free kick was ordered against the Rangers, and Livingston created a sledgehammer, Declan Gallagher and Robinson sent Meng to score the ball in the center of the penalty area.
At this stage, the Rangers dominated in possession of the ball, but home defense was impenetrable for them and goalkeeper Liam Kelly usually didn't have much work to do.
The same image of the game was also in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to intervene.
Scott Pittman stopped the legs of Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow did not hit from another standard situation at Livingston.
In the penalty area of Livingston, centres that the players were constantly cleaning up were constantly flying, and two penalty kicks came to nothing - after Halket's attack on his replacement Glenn Middleton and another at his fingertips.
"The Phenomenon" from Livingston – analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
They were without exception excellent and continue to exceed expectations on their way upwards.
Their style of play and team hasn't changed much since returning to the top, but Holt deserves a lot of praise for the team's break-up since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was huge, leading a perfectly organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on the alert all the time.
The Rangers lacked inspiration.
They used to be good under Gerrard, but they no longer meet these standards.
Their ending was chaba – they only broke into the home side once – and for the Rangers it should be a wake-up call because they are in the middle of the table.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an had a mixed reception in Cologne.
When the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin on Saturday (September 29th), the sky was blue and everyone was smiling.
It is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve relations between NATO allies.
They disagreed over a number of issues including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s accession to the EU.
Erdogan then moved to Cologne, where he opened a huge new mosque.
In this city is the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police prevented a crowd of 25,000 people from meeting in front of the mosque for security reasons, but there were many supporters in the vicinity who wanted to see their president.
Hundreds of people – many of them Kurds – were also heard protesting against Erdogan, who condemned his policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him into the country.
The protests reflect the controversy of the visitor, who some German Turks celebrated as a hero, and others cursed as an autocrat.
Deptford accident: cyclist dies after car crash
A cyclist died in a car crash in London.
The accident occurred at approximately 10:15 local time near the Bestwood Street intersection with busy Evelyn Street in Deptford, southeast of the city.
The driver stopped and the ambulance arrived soon, but the man was dead on the spot.
It was only a few months after another cyclist died about a mile and a half from the scene of Saturday’s tragedy in the Childers Street crash when the driver landed from the scene.
The Metropolitan Police said police are now trying to identify the man and inform his relatives.
The road is closed, buses run on alternative routes, and motorists are advised to avoid this area.
Long Lartin Jail: Six Guards Injured During Disturbances
According to the prison office, six security guards were injured in riots in a men's prison with high security.
The riots erupted at Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire on Sunday around 9:30 p.m. local time and are still ongoing.
To cope with the outbursts involving eight prisoners in one wing, specialised guards from the Tornado team were called in.
The guards suffered minor injuries and were treated on the spot.
A spokesman for the prison service said: “To cope with the ongoing incident at Long Lartin Prison, special training of prison staff was deployed.
Six members of the staff were treated with injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and it is clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and may spend longer time behind bars.”
There are more than 500 prisoners in Long Lartin Prison, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was announced that the director of the prison was dead after the attack on a prisoner in the hospital.
And last October, regular units were called to prison for serious unrest, in which personnel were attacked by biliary bullets.
Hurricane Rosa threatens floods in Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (area where it is dry may benefit)
It’s not usual for a tropical low-pressure brace to hit Arizona, but that’s what’s likely to happen early next week when the remaining energy from Hurricane Rosa outweighs the desert southwest and poses a risk of flooding.
The National Weather Service has issued a flood warning on Monday and Tuesday from western Arizona for southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including cities such as Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to go straight across the Phoenix on Tuesday and bring rain on Monday night.
The Phoenix National Meteorological Service said on Twitter that “since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have retained tropical storm or pressure status within 320 km of Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane another 64 km from the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict rainfall of 50 to 100 mm, in the Mogollon Rim area of Arizona locations of up to 150 mm.
In other areas of the desert northwest, including the middle of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, it is likely to fall 25 to 50 mm, with local accumulations of up to 100 mm.
For those who are not at risk of flooding, the rain in Russia can be a blessing because the area has hit dry.
Floods are a very serious thing, but these falls may help somewhere, because the Southwestern United States has just hit a drought.
According to weather.com, more than 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing “extreme drought”, which is the second-highest category, according to U.S. Drought Monitor.
Hurricane Rosa's journey will first lead to the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, still about the strength of a hurricane with a maximum wind speed of 137 km/h, then on Sunday morning will be 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and will move at a speed of 19 km/h to the north.
Then the storm meets the colder waters of the Pacific Ocean, and thus loses its strength.
It is expected to arrive in Mexico on Monday afternoon or evening as a tropical storm.
In some parts of Mexico, precipitation will be severe, which poses a high risk of flooding.
“In the region from Baja California to northwestern Sonorah, total precipitation is expected to be between 75 and 150 mm, with a precipitation of up to 250 mm,” said weather.com.
Rosa then travels like a tropical storm across Mexico to the north and arrives at the Arizona border on Tuesday morning, then passes through Arizona and enters southern Utah on Tuesday evening.
"It is expected that the main risk for Russia or its remnants will be very strong precipitation in Baja California, the northwestern Sonora and the desert southwest of the United States," the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
These rains are expected to cause deadly floods and streams of Sutin in deserts and landslides in mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton: Four people arrested for attempted murder
A three-year-old boy and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found in Somerset.
The injured boy was found in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton on Saturday at approximately 4:00 local time.
He was taken to the hospital and his condition is now “stable”.
According to police in Avon and Somerset, young men aged between 17 and 20 were detained at night in the Radstock area.
Police are looking for witnesses who might have a cell phone record of what happened.
Trump Says Kavanaugh 'Experienced Evil and Anger' Democratic Party
“The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a rejection of the Democratic Party’s reckless and scandalous tactics,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that during the process of his nomination, Kavanaugh "experienced the evil and anger" of the Democratic Party.
Kavanaugh testified in front of Congress on Thursday, where he resolutely and emotionally rejected Christine Blasey Ford’s allegation that he sexually assaulted her a few decades ago when they were teenagers.
At the hearing, Ford also testified about her indictment.
The president said on Saturday that on that day, "Americans were witnesses of Kavanaugh's excellence and quality and courage."
Speaking to his supporters from West Virginia, he said that “the voice confirming Judge Kavanaugh is a confirmation of one of the greatest legal brains of our time, a lawyer who has excellent public service on his account.”
The president indirectly opposed Kavanaugh’s nomination when he spoke about the importance of Republicans participating in mid-term elections.
“Five weeks ago, one of the most important elections in our lives.
I'm not running, but I'm still on the move," he said.
“That’s why I’m fighting for great candidates everywhere.”
Trump said the Democrats had opted for “resistance and obstruction.”
A Republican leadership adviser told CNN that the first key procedural vote on Kavanaugh's nomination on the floor of the Senate is expected no later than Friday.
Earthquakes and Tsunami in Indonesia Killed Hundreds and Number of Victims Continues to Grow
Authorities said on Saturday that after the Indonesian island of Sulawesi was hit by a massive earthquake and tsunami, at least 384 people died, many of whom were swept away by the huge waves that flooded the beaches.
Hundreds of people gathered on the beach in Palu on Friday at the festival, but at twilight, up to six-metre waves hit the coast, killing many people and destroying everything in their way.
The tsunami precipitated an earthquake of 7.5 degrees.
“When a tsunami threat appeared yesterday, people were still on the beach and didn’t escape immediately, so they fell victim to the wave,” said BNPB spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at a Jakarta briefing.
“The tsunami wave didn’t go alone, it took cars, mudslides, houses, it hit everything on the ground,” Nugroho said, adding that before the impact on the coast, the tsunami wave spread at an open sea speed of 800 km/h.
He said that some people had fled to the trees before the wave and survived.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
The aerial photographs, published by the disaster mitigation agency, show many destroyed buildings and shops, twisted and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
The city's coastline was also shaken on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technologies (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday’s powerful tremors was about 200 times greater than the power of the atomic bomb dropped during World War II on Hiroshima.
The city lies at the end of a long, narrow bay, which may have further exacerbated the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had been destroyed.
He noted that the bodies of some of the victims were found buried under the rubble of the destroyed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho reported that the number of casualties and damage could be greater on the coast 300 km north of Pal, in an area called Donggala, which is near the epicenter of the earthquake.
According to him, the communication was "absolutely devastated without any information" from the Dongala.
The Red Cross said in a statement that more than 300,000 people live in the area, adding that its workers and volunteers are heading for the affected areas.
“It’s a tragedy, but it could get a lot worse,” the statement said.
The agency came under heavy criticism on Saturday for not informing Palu that the tsunami had hit, although authorities said the waves had come at the time the warning was issued.
Amateur footage shared on social media shows a man on the upper floor of the building warning people on the street of a tsunami.
Within a few minutes, the coast will be hit by a water wall that transports buildings and cars.
The Reuters agency was unable to verify the record immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage that disrupted communications around Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue work.
According to the authorities, the army began sending cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, but evacuated people still need food and other basic necessities.
The airport in the city was reopened only for aid transport and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit evacuation centers in Palu on Saturday.
The number of victims of the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to more than 800.
That's too bad.
When employees of the World Vision organization from Donggala arrived in the city of Paula, where employees were hiding in shelters from the huts built in the courtyard of the office building, they saw images of destruction along the way, Mr. Doseba says.
“They said they saw a lot of homes destroyed,” he adds.
It's too bad.
When aid groups began a sad effort to help in disasters, some complained that foreign workers with a lot of experience were not allowed to come to Paul.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies and personnel from abroad may begin to flow to the site of the calamity until a national disaster zone is declared.
That hasn't happened yet.
“It’s still a disaster at the provincial level,” said Indonesian Red Cross spokesman Aulia Arriani.
“Once the government says, ‘OK, this is a national disaster,’ we can start international aid, but that’s not the case yet.”
When Paul was the second night after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, friends and relatives of those who are still unaware still hoped that their loved ones would be the miracles that alleviate the cloudy stories of natural disasters.
They pulled a little boy out of the canal on Saturday.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who was trapped under rubble next to her mother's body for two days.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian paragliding team, trained two of the missing paragliders at the Asian Games that ended in Indonesia this month.
Another of the people imprisoned at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
“As a person who has been engaged in paragliding for a long time, I have my own emotional burden,” he says.
Mr. Gendon outlined how in the hours that followed the paragliding community’s news of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel, he desperately sent messages via WhatsApp to competitors from Palo who participated in the beach festival.
But instead of a pair of blue ticks, his messages ended up with a gray mark.
“I think that means that the messages have not been delivered,” he says.
Thieves took $26,750 while filling the ATM in Newport on the Levee
According to a press release from the Newport Police Department, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee on Friday morning while filling up a Newport on the Levee ATM.
According to Detective Dennis McCarthy, the driver of the car emptied the ATM in the entertainment complex and prepared to put more money into it.
In doing so, another man “runned behind a Brink employee” and stole a bag of money that was supposed to be put into the ATM.
Witnesses said they had seen several suspects fleeing the scene, but police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
If you have any information about the identity of the suspects, contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Raper changed his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
He announced the change on Twitter on Saturday, writing, “The Being formally known as Kanye West.”
Forty-one-year-old West has been nicknamed Ye for some time and used the pseudonym as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is due to release his new album Yandhi.
The show will replace singer Arian Grande, who has cancelled her participation for "emotional reasons," the show's creator said.
West had previously said that the word for him has a religious meaning in addition to the abbreviation of the existing professional name.
“In my opinion, ‘ye’ is the most used word in the Bible, where ‘you’ means ‘you’,” West said earlier this year when he spoke to radio moderator Big Boy about his album.
“It’s you, it’s us, it’s us.
It changed from Kanye, which means the one, to just Ye – as a mere reflection of our good, our evil, our confusion, everything.
The album is a reflection of who we are."
A number of other famous rappers also changed their name.
Sean Combs was known at various times as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced that he preferred the names Love (love) and Brother Love (brotherly love).
Former West's co-worker Jay-Z also wrote his name alternately with his ally and without him and in large and small letters.
Mexican President Amlo vows not to use the military against civilians
On the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the bloody attack on students, newly elected Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador pledged never to use military force against civilians.
On Saturday, Lopez Obrador promised at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would “never use the military to oppress the Mexican people.”
At a time when the leftist student movement spread throughout Latin America, soldiers began shooting at people on October 2, 1968, at a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing up to 300 people.
Lopez Obrador pledged to support young Mexicans by paying monthly support to those studying, and by opening other free public universities.
He said that unemployment and the lack of opportunities for education are dragging young people into criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double funding for artificial intelligence
According to investor and artificial intelligence expert Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple, China is increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) and the U.S. should double the amount they spend on research in the field.
The comment comes after various parts of the U.S. government released announcements about AI, even though the U.S. as a whole has no formal strategy for artificial intelligence.
China, meanwhile, last year introduced a plan that it wants to be the number one in AI innovation by 2030.
“Doubling the budget for AI research would be a good start given that all other countries are far beyond the U.S. and we are looking for another breakthrough in AI,” Lee says.
In an interview with CNBC this week, Lee said that doubling funding could double the chance that the next major AI discovery will be made in the US.
Lee, who published Houghton Mifflin Harcourt’s book “Superpowers of AI: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” this month, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the most prominent AI<0x2B> companies in China.
At Carnegie Mellon University in the 1980s, he worked on an AI system that outperformed the best American player in Othello, and later was a senior researcher at Microsoft and president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee appreciated previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Robotic Challenge, and asked when he would be next to help identify new visionaries.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to get government grants, according to Lee.
“Academic peaks are not led by China, but by corporations,” Lee says.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have been employing the best experts from universities in recent years to work on artificial intelligence.
According to Lee, changes in immigration policy could also help to improve AI efforts in the United States.
“In my opinion, PhD holders in the field of AI should automatically be offered green cards,” he says.
In July 2017, the State Council of China released a new generation of artificial intelligence development plan.
The Chinese National Foundation of Natural Sciences provides funding to people in academic institutions in a similar way as the National Scientific Council and other government organizations donate money to researchers in the US, but the quality of academic work is worse in China, Lee says.
The U.S. Department of Defense has established a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence to engage industry and academic partners this year, and the White House has announced the creation of an Artificial Intelligence Selection Commission.
And DARPA announced this month that it is investing $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
As far as the NSF is concerned, the NSF now invests more than $100 million annually in AI research.
However, U.S. legislation, which wanted to create the National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence, has not done anything for many months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on whether to change the name of the country
Macedonians voted on Sunday in a referendum on whether to change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia", which would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that blocks requests for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province called Macedonia and claims that the name of the northern neighbor constitutes a claim to its territory, and therefore vetoed Macedonia's entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement on the proposed new name in June, but nationalist opponents argue that the change will weaken the ethnic identity of the majority Slavic population in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum, and the campaign calling for a boycott has raised questions about whether at least 50 percent of voters will be required to make the referendum valid.
The question in the referendum was: “Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with the acceptance of an agreement with Greece?”
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say it is a price worth paying for Macedonia, one of the successor countries of the former Yugoslavia, to join organisations such as the EU and NATO.
“I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the roof of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us,” says 79-year-old Olivera Georgievska from Skopje.
While the referendum is not binding, enough members of parliament said they would be guided by the result of the vote.
A change of name would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The State Electoral Commission said no problems had been reported by 1 p.m.
Electoral participation, however, was only 16 percent compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters gave up their vote.
“I went to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,” says Gjose Tanevski, a 62-year-old voter from the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dusko surrender their votes in a Macedonian referendum on a name change that would pave the way for NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia on September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepares a small podium and raises chairs in front of tents built by people boycotting the referendum.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to enter them with our heads up, not the door for servitude,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have our pride.
If they don’t want us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of Eurasian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring so much needed investment to Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
“I think the vast majority will be in favour, because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after voting.
The “yes” result would be “confirmation of our future.”
According to a survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research, a referendum could take place between 30 and 43 percent of voters – which is less than the required turnout.
Another survey conducted by the Macedonian television station Telma TV found that 57 percent of respondents intend to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent said they would vote yes.
In order for the referendum to be successful, it must be attended by 50 percent plus one voter.
The failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government’s policy since its inception last May.
Sergio Aguero from Manchester City has scored a goal through the entire defense of Brighton
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling managed to defend Brighton on Saturday, securing Manchester City a 2-0 win at Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
In Aguera's performance, his goal in the 65th minute looked ridiculously easy.
It all started with a shot that the Argentine striker got in the middle of the field.
He sprinted between the three Brighton defenders and entered the open space.
Aguera was surrounded by four green jerseys.
On the edge of Brighton's penal territory, one defender passed by and several others ran ahead.
He found Sterling on the left.
The English striker clinched the ball in the penalty area back to Aguero, who right-handedly defeated Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan by shooting at the right side of the net.
“Aguero has a leg problem,” City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We thought he would play 55 or 60 minutes.
And so it was.
We were lucky to have scored a goal at the time.”
But the initial advantage for the Sky Blues in this Premier League match was arranged by Sterling.
This goal fell in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deep into Brighton.
On the left he sent a beautiful ball to Leroy Sane.
Sane processed the ball and then sent Sterling to the remote bar.
The attacker Sky Blues glued the ball into the net just before sliding off the pitch.
City will play Tuesday at 12:55 with Hoffenheim in the Champions League group at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to spoil the joy of the Rockies
When the Nationals were eliminated from the play-offs, there wasn’t much reason to re-enact.
But the ever-competitive Scherzer hopes to take the lead in the game against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday – but only when the Rockies, who lead the NL West by one game over the Los Angeles Dodgers, have a play-off hope.
The Rockies secured at least a wild card on Friday night with a 5-2 win over the Nationals, but they still want to win their first title in the division.
“Although we’re not playing anything, we can at least get started because the atmosphere here in Denver is amazing and the second team will be playing with probably the most effort I’m going to experience this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to play it?”
The Nationals have not yet announced who will start on Sunday, but are reportedly clinging to Scherzer in such a situation.
For Scherzer, it would be his 34th start, and he'd be training on Thursday, and he'd be up and running on Sunday, when he's usually off.
Washington's right-hander has a stats 18-7 this season with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 shifts.
Trump Speaks at a Meeting in West Virginia <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
The president indirectly commented on the situation around his candidate for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of Republicans participating in mid-term elections.
“In November, everything we have been able to do will be at stake.
One of the most important choices of our lives has five weeks left to make.
“It’s one of the big, big ones – I don’t run, but we’re still on the move and I’m fighting everywhere for great candidates,” he said.
Trump continued, “You see this monstrous, monstrous group of Democrats, you see that’s happening right now.
And they are determined to take power by any means necessary, you see here the evil, the resilience.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to beat to gain power and control, that's what they want, power and control, we don't give them that."
The Democrats, he said, opted for “resistance and obstruction.”
"And you've seen it in the last four days," he added, saying the Democrats are "angry and evil and disgusting and perverted."
He mentioned on behalf of the oldest member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, which led to a loud public outcry.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you get the document?
Uh, what?
No, uh, no, wait—that was really a bad body speech—the worst body speech I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a diverse stream of opinion.
He is intolerant of those who express their opinions.
When Momenta activists on my local side voted for my reminder, it was no surprise.
After all, I am the last of a number of Labour Members who have said that they are not welcome – because they have honestly expressed their opinion.
My fellow Member of Parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated similarly because she was resolutely anti-Semitic.
In my case, I was criticized for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, on paradoxically similar issues, about which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
In the announcement of the Labour Party’s meeting in Nottingham East on Friday, it said, “We want the meetings to be accessible and productive.”
Most of the eight years I’ve been a local member of parliament for the Labour Party, the GC meetings on Friday night were just like that.
Unfortunately, the majority of meetings do not take place today, and the promise of a “more polite, more polite” policy has long been forgotten, if it ever started.
It is becoming increasingly obvious that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and each opinion is judged as acceptable for the leadership of the party.
It started shortly after Jeremy became the leader. My colleagues, who I had previously thought we had similar political views, suddenly expected me to turn 180 degrees and stand in positions that I would otherwise not agree with – be it one national security issue.
Whenever I speak in public – and it doesn’t matter what I say – there is a tirade on social media that calls for my appeal, denounces the politics of the center and tells me that I shouldn’t be on the Labour side.
And it's not just my experience.
I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments directed at me are usually political.
I have respect for the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face a surge of sexist or racist insults every day, but will never give up.
One of the aspects of this era of politics that I am most disappointed with is how insults become the norm.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should cultivate a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer the diversified flow of opinion, and with every proposal for distrust or a change in the rules of selection, the party becomes more limited.
In the last two years, they have advised me many times to hold back, not so much, and then “I’ll be fine.”
But that's not why I went to politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a school pupil, provoked by the negligence of Margaret Thatcher’s government, which let my general school class literally disintegrate, I have tried to fight for better public services for those ministers or those most in need.
I've never hidden my politics, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been surprised by my political positions and areas in which I disagree with the current leadership.
To those who supported the proposal on Friday, I would only say that when a country breaks into a Brexit that will damage households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
Of course, my main message is not for the moment in Nottingham, but for my voters, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat of revocation or political pragmatism will keep me from acting under all my circumstances.
Chris Leslie is a Member of Parliament for Nottingham East.
Ayr 38 – 17 Melrose: The undefeated Ayr climbs to the top
The two late fives slightly distorted the final result, but there’s no doubt that Ayr deserved to triumph in this amazingly fun Tennent’s Premiership match.
Now they are at the forefront of the table, as the only undefeated.
In the end, it was an excellent defense and a better use of the chances, which helped the home team win, and coach Peter Murchie had the full right to be satisfied.
“We’ve been through big tests in our games and we’re still undefeated, so I have to be happy,” he says.
Robyn Christie of Melrose says: “All the honors to Ayr, they took the chances better than we did.”
The five Grant Andersons in the 14th minute, altered by Frazier Clime, sent Ayr forward, but the yellow card for the Scottish representative Rory Hughes, released by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to take advantage of the numerical dominance and Jason Baggot won unchangingly.
Climo increased Ayr's lead by penalty and then scored exactly in half time and changed the solo attempt, so he adjusted to 17-5 for Ayr.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's five, transformed by Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
Then came a longer delay due to a serious injury to Ruaridha Knott, who left the playground on the carriers, and when he started playing again, Ayr again jumped thanks to five Stafford McDowalls, which he changed to Climo.
Representative captain Ayr Blair Macpherson then received a yellow card and Melrose again used the player thanks to the unchanged fifth Bruce Colvin after a short strong pressure.
The homers, however, returned, and when Struan Hutchinson got yellow for attacking Clima without the ball, MacPherson from the penalty line-up put the ball behind Ayr's progressing foul.
Climo changed, again almost from the start, after Kyle Rowe caught David Armstrong's kick and sent Gregor Henry's wing for the fifth five home runs.
Star Still Game launches a new career in hospitality
It seems that the star of the series Still Game Ford Kieran is moving into the hospitality industry. It turns out that he was appointed the director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 60-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC series, which he writes and plays alongside longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The couple announced that the upcoming ninth series would be the final series of the series, and Kiernan seems to be already planning his life after Craiglang.
According to an extract from the official register, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the report, but a source in the Scottish Sun newspaper suggested that Kiernan wanted to engage in a "prosperous restaurant business" in Glasgow.
"The sea is ours": Inland Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen the way to the Pacific
Sailors are guarding in front of the Navy Command in La Paz, which is decorated with ropes.
Above the public buildings is a blue flag in the color of the ocean.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca for the Amazon are described with the motto: “The sea is ours.
Obtaining it is our duty.”
Throughout Inland Bolivia, there is still a vivid memory of the coastline that the country lost in favor of Chile in the bloody war on resources in the 19th century – as well as the desire to sweep the Pacific Ocean again.
These aspirations are perhaps the biggest in a few decades, as Bolivia is awaiting a decision by the International Court of Justice, which is due to fall on October 1st after five years of probation.
“Bolivia has the energy, the spirit of unity and peace and of course expects a positive outcome,” said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians will follow MSD’s decision on big screens across the country in the hope that the tribunal in The Hague will decide in favor of Bolivia’s claim that, after many decades of interrupted talks, Chile is obliged to negotiate a deal after the coup d’état.
Bolivian President Evo Morales, who is facing a controversial re-election battle next year, is also keen on Monday’s decision.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” he said at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will decide in favor of Bolivia – and even if it did, much would not have changed.
This UN body, based in the Netherlands, has no authority to assign Chilean territory to anyone and has stated that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the MSD decision comes just six months after the latest arguments were heard shows that the case “was not complicated,” says Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean international law expert.
And the last four years have not only not supported the Bolivian cause, but perhaps rather slowed it down.
“The current Bolivian government has taken over the issues of access to the sea,” Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate says.
He adds that Morales’ offensive rhetoric has weakened all remaining goodwill in Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will one day start negotiating again, but after this it will be extremely difficult to hold discussions.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltze, the representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision was unusually fast.
On Monday, it will provide Bolivia with “an exceptional opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile” and a chance “to end 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents – would use the question of the sea as a political blunder.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific,” he added.
“Judgement is an opportunity to find that we need to deal with the past.”
North Korea says there will be no nuclear disarmament unless it is able to trust the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho Says His People Never Disarm Their Nuclear Weapons First If They Can't Trust Washington
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to deliver on the promises made at the summit of the leaders of both rivals in Singapore.
His comment comes after it appears that U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is about to restart nuclear diplomacy, which has been stuck at a dead end for more than three months for a Singapore meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it’s “planning hope” that the ongoing sanctions and US objections to the declaration ending the Korean War could at times bring the North to its knees.
Washington is cautious about agreeing to the declaration unless Pyongyang first takes significant steps to disarm.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is a general skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about abandoning this arsenal, which the country is likely to see as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo wants to visit Pjöngjang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris Shows Show That The Latest Trend Of Huge Head Covers Will Soon Arrive In Your Fashion Stores
If you want to expand your hat collection or completely block the sun, your search is over.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne revealed a series of shattered giant head coverings for their spring/summer 2019 collections at a show that captivated everyone at Paris Fashion Week.
Very impractical hats flooded Instagram this summer and these designers sent their exciting creations to the pier.
The exhibition piece from Valentina was an exaggerated beige hat with a wide edge resembling a feather that flooded the heads of models.
Other oversized accessories were decorated melons, a witch hat, and even pineapple – but they’re not meant to heat the head.
Thom Browne also introduced a selection of bizarre masks – and just in time for Halloween.
Many of the multicolored masks have velvety lips and resemble Hannibal Lecter rather than high fashion.
One creature resembled scuba gear with snorkeling and glasses, while the other looked like a hornet with melted ice cream.
And if you continue with a huge fashion – you’re lucky.
Fashion experts predict that huge caps could even come into fashion stores as well.
The overgrown hats come after "La Bomba", a straw half a meter wide, worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The iconic brand behind this very impractical hat, which flooded social media, sent another huge creation – a straw beach bag that’s almost as big as the model in the swimsuit that wears it – to the parade pier.
At Paris Fashion Week, a dark orange reef bag limped with reef shakes and equipped with a white leather handle was an exhibition piece of the La Riviera spring/summer 2019 collection from Jacques.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect big hats and beach bags to appear in fashion stores next summer – given that the designer had so much success with them, it would be hard to ignore the high demand.”
John Edward: Language skills are a necessity for global citizens
Scottish independent schools have a number of academic successes and this continues in 2018 with other excellent test results. Individual and group successes in sporting, artistic, musical and other community activities only underline this.
These schools have more than 30,000 pupils across Scotland, are represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) and strive to provide their pupils and parents with the best possible level of service.
Independent schools prepare their pupils for further and higher education, the career they have chosen, and their place as global citizens.
As a sector of education that can design and implement individually tailored school education plans, we observe that modern languages are still popular and sought-after subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it goes straight to his head.
If you talk to him in his own language, it goes straight to his heart.”
It is important to note that if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries, we cannot rely solely on English.
The latest results of this year’s exams show that languages are at the top of the charts, with the highest success rate being independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of pupils who learned a foreign language achieved the best A grade.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools show that the highest grade A reached 72 percent of Mandarin students, 72 percent of German students, 69 percent of French students and 63 percent of Spanish students.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages as subjects chosen by students are as important in the study plans of independent and other schools as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics).
A survey conducted by the UK Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 found that 17 per cent of job vacancies are under-skilled due to reasons employers report as problems.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly becoming a necessity in preparing young people for their future careers.
Given that more and more job opportunities require languages, these skills are a necessity in a globalised world. -
No matter what career a person chooses, if he has learned a second language, he will have the real advantage of having such a lifelong skill in the future.
Thanks to the ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries, a person who speaks multiple languages automatically gains an advantage over the competition.
According to a survey conducted by YouGov in 2013 among 4,000 adults in the UK, 75 percent of them were not able to speak a foreign language well enough to conduct a conversation, with a single language spoken by a two-digit 15% French, specifically.
That is why it is important for today’s children to invest in language learning.
If children know more languages, especially the languages of the developing economies, they will be more likely to find meaningful jobs.
In Scotland, each school is different in the way it teaches languages.
A number of schools focus on more classical modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered to be the most important for the UK in the 2020 outlook, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the child is interested in, he will always have at independent schools to choose from several languages with teachers who are experts in the given field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing an educational environment that prepares and equips children with the skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future holds for them.
At the moment, it cannot be denied that languages are essential for the future of the country in a global business environment, so this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should, in fact, be considered “international communication skills.”
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and landmark to young people in Scotland.
We have to do it right.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron will be in San Diego for the first time in a Lakers jersey on Sunday.
Fans looking forward to LeBron James joining the Los Angeles Lakers for the first time are looking forward to it.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday's San Diego pre-season game against the Denver Nuggets.
It is not yet clear how many minutes it will take.
“It will be more than one and less than 48,” Walton said on the official website of the Lakers.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell wrote on Twitter that James is likely to play only a limited number of minutes.
Last week after training, James was asked about his plans for six Lakers games in the preseason.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need pre-season games,” he said.
Trump's performance in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump will launch a wave of campaigning tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of five meetings scheduled for next week, including stops at friendly locations such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
Given the suspension of the vote to confirm his vacant candidate in the Supreme Court, Trump wants to gain support for the upcoming mid-term elections, as Republicans face the risk of losing Congress in the November election.
What time does Trump’s performance begin tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trump’s meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 19:00 Eastern Time, today on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
Trump’s meeting in West Virginia can be watched online below through a live stream to YouTube.
Trump is likely to talk about hearing candidate Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court hearing, which took place this week and was very tense over allegations of sexual misconduct. The Senate confirmation vote is expected to be postponed by a week.
But the main goal of this wave of rallies is to help the Republicans catch up before the November elections.
According to Reuters, Trump’s campaign organizers say the five meetings next week are aimed at “energizing volunteers and supporters so that Republicans can try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and in the House of Commons.”
“Control over the Senate is so important to his agenda that the president will go to as many states as possible in this busy campaign season,” a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
According to West Virginia Metro News, supporters from “Ohia and Pennsylvania” could come to the Wesbanco Arena meeting in Wheeling today and watch the Pittsburgh media.
On Saturday, it will be the second time in the last month that Trump will visit West Virginia, in which he gained more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for the Senate for West Virginia Patrick Morrisey, who is lagging behind in polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morriseye that the president must come to help him in the polls,” West Virginia University political scientist Simon Haeder told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team showed that it has a stomach to fight to keep hope from Sunday's singles
After three one-sided matches, Saturday’s pair may be just what the Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging shuttle is a completely imaginary sporting concept, but the players really believe it, and most of all, at such competitions.
So where's the shuttle going now?
"They've scored six points and now they're four, so we're taking it so the shuttle probably moves a little bit towards us," Spieth said at the end of the day.
Europe, of course, has an advantage, it leads by four points and there are still twelve of them left.
As Spieth says, Americans feel they have a little wind in their sails, and there are a lot of things that can encourage them, such as the form of Spiethe and Justin Thomas, who played together all day long and each can boast three points out of four.
Spieth was fatal in the transition from ignition to green and is an example.
The celebratory screams further strengthened in the continuation of his round, as he managed the key kick to win the whole match, as they were with Thomas after two holes by two in the back.
His putt, who won their 15-hole match, met a similar streak that tells you that the American team is not out yet.
"You really had to go deep and take care of your own game," Spieth said.
That’s all the players left behind.
18 holes to leave a trace.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed main story of the Ryder Cup.
Strange but lovely couples from Europe are four out of four and can’t do anything wrong.
"Moliwood was the only couple that didn't hit the pit on Saturday afternoon, but also passed on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and again on Friday morning."
The course and the way the energy flows both towards the turbulent audience and from him confirms that these are the players destined for Sunday victory, and that until sunset over Le Golf National there will be no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari.
It's best to both at the same time in a different hole.
However, it is still premature to speak of European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson briefly collaborated with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the four-ball morning game, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
The jam and two dabs on the front nine buried Spain and Sweden in a gap from which they no longer climbed.
No one will be able to help you on Sunday.
Two-double-to-two-ball games are so fascinating when you closely monitor the interactions of people in a pair, the advice they give, the advice they don’t give, and the way the strategy can change in a moment.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has made a significant leap forward to the last day, but this game of the two has also shown that the U.S. team has a stomach for the fight that some, especially from the states, have doubted.
To the final day of the Ryder Cup, Europe leads with a score of 10-6 points
Europe will gain a healthy advantage until the last day of the Ryder Cup after coming out of Saturday's doubles game to two balls with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
Inspired by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, who reportedly won nearly twice over rival Tiger Woods, they decided to make four laps at Le Golf National.
The European side with Thomas Bjorn, who decided two years ago to keep the trophy they lost at Hazeltine, dominated in the morning games on two balls with the American side failing in the series 3-1.
The U.S. showed more resistance in four, won two games, but could not get into the deficit.
Jim Furyka needs eight points out of Sunday’s 12 games to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European novice to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, who received the nickname "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are just the second pair to win four points from their four innings in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the two-ball game, they beat tired Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau even more sharply 5&4.
Woods, who ran two games on Saturday, showed occasional flashing brilliance, but now lost 19 of his 29 doubles games to two balls and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, rested after a two-ball game in the morning, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in a doubles game on the 2&1 defeat of Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - the number one and three in the world rankings.
Europe, however, did not have it on this pleasant, fresh day southwest of Paris, won on the whole line.
Triple-league winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas scored two points for the Americans on Saturday.
They won a rough 2&1 victory over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in a two-ball game and later returned to defeat the Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in a doubles game, despite losing the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history, the team returns from a four-point deficit to a two-game, although as a defending side Furyk only needs a referee to win the trophy.
After the second day was the best in two days, it seems that the Sunday counterattack is behind them.
North Korea Says It Doesn't Disarm Unilaterally and Without Confidence
North Korea’s foreign minister said on Saturday that the ongoing U.N. sanctions have deepened its distrust of the United States and that the country will never give up its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho said at his annual general meeting that North Korea had taken “significant measures of goodwill” in the past year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the site of nuclear tests, and promising not to spread nuclear technology and weapons.
“But we do not see a corresponding reaction from the United States,” he said.
“Without trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security and under such circumstances it is not possible to disarm unilaterally.”
While Ri repeated North Korea’s well-known complaints about Washington’s resistance to the “stage” approach to denuclearization, according to which North Korea would be rewarded for each step, his statement seemed so minor that it seemed to be so insignificant in that it did not deny the dream.
Ri mentioned a joint statement made by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the US president and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work on the “denuclearization of the Korean peninsula,” while Trump pledged security.
North Korea is seeking a formal end to the 1950-53 war, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls for the release of tough international sanctions against North Korea.
“The U.S. insists on ‘denuclearization first’ and increases the pressure on sanctions to enforce its goals, and even oppose ‘the declaration of an end to war,’” Ri said.
“The idea that sanctions can bring us to our knees is a dream of people who don’t know anything about us.
The problem, however, is that the ongoing sanctions deepen our distrust.”
Ri did not mention the plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US leader stressed at the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the minister emphasized three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: “If South Korea and not the US were on the side of the denuclearization issue, denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not be in such a pathetic situation.”
However, the tone of Rih’s speech was dramatically different from last year’s when he told the UN General Assembly that North Korea’s missile targeting of U.S. territory was inevitable after the “bad president” Trump called Kim a “missile man” on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened "total destruction" of North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take steps to disarm, but said there was still a lot of work to be done and sanctions must remain in force until Koverne Se.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time frame for it, saying: "If it takes two years, three years or five months - it doesn't matter."
China and Russia say the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures it has taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that “the imposition of Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and without ceasing until we are aware of the complete, definitive, verified denuclearization.”
The Security Council unanimously supports sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an effort to suppress the financing of Pyongyang nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo and Ri met at the UN General Assembly, and Pompeo said he would visit Pjöngjang next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not end well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said progress had been made, only to be declared by North Korea within a few hours that he had made “gangster demands.”
North Korea pledged to meet with Moon this month to dismantle the missile site and also the nuclear complex if the United States takes "appropriate measures".
He said Kim had informed him that the “appropriate measures” he hopes are the security guarantees that Trump has promised in Singapore and is aimed at normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students participate in a course that is designed to teach them enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has led all of its students to sleep more, in an effort to fight the growing culture of macho studies all night long when students are asleep and encouraged with caffeine.
Academics have found that students at the world’s most famous university are often helpless when it comes to the basics of self-care.
The course was designed by Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham Hospital and Women’s Hospital, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after he lectured on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
“At the end, a girl came to me and said, ‘Why are you telling me this only now, in my last year?’
She said no one ever told her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, which was presented for the first time this year, explains students basic information about how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance and improve their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the university’s executive director of health services, said the university decided to introduce a course after finding that the students were really seriously sleepy during the week.
The hourly course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one part is the picture of student colleges where students click on cups with coffee, curtains, tennis and books about the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is affected by lack of sleep and the importance of proper sleep habits.
In other parts, participants are informed about how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
The interactive icon map of the campus then invites participants to think about their daily routines.
“We know that the behavior of students will not change immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know – just as you have a right to know the health effects of smoking cigarettes,” added Professor Czeisler.
A culture of pride in “studying all night” still exists, he added, adding that modern technologies and the ever-increasing pressure on students mean that the problem of sleep deprivation is also growing.
Enough good quality sleep should be a student's "secret weapon" to fight stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said - even so that it doesn't get accumulating, because sleep deprivation switches the brain to starvation mode, so the person is still hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student of chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design a course that took one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to push the entire course.
He hopes that the next step will be to ask all graduate students to complete a similar degree program before entering a competitive institution.
The professor advised students to consider setting the alarm on the time to go to bed, as well as when to wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of “blue light” emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting that can solve your circadian rhythm problem.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga Goal Drops Gerrard's Men
The Rangers suffered another loss when Dolly Mengy's hit confirmed Steven Gerrard's dissatisfaction with a 1-0 loss at Livingston.
The Ibrox side tried to record their first victory from 4 to 1 February triumph at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team only caused Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as a manager to leave his post eight points from leading Ladbrokes Premiership Hearts.
Menga was beaten seven minutes before half time and the Rangers seemed to have no inspiration and determination to settle.
While the Rangers are now dropping to sixth place, Livingston climbs to third and right behind the Hibernian team as opposed to one goal.
And there could be more Rangers problems after line judge Calum Spence had to be treated with a head injury after he was apparently hit by an object from a point of view.
Gerrard made eight changes to his side, which moved around Ayr to the semi-final of the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt went with the same Livi 11, who last week picked up a Hearts point and would be delighted as his well-trained team pushed his opponents at every step.
The Rangers may have controlled the hold, but Livingston did more with the ball on their side.
They were to score just two minutes after Menga first left Scott Pittman on Allan McGregor's goal, but the backup buried his big chance.
Keaghan Jacobs' distant free kick then found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could only try at the back post.
The Rangers took control, but it seemed that in the last third there would be more hope than faith.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt he should have a quarter-hour penalty when he met Steven Lawless, but referee Steven Thomson threw the Colombian challenge off the table.
The Rangers managed to score only two shots in the first half, but former goalkeeper Ibrox Liam Kelly was surprised by the header from Lassana Coulibaly and the short shot from Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi’s opener could have been against the game after 34 minutes, no one can deny that they already deserved the hard work.
The Rangers again failed to deal with the deep Jacobs set.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who was calm and beat Meng to an easy finish.
Gerrard took action at the break and replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, and the exchange had an almost immediate result when the wing slammed into Morelos, but the imposing Kelly stood out of line and the attack was blocked.
But Livingston continued to lure visitors into the game exactly the kind they love when Lithgow and Halkett metalled one long ball after another.
Holt's side could have deepened its lead in the final stages, but McGregor stood up well to block Jacobs before Litgow ran out of the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton had another delayed penalty when he got involved with Jacobs, but Thomson turned away again.
Almanach: The Inventor of Geiger's Meters
And now the page from our almanac "Sunday morning": September 30, 1882, today it is 136 years old, and it is still increasing... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to a device known as a Geiger counter.
The Geiger Counter Science Station also became a permanent pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", starring the seemingly unlikely scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: “What the hell is that?”
Rogers: “It’s a Geiger counter that’s used to locate radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you can really hear the effects of the atoms excreted by radioactivity in the minerals.
Evans: "Well, he's really cracking in it now!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
New Cancer Vaccine May Teach the Immune System to “See” Dangerous Cells
New Cancer Vaccine May Teach the Immune System to “See” Dangerous Cells and Kill Them
Vaccine Teaches the Immune System to Recognize Dangerous Cells as Part of Treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from the patient and their transformation in the laboratory
Then they can "see" the protein, which is common to many cancers, and then inject the needle again
The test vaccine shows promising results in patients with multiple types of cancer.
One woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize dangerous cells, had ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from the patient, their transformation in the laboratory, so they can “see” the protein common in many cancers called HER2 and then be re-applied to the cell.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results suggest that we have developed a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “regulates the growth of several types of cancer,” including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer, explained Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar approach, when immune cells were taken from patients and “learned” to focus on cancer cells, was already being advocated in the treatment of type leukemia.
Kanye West attended a pro-Trump sermon, in his magic hat, after his performance on SNL.
It didn't go too well
Kanye West was cast in the Saturday Night Live studio after a confusing performance during which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run in 2020.
After singing the third song that night, called Ghost Town, in which he wore the make America Great Again cap, he began to spit on the Democrats and reiterated his support for President Trump.
“I often talk to white people and they say, ‘How can you like Trump, he’s a racist?’
“If I had used racism, I wouldn’t have been in America for a long time,” he said.
SNL began a parody show with Matte Damon in the lead role, in which the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on the rape charge of Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, footage of West's theatrical speech was recorded on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock tried to make West laugh.
West also complained to the viewers that his head decoration was nicely eaten in the background.
“I was bullied behind the scenes.
They said, "Don't go there with that hat."
That's disgusting!
They also said I was in the wrong place,” he told the Washington Examiner.
West continued, “You want to see the wrong place?” and added that he would “put on his superman suit because that means you can’t say what to do.” Do you want the world to move forward?
Try love."
His remarks deserved to be heard only by the audience at least twice, and SNL members looked upset, in despair, Variety says, and one person even said, “The whole studio was completely shut down.”
West was invited as a late replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose former friend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West confused many present by singing the song I Love dressed as a bottle of Perrier water.
West received support from TPUSA’s leader, Candace Turner, who tweeted: “To one of the most daring characters: THANK YOU, YOU HAVE BEEN A DAVID.”
But guest talk show Karen Hunter wrote on Twitter that West "was just who he is, and that's absolutely amazing."
“But I don’t want to reward anyone (by buying his music or clothing or supporting his ‘art’) whom I believe represents and sends to the world an ideology that is detrimental to my community.
He's free.
Just like us,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and said he is now "formally known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
A fellow rapper, Snoop Dogg, formerly called Snoop Lion and of course the late musical legend Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then to an artist formerly known as Prince.
Accused of attempted murder in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after a man was killed in a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
The incident occurred in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is due to appear in court in Belfast on Monday.
The indictment is reviewed by the State Prosecutor's Office.
Game Thrones star Kit Harington has fallen into toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow with a sword in the violent medieval fantasy HBO series.
The 31-year-old actor, however, stepped out of the macho hero stereotype and said that such on-screen roles mean that young boys often feel they have to be tough to deserve respect.
The Sunday Times Culture Kit said he believed "something is wrong" and asked how to address the issue of toxic masculinity in the <0x23>MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his 31-year-old Star of the Throne Rose Leslie, has admitted that he is "very strong" about the problem.
“At this moment I personally feel pretty strong – what happened to masculinity?” he said.
“What do we teach teenage men about the problem we see here now?”
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity thanks to its very masculine characters.
He continued: “What is born and what is learned?
What do boys learn on television, on the streets, from them grows the feeling that it is necessary for every man to have such a side?
I think that's really one of the big questions of our time - how to change it?
Because the young man must have changed something for the worse.
In the interview, he also admitted that he will not play in any prequel or sequel to Game of Thrones after the series is finished, as he already has enough "fights and horses".
From November, Kit will play in the remake Right West by Sam Shepard, which is the story of a film producer and his brother, a robber.
The actor recently revealed that meeting his current wife Rose for the best that Game of Thrones has come from.
"I knew my wife when I was filming the show, so he gave me my future family and my whole next life," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the love object of Kit's character Jonah Snow, in this fantasy series awarded an Emmy Award.
The couple married in June 2018 on the grounds of Leslie's family home in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
According to official figures, more than 820,000 people are affected by the virus in the country.
Approximately 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases were transmitted by sex, which meant a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spreads across some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
The number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 each year.
Transmission of HIV through sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is reportedly still widespread.
Given the conservative values of the country, the study estimates that 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases come from insufficient sexual protection during these contacts.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged a universal approach to HIV treatment as part of efforts to address this problem.
Maxine Waters denies that staff would let go of GOP senators’ data, bypassing the terms “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
U.S. Senator Maxine Waters on Saturday condemned allegations that a member of her staff had sent personal data of three Republican U.S. senators to lawmakers' wiki pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed the charges were backed by "ultra-right" scientists and websites.
“Lies, lies, and other degrading lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The released information reportedly included home addresses and phone numbers for U.S. senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared on the Internet on Thursday and was published by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate hearing on charges of sexual abuse by Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred sometime after the three senators interrogated Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState have announced that the IP address that sources the contributions is associated with Waters’ office and has released information about Waters staff members, Hill says.
“This unfounded claim is a totally false and absolute lie,” Waters continued.
“A member of my staff – whose identity, personal information and security were threatened as a result of these fraudulent and false accusations – was in no way responsible for the leakage of this information.
This unfounded claim is a completely untrue and absolute lie.”
Waters's statement quickly earned online criticism, including that of former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is outrageous," Fleischer wrote.
“That means he doesn’t have the temperament to be a member of Congress.”
When someone is accused of something he didn't do, he shouldn't be angry.
He mustn't be resilient.
He must not question the plaintiff's motives.
It has to be calm and not upset.”
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters's reaction to Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was criticized for appearing too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate who contested the election against Waters, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
“If it were true, it would be something,” he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said that her office had alerted “the competent authorities and authorities active in criminal proceedings to these fraudulent claims.
“We will make sure that the perpetrators are exposed,” she continued, “and that they will be legally responsible for all their actions, which are destructive and dangerous to everyone and all members of my staff.”
Johnny English hits reviews again – weaker espionage parody Rowan Atkinson
It is already common to look for Brexit in every new film with a British tendency, which seems to be the case for this resurgence of Johnny English in a series of action parodies - which began in 2003 with Johnny English and was brought back to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will this stubborn satire on the subject of how obviously a bad nation we are, our new export opportunity?
In any case, this outspoken, incompetent Johnny English with a rubber face had his license to repackage this thing in a whole new way – that name more than anything else signaling that it is a broad comic creation designed for a non-English-speaking cinematic audience.
He is, of course, the stupid secret agent who, despite his bizarre demands for smoothie glamour, has a little bit of Inspector Clouseau, a little bit of Mr. Bean, and a big custodian of the man who has won a single tone in the Chariots of Fire at the 2012 Celebration Game Opening.
The character is also originally based on a traveler and an international mystery man, whom Atkinson once played in the forgotten Barclaycard television commercials, and who left behind chaos.
In this last edition, you will find one or two beautiful moments.
I loved Johnny English as he approached the helicopter in medieval armor and the rotor blades briefly galvanized about his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is exposed, but humor feels quite undersized and strangely superfluous, especially when "serious" film brands like 007 and Mission Impossible themselves now offer comedy as a certain component of their production.
Humor is rather intended for children than adults, and for me Johnny English’s crazy trampoline is as inventive and focused as Atkinson’s silent film gays in the person of Mr. Bean.
The persistently current assumption is that the UK is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker infiltrated a British super-secret web network of spies and revealed the identity of all British agents in the field, to intimidate an agent in the service - a little too small a role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last drop for the prime minister, who is a pompous and excited character who is already suffering from a complete collapse of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson plays the character of Theresa May as best as possible, but there is nothing much in the script.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that once every active spy is threatened, she will have to return someone from her retirement to work.
This means that Johnny English himself, who is now employed as a director in some luxury facility, but at the same time gives a record lesson on how to be a secret agent: here are a few nice gags because English offers a spy academy similar to Rock School.
English returned to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and met with his long-suffering ex-partner Bough, played by Ben Miller again.
Bough is now a married man who lives with a submarine commander, an affected character who Vicki Pepperdine might be a bit of a waste of talent.
So Batman and Robin, packed for Her Majesty's Secret Service, are back in action and meet the beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bullet, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously under the spell of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve British computer crimes: the villainous Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey full of fries: masked as waiters set fire to a French restaurant; create chaos when they smuggle on board Volt’s luxury yacht; and English launches pure anarchy when Volt tries to inter-reality with the help of virtual reality.
All the axes are certainly ready for this last sequence, but no matter how kind and stormy they are, they have something in them from the children's TV.
It's a rather moderate thing.
And just like other Johnny English films, I couldn’t help but think: Can the British film industry not give Rowan Atkinson a role that really matches his talent?
Labour denies that they would develop a plan for the British to work four days a week to get paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is considering a radical plan in which the British will work four days a week and get paid for five.
The party reportedly wants the heads of companies to hand over to workers the savings that will result from the use of artificial intelligence (AI).
Employees would enjoy a three-day weekend - but they would still take the same reward.
Sources claim that this idea would “drop” into the party’s economic agenda and plan to tilt the country in favor of workers.
The transition to a four-day working week was approved by the Congress of Trade Unions as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A long-term Labour member told the Sunday Times: “The evaluation of this measure is expected to be announced by the end of the year.
This will not happen overnight, but the four-day working week is a wish that fits into the party's stances to balance the economy in favor of the worker and the party's overall industrial strategy."
The Labour Party will not be the first to support such an idea, the Green Party has pledged a four-day working week during its 2017 general election campaign.
However, this aspiration is currently not approved by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour Party spokesperson said: “The four-day working week is not our party’s policy and the party does not take it into account.”
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used a working conference last week to fulfill his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to return energy from “anonymous directors” and “experts” in utilities.
The shadow chancellor’s plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not have to return to their overall share, because the Labour government could carry out “stripping” on the basis of perceived guilt.
He also confirmed plans to place employees on the boards of directors of companies and create equity funds that will transfer 10% of private company equity to employees who are eligible for annual dividends up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy said on the show “60 Minutes” whether the FBI investigation Kavanaugh could change their mind
The FBI's investigation into charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the last vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least a week, and raises the question of whether the office's findings could spur some Republican senators to pull their support.
In a Sunday's 60 Minutes interview, correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could reveal anything that would change their minds.
Kennedy looked more open-minded than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
“I said I went to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when it happened, when the indictment came out, and he said, "Did you do it?"
He was determined, determined, unequivocal.”
Graham's decision, however, is undeniable.
“I have already made my decision about Brett Kavanaugh, and that would be a really explosive charge,” he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know one thing: Brett strongly denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And none of those she named could verify it.
It's been 36 years.
I don’t see anything change.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and what has it done to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York City will host the annual Global Citizen Festival, which offers a very impressive array of stars and an equally impressive mission to end world poverty.
The Global Citizen Festival will welcome tens of thousands of people who will meet in Central Park to enjoy not only artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the true purpose of the event, which is the end of the 20th century extreme poverty.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is an expansion of the Global Poverty project, an international group to support poverty eradication by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to get a free event ticket (if you weren’t willing to pay for a VIP ticket), visitors had to complete a series of quests or “actions” such as volunteering, e-mail to a world leader, phone call, or other meaningful ways to help raise the stakes.
But how successful was Global Citizen now 12 years before it achieved its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert really in a way that convinces them to demand action, or is it just another case of so-called “clickivism” – people who feel that by signing an online petition or sending a tweet, something will change?
Global Citizen says that since 2011, it has recorded more than 19 million “actions” from its supporters, trying to achieve different goals.
He says these actions have helped world leaders to announce commitments and measures of more than $37 billion that are expected to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group announced 390 commitments and notifications resulting from its activities, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid out or financed.
The group estimates that hedged funds have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Key commitments include the Power of Nutrition project, a UK partnership of investors and contractors committed to “helping children grow to their fullest potential”, promising to provide Rwanda $35 million to help end malnutrition in the region after receiving more than 4,700 cits.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens like you, we can only make a note of social injustice in the form of malnutrition in history,” Power of Nutrition Project Ambassador Tracey Ullman told the crowd during a live concert in London in 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions calling for the U.K. to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for the Power of Nutrition project, which will address 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the most common questions on their website asking, “Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?”
The Global Citizen responded: “It will be a long and hard road – sometimes we fall and fail.
But just like the big civil rights and the anti-apartheid movement, we will succeed in front of us because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are among those performing at this year’s New York City show, which will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. Could Use Navy for ‘Blockade’ to Prevent Russian Energy Exports - Interior Minister
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Washington can resort to the Navy "if necessary" to prevent Russian energy from entering markets including the Middle East, U.S. Interior Minister Ryan Zinke said.
Zinke argued that Russia’s involvement in Syria – especially where it acts on the invitation of a legitimate government – is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
“I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to mediate energy as well as in Eastern Europe, in the southern abdomen of Europe,” he said.
And according to the official statement, there are ways and means to deal with it.
“The United States has the opportunity to work with our navy to ensure that the sea routes are open and, if necessary, blocked to ensure that their energy is not market-oriented,” he said.
Zinke addressed the participants in the event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that is considered to be the “voice of energy consumers” in the United States.
He compared Washington’s approach to negotiations with Russia and Iran, and noted that they are practically the same.
“The economic opportunity for Iran and Russia is more or less an investment in or replacement of fuel,” he said, referring to Russia as a “one-purpose” player with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statement comes because the Trump administration is on a mission to boost exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe and has replaced Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to step down from the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump said had made Berlin a “hostage” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the 11 billion dollar Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which aims to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s ardent opposition to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and is an example of unkind competition.
“I think we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for developing pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after meeting with U.S. Energy Minister Rick Perry in September in Moscow.
The U.S. has raised concerns from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s largest industrial organisation, the German Federation of Industry (BDI), has called on the United States to avoid EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem when the third country interferes in our energy supplies,” Dieter Kempf, head of the German Federation of Industry (BDI), said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren vows to “look closely” at the 2020 presidential candidacy, says Massachusetts Senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that after the midterm election, she is “looking closely” at the presidential nomination.
During a meeting of the council in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering the candidacy.
“It’s time for women to come to Washington and fix our broken government, including the top position of women,” she said.
“After November 6th, I will look closely at the presidential candidacy.”
During the meeting, Warren also mentioned Donald Trump and said that she was “bringing this country in the wrong direction.”
“I fear to the brink of what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren was open in her criticism of Trump and his appointment of Supreme Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren tweeted: “Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote.”
However, a poll released on Thursday showed that most of Warren's voters do not think he should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of “probable” Massachusetts voters said the senator should not run, according to a poll by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent would support the candidacy.
The survey showed greater support for the candidacy of former governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent for the candidacy and 48 percent against it.
Other high-profile Democratic names discussed in the run-up to 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision in January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin mentions PTSD by Track Palin at a meeting with Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26, spent one year in Iraq after being listed in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
“What my own son is going through, what he’s going through after his return, may concern other families who are feeling the consequences of PTSD and some of the injuries our soldiers are going back with,” she told the audience at a meeting with Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest "the elephant in the room" and said of her son and other war veterans that "they come back a little different, they come back in eccentricity, they come back and ask if there is any respect for the things that their fellow soldiers and pilots give, and each member pays her.
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, interfering with reports of domestic violence and possession of weapons intoxicated, said Dan Bennett, a spokesperson for Wasilla Police Department.
18 States, D.C. Supports Call for New Asylum Policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal call for new measures by the U.S. government to deny asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from eighteen states and the Washington District on Friday issued a short report to support asylum seekers and challenge the measure, NBC said.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions case, who filed the American Civil Liberties Organization against federal politics in August, has not been disclosed.
She said her partner "and his sons and gang members" abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
Lawyers from Grace states have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce large numbers of asylum seekers in the United States, as nations facing ubiquitous problems with gangs and domestic violence.
A new U.S. asylum policy has reversed the 2014 appeals Senate decision for immigrants that allowed illegal immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
D.C. Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new measure “ignores decades of state, federal and international law.”
“Federal law requires all asylum applications to be decided on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and such an obstacle violates this principle,” the short friend said.
Lawyers further briefly argued that a policy that denies immigrant entry harms the U.S. economy and says they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and “give the necessary work.”
Attorney General Jeff Sessions has ordered immigration judges not to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence in June, according to a press release.
“The asylum is available to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or because of political opinion,” Sessions said in a June 11 statement.
Asylum has never been aimed at alleviating all the problems – even all the serious problems – that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue attempts in Palo, where the number of victims has already doubled, race in search of survivors with time
For the survivors, the situation was getting worse and worse.
“It’s very tense,” said 35-year-old Risa Kusuma’s mother, who comforted her feverish boy in an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
“Every minute an ambulance will bring in more bodies.
“Clean water is rare.”
Residents have been seen returning to their destroyed homes, picking up through the smudged things and trying to save anything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured and the hospitals, which were destroyed by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, were damaged.
Some injuries, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a fractured spine and shoulder, rested at Palu's Army Hospital, where patients were treated outside due to continued severe subsequent shocks.
Tears filled his eyes as he felt that a violent earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to be saved.
I think I was dragged into the ruins of the wall," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for the wedding.
“I heard my wife calling for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
Maybe they're okay."
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of ‘Smoking’ Propaganda
A week after the official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in the U.S. newspaper that focused on the mutual benefits of trade between the U.S. and China, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday mentioned a China Daily surcharge paid in the Des Moines Register — the state of Iowa’s largest-selling newspapers — after accusing China of trying to interfere in U.S. congressional elections on Nov. 6.
Trump’s accusations that Beijing was trying to interfere in the U.S. election indicated what U.S. officials said Reuters was a new phase of Washington’s escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is customary for foreign governments to advertise in support of trade, Beijing and Washington are currently stuck in an escalating trade war, which is manifested at the level of mutual imports.
China's retaliatory sanctions at the start of the trade war were designed to target exporters in states such as Iowa that supported Trump's Republican side, Chinese and American experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowy, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had hurt U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in a statement in the Des Moines Register on Sunday that China is now doubling this bullying by publishing propaganda ads in our own free press.
“In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the valuable American tradition of free speech and free press by placing paid advertising in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“Unlike in a newspaper stand on the street in Beijing, you’ll find limited dissenting voices and you won’t see any real reflection of the dissenting views that the Chinese might have on China’s worrying economic trajectory,” he said.
He added that "one of the most important Chinese newspapers refused to offer to publish" his article, although he did not say which newspapers.
Republicans Leave Their Voters Before Elections Due to Debate With Kavanaugh, Analysts Warn
As many top Republicans defend the candidate for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who faces several allegations of sexual assault, the analyst warned that during the upcoming midterm elections they will know the response, especially from women.
Emotions around this case have been extremely high and most Republicans on the record already say they want to continue voting.
These things can’t be returned,” said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Maxwell’s University of Syracuse School.
Reeher said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) at the last minute to seek an FBI investigation would suffice to reassure voters.
“Women won’t forget what happened yesterday — they won’t forget it tomorrow, nor will they forget it in November,” Karine Jean-Pierre, chief advisor and spokeswoman for the Progressive Group MoveOn, told a newspaper in D.C.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted “November is approaching!” at a demonstration in the Senate Corridor, where Republicans in charge of the Justice Commission decided to appoint Kavanaugha despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford’s testimony, Mic said.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will break records,” said Stu Rothenberg, an unbiased political analyst.
“People say it was high, it’s true.”
But it could be higher, especially among the hesitant female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, aged 18 to 29, who don’t like the president, but often don’t go to the polls.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony detailing her accusations of sexual assault on the Supreme Court candidate, analysts suggested that if the Republicans confirmed it, there could be opposition.
“It was a mess for the GOP,” Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said earlier this week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about voting on the committee or the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh will sit on the chair, it's also about how the Republicans handled it and how they handled it," said Guy Cecil, director of U.S. priorities, a group that helps to vote for Democrats.
However, Americans seem somewhat divided in opinion, who to trust in the light of Ford and Kavanaugh's testimonies, with a little more sympathy for the second named.
A new YouGov survey showed that 41 percent of respondents believed Ford's testimony, or likely believed it, while 35 percent said they believed Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh was probably or certainly lying during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Under pressure from the Flake FBI, he is currently investigating the charges filed by Ford, as well as at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh had attacked her drunk at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate showed her his genitals at a party during his studies at Yale University in the 1980s.
World Wide Web Inventor Plans to Launch New Internet and Prevent Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that is trying to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that builds on the open source platform of Berners-Lee called Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who people have access to information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the goal of the Inrupt project is "world domination."
"We have to do it now," he said of this startup.
“This is a historic moment.”
The application uses Solid technology, which allows people to create their own “personal online data storage” or POD.
It can include contact lists, to-do lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Disk, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are available in one browser and all at the same time.
What is unique about personal online data storage is that it is entirely up to the user to determine who will have access to what kind of information.
The company calls this “personal empowerment through data.”
According to John Bruce, the purpose of the Inrupt project is to bring resources, processes, and appropriate skills to help the Solid platform be available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform that IBM has purchased, some of the employees working on the project have collaborated on the project and the community of volunteer programmers.
From this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team with Facebook and Google are not talking about introducing a complete change where all their business models are turned upside down overnight.
“We don’t ask for their permission.”
Berners-Lee wrote in a post published Saturday that the mission of the Inrupt project is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that will help protect the integrity and quality of the new website built on the Solid platform.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by founding the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the discussion of net neutrality.
Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic about this next era of the web,” added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of the Spiritual Who Received the Victorian Cross during World War I
Celebrations have taken place a hundred years since the only Anglican Church clergyman won the Victorian Cross as a warrior during the First World War.
Lieutenant-Colonel Bernard Vann won the award on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglis and Lehaucourt.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a gunman, and he never learned that he had won the highest British military award.
His two grandsons revealed a memorial stone to him on Saturday at a party in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his great-grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was “genially symbolic” that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather’s victory.
According to the London Gazette on September 29, 1918, Lt Col Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin with a very dense fog and heavy field artillery fire.
He later made his way to the front line and led the line forward with the "highest courage" before throwing himself into the field of fire and knocking off three separate units.
Lieutenant-Colonel Vanna was killed by a German firefighter on 4 October 1918, just a month before the end of the war.
The 72-year-old Michael Vann said his grandfather’s actions were “something I would never do, but at the same time something that is humiliating.”
Together with his brother Dr. James Vann, after a show led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band, they laid the wreath.
Michael Vann said he was "very honoured to be able to participate in the show," adding that "the bravery of the real hero is manifested by the support that a lot of people will provide."
MMA fans stayed all night to watch Bellator 206, instead getting a pig Peppa
Imagine, you've been waiting all night to watch the haunted Bellator 206, just to be denied the main event.
The San José account contained 13 points, including six on the main card and the live broadcast took place in the UK all night on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for a match with each other, audiences in the UK were amazed when the news turned into a show about Peppa Pig.
Some remained uneasy after waking up until early in the morning because of the match.
One of the fans on Twitter described the change in broadcasting to the children's show as "a certain form of a bad joke."
“According to the government regulation, such content is not appropriate at 6 a.m., and therefore it is necessary to broadcast children’s shows,” said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications at Bellator after being asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa Prussian," yes.
Bellator President Scott Coker said they will work on the program so that audiences in the UK will be involved in the future.
“I think when I think about broadcasting, we can probably handle it,” Cooker said.
“But it’s six o’clock on Sunday morning and we won’t be able to do it until Sunday of our time, Monday of their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when that program changed, there were a lot of texts going back and forth and not all of them were just friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But he wasn't, the government could have done it.
I promise you, it won't happen next time.
We’re reducing it to five games instead of six – as we normally do – and we’ve tried our best to keep our fans’ promise and we didn’t make it.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Previous articleDesert Island Discs: Tom Daley Feels ‘Minority’ for Sexuality
Olympic jumper Tom Daley says he grew up with a sense of inferiority towards everyone because of his sexuality – but that motivated him to pursue success.
The 24-year-old said he didn’t realize until he entered high school that “not everyone is like him.”
On Radio 4’s first Desert Island Disc, featuring Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke out loud about gay rights to give others “hope.”
He also said that the opportunity to become a parent made him less interested in winning the Olympics.
The regular moderator of the long-term show Kirsty Young had several months off due to illness.
Daley, who appeared as a carpenter on Laverne's first show, said he felt "less valuable" than anyone else who grew up with him because "it wasn't socially unacceptable for you to like boys and girls."
He said, “Until now, these feelings of inferiority and otherwise were real things that gave me strength and power to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was “someone,” he said not to disappoint anyone who might find out how his sexuality is.
A double holder of the bronze Olympic medal has become a fighter for the rights of the high-profile LGBT movement and has used his presence at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he called because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without consequences and wanted to give “hope” to others.
The three-time world champion said his love for a man – American film director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 – “has reached the unprepared.”
Daley married a 20-year-old Oscar keeper last year, but said the age difference was never a problem.
“When you experience so much at such a young age – he was at his first Olympics when he was 14 and his father died three years later from cancer – he said it was not easy to find someone at the same age who experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple adopted Robert Ray Black-Daley's son in June, and Daley said that he had "changed his whole point of view".
“If you asked me last year, it would all be like, ‘I want to win a gold medal,’” he said.
“You know, there are bigger things than gold Olympic medals.
"My Olympic medal is Robbie."
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father disagreed with the fact that he was about to die, and the last thing he asked was if they already had tickets to the 2012 London Olympics because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him - you won't be first, Dad," he said.
“I held him by the hand when he stopped breathing and until the moment he stopped breathing and was dead, I finally realized he wasn’t invincible,” he said.
The year Daley participated in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
“I knew I had dreamed of my whole life — jumping in front of our homes at the Olympics, I don’t know how I felt better,” he said.
It also inspired the selection of his first song – Stream by Heather Small – which resonated with him at the start of the Olympics and still evokes a goose skin.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, who was out of shape, ended up on the bench in the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson would reach a record on Sunday when he played 47, a Ryder Cup match, but would have to pay off the form to prevent it from being an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who played at events held every two years at a record low of eighteen, sent captain Jim Furyk at Saturday's fourball and foursomes on the bench.
Instead of being at the center of the event, as was often the case in the U.S., the five-time main winner spent his day alternating between cheerleaders and working on the game in a row that he hoped would fix what bothered him.
This 48-year-old has never been the straightest of drivers, even at the top of his career, so he’s not the ideal choice for the narrow Le Golf National, where a long limbic terrain routinely punishes stray shots.
And if the golf course itself isn’t worrying enough, Mickelson is faced in the ninth Sunday match by British Open champion Francesco Molinarim, who won all four of his matches this week in the team with rookie Tommy Fleetwood.
Had the Americans, who had four points less, started 12 separate swords, avoided a quick start, Mickelson's sword could have turned out to be absolutely essential.
Furyk expressed confidence in his husband and gave nothing else.
“He totally understands the role he played today, he kicked me in the back, put his hand around my shoulders and said he’ll be ready tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He believes so much.
He is a member of the Straw House and in the past he has been so helpful to these teams this week.
I had no idea he was going to play two swords.
I imagined more, but so it evolved and we thought we had to go this way.
He wants to participate, just like everyone else.”
Mickelson beat Nick Fald's record in most of the West Ryder Cup on Sunday.
It could mean the end of his career in the Ryder Cup, which never reached the heights of his individual record.
Mickelson achieved 18 victories, 20 goals and seven draws, although Furyk says his presence has brought certain intangible results to the team.
“He’s funny, he’s sarcastic, he’s funny, he likes to make fun of people and he’s a great companion in the team room,” he explained.
“I think the younger players also enjoyed the fun when they were following him this week, which was fun to watch.
It’s more than just a game.”
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows the great leadership could soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, European captain, from experience, knows that the big lead to the singles of the last days in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable ride.
Dane made his debut at the 1997 match in Valderrama, where the team led by the captain Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but came to the finish line with a close victory of 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“You still have to remember that we had a big jump in Valderrama, as well as in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but only tightly,” Bjorn said, in the picture, after watching the National Golf 10 wins in 2018.
So history and every member of the team showed me that it's not behind us.
You will be bored tomorrow.
Go there and do all the right things.
It's not for you until all the points are on the board.
We have a goal, and that is to try to win the trophy, and that's what we're focusing on.
I said I would focus on 12 players on our side, but we also know what to stand for on the other side – the best players in the world.”
Bjorn, pleased with the way his players behaved on a complex golf course, added: “I would never have done it myself.
There's another animal waiting for us tomorrow.
Tomorrow, individual performances are being prepared and this is too difficult.
It’s great to be out with your partner when it’s going well, but when you’re there to be on your own, your golfer’s capacity is fully tested.
This is the message you have to convey to the players to get the best out of you tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind and he has to go and get the best out of you too.
Unlike Bjorn, opponent Jim Furyk will make sure his players play better as individuals than as partners. Exceptions are Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have earned three points out of four.
Furyk was personally on both sides of these big turns when he was part of the winning team in Brooklyn to then end up as a loser when Europe achieved the "Miracle in Medinah".
“I remember every damn word,” Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 captain, said in a statement, “I remember every damn word he said.
“Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but you would like to start as fast as in Brooklyn, as in Medinah.
When this tempo goes one way, it puts a lot of pressure on those midfield matches.
Accordingly, we set up the composition and make sure the boys feel like you know, like we're supposed to be enchanting tomorrow."
Thomas was tasked with trying to counterattack and confront Rory McIlroy in a top match with the players: Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, who are the other Europeans in the top half of the order.
“I went with that group of guys in this order because I think it covers the whole journey,” Bjorn said of his selection of singles.
German New Warship Delayed Again <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
The latest German naval frigate was recognized in 2014 to replace the aging warships of the Cold War era, but will not be available for at least another year due to faulty systems and a snowy coastline, local media reported.
The launch of the "Rheinland-Pfalz" ship's leader, the all-new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigate, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit, a spokesman for the army.
The ship was to become part of the navy in 2014, but the challenging post-delivery problems have upset the fate of this ambitious project.
Four vessels of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, which the Navy ordered in 2007, will serve as a replacement for the aging Bremen-class frigates.
It is clear that they will be equipped with a powerful artillery, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-submarine ballistic missiles, and certain hidden technologies such as reduced radar and infrared and acoustic elements.
Other important features include long maintenance times – it should be possible to deploy the latest frigates for up to two years outside the home port.
The constant delays, however, mean that the top naval vessels – which were supposed to allow Germany to send forces overseas – will be outdated by the time of commissioning, notes Die Zeit.
The famed F125 frigate was in the news last year when the German Navy officially refused to put the vessel into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had returned the ship to the manufacturers after the surrender.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but the German media cited a number of key "software errors and defects in metal elements" defects, which would render the warship unusable when deployed in combat.
The software failures were particularly significant, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ship would be operated by a crew of some 120 sailors – half of the workers needed on the Bremen-class frigates.
It has also been shown to be significantly overweight, which reduces its performance and limits the ability of the Navy to add future innovations.
It is believed that the 7,000-ton Rhineland-Palatinate will be twice as heavy as the class ships used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to defects in metal elements, the price of the entire project – including the training of the crew – is also a problem.
It is said that out of the original 2.2 billion euros, the price rose to a dizzying 3.1 billion euros.
Problems with the latest frigates have gained importance especially in the light of recent warnings that German naval power is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the defence committee of the German parliament, confirmed that the navy is indeed "coming ships capable of deployment."
This representative stated that the problems were being continuously packed because the old ships were discontinued, but no replacements were provided.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates were able to become part of naval equipment.
The National Trust Listens to the Secret Life of Butterflies
A new research is underway at the butterfly settlement in the Scottish Highlands to uncover how butterflies use the landscape to hunt food.
There is hope that the findings of the research will shed new light on the behavior of unique flying mammals and help guide future activities to preserve this species.
The study, conducted by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland association, will look at the minnows and the smallest and brown long and watery bats in the botanical garden of Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in the key areas of this butterfly settlement, which will monitor the activities of the butterflies throughout the year.
NHS employees and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
Professional sound analysis of all recordings determines the frequency of call of bats and what the individual species do.
Subsequently, a map of the habitat and a report will be published that will create a detailed landscape image of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a natural resource conservation consultant for the NTS, hopes that the results will show which habitat areas are most important for bats and how they are used by individual species.
This information will help to identify the benefits of habitat management work, such as meadow production, and best practice in maintaining forested areas for bats and other related species.
Bird populations in Scotland and all of Great Britain have been declining to a great extent in the last century.
They are endangered due to the construction and territorial development that affect colonies and the natural environment.
Wind turbines and lighting, as well as flies traps and chemical treatment of building materials and cat attacks, can also pose a risk.
The butterflies are not blind.
Because they hunt at night, however, their ears are more useful in hunting prey than their eyes.
They use an ingenious echo-location technique to trigger snails and obstacles in flight.
The NTS, responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 major gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, takes bats very seriously.
He has trained specialists who regularly conduct surveys, colonies checks, and sometimes rescue work.
The organization has even set up the first and only reserved butterfly reservation at Thrave in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland’s ten species of butterflies.
The manager of David Thompson’s headquarters says that this is the ideal territory for them.
“We have a great area here at Thrave for bats,” he said.
“We have old buildings, lots of ancient trees and the best habitat.
But there’s still too much we don’t know about bats, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us better understand what they need to survive.”
It underlines the importance of controlling bats before starting maintenance work on real estate, as it is possible that the unconscious destruction of one maternal nest can kill up to 400 females and young, which can destroy the entire local population.
Bats are protections and it is illegal to kill them, harass, disrupt or destroy their colonies.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish representative of the Bat Conservation Trust, encourages the public to join hands and help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and a lot of species that we don't know how to cope with their populations."
Ronaldo rejects rape charges and his lawyers are going to sue the German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo called the allegations of rape "fake news" and said people "want to make themselves visible" by using his name.
His lawyers are going to sue the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which reported on the allegations.
This Portuguese and Juventus attacker was accused of raping American Kathryn Mayorgy in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He allegedly later paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the case, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
A few hours after the release of the indictment, 33-year-old Ronaldo spoke to his 142 million followers in a live video on Instagram and described the information as “fake news.”
“No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news," the five-time Golden Ball award holder said to the camera.
“They want to live on my behalf.
That's normal.
They want to be famous when they say my name, but that's part of their job.
I'm happy and I'm fine," said the player with a smile.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo’s lawyers are going to sue Der Spiegel for unfounded accusations that they described as “inadmissible notifications of suspicions in the private sector.”
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for "moral damages in the amount of the corresponding seriousness of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent times."
The incident was reported to have occurred in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Las Vegas casino suites.
After meeting at the nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the game, where she was allegedly raped anal, according to a file filed in the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo dubbed him after the alleged incident and told her that he was "99 percent" a "crazy" and "one percent" a "disappointed" one.
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that he paid for sex, but that he was consensual.
Mayorga also stated that she went to the police and allowed her to take pictures of her injuries in the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was "afraid of revenge" and feared "public humiliation".
A 34-year-old woman claims she is now seeking remand because she is still traumatized by the alleged incident.
At the time of the accusation of attack, Ronaldo took steps from moving to Real Madrid from Manchester United and this summer bought it for 100 million euros by the famous Italian club Juve.
Brexit: Britain will forever regret the loss of automakers
The UK will "forever regret" if it loses its status as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, said Greg Clark, the UK's secretary of state.
He added that it was “concerning” that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at the Burnaston plant near Derby.
"A deal is necessary," Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of delays at the borders if a Brexit deal is not concluded could become jobs.
At the plant in Burnaston, where Toyota’s Auris and Avensis cars are produced, they produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to other EU countries.
“My view is that if Britain suddenly left the EU at the end of March, we would see a stop at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, CEO of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other automakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover in the UK, are spreading fears of leaving the EU without a deal in terms of the operation of cross-border trade.
BMW, for example, says it will close its production plant in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concerns relate to what manufacturers point to as risks to the supply chain in the case of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line is in operation on the basis of "just in time" deliveries, with parts delivered from suppliers in the UK and the EU for custom-made cars within 37 minutes.
If the UK left the EU on March 29 without a deal, there could be a border disruption, which the industry says could lead to delays and a lack of spare parts.
Toyota could not have more than one day in stock at the Derbyshire plant, the company said, resulting in a downturn in production.
Mr Clark said Theresa May's plans to revive future relations with the EU were "precisely calibrated to prevent these border checks."
"We need an agreement. We want to have the best deal that will allow, as I say, not only the current success, but also the capture of this opportunity," he said on BBC Radio 4's Today.
“The proof not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers is that we need to be absolutely able to continue what is a highly successful supply chain set.”
Toyota has not been able to say how long the production will be halted, but in the long run it warns that the additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately be at the expense of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years and is the chairman of the trade unions at the race, said that the trade unions are increasingly concerned: “I have experience that once these places disappear, they will never return.
A spokesman for the government said: “We have put in place a precise and reliable plan for our future relations with the EU.”
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, White House says
Donald Trump’s high-level meeting with acting attorney general Rod Rosenstein could be “deferred next week” as the fight for the post of supreme judge with Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Robert Mueller’s special council, which examines interference in the Russian elections, links between Trump’s supporters and Russia, and possible judicial obstructions by the president.
No matter how Trump dismisses the deputy general and threatens Mueller’s independence, Washington’s clutches have been saturated for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing wearing a camera to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of including the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
Last Monday, however, he arrived at the White House surrounded by news that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was at the United Nations headquarters in New York at the time, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said he would not have “preferred” to let Rosenstein go, but then the meeting was delayed so as not to interfere with a hearing in the Senate Judiciary Committee, where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christ Blasphemy.
On Friday, Trump ordered a weekly FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh, delaying the full Senate vote again.
Trump’s spokeswoman, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “The date has not yet been set, it may be this week, it may be necessary to move another week in view of everything else that is going on in the Supreme Court.
But we will see and I will always communicate up-to-date information to the media."
Some reporters disagree with this claim: Sanders has not held a press conference with the White House since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that too few press conferences were not caused by aversion to the “theatre” of television reporters, even though she said: “I disagree with the fact that he will perform.”
She then suggested that the number of direct contacts between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president holds more sessions with questions and answers than any president before him," she added, without giving any evidence. "We were looking at those numbers."
The conference will continue, Sanders said, but “if the press had the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, it would undoubtedly be better than having conversations with me.
We are trying it and you have seen that we have been doing it in the last few weeks and that there will be a press conference where you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly receives inquiries when he leaves the White House or attends open sessions or press conferences with visiting high-ranking officials.
Separate press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president probably showed why with his relaxed and sometimes bizarre appearance in front of assembled reporters.
Health Minister writes to EU workers in NHS Scotland not to be afraid of Brexit
The Minister of Health wrote to EU employees working at the Scottish NHS to express their gratitude and wish that they would remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman's SME sent a letter not six months before Britain left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already pledged to settle the costs of applying for the status of settlement of EU citizens who work in the transferred public services.
In her letter, Freeman said: “Over the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on a resignation are continuing, and they are heading towards the expected decisions this fall.
However, the UK government is also taking steps to prepare for a possible no-deal withdrawal scenario.
I know this must be a very disturbing time for all of you.
Therefore, I would like to reassure you once again how much I appreciate the contribution of each member of staff, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services and are beneficial to patients and the communities to whom we provide services.
Scotland is absolutely your home and it is our heartfelt wish that you stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after a head injury
The outspoken Tennessee Tigers defender Christion Abercrombie has given up emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in Saturday's 31-27 defeat from rival Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessee's Mike Organ said.
Tennessee head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before half-time.
“He came to the sideline and just collapsed there,” Reed said.
Coaches and health professionals put Abercrombie on the sidelines and then put him on the carrier and prepared for further assessment.
A Tennessee state official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had submitted surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "no details of the type/range of injury" are yet available and that the state of Tennessee is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, second in the red shirt, graduated the first season for the state of Tennessee after moving from Illinois.
Before the end of the game on Saturday, he had five total operations, which means a total of 18 operations per season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher property tax when buying real estate in the UK.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher property tax when they buy property in the UK, and the money will be used to help the homeless under the new Tory plans.
This action will neutralize the success of Corbyn’s move to attract young voters.
The increase in the liability of the higher property tax will be payable to persons who do not pay the tax in the UK
The state treasury is expected to increase by <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year – to help homeless people
Buyers from abroad will pay a higher tax on the purchase of real estate when they buy a property in the UK, and the money will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May announced today.
This act will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s pull to attract young voters with pledges to provide affordable accommodation and focus on high-income people.
The increase in property purchase tax will affect individuals and businesses that do not pay taxes in the UK, with the money additionally boosting the government’s efforts to fight sleepless overhead.
The surcharge, which is in addition to the current obligation to pay property purchase tax, including the higher levels introduced two years ago for other homes and the purchase for rental purposes, may reach up to three percent.
The state treasury is expected to raise funds by up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year.
Estimates say that newly built properties in London are being purchased by 13 percent of non-residents in the UK, excluding prices and making it difficult for first-time buyers to get to the home rankings.
Many of the country’s rich areas – especially in the capital – have become “spirit cities” precisely because of the high number of buyers from abroad who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new rules came just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a cut in property purchase tax to help more young people build their own first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping property prices high by occupying land but not using it, and urged Ms. May to withdraw quotas from affordable homes to fix the “unfamiliar home” in Britain.
Mr Corbyn announced the appeal of a number of proposed housing reforms, including the management of rentals and the end of "unnecessary" emigration.
It also wants to increase the powers of committees to build new homes.
May said: “Last year I said I wanted to devote my efforts as a prime minister to the restoration of the British dream – that every new generation would have a better life.
And that means fixing our damaged real estate market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and shape life here.
However, it cannot be right to make it easy for entities that do not live in the UK and for foreign companies to be able to buy houses as well as hard-working residents of the UK.
For many people, the dream of their own home is too far away, and the sleepover without a roof over their heads is too real.”
Jack Ross: 'My highest ambition is to drive Scotland'
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his “highest ambition” is to become Scotland’s manager at some point.
The 42-year-old Scott enjoys the challenge of restoring the northeastern club, which currently holds the third position in the Premier League, just three degrees below its peak.
This summer he moved to the Stadium of Light after last season St Mirren brought back the Scottish Premiership.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B rating and that was it," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
“But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my dad when I was a kid, and that’s always something that draws me back.
But this opportunity would only come if I was successful in leading the club."
Ross' predecessors in the role of Sunderland managers were: Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former head of Alloa Athletic says he felt no anxiety over the succession of such established names in such a large club when he had previously rejected the prejudices of Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“Success for me at the time would be the question of whether I can get this club back into the Premier League.
Because of the structure and equipment at this club, it is undoubtedly part of the Premier League," he said.
“It’s not an easy task to get him back there, but I think I’d be successful if I could only get the club back there.”
Ross has only been in management for three years, previously served as assistant manager at Dumarton and spent 15 months as a Hearts coach.
He then helped Alloa recover from his downfall into the third group and transformed St Mirren from a starting downfall to a champions title winner the following season.
And Ross says he feels much better now than he ever had in his career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"They were probably real intersections," he recalls from the time Allo was taken.
“I really believed that leadership was the right thing for me, more than playing.
It sounds strange, because I was good, well earned by it, and enjoyed the appropriate heights.
But playing can be challenging.
There are a lot of things you have to go through every week.
I still go through them from the point of view of the stress and pressure of the work, but in leadership I just feel good.
I’ve always wanted to be a manager and now I’m doing it, I feel like I feel the most in my adult life right now.”

Research has found that a great time on the pint is on Saturday at 5:30 p.m.
The summer wave led to an increase in revenues for British pubs struggling, but increased pressure on the chain of restaurants.
The figures show that groups of pubs and bars saw sales increase by 2.7 percent in July – but restaurant revenues fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin of CGA Consulting, who produced the final reports, said: “The stable sunshine and longer-than-expected participation of England in the World Cup meant that July followed a similar pattern to the previous July, when more than 2 percent were restored, while the number of visitors increased.
The 1.8 percent decline in restaurant sales in June deteriorated further in July.
The pubs and bars that attract drinks have so far behaved the strongest in the same way as the restaurants have deteriorated.
The hosts, whose main revenue is from food, also suffered from the sun, albeit not as dramatically as the restaurant operators.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
Between controlled values and bars, beverage sales rose by 6.6 per cent for the month, while food sales fell by three per cent.
Paul Newman, an analyst at Leisure and Hospitality, said: “These results are a continuation of the trend that has been going on since the end of April.
Weather and the impact of significant social or sporting events are the biggest factors when it comes to sales outside the domestic market.
It’s no surprise that restaurant chains continue to struggle, although the annual drop in sales by 4.8 percent will be particularly painful in the light of the ongoing cost pressures.
Long hot summers can’t be a worse time for food-loving business operators, and time will tell whether the milder temperatures we experienced in August will bring so much needed relief.”
Total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including the newly opened, stood at 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in brand presentation.
The Coffer Peach Tracker industry sales monitor for the UK pubs, bars and restaurants sector collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups with a combined turnover of over <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion, which is an established industry standard in the industry.
One in five children has a secret social media account that they hide from their parents.
One in five children – only 11 years old – has a secret social media account that hides from parents and educators, research shows
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed an increase in “fake Instagram pages”
Reports have raised concerns that sexual content is being published
Twenty percent of pupils say they have a "main" account that their parents know about
One in five children – at the age of just 11 – create accounts on social media that they hide from their parents.
A survey of 20,000 high school pupils showed a rapid rise in “fake Instagram accounts” where photos are shared.
Reports point to concerns that sexual content is being published.
Twenty percent of pupils said they have a "main" account that their parents know about, and at the same time they have a private account.
One mother, who ran into her 13-year-old daughter’s secret website, found that her teenager was inviting others to “rape her.”
Research conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) association of independent schools has shown that 40 percent of 11- to 18-year-old students have two profiles, with half admitting to owning private accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: “It’s worrying that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where their parents and educators can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" in the Scottish Athletic Committee
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Committee as non-executive director at the Annual General Meeting of the Steering Committee.
Doyle is the most acclaimed lightweight athlete and President Ian Beattie has described the move as a great opportunity for those who are in the lead of sports such as those who will benefit from her far-reaching international experience over the past decade.
"Eilidh has extensive respect in the Scottish, British and world athletic community and we are sure it will be very beneficial for athletics in Scotland to be a member of the committee," Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I’m excited to be the voice of the athletes and I hope I’ll be really helpful and help lead the sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won the Olympic Games in Atlanta in 1996 at the 200 and 400 metres, won a total of four gold medals and is now a regular BBC expert, unable to walk after a transient ischemic attack.
He tweeted: “I had an attack a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors said that only time will tell if I'm recovering or to what extent.
It's exhausting, but I've been able to fully recover, learn to walk again, and I'm doing exercise today!
Thank you for all the encouraging messages!”
Milk slurry causing mother-to-cow comparison divides opinions online
The vacuum cleaner manufacturing company has shared online opinion with advertising that compares nursing mothers to nursing cows.
As part of the launch of “the world’s first silent wearable vacuum cleaner,” the consumer technology company Envi has released a music video with an overlay showing the freedom the new vacuum cleaner gives nursing mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of ducks with cows for a song with the lyrics: "Yes, I am impressed, but you can't see any tail" and "If you haven't noticed that I don't have wigs, they're here my breasts."
The choir continues: "Pump, pump, I feed the children, pump, pump, I feed my sweet milk."
However, the advertisement, which was posted on the company’s Facebook page, sparked online controversy.
The video had 77,000 views and hundreds of comments and received mixed reactions from those who saw it, with many of them saying it sheds light on the dairy industry’s “horror.”
“A very poor decision to abuse cows for advertising this product.
Like us, they have to be pregnant and give birth to breast milk, but their babies are taken away a few days after giving birth,” says one of the comments.
Elvie vacuum cleaner discreetly implants on breastfeeding (Elvie/mother)
Another comment: “Understandably traumatic for both mother and child.
But yes, why not use them to advertise on the breast pump for the mothers who leave their children?"
Someone else added, “This advertisement is completely out of the question.”
There was also the one who defended the advertisement, with one woman admitting that she considered the song "contagious".
“I think it’s a brilliant idea.
I'd get the pump if I'd still sneeze.
When I suck, I feel like a cow.
Advertising is a little crazy, but it's about it.
It's a brilliant product," one user wrote.
Another added: “It’s a fun advertisement aimed at mothers who suck milk (often at work or on the toilet) and feel like ‘cows’.
It is not an advertisement that should praise or damn the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women shows that they are all dancing with discreet vacuum cleaners hidden under the bra.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the notion that many women who suck milk say they feel like cows.
However, the vacuum cleaner Elvie is completely quiet, has no wires or hoses and hides beautifully in the breastfeeding bra, so it gives women freedom of movement, the ability to hold the baby and even walk while sucking.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD for mothers, added: “The Elvie vacuum cleaner is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a significant and provocative launch.
By creating a parallel between lactating mothers and lactating cows, we wanted to point out the suckling of milk and all the challenges associated with it, while showing a fun and reliable sense of freedom that the new sucker will ensure.
This isn't the first time that Elvie's vacuum cleaner has come to the rescue.
During London Fashion Week, one of the two mothers of designer Marta Jakubowski appeared at the mill, who was just using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of detained children of migrants has risen sharply despite the fact that monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, especially because the harsh rhetoric and principles put in place by the Trump administration have made it difficult to place children with escorts.
Most escorts were traditionally made up of undocumented immigrants who were afraid of endangering the possibility of staying in the country, so they claimed to belong to the child.
The risk rose in June, when the federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households must provide fingerprints and that this data will be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at the Immigration and Customs Department, testified through Congress that the agency had arrested hundreds of people who applied for the escort status of single minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested did not have previous criminal records.
Up to 80 percent of people who are sponsors or members of the household of sponsors are illegal in our country, and a large number of them are criminals.
So we continue to pursue them," said Mr. Albence.
According to the staff of the asylum facility, representatives in an effort to deal with issues about children more quickly have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear before the court within a month of detention, instead of the previous standard 60 days.
A lot will appear through a video conference call rather than in person to declare their case as a legal status for an immigration judge.
Those who are not eligible for help will be quickly deported.
The longer the child is in custody, the more likely it is to develop anxiety or depression, which can lead to bursts of anger or attempts to escape, say asylum workers and report reports from the system over the past few months.
Lawyers say these concerns are heightened in a larger facility, such as the Tornillo, where signs of a child being bored are more likely to be unnoticed, precisely because of the size of the device.
They added that moving children to a camp without enough time for emotional preparation or goodbye to friends could cause trauma that many children are already struggling with.
Syria has announced that the US, French and Turkish “occupation components” should be withdrawn immediately
During a speech at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called for Syrian refugees to return home, even though the country’s eighth year of war is underway.
Moualem, who is also a deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces are illegal in Syrian territory, under the pretext of fighting terrorism and that "it will be handled accordingly."
"They must give up immediately and unconditionally," he said at the meeting.
Moualem insisted that “the war on terrorism in Syria is almost over,” with more than 360,000 people dead and millions more missing from their homes since 2011.
He said Damascus would continue to “fight in this holy battle until we liberate all Syrian territory” from terrorist groups and “any illegally present foreigners.”
The United States has some 2,000 troops in Syria, mostly training Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs fighting President Bashar al-Assad and advising them.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the territory of war-torn countries.
At the time of the release of the refugees, Moualem said conditions of return were good for them and accused “some Western countries” of “spreading irrational fears” that caused the refugees not to return.
“We have called on international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns,” he said.
“They’re politicizing what should be purely a humanitarian matter.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that no recovery aid will be available to Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a protection zone in the last Idlib refuge has created an opportunity to move further in political discussions.
The Russo-Turkish deal prevented a major attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, where three million people live.
Moualem, however, pointed out that the deal has "clearly given deadlines" and expressed hope that the military intervention will be aimed at jihadists including Nusra Front fighters linked to al-Qaeda who "will be exterminated."
U.N. envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes that the first meeting of a new committee consisting of members of the government and opposition will be held soon to propose a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set the conditions for the Syrian government’s participation in the committee, saying that the panel’s work should be limited “to checking the articles of the existing constitution” and issued a warning before taking action.
Why Trump will win in the second half
According to this logic, Donald Trump would also win the next election in 2020, if, as many liberal observers hope, the accusations and scandals did not prematurely end his inauguration as president.
In that case, it would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic finale of the presidential period in history!”
So far, there are no signs of fatigue in the follow-up.
Since 2014, the main broadcast time has more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average viewership of 2.4 million in the main broadcast time, which is an increase from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen and The Rachel Maddow Show on MSNBC, which increased the viewership on cable television to 3.5 million viewers from the main night TV shows.
“It’s a heat that attracts people because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Baer, the host of Designated Survivor’s ABC drama about a cabinet secretary who became president after the Capitol bombed the attack.
Nell Scovel, an experienced comedy author and the show "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club," has a different theory.
He remembers driving a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he was going to vote for Trump.
Why? she asked.
"He said, 'Because he's funny, 'Mrs. Scovel told me.
It's the importance of entertainment in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the story set in of Washington could predict the future of Roe v. Wada, whether immigrant families can reunite and benefit the global economy.
Layout is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet it goes beyond whether you’re an informed citizen when you watch a panel of experts for six hours discussing how Bob Woodward uses “deep backup” resources for his book “Fear,” pranks the “Don’t Let Me” by “Daniel Manafort’s” fur coat and “Don’t” by “Daniel Manafort’s” fur coats at $15,000 worth of “Storble.”
I'm not going to look at Super Maria again the same way.
“Part of what it does and what makes the reality show feel like is that it feeds you something every night,” said Brent Montgomery, chief executive officer of Wheelhouse Entertainment and author of the documentary Pawn Stars about N.F.L. Trump’s spin-off show in which he credits Kim Jong-un.

Money flows from the outside to the tightest domestic races of the medium-term elections
It’s no surprise that Pennsylvania’s 17th district is experiencing an influx of funding thanks to the reorganization of congressional districts that generated two office holders fighting for the same chair.
This recently led to the transformation of Pittsburgh’s suburban district by Democratic Republican Conor Lamb—who won another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb opposes another official, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents the old 12th District of Pennsylvania, which is heavily overlapping with the new 17.
After the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally divided in favor of the Republicans, the maps were distorted.
The race in the new 17th district triggered a sharp financial split between the main party's financial branches, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb's name became known in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in the March special election to the 18th congressional district.
This chair has been occupied by a Republican for more than a decade and Donald Trump has won the district by 20 points.
Politicians are giving Democrats a small step forward.
U.S. Considers Punishing El Salvador for Supporting China, Subsequently Resigns
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing under mild pressure from Washington.
President Trump had a friendly meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and was staying at a hotel in Panama until the partners judicially removed Trump’s organizational team leadership.
U.S. foreign ministry officials have decided to revoke the U.S. diplomatic mission from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the basis of “recent decisions not to further recognize Taiwan,” Ministry spokeswoman Heather Nauertov<0xC3><0xA1> said in a statement.
But the fines were considered only against Salvador, who received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including funds for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed fines, which included shortening financial aid and aimed at limiting visas, would be painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and number of murders.
With continued internal negotiations, North American and Central American leaders have postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity, following similar negotiations from the previous year, which were seen as a step forward by the US in its efforts to prevent migrants.
But by mid-September, senior administration officials have made it clear that they want to continue negotiations and effectively complete any proposed sanctions on El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now tasked with resolving the conference currently scheduled for mid-October, as part of a signal that the administration is putting on negotiations, diplomats said.
And three U.S. ambassadors quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without having any new unbroken news from Washington.
White House spokesman Mr Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal negotiations on the conditions of anonymity.
Their sources have been confirmed by an external analyst, who is close to the government executive and also spoke on condition of anonymity.
History of studies
The final nail in the coffin could be Robert Mueller’s report from the Special Committee on the possible detention of Mr. Trump in the enforcement of the law, of which there is now a lot of evidence in the public records.
Mr. Mueller is also reportedly turning to whether Mr. Trump’s campaign did not contain a secret deal with Russia regarding the attack on our elections.
If there was an exchange of parties in Congress, Mr. Trump would have to apply for responsibility in front of this body, just as he is preparing to appear before the voters again, and in the end a jury of his colleagues would probably be waiting for him.
That’s a whole series of “ifs” and I don’t want to argue that Mr. Trump’s fall is inevitable – just as it is with similar politicians in Europe.
Each of us on both sides of the Atlantic has a choice ahead of us that will affect how long the suffering will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to stage a coup against Hitler, all it took was for the Western powers to stand up and support him in Munich, Czechoslovakia.
We wandered and missed the opportunity to avoid the long years of bloodshed that followed.
History revolves around such critical moments that speed up or slow down the impenetrable course of democracy.
Americans are now facing a number of similar critical moments.
What do we do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, here the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein had been pushing this since the report announced last year that he had secretly proposed to record the president and speculated that he was not in a health condition to hold the presidential office.
According to Mr. Rosenstein, the Times versions are inaccurate.
“How will we respond if Brett Kavanaugh’s newly requested investigation is not complete or fair – or what if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite a compelling charge of sexual assault and false testimony?
And most importantly, will we vote in the middle of the term for Congress to assign responsibility to Mr. Trump?
If we fail in these tests, democracy will wait for a long dark night.
But I don't think we're going to heal, thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy home.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later, on Saturday, she sent me to light candles on a table with a swastika.
How could I not be optimistic about our future with such a legacy?”

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers is optimistic about the clash with Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday with the knowledge that the victory over Raku<0xC5><0xA1>ana would give them great hope for the G-League move earlier this month after an impressive draw in Spain at Villarreal.
The knee injury prevented back-up Graham Dorrans from appearing on the pitch for the first time in the season until a 2–2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use the result as a reflective bridge to bigger things.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal has a good team," said the 31-year-old.
“We went into a game with the belief that we could pull something out, and we took the point.
Maybe we could have reproduced it in the end, but overall, the remise was probably fair.
They were probably better in the first half, but in the second half we improved and we were better again.
It will be another big European night on Thursday.
I hope we get three points, but it's going to be tough because they paid a good result in the last game, but with the spectators behind us, I'm sure we can push and it's going to work out well.
“Last year was pretty tough, with all my injuries and changes at the club, but now I feel really good about it.
The team is strong and the guys are really enjoying it, the training is also great.
I hope we can stand up to it now, put last season behind us, and we will be successful.”
Women Are Worried About Retirement Savings
Although the survey participants had a clear idea of how to take care of them, few people spoke to family members about it.
About half of the people in the nationwide study said they discussed the price of long-term care with their partner.
Only 10 percent said they talked about it with their children.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t decide to discuss it with him,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of national life insurance.
You can start like this.
Talk to your partner and children: You can’t prepare your family for care unless you reveal your wishes to them in advance.
Together with your counselor and family, discuss where and how to receive care, as these factors can play a big role in determining the price.
Invite your financial advisor: A consultant can help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
Long-term care can be financed, for example, by using traditional long-term care insurance, hybrid cash life insurance that will help you pay for these expenses, or by using your own insurance using your own funds – as long as you have the money.
Create your own legal documents: Prevent legal battles as long as possible.
Determine a health care representative, which will be a trusted person who will oversee your medical care and ensure that doctors will comply with your wishes if you are not able to communicate on your own.
Also consider writing full power for your finances.
You will choose a trusted person who will make a financial decision for you and ensure that your accounts are paid in case you are not eligible for it yourself.
Don’t forget the small details: Imagine that your old parent necessarily needs a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about his medications and allergies?
Write out these details in a written plan to be ready.
“It’s not just finance, it’s what the doctors are called,” Martin asks.
“Where are the medications?
Who will take care of the dog?
Have that plan ready at hand.’
A man in Ilfracombe was shot several times in the air.
When the man returned home on foot after a night shift, several shots from the airframe struck him.
The 40-year-old victim was found in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when she was shot in the chest, abdomen and arm.
Police described the shooting, which took place around 2:30 BST, as a “random act.”
The victim of the attacker did not count.
The victim's injuries are not life-threatening, and the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died in a severe earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials say the death toll is expected to rise further.
Because the communications are off-line, the auxiliary units were unable to obtain any information from the Donggala Regency, which is an area north of Pal, which is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-degree earthquake.
After the disaster, more than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu.
Here are some key facts about the city of Palu and the regency of Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi and its population was estimated at 379,800 people in 2017.
The city was just celebrating its 40th anniversary when earthquakes and tsunami struck.
Donggala is a regency stretching over 300 km (180 miles) along the coast on the northwestern island of Sulawesi.
The Regency, an administrative region under the province, had a population of 299,200 in 2017.
The main components of the economy of the province of Central Sulawesi are fishing and farming, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but it is mainly concentrated in Morowa on the opposite coast of Sulawesi Island.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency, the tsunami has hit Palu and Donggala several times over the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami in Donggale killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
The tsunami hit the west of Donggala in 1996, when it claimed nine casualties.
Indonesia is located on the seismic Pacific Circle of Fire, and there are regular earthquakes.
Here is a list of some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunami in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra on 26 December caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh province.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, near the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-degree earthquake struck the southern Indonesian island of Java, causing a tsunami that hit the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai islands near Sumatra, causing a 10-metre-high tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A mild earthquake struck the Pidie Jaya rainforest in Aceh province, causing destruction and panic as it reminded people of the devastating effects of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
There was no tsunami this time, but more than 100 died from falling buildings.
2018: A severe earthquake hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily incarcerated.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
According to a report released by the Alaska State Troopers on Saturday, 29-year-old Palin living in Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, disruption to reports of domestic violence and detention.
According to police reports, when his female acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, Palin picked up her phone.
Palin was sent to the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and was held on $500 uninsured bond, KTUU reports.
According to the network's report, he appeared in court on Saturday, where he said he felt "definitely innocent" when asked about his statement.
Palin faces three Class A offences, meaning he could be sentenced to a year's imprisonment and a fine of up to $250,000.
At the same time, he was charged with a Class B offence, which is punishable by a one-day prison sentence and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time Palin has to face a criminal investigation.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
The alleged attack on the police was reported by his mother, Sarah Palin, over the phone.
The case is currently before the Alaskan court for war veterans.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, disruption of domestic violence reporting and possession of weapons under the influence of intoxicants in connection with the incident.
He was supposed to hit his girlfriend in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by war veteran groups for linking her son’s violent behavior to a post-traumatic stress disorder caused by her son’s service in Iraq.
Indonesian earthquake and tsunami: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electrical and communications networks are out of operation and the number of victims is expected to increase in the coming days.
The quake struck directly on the shattered part of the island of Sulawesi, located northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
On social media, there were videos depicting the moment of the disaster.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in Palu when a tsunami struck the coast.
Federal Prosecutors Call for Extraordinary Death Penalty for Suspected Terrorist Attack in NYC
Federal prosecutors in New York are demanding the death penalty for Sayfulla Saipov, who is suspected of committing a terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people — an exceptional punishment that has not been granted for federal crimes in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly carried out an attack on a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan in October using a rented Home Depot truck that knocked out pedestrians and cyclists.
In order for prosecutors to defend the death penalty, they will have to prove that Saipo “intentionally” killed eight victims and “intentionally” caused a number of injuries – this is how the terms of the intention to grant the death penalty are defined according to a document approved by the Southern District of New York court.
According to the court documents, both of these figures would mean the possibility of the death penalty.
Several weeks after the attack, the federal grand jury accused Saipo of 22 criminal offences, including charges of murder in favor of extortion, which federal prosecutors commonly use in cases of organized crime, and charges of violence and engine destruction.
The attack required “significant planning and preparation,” the prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov’s act was carried out as ugly, cruel and twisted.”
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, pain and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadtov<0xC3><0xA1>, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlijov<0xC3><0xA1>, Hern<0xC3><0xA1>n Ferruchi, Hern<0xC3><0xA1>n Diego Mendoza and Alejandra Dami<0xC3><0xA1>n.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been ten years since the Southern District of New York court last handed down the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but was sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was actually carried out was in connection with the 1953 New York federal case, when the married couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed, who proved a conspiracy to spy for the Soviet Union during the two-year Cold War.
Both Rosenbergs were seated in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, expressed minimal regret over the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
According to police, he said he felt good about what he did.
According to the accusations, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack by watching videos of the Islamic State on the phone.
Police also said they had demanded that the Islamic State flag be raised in a hospital room.
He said he felt innocent about the 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were “obviously disappointed” by the prosecutors’ decision.
“We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty instead of admitting guilt and life sentence without the possibility of release only prolongs the trauma of these events for anyone they concern,” Patton said.
Saipov's team of attorneys has already asked the prosecutor not to demand the death penalty.
Conservative Party MPs say he should be entrusted with Brexit negotiations NIGEL FARAGE
During today’s protest at the Conservative Party conference, Nigel Farage pledged to “mobilize the People’s Army.”
The former leader of the UK Independence Party said politicians must “feel pressure” from Eurosceptics – as suggested by one of its own MEPs Theresa May, he should lead negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said at a Birmingham march that Britain “would be out by now” if he were Brexit secretary Mr Farage.
But the problem that Mrs May faces as she pacifies her ranks, where there is a deep split, has been highlighted by conservatives struggling to stay in the EU, who have joined the stand-alone protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is trying to keep her Chequers compromise plan under attack by Brexit supporters, supporters of persistence in the EU and the EU itself.
The Allies insist that they will continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels regardless of the consequences – and will force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between its package and ‘chaos’.
Mr. Bone said that Leave Means Leave will gather in Solihull, where he wanted to “go to the Chequers.”
He proposed to Mr Farage that he should become a representative and be responsible for negotiating with Brussels.
“If he were in the lead, we would be out today,” he said.
Wellingborough added, “I will stand for Brexit, but we have to cough up the Chequers.”
To show his opposition to the EU, he said: “We did not fight World Wars to have to listen.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Mr. Bone rejected the proposals that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that British citizens would change their minds and want to stay is completely irrelevant.”
Conservative Brexit advocate Andrea Jenkyns, who also attended the march, told reporters: “I just say, Madam Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chequers is unpopular with the general public, the opposition will not vote for him, and he is not liked by our party members or our activists, who are currently filling the streets to make us even elected.
Forget the Chequers and start listening.’
In a sharp report to Ms. May, she says, "The Prime Ministers will keep their place when they keep their promises."
Farage said conservative politicians must “get into an uncomfortable situation” if they want to betray their decisions made on the basis of the 2016 referendum.
“Now it’s about trust between us – the people – and our political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit, and we’re standing here today to tell them, ‘We won’t let you do that.’”
In the report to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want our political class, which is on the brink of betrayal of Brexit, to feel pressure.
“We are now mobilizing the army of the people of this country, which has secured us victory in the Brexit referendum, and we will not rest until we become independent and proud of the United Kingdom that governs itself.”
In the meantime, supporters of the Union continued to visit Birmingham and then organized a two-hour meeting in the city centre.
Several activists waved banners of the Conservatives against Brexit after the party’s opening weekend.
Labour MP Lord Adonis made fun of the Conservatives because of the party’s security concerns after the conference began.
“These are the people who, in their own words, can provide IT systems and technology for Canada plus plus, for smooth borders, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
It's all a frieze.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren Plans to ‘Denk Properly’ Presidential Candidate
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren has said that she will “think thoroughly about the presidential nomination” after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that a Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future on Saturday at a town hall in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is seeking re-election in November against Republican Rep. Geoff Diehl, who was co-chair of Trump’s 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She was at the center of speculation that she could stand up to Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon action in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters in the town hall since Trump took office.
One of the participants asked her if she was planning to apply for the office of president.
Warren replied, “It is time for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government, which means a woman in the highest position.”
He was arrested on suspicion of shooting Sims from LSU.
Police in Baton Rouge, LA, on Saturday said they had arrested a suspect in Friday's shooting of LSU basketball player Wayd Sims.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at 11:00 ET News Conference.
A video of Friday's shooting was released requesting the identification of the man captured on the tape.
Sims, 20, was shot dead on Friday morning near a campus at Southern University.
"Wayde Sims suffered a head injury that was not life-saving," Murphy J. Paul, the chief of police, told media on Saturday via the 247sports website.
Wayde tried to protect his friend, and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted that he was moving on the scene, had a gun, and also confessed to the shooting of Wayde Sims.
Simpson was incarcerated without incident and taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
The 6-foot and 6-inch tall Sims, who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games, 10 of which were last season, with an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russia’s Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is approaching the World Champion title when the team’s director placed him in the hands of a victory over Sebastian Vettel
As soon as Valtteri Bottas finished in Saturday’s qualifying against Lewis Hamilton, it was clear that Mercedes’ team management would play a big role in the race.
Bottas had a good start from the pole position and almost got rid of Hamilton when he defended his position in the first two laps and called on Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel got into the depot first and let Hamilton pick up the wagons spinning at the group's lap, which should be decisive.
The Mercedes driver took to the depot a few minutes later and after the start he made his way to Vettela. However, Hamilton went ahead and in a close match, the Ferrari driver had to unwittingly leave the inner lane open in order to defend himself in the third turn after the double.
Max Verstappen started from the rear row of the field and was in the lead at the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then led for much of the race because he kept the original tyres as long as possible to focus on the fast finish and could take Kimi Raikkonen's fourth position.
He eventually made it to the depot in the 44th round, but in the remaining eight rounds he was unable to increase the pace and Raikkonen remained fourth.
It's a hard day, because Valtteri did a great job all weekend, and when he got the order, he behaved like a perfect gentleman.
The team did a fantastic job and the reward is the first two places," Hamilton said.
It was a really bad body language.
President Donald Trump made fun of Senator Dianne Feinstein at a meeting on Saturday for insisting she did not publish a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
During a speech at a meeting in West Virginia, he did not directly mention Ford's resignation before the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead stating that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are "evil and disgusting and depraved."
“One thing that could happen, and the wonderful thing that happens in the last days in the Senate, when you see that anger when you see those people being angry and angry and disgusting and perverted,” he said.
“When you look at publishing and publishing and they say to you, ‘Ah, I didn’t do it.
I didn't do it."
You remember?
Dianne Feinstein, can you help me escape?
Remember her answer... you published the document – ,ach, ah, what?
Oh, no.
She didn't publish."
Well, wait a minute.
We published... No, no, no," he added, imitating the senator.
The Feinsteins sent Ford a letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh in July, and the information was leaked in early September — but Feinstein denied it had been leaked from her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s allegations, nor did I disclose the case,” Feinstein told The Hill.
“She asked me to keep everything a secret and I did exactly what she asked me to do.”
However, according to her, the president, who spoke about the case at a meeting on Saturday evening, apparently did not believe her: “I tell you, it’s a really bad body language.
Maybe she didn’t, but it’s the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
The president continued to defend a candidate for the Supreme Court judge, who was accused by three women of sexual harassment, and suggested that the Democrats were using these accusations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to take back power by any available means.
You see this betrayal, this disgust, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to push into the country to get back to power and control,” Mediaite quoted the president as saying.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored twice for Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars made a Friday loss in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants with a win in Saturday's retaliation in Dundee, which ended 5-3.
The Giants soon took the two-sided lead thanks to the interventions of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie managed to make it home before Dwyer returned the Giants leadership.
Francois Bouchard then again compared for Dundee, with two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen insured their victory.
It was Adam Keefe's third defeat in the Elite League this season for the team, who managed to beat Belfast Dundee 2-1 on Friday.
Both teams have met for the fourth time in the season, with all three previous games being dominated by the Giants.
Dwyer's first goal came in the fourth minute, at 3:35, assisted by Kendall McFaull, while David Rutherford conceded an assist to Beauvillier's second goal four minutes later.
The first third was wild when Sullivan got home back into the game at 13:10 and then Matt Marquardt scored a goal for Cownie, who was comparing at 15:16.
Thanks to Dwyer, the Giants went to the cabins for the first break, after all, only in the lead, when he scored his second goal of the evening at the end of the first third.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard again managed to score a goal from the overtime game in time 27:37.
Cownie's and Charles Corcoran's joint work later helped Nielsen for the first time in the match to jump the lead to Dundee, and the same player secured the lead of his team in the final half.
The Giants, who have now lost the fourth of the last five games, will play another game on Friday at home in Milton Keynes.
Air traffic chief has died to allow hundreds of people on board the plane to escape an earthquake
The Indonesian air traffic chief is celebrated as a hero after he died, as he watched to ensure that the plane was able to safely take off with hundreds of people on board.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a major earthquake rocked the island of Sulawesi on Friday that caused the tsunami.
Severe aftershocks flooded the area and many people remained trapped in the rubble of the city of Palu.
But despite the fact that colleagues of the 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung fled to save their lives, he refused to leave his place in the wild-beating control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He remained in his position to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could safely take off.
Then he jumped from the control tower down when he thought it was falling down.
He later died in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait told Australia's ABC News that the decision helped save hundreds of lives.
We prepared transport by helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan, which transported him to a hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“Our hearts are broken by this message,” he added.
In the meantime, the authorities concerned that the number of deaths could reach thousands, the agency responsible for resolving the disaster said that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
“The number of deaths is still increasing as many of the bodies are still unreleased under the wreckage and many of them have still not been reached by rescuers,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Waves in the devastated Pal have reached a height of up to six meters. Mass funerals will be held in the city on Sunday.
Military and civilian aircraft bring aid and supplies to the affected areas.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute an ambulance brings in more bodies.
There is a shortage of drinking water.
“Small shops are stolen everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is trying to help the survivors, but we don’t know what they will find on the spot.
It’s already a tragedy, but it could be even worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country’s military: “I ask you to work day and night and complete all the tasks needed to evacuate.
“Are you ready?” he told CNN.
Indonesia was hit this year by an earthquake in Lombok, which killed more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini now claims one person missing after plane crash in lagoon
The airline operating the flight, which crashed in a lagoon on one of the Micronesian islands in the Pacific, now said one person was missing, initially stating that all the passengers and crew of a total of 47 people were safely evacuated from the island.
Air Niugini said in a press release that she was unable to find a single passenger on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it is cooperating with local authorities, hospitals and investigators in the search for a missing man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for details of the passenger, his age or nationality.
Local ships helped to rescue other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water in an attempt to land at the airport on the island of Chuuk.
Officials said on Friday that a total of seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said six of the passengers remained in treatment as early as Saturday and all were in a stabilized state.
What caused the accident and the exact sequence of events, however, remains unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane had landed in the lagoon before the runway.
Some of the witnesses thought that the plane had crossed the track.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane had landed from a very low altitude.
"That was very good," said Jaynes.
Jaynes further stated that, together with the others, he managed to get water down the deep belt to the emergency exits of the sinking aircraft.
He further said that the crew on board panicked and shouted and that he himself suffered minor head injuries.
The U.S. Navy said seafarers who worked nearby on the adjustments to the port pier had helped rescue passengers by using an inflatable boat carrying passengers to shore even before the plane sank to a depth of about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
According to data from the Aviation Safety Network, a total of 111 people have died in plane crashes with the PNG registration mark over the past two decades, but no accidents have occurred to Air Niuguni.
Analyst describes the last moments of a woman who was burned alive
The prosecution on Saturday ended its speech in the case, in which a man is repeatedly convicted of burning a woman alive in the state of Mississippi in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice, in the person of its analyst Paul Rowlett, testified for several hours and provided expert assessments in the field of intelligence analysis.
An analyst for the jury sketched a scenario using the cell phone records of 29 defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old Jessica Chambers from the night she died.
Rowlett said he obtained location data from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was at Chambers's the night of her death, which was inconsistent with his previous statement, The Clarion Ledger newspaper reported.
When the cell phone data showed that he spent the night with Chambers, he reported that he was with his friend Michael Sanford, who was then visited by the police.
Sanford stood in front of the courthouse and testified that he was not in town on that day.
When the plaintiffs asked if Tellis was telling the truth that he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said, "He's lying because my car was in Nashville that night."
Another discrepancy was that Tellis stated that he knew Chambers about two weeks after she died.
However, cell phone records indicate that the two had known each other for only a week.
Rowlett said that shortly after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' text messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He wiped it completely out of his life," Hale said.
The defense will begin its final speech on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the case to be brought before the jury later that day.
High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
The hip hop trio wants to deal with the negative opinions on this genre by filling their music with positive messages.
High Breed from Bristol claims that hip hop has moved from its inception with political messages and solutions to social problems.
They therefore want to go back to their roots and popularize conscious hip hop again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have encountered revival in the recent past thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey in the UK.
Another black woman?!
A New York schoolteacher sues a couple for their expulsion after a “racist” text message
A New York-based schoolteacher is suing a couple for their discriminatory expulsion after receiving a text message from her mother incorrectly sent, in which she was labeled "another black" text message.
The couple denied being racist and compared the lawsuit to "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two, expressed outrage when she found out on her first day at work in 2016 that her children’s new educator, Giselle Maurice, was black.
“NEEEEEEEE, OTHER BLACK,” Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
However, instead of sending her to her husband, she was sent twice by P. Maurice.
When she understood her faux pas, Ms. Plasco-Flaxman, “concerned,” threw Ms. Maurice out and said that her leaving teacher, who was an African-American, was working really badly and was expecting the Philippines instead, the New York Post reported.
Ms. Maurice received a salary for one job and was sent home by Uber.
Now Maurice is suing a couple for dismissal and demanding compensation of $350 per day for the six-month commitment for which she was initially hired, albeit without a contract.
“I want to show them that this is not done,” she told the Post this Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple, however, returned the blow with the fact that they were not racist, but that the termination of Ms. Maurice's employment was an appropriate measure, for they feared they could no longer trust her after that insult.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t want to say.
She's definitely not a racist.
We are not racists," her husband, Joel Plasco, told the Post.
“But would you put your child in the hands of someone you treated rudely, even though it was a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on, come on."
Plasco resembled the lawsuit to "extortion" and said that his wife was only taking care of a two-month-old child and was in a "very difficult situation".
“Would you drive someone like that?
That's not a nice thing at all," said the investment banker.
Although the trial is still ongoing, the jury on social media very quickly condemned the couple for their behavior and logic.
The publishers of the stories about the bear Paddington feared that readers would not identify with the talking bear, the latest reports show
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, told the reporter: “It’s hard to feel in the situation of someone reading it for the first time, even before it’s published.
It’s very funny to know now that we know the great success of the Paddington Bear.”
She stated that her father, who worked as a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired to write a children's book about a little plush bear, was very disappointed that his work was rejected, added on the day of his 60th anniversary of publication of the book, which became "sweet-sweet-sweet".
To Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important member of her family", she added that her father was very proud of his ultimate success.
“He was quite a quiet man, he was never at all exhilarating,” she said.
“But because Paddington was such a real character for him, it was like you had a child who achieved something you can really be proud of.
I think he looked at Paddington's success with this look.
Even though it was his mere creation and imagination, he always tried to attribute all successes only to Paddington."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone
After landing, her daughter was quickly transported to the Louise Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried to save her life.
“He called me on a regular basis to tell me that it was really bad and that he didn’t expect her to get out of it,” said Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I had a phone call from Nada where she told me she was going to die in another two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
That's how I did it.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, darling.
I'll be there with you soon.
I'll be there with you.
The medications given to her by doctors to keep her heart running slowly lost its effectiveness and left her body.
She died shortly thereafter, and it was as if everything was closed.
I just had to sit and wait, I knew what was going on.
I couldn’t cry or cry because I was surrounded by families and other people.
I just had to keep it in me.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now grieving the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane along with the other passengers, without revealing what a difficult test she was going through.
"Nobody knew about it," she said.
“I kept my head bent, tears were running through my face all the time.
It’s hard to explain, but it was just during the flight that I felt an astonishing understanding of Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Women in need send postcards to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women, who have lost loved ones as a result of suicide, work together to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys send out Welsh Bridge postcards with inspirational messages and phone numbers on which people can seek support.
Tyler's son, Mrs. Davis, was only 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression, and as a result, he took his own life at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any other parent to have to feel what I’ve felt every day,” she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a gifted young chef with a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him because of his smile.
They always said that his smile could light up every room.”
However, before his death, he left work because he was “in a really dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 at the time, found his cousin’s immovable body after taking his life.
Mrs. Davis says, “I’m constantly worried about the impact it will have on his life.”
Mrs. Davis proposed a postcard, “to inform people that they have people at their disposal who are willing to help them and can talk to them, even if they are their friends.
Don’t sit down, you have to talk.”
Mrs. Humphreys, who is Mrs. Davies's flight mate, lost Mark, who had been her partner for 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
“Nothing told me that he felt down, or depressed, nothing at all,” he explains.
“A few days before Christmas, we saw a change in his behavior.
The worst was on Christmas Day – when the kids opened the gifts, he didn’t even look at them, nothing.”
She said that her partner’s death was a huge trauma for them, but that she had to get over it gradually: “It can make a complete hole in the family.
It ripped us apart.
But we all have to go on and fight.”

The future of Brett Kavanaugh depends on the balance as the FBI begins its investigation
“I thought we could get something we were actually asking for — a limited-time, limited-scale investigation — we could bring some unity into it,” Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would “dissolve” the parties after the parties.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to start an investigation?
Their resistance is well-timed.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away from us, on November 6, and if the Republicans behave as expected, it will lead to their substantial weakening in attempts to force the man they want to hold office in the highest court of this country.
George W. Bush called the senators, lobbied at them in support of Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for President Bush, and through him met his wife Ashley, then Bush’s personal secretary.
What happens if the FBI makes a report?
The Senate will vote on this, and there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
However, it is not clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which has allowed Vice President Mike Pence to break the referee and confirm it with the Supreme Court.
North Korea's number of refugees 'declining' after Kim
The number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea has declined since the beginning of Kim Jong-un's rule seven years ago, South Korean lawmakers say.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South Korean Ministry of Unification, said there were 1,127 escapes in the past year – compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park further said that it is behind tighter controls on the North Korean-Chinese border and higher rates of smugglers required at the border.
Pjöngjang did not make a public statement.
The vast majority of refugees from the North today are getting an offer for South Korean citizenship.
Seoul claims that since the end of the Korean War in 1953, 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border.
Most of them run through China, with North Korea having the longest border, and it is easier to cross it than in the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China views refugees as illegal migrants and not as refugees, and is often forced to repatriate them.
Relations between the North and the South – which are technically still in a state of war – have improved considerably in recent months.
This month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pjöngjang for talks focused on stalled denuclearization talks.
This was followed by a historic June meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed on extensive terms of cooperation on nuclear disarmament on the Korean Peninsula.
On Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Jong-ho accused the United States of making no progress on the issue of sanctions.
“Without any trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security, and under such circumstances there is no way for us to unilaterally disarm,” Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was unsuitable for serving in the Supreme Court
Democratic minority leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was unsuitable for serving in the Supreme Court due to her temperament.
Pelosi made this remark in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t help myself, but if any woman ever performed such a theatre, they would call it “hysterical,” Pelosi said in her response to Kavanaugh’s Thursday’s resignation before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Kavanaugh emotionally rejected all allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford at the time of their puberty.
During his introductory speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes almost screaming and suffocating when talking about his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly denounced the Democrats on the committee and said their accusations against him are a “large and coordinated attack” by organized liberals who failed to pass through the defeat of Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said Kavanaugh’s resignation proved that he was unable to work for the Supreme Court because he showed he was biased against Democrats.
“I think he himself disqualified with these statements and the way he relied on the Clintons and Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi responded negatively to the question of whether she would seek Kavanaugh's resignation in the event of his confirmation, even if the Democrats had won a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I’m going to tell you this — if he doesn’t tell Congress the truth, then he’s not only eligible to work for the Supreme Court, but also for the court he’s working for now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the appeals court in D.C. .
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she was concerned about Kavanaugh’s potential earnings in court under the Acceptable Care Act or Roe vs. Wade because he is considered a conservative judge.
As part of the hearing prior to his confirmation in office, Kavanaugh avoided answering the question of whether he would overturn any decisions of the Supreme Court.
"There's no time for a hysterical, presumptuous person to come to court and expect us to just say, 'Hey, that's beautiful,'" Pelosi said.
And women have to rule it.
After months and years of silence, she couldn’t get rid of it without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's unusual, do I?"
She continues: “A lot of help was given to me by a woman who was working as a director somewhere and who told me that she was also crying when she was angry, but she had a certain technique, which means that when she was angry and started crying, she said to the person I was talking to, ‘Maybe she thought,’
But I'm angry."
And so she went on.
And I think it's great."
Tears are acceptable as a means of reacting to anger, partly because they are not understood.
One of my most vivid memories comes from my first job, where I worked in an office where men dominated. Once there I expressed my inexpressible anger by crying. But the older, always horny manager, who I was always a little worried about.
"Never show them you're crying," she told me.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be glad they got you."
Patricia Schroeder, a former Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidacy.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an unmarried affair aboard the Monkey Business and had to withdraw from the fight, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, found that there was no reason she could not explore the idea of her own presidential candidacy.
"It wasn't a well-thought-out decision," she told me with a laugh after 30 years.
“There were already seven other candidates, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called it "Snowflake and the Seven Dwarfs."
But since the campaign had been running for a long time, she couldn’t keep up with the winnings, so she pledged not to go into the match unless she won $2 million in the winnings.
It was a lost battle.
She found that some supporters who would give $1000 to a male candidate would only give her $250.
"Do you think I'll get a discount?" she thought.
When she announced that she would not formally carry out the campaign, she was completely overcome by her emotions – as an expression of gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration with the system that made it harder for her to earn money and focus on voters with a ploy rather than a ploy on sex, a ploy on her.
"You might think I've collapsed nervously," Mrs. Schroeder said of the press's reaction.
“And maybe you’d think that my main sponsor was Kleenex.
I remember thinking about what they'd probably write to me on the gravestone.
"Plaka"?
Why the Sino-American trade war could be good for Beijing
The opening salvage of the trade war between the US and China has been deafening and, although the battle is not far-reaching, experts say the gap between the countries will be beneficial for Beijing in the long run.
US President Donald Trump issued the first warning this year by slashing Chinese exports including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
Most of the major escalations, however, saw the light of the world this week, when new tariffs on US$200 billion (GBP150 billion) goods were announced, which practically means taxing half of China’s trade exports to the US.
Beijing has responded every time, most recently by imposing tariffs on five to ten percent of 60 billion U.S. goods imports.
China has been trying to pay back the US with the same coin, and it is unlikely that the world’s second-largest economy would kneel on its knees.
Even if China wanted Washington to return to its original railroads, it would mean retreating to its demands, but it would be absolutely humiliating for Chinese President Xi Jinping to submit to U.S. demands.
Yet experts believe that if Beijing could play its cards correctly, the U.S. trade war could positively support China in the long run because it would reduce the interdependence of the two economies.
“The reality is that a quick political decision by Washington or Beijing could create economic conditions that would trigger an economic outburst in both countries. This is far more dangerous than Newcomers have so far allowed,” said Abigail Grace, a senior researcher at the US-based Security Center.
Syria Is Ready to Return Refugees, Foreign Minister Says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help in rebuilding a country devastated by more than seven years of war.
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country are improving.
"Today's situation on the territory is more stable and safer thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas of the destroyed terrorists to a normal state.
Now all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees who have been forced to leave the country as a result of terrorism are met, as well as the unilateral economic measures that have focused on their daily lives.
The UN estimates that Syria has left more than 5.5 million people since the start of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still live in the country in need of humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome any assistance in building a devastated country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from the countries that sponsored the insurgents.
Europe reacted strongly to victory in the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Evria won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating Team USA with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National on the fringe of trouble in France.
The U.S. has now lost sixth in a row on European soil, so it has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn and his team reached the 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who toured most of the time, then threw the ball into the water on 3 pairs of 16th holes and let Francesco Molinarim win.
The Italian golfer Molinari then shone in all his wheels and became one of the 4 players and achieved the best result 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament was approved in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was defeated by 5 and 4 players of the European team with the lowest score, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
World top scorer Dustin Johnson lost 2nd and 1st with England's Ian Poulter, who apparently completed his last Ryder Cup.
A veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spain’s Sergio Garcia has become the overall best European player with 25.5 points earned in his career.
“I don’t usually cry, but I can’t help myself today.
It's been a rough year.
So thanks to Thomas for choosing me and trusting me.
I'm so happy, really happy that I got the cup back.
It all depends on the team, I'm glad I was able to help," Garcia said after winning Europe.
He gave the cup to his countryman John Rampo, who on Sunday defeated American legend Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in singles.
"I'm incredibly proud to have defeated Tiger Woods, and I grew up watching him," Rahm, 23, said in a statement.
Woods lost all four games in France and now has a career record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
A strange statistic of one of the best players of all time, who has won 14 of the biggest titles, with which only Jack Nicklaus can compare.
The U.S. team struggled throughout the weekend to find the fairway, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who performed top golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk said after his team’s unsatisfactory results: “I’m proud of the guys, they really fought.
This morning we really warmed Europe to the heart.
We didn't really make it.
I'm ripping my hat off in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played really well.
We will regroup and move forward in cooperation with the PGA of America and the Ryder Cup committee.
I like those 12 guys, I'm glad I could have made them captain.
I really have to sneeze.
You've played us."
Red tide update: Concentrations drop in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota districts
The latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission points to the overall decline in red tidal concentrations in the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC report, spots of flowering water are now reported from the districts of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier – this indicates a declining concentration.
The flowering waters of the red tide range about 130 miles of coastline from the northern district of Pinellas to the southern district of Lee.
The spots were observed about 10 miles off the coast in Hillsborough County, but last week there were relatively fewer places.
The red tide was also observed in Pasco County.
Last week, the average concentrations of voles at the coast or at the open sea in the Pinellas district were reported at the voles. In the Hillsborough district, low to high concentrations were observed in the open sea, at the low to high concentrations at the low to high concentrations, at the low to high concentrations at the sea level in the Manatee district, and at the lowest concentrations at the high concentrations at the Saratee district.
Respiratory irritation continues to occur in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier districts.
Inflammation of the airways was not reported in northwest Florida last week.
