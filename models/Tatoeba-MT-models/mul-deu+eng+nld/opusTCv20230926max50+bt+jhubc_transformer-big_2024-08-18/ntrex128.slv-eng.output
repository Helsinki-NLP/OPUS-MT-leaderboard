Members of the Valencian Assembly are concerned that they are “like Mupetka”
Some members of the Assembly were appalled by the proposal to be renamed MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, see Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This came about because of plans to change the name of the assembly to the Valizan Parliament.
Members of the Assembly throughout the political spectrum are concerned that they will laugh.
A member of the congregation from the types of laborists said that their group was concerned about them “because the name of Rome is Twp and Pwp.”
For readers outside Wales: twp in Welsh means stupid, pwp means fuck.
Plaid Cymru, a member of the party’s assembly, said their group as a whole was “not satisfied” and suggested other options.
The Valencian Conservative said his group was “open-minded” about the change of name, while noting that there was a slight difference in pronunciation between the words of MWP and Muppet.
In this context, the pronunciation of the Welsh letter "w" is similar to the pronunciation of the letter "u" in the Yorkshire dialect.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce name changes, said: “The final decision on the possible descriptors for the members of the Assembly will, of course, have to be made by the members themselves.”
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public consultation on the proposals and received broad support for the appointment of the Assembly of the Parliament of Valencia.
As members of the Assembly, the Commission chose the name ‘Welsh Parliament Member’ or ‘WMP’, but in the public consultation the option ‘MWP’ received the most support.
Members of the House are obviously proposing other options, but reaching a consensus will be a difficult task for President Elin Jones, who has to submit a draft legislation on amendments within a few weeks.
The reform legislation will also include other changes to the way the Assembly operates, including rules on incompatibility in the performance of the function of the members of the Assembly and the formation of a system of committees.
Members of the Assembly will participate in the legislative debate in the final vote on their appointment.
Macedonians will decide to change the name of the country with a referendum
Voters will vote on Sunday to change their country’s name to “Republic of North Macedonia.”
They want to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of their northern neighbor represents the right to their territory, and has repeatedly opposed its application for membership in the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the plebiscite's name change, said he would not take the vote into account.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that a change in the name is the price they have to pay to join the EU and NATO.
The bells in St. Martin’s church are ringing as churches in Harlem are struggling
“The older people I’ve talked to say there used to be a bar and a church on every corner,” Adams said.
“Not one or the other today.”
He explained that the disappearance of bars was understandable.
“People are socializing differently today.
Bars are no longer the living room neighborhoods where people go regularly.”
In the churches, however, he worries that the money from the sale of funds will not last as long as the leaders expect, and that they will soon be back in the beginning.
He added that churches could be replaced by residential buildings with a common administration (condominium), where people will live, who will not help shelters in the neighborhood that remain.
“The vast majority of people who will buy condominiums in these buildings will be white,” he said, “and so the day will soon come when all of these churches will be closed, as people who will move into these condominiums are unlikely to become members of these churches.”
Both churches were built by Belgian religious communities before Harlem became a black metropolis – the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin’s a decade later.
The original Belgian Methodist Church community emigrated in the 1930s.
The building was taken over by a black religious community, which performed worship services nearby.
St. Martin’s was taken over by a black religious community led by Honorable John Howard Johnson, who on 125th Street, Harlem’s main shopping street, led a boycott of vendors who did not want to hire or support black people.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but when Johnson's father's parishioners planned the renovation, they ordered the bells to be lit.
In honor of David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin’s Church, he proudly called the bells “bells for poor people.”
The expert, who was jailed in July, called them “a cultural treasure” and “an irreplaceable historical instrument”.
Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan also emphasized that these were the first bells to be played by a dark-skinned musician, Dionysio A. Link, who left 18 years ago for the Riverside Church church, where they were to bend to larger bells.
Mr. Merriweather said that he was not replaced in St. Martin’s Church.
In the last few months, St. Martin’s Church has had a complex story with architects and contractors; some were brought by church laymen and others by the diocese.
Zakristia, an administrative body of the parish consisting of laymen, wrote to the diocese in July that she was concerned that the diocese would “try to transfer costs” to the parish, even though the parish was not involved in the employment of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about the transparency of the diocese.
Sea Dog Hurts 13-Year-Old Man While Hunting Stallions in California
Officials report that on Saturday in California, a sea dog attacked and injured a 13-year-old while hunting lobsters at the opening of the lobster hunting season.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon’s Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he dived with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy scream for help, then swam to him with a group and helped him pull him out of the water.
Hammel said he first thought the boy was just excited because he caught a hammer, and then he found out he was screaming, “He bit me!
He bit me!”
When he came to the boy, Hammel noticed that he had the whole key ripped off.
“I told everyone to come out of the water, ‘There is a sea dog in the water!’”
The boy was transported by helicopter to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he remains in critical condition.
The type of marine dog responsible for the attack is not known.
A rescuer from the water, Captain Larry Giles, said in a statement to the media that a sea dog had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was found not to be a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered severe damage to the upper part of the body.
For 48 hours, officials blocked access from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami’s Beach in Ecinitas due to investigation and security.
Giles said there are more than 135 species of sea dogs in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury’s plans to enter the UK beauty market
Sainsbury’s comes in Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with beauty corners as they have in department stores, and with professional staff.
As part of entering the UK beauty market, which is worth <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion and is still growing, while sales of clothing and household appliances are declining, larger beauty corners will be tested in 11 stores across the country, and next year in more stores if they turn out to be.
To invest in beauty products, they decided, because supermarkets are looking for ways to fill the shelves they used previously for TVs, microwaves and household appliances.
At Sainsbury’s, they say they will double the range of their beauty products on 3000 products and include brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees offer will also gain more space in areas with brands similar to those in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket is also reviving its boutique range of cosmetics, so most of the products are vegan – something that younger shoppers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, Fragrance Shop will test a concession at two Sainsbury’s stores. The first opened last week in Croydon, South London, and the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, until the end of the year.
Due to online shopping and daily shopping for smaller quantities of food in local stores, supermarkets need to make more effort to convince people to visit.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury’s, said retail stores will be similar to department stores as a chain of supermarkets is trying to fight off Aldi and Lidl discounts with multiple services and non-food products.
Sainsbury’s opened outlet Argos in several hundred stores and also Habitat stores, having bought both chains two years ago, increasing food sales and making acquisitions more profitable.
Previous attempts by supermarkets to renovate their departments with cosmetics and pharmaceuticals have ended unsuccessfully.
Sainsbury’s embarked on a joint venture with the Boots chain in the early 21st century, but the partnership ended after a dispute over the division of profits from drugstores in their supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury’s three years ago sold its pharmaceutical company with 281 stores to Celesio, which owns the Lloyds Pharmacy chain.
Lloyds will play a role in this plan, as the four stores are expected to expand the range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury’s Commercial Director, said: “We have changed the look and feel of our beauty corners and thus improved the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained collaborators who will be available for advice.
Our range of brands is designed to suit all needs, and the attractive environment and convenient locations mean that we are now an interesting beauty destination that presents a challenge to the old way of shopping.”
Peter Jones 'wrong' to drop Holly Willoughby's <0xC2><0xA3>11 million job
The star of the show Dragons Day (Good Business) is angry that TV host Holly Willoughby has withdrawn from a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million job with his lifestyle brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer.
Willoughby doesn't have time for their truly brand of clothing and accessories.
The business pair company was compared with the brand Goop Gwyneth Paltrow.
The head of the show This Morning, 37, announced on Instagram that she is retiring.
Holly Willoughby has angered the show's Dragons Den by pulling out of their profitable lifestyle brand business at the last minute to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was “angry” when a golden TV girl on Tuesday, during a tense meeting at his company’s headquarters in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire, admitted that due to her new business – worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million – she no longer had enough time to devote to Truly and devote herself to their treasure.
The company was compared to the Goop Gwyneth Paltrow brand and announced that it would double its assets, estimated at <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she was leaving the True brand, Jones flew out of Britain to one of her vacation homes.
The source says: “Truely was by far the most important thing for Holly.
That would be her long-term future, with which she would survive the next two decades.
Her decision to resign completely surprised everyone involved.
On Tuesday, no one could believe what was going on, as the opening was so close.
At the company’s headquarters in Marlow, the warehouse is full of goods ready for sale.”
Experts believe that the departure of the show’s host, This Morning, which is among the most interesting connections for banks in the UK, would cost the company millions due to large investments in products, from pillows and candles to clothing and accessories, and additional delays in opening.
This can mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, the mother of three children, and her husband Dan Baldwin were good friends with Jones and his wife Taro Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded True with Cappo in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined them as president in March.
The couple went on vacation together, and Jones has a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become M&S brand ambassador and replace Ant McPartlin as host of I’m A Celebrity.
A source close to Jonas said last night: “We will not comment on his business affairs.”
A difficult conversation “and then we fell in love”
He joked about the criticism of the media over a comment that some consider “non-presidential” and a positive view of the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump, in his “journalistic” voice, said:
“I didn’t let anything go.”
He stressed that Kim had shown interest in a second meeting. Their first meeting in Singapore in June was marked by Trump as a major step towards North Korea’s nuclear disarmament.
But the negotiations on nuclear disarmament have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at a UN General Assembly meeting that North Korea does not see an “appropriate response” by the United States to North Korea’s previous disarmament measures.
Instead, he stressed that the United States is continuing to impose sanctions, which continue to put pressure on it.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech.
“We are doing very well with North Korea,” he said.
“We wanted to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
We have a good relationship now.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim brought positive results – they stopped testing the missiles, helped liberate the hostages, and brought home the remains of American troops after their deaths.
He also defended his unusual approach in talking about relations with Kim.
“It can be very Presidential, but instead of 10,000 people outside trying to get into this crowded scene, we have 200 people standing here,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
Cunamiento and earthquake in Indonesia devastated the island, hundreds of dead
In addressing the effects of the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign NGOs were told that they did not need their help.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok has been displaced, they have not declared a natural disaster, which is a condition for sending international aid.
“Unfortunately, in many cases, it was very clear that they did not require international assistance, so the situation is somewhat complicated,” Sumbungova said.
Save the Children consists of a team that will travel to Palo, but it is not yet clear whether foreign personnel will be able to help on the ground.
Sutopu, a representative of the national disaster agency, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu and determining whether they would allow international agencies to help.
Given that earthquakes in Indonesia are a constant, the country remains completely unprepared for the anger of nature.
Although shelters were built in Aceh after the tsunami, it is not common practice on other coasts.
The loss of life was probably due to the apparent absence of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, although the warning was valid.
Traveling between many Indonesian islands is a challenge even in the best of times.
Due to natural disasters, the logistics are even more complicated.
The hospital ship, which is anchored in Lombok to help the victims of the quake, is sailing towards Palu, but it will take at least three days to arrive at the site of a new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has put the improvement of Indonesia’s destroyed infrastructure at the forefront of his election campaign and spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
But the financial deficit poses a problem for the Jokovo administration in re-election next year.
Yoko also faces the pressure of long-standing tensions between sects in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of religion.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands evacuated from their homes as Christian and Muslim mobs fought in the streets with swords, bows and arrows, and other primitive weapons.

The shot traveled high above the penalty area towards the upper right corner of the neck.
In the end, the <0xC5><0xBE>oga fell through the goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalage and fell into the hole.
“I was just trying to get in the right position for the ball and players like Shaq are always pulling it forward as much as I can, so I was just trying to get as much time as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kante coming, so after one touch I didn’t think much and decided to shoot.”
Chelsea led 1-0 at half time with a hit by Belgian player Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The attacker of the blues in this action with the fifth handed the ball back to Mate Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> and entered Liverpool's half.

Tsunami death toll in Indonesia rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the state-run disaster agency reported on Sunday morning.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a representative of the agency, told a news conference that there were many people as a result of Friday’s 7.5 magnitude earthquake that triggered six-metre waves trapped in the ruins of buildings.
Palu, which has a population of more than 380,000, is smashed with ruins of buildings.
Police Arrest 32-Year-Old Man on Murder Suspect After Woman Arrested to Death
Police have launched a murder investigation after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
A 44-year-old man with stab wounds was found at 7:55 a.m. at Grayson Mews on John Street and arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder.
The police call all those who have been in the area and who have seen or heard anything to make a statement.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hagan said: “The investigation is in its infancy, but I call on all those who were near John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I also invite everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have caught something on the car camera footage, to contact us, as they may have information that is crucial to our investigation.”
A police official confirmed that the woman was a resident of Birkenhead, and the body was found inside the property.
This afternoon, friends who think they know the woman came to the scene of the crime and asked where they found her this morning.
Investigations are underway and the police are informing the women.
The taxi driver, who lives in Grayson Mews, just tried to return to his apartment, but the police told him that no one should enter or exit the building.
When he found out what had happened, he was left speechless.
Residents are now told it may take several hours before they can re-enter.
Police officers have heard how he explained to the man that the entire area is now being treated as a crime scene.
A woman came to the scene, all in tears.
He kept saying, “It’s so horrible.”
At 2:00 p.m., two police vans were inside the cordon and another one just outside it.
A number of police officers stood inside the cordon and watched the residential block.
Anyone who has any information is asked to write to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 and state the journal 247 of September 30.
Cromwell's statue in parliament has become the latest memorial target of a "rewriting of history" dispute
Its removal would be a poetic right to destroy many of England's cultural and religious artifacts by fanatical adherents of Puritanism.
But the Cromwell Society described Crick’s proposal as “stupidity” and “an attempt to rewrite history.”
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “In today’s discussion of removing statues, it became clear that the image of Oliver Cromwell outside the Western Ministry Palace would become a target.”
Iconoclasm in the English Civil Wars Cromwell neither ordered nor executed.
Perhaps Cromwell will be the wrong victim for the actions of his predecessor from the last century.
The brilliant presentation of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft tells of a 19th-century opinion and is part of a history for a personality that some believe is still worth celebrating.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwella is seen by many (perhaps even later in the 19th century than today) as a protector of parliament against external pressures, in his case, of course, a monarchy.
Whether or not this is a completely accurate presentation is the subject of constant historical debate.
It is clear that the dispute in the mid-17th century shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable individual who represents one side of this division.
His achievements from his time as Lord Protector also deserve to be celebrated and commemorated.”
Chinese Farmer Killed by Slaughter Pig to Death
According to local media reports, a pig attacked and killed a farmer in a market in southwestern China.
The man, who was only identified with the surname “Yuan,” was found dead with a cut in artery and covered in blood near a pig market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
Pig measles is being prepared to vaccinate pigs on a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
She was reportedly travelling with her cousin from neighbouring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and the door of the neighbouring pig was opened.
He said there was a large male pig with a bloody sponge in the pig.
A forensic investigation confirmed that a 250-pound pig killed a farmer to death.
“Brother’s legs were bloody and smeared,” a cousin named “Wu” was quoted as saying by Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed that Yuang came to the market on Thursday at 4.40 a.m. to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that attacked Yuan was neither his nor his cousin’s.
A market manager told Evening News that the pigs had been locked in order not to attack anyone else, while police collected evidence on the scene.
Yuan's family and the management of the market are supposed to negotiate compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of swine attacks on humans have already been reported.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, with the man suffering from severe physical injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 300-kilogram pig squeezed a Welsh farmer over a tractor, but then the woman drove the animal away.
After the pigs ate a farmer from Oregon in 2012, another farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not usually attacking, but a bloody taste can act as a “thrower.”
“We’d just play.
They're like little children, very curious... they don't want to hurt you.
We just need to show them a lot of respect,” he said.
Hurricane Rosa has caused heavy rain to the southwest of the United States.
According to forecasts, Hurricane Rosa is moving towards the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico and weakening.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will bring floods to the north of Mexico and the southwest of the United States.
Rosa is a Category 1 hurricane with a wind speed of 137 km/h and is located 620 kilometers southwest of Punta Eugenie in Mexico from 5:00 a.m. on Sunday.
Rosa is expected to move to the north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, over the Pacific Ocean, a low-pressure zone is strengthening, moving eastwards towards the west coast of the United States. Rose will approach the peninsula of Baja California on Monday as a tropical storm and push high tropical humidity north-northwest to the southwest of the United States.
The rose will bring up to 250 mm of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Subsequently, tropical moisture, which will mix with the low-pressure zone, will create abundant rainfall in the broader southwestern region in the coming days.
Locally, 25 to 100 mm of rain will cause dangerous flooding, flooding and the possibility of landslides in the desert.
Due to the high tropical humidity, rainfall in some places will approach 50 to 75 mm per hour, mainly in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In the southwest, especially over most of Arizona, it is expected to rain 50 to 100 mm.
Floods are possible due to the rapid deterioration of the situation due to the widespread nature of tropical rains.
It would be very unthinkable to walk into the desert when there is a danger of tropical rain.
Heavy rains can turn canyons into hot rivers, and storms will bring local heavy winds and dust into the air.
The approaching low-pressure zone will bring local rainfall to parts of the Southern California coastline.
Precipitation above 12 mm is possible, which can lead to less flooding and slippery roads.
This will be the first rainfall for the region during the rainy season.
Some scattered tropical rainforests will begin to approach Arizona on Saturday afternoon and on Monday early in the morning, and late Monday and Tuesday rainfall will spread.
Heavy rains will spread to all sides of the sky on Tuesday and will last until Wednesday.
In October, there may be large temperature fluctuations in the United States, as the Arctic cools and the tropical areas remain quite warm.
Sometimes this causes dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
Sunday is an excellent example of the dramatic temperature difference in the central part of the United States.
There is a 20-degree difference between Kanas City in Missouri and Omaha in Nebraska and St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa.
Over the next few days, summer temperatures will try to stabilize and expand again.
Most of the central and eastern United States will enter the hot October with temperatures around 27 <0xC2><0xB0>C from the Southern Plain region to parts of the northeast.
In New York City, the temperature could be 27 <0xC2><0xB0>C on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above the average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows good above-average temperatures for the east of the United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people have mirrored Brett Kavanaugh’s interrogation
More than 20 million people on six television networks watched an interesting testimony Thursday by Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, a woman accused of sexual assault that was supposed to occur in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political pat position continued, as television stations interrupted the regular program due to Friday's last-minute turnaround: an agreement struck by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake, namely that the FBI would conduct a one-week investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Judiciary Committee that she was 100 percent convinced that Kavanaugh had touched her in a state of guilt and tried to pull her off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh said in a turbulent statement that he was 100% convinced that this did not happen.
Nielsen reports that the testimony on Friday is expected to mirror more than 20.4 million people.
The company counted the average viewership of television networks CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers were not immediately available to other networks that played the witness, including the PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network networks.
In addition, Nielsen usually has some problems with harming viewers watching the show in the offices.
For an easier performance, the viewership is similar to that of playing a football match finals or awarding the American Film Academy awards.
The Fox News Channel, whose leaders strongly support Kavanaugh’s appointment, leads a full-day hearing in front of all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers, reports Nielsen.
In second place is ABC with 3.26 million viewers.
The CBS network had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million and CNN 2.52 million viewers, reports Nielsen.
Interest remained high after the hearing, too.
Flake played a central role in Friday's drama.
After a moderate Republican’s office made a statement that he would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, on Friday morning the cameras of CNN and CBS television networks recorded how protesters shouted at him as he tried to get into the elevator to attend a hearing for the justice committee.
During the construction, he took a look for a few minutes, which was captured live by the cameras of the television house CNN.
“I’m standing here in front of you,” said a woman.
“Do you think he’s telling the truth?
You have power, while a lot of women are powerless.”
Flake said his office had made a statement, adding that he would say more at a committee hearing, and then the elevator door was closed.
All television networks were broadcast live hours later as the Justice Committee voted to hand over Kavanaugh's nomination to the Senate.
But Flake said he would only do so if they agreed that the FBI would investigate charges against the candidate next week, which was called for by a minority party of Democrats.
Flake was in part convinced by talks with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and several other senators afterwards, Flake made his decision.
Flake's vote was decisive, as it was obvious that Republicans would not have votes to appoint Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has launched an investigation by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) into charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accused of "playing political games" on Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused her plans to leave the European Union of “playing political games” with Britain’s future and undermining national interest.
British Prime Minister Therese May arrives at a Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK on September 29, 2018.
In another interview with her on the cover of the magazine, her former Secretary of State Boris Johnson escalated her attack on her so-called Chequers Brexit plan and said the proposal for Britain and the EU to pay the tariffs was second “totally absurd.”
Wayde Sims Shooting: Police Arrest Dyteon Simpson, Suspected of LSU Player's Death
Police have arrested a suspect in a fatal shooting at Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
According to police reports from Baron Rouge, 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and taken to prison on second-degree murder charges.
Officials released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson and police said that Sims had lost their sunglasses during the fight.
Police found the sunglasses on the scene and on them Simpson's DNA, CBS television supplements the WAFB television reports.
After Simpson's interrogation, the police made a statement that he confessed to shooting Wayde to death.
The bail is $350,000, the lawyer reports.
A viewer from the East Baton Rouge Parish district on Friday released a preliminary report stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the neck.
The police, for their help in the investigation that led to the arrest, thank a special unit for the refugees of the Louisiana State Police, the criminal laboratory of the State Police, the police of the Southern University and the residents of the area.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked the local law enforcement authorities for their “care and seeking justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
The 201-centimeter striker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
Last season, he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 jumps per game.
On Friday morning, LSU coach Will Wade said the team was “shocked” and “shocked” by Wayde’s death.
“That’s what worries you all the time,” Wade said.
Volcano dust ash in Mexico City
The ash, swirled by the Popocatepetl volcano, reached the southern neighborhood of Mexico’s capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday not to approach the volcano as activity in the crater increased and recorded 183 emissions of gas and ash in 24 hours.
The Center has observed several cases of thunderstorms and earthquakes.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash that covered the windshield of cars in the neighborhoods of the capital, Ciudad de Mexico, such as Xocchimilco.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in activity in the volcano, located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital, after a 7.1-degree earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, called Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after protesters in support of independence clashed with anti-aggression police units, and thousands of people joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia’s polarized vote on ouster.
A group of masked supporters of separatism, detained by anti-aggression police units, smeared them with eggs and metallic paint powder, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that are usually flooded with tourists.
Later raids also occurred, with the police having to use pendants to stop the fighting.
Supporters of independence, who for hours shouted “without forgetting, without forgiveness,” faced protesters who support unity and shouted “Long live Spain!”
According to local media reports, 14 people were more likely to be injured in the protests.
A year after the October 1 referendum, which was declared illegal in Madrid, Catalan separatists celebrated it, tensions in the region that supports independence remain.
The vast majority of voters voted for independence, although participation was low, as opponents of the secession largely boycotted the elections.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop the continuation of voting in the region's polls in violent clashes.
The independence groups camped overnight in front of the polls to prevent the demonstrations and thus support the state police.
The demonstrations continued, but they had to pave the other way.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who took part in a separatist protest with his wife, said he had no more hope of Catalonia becoming independent.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
I watched my parents cry for happiness because they could vote, but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Despite important, although close victories in the regional elections last December, Catalan parties that support independence have struggled to maintain the initiative this year, as many of the most well-known leaders are either in voluntary exile or awaiting trial for their role in exile and non-referral to the organization.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in support of the police, said the protest was fueled by politicians on both sides.
“The tension is escalating,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in custody since the end of last year before the trial began, announced that he will run for European Parliament elections next year.
“Candidating for the European elections is the best way to condemn the regression in democratic values and oppression we have seen in the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Arrested men who crashed into the house by car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested for colliding with a car several times in a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place on Ballynagard Crescent Street on Thursday at approximately 7.30 p.m. British Summer Time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the door and the building itself were damaged.
At some point, they were also supposed to shoot the car with a self-propelled gun.
With Menga's hit, Livingston won 1:0 against Rangers
Dolly Menga with his first goal for Livingston secured victory
Livingston surprised the Rangers and Steven Gerrard only had to admit his second defeat in 18 games as a coach of the club from Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's shot made the difference, as Gary Holt's team equaled the Hibernian team in second place.
Gerrard's team has thus been left without a guest victory in this year's championship, and next Sunday they are waiting for the Hearts, who lead on the rankings and who are behind by eight points.
The Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, increased his line-up of defeats in the division in six games, and head coach Holt, who replaced Kenny Miller last month, has yet to taste the defeat.
Livingston Lost Possibilities Against Direct Guests
Holt's team should be leading well before the hit, as they caused a number of problems with their directness to the Rangers.
Scott Robinson made a breakthrough, but he sent the ball over the door frame, then Alan Lithgow hit the door, and Craig Halkett shot his head over the goal.
The hosts left the game to the Rangers because they knew that they could be dangerous to the guests when interrupted in the attack.
And so they came to the key goal.
The Rangers gave Livingstone a free shot, and Declan Gallagher and Robinson prepared an action for Mengha, who shot and hit him from the middle of the penal area.
The Rangers had a greater possession of the ball, but the domestic defenses could not break through and goalkeeper Liam Kelly did not have much work to do.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly's defense.
Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor shot Scott Pittman with his leg, and Lithgow shot past the goal from another Livingston break in the attack.
The drafts continued to arrive at Livingston’s penal area, but the locals refused all attacks, two offenses – Halket’s offense against Glenn Middleton’s replacement and a hand-to-hand offense – but the referee failed to score.
“Excellent performance” Livingston – analysis
Alasdair Lamont (BBC Scotland) at Tony Macaroni Arena
Great performance and result for Livingston.
All of them were excellent and continue to exceed expectations on this path upwards.
The style of the game and the character have not changed much since their return to the top, but Holt has to be credited with the way he woke the team since his arrival.
The heroes were great.
Captain Halkett played an extremely important role and deployed a well-organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall in readiness all the time.
But the Rangers simply lacked inspiration.
Although they are exceptional under Gerrard’s leadership, they lack these standards very much.
There was a lack of shots at the goal – only once successfully defeated the host defenses – and this is a sort of wake-up call for the Rangers who were in the middle of the ladder.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an accepted mixed in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29th), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met at breakfast in Berlin, smiles and blue skies prevailed.
Today is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, aimed at improving relations between NATO allies.
There have been disputes over human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then traveled to Cologne for the opening of a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest number of Turkish population outside of Turkey.
For security reasons, police prevented 25,000 heads of the crowd from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters managed to get closer to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters, including many Kurds, who do not support Erdogan’s government also expressed their views and condemned Erdogan’s policy and the German government’s decision to welcome him into the country.
The opposing protests reflect the segregation of the visitor, which some German Turks celebrate as a hero, while others despise as an autocrat.
Deptford Road Accident: Bicycle Accident Killed in Car Race
In London, a cyclist was fatally injured in a race in which a car was involved.
The accident occurred near the intersection between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, on a road in Deptford, southeast of the city at about 10.15am British Summer Time.
The driver of the car stopped and rescuers arrived, but the man died at the scene of the accident.
The accident occurred just a few months after the cyclist died in a collision in which the driver of the car fled, on Childers Street, about 1.5 km from Saturday's crash.
Police said police are checking the identity of the man so they can notify his relatives.
They set up roadblocks and rerouted bus lines, and advised motorists to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Guards Injured in Execution
Six prison guards were injured in a riot in a heavily guarded man's prison, the prison administration said.
The riot broke out at HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire on Sunday at about 9:30 p.m. British Summer Time and is still ongoing.
Police specialists from the Tornado unit have been called in to arrange for an outcry involving eight detainees and limited to one wing.
The guards were provided with minor injuries to the face on the spot.
A prison staff representative said: “We have called specially trained staff who will take care of the detainees in HMP Long Lartin.
Six of the staff members were injured.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and it is clear that the police will take responsibility for it, and they may be further behind bars as a result.”
The HMP Long Lartin prison has more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous offenders in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison manager was in hospital care because he was attacked by a prisoner.
And last October, an anti-aggression police unit was called to jail for mediating a serious outcry in which staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Pheonix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (which may be beneficial for dry areas)
Tropical depression rarely reaches Arizona, but that’s exactly what’s likely to happen early next week, as the remaining energy of Hurricane Rosa makes its way through the southwest desert and brings the danger of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings for sudden flooding on Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to rage over Phoenix on Tuesday, but it will be raining late on Monday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix wrote in a tweet that only “ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or depression status within 300 kilometers of Phoenix since 1950!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) raged a good 60 kilometers from the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 50 to 100 mm of precipitation with individual precipitations of up to 150 mm on Mogollon Rome, Arizona.
In other areas of the southwest desert, including the Rockies and the Great Basin, precipitation of 25 to 50 mm is expected, individual precipitation of up to 100 mm is possible.
For areas beyond the danger of sudden flooding, Hurricane Rosa may be a real blessing, as the region has been hit by drought.
Although floods are a very serious problem, part of the rainfall is likely to be beneficial, as a dry period is currently taking place in the southwest.
“According to the U.S. Drought Tracking Center, about 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme drought,” reports weather.com.
Hurricane Rosa first leads to the mainland of the Mexican peninsula of Baja California.
Rosa, which still has the power of a hurricane on Sunday morning with the highest wind speed of 137 kilometers per hour, is 620 kilometers south of Punta Eugenie in Mexico and moves north at a speed of 19 kilometers per hour.
The storm comes into contact with the colder waters of the Pacific and therefore weakens.
The mainland of Mexico is expected to be hit by a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
Precipitation in parts of Mexico can be plentiful and therefore pose a high risk of flooding.
“From the Baja California peninsula to northwestern Sonora, we expect 75 to 150 mm of precipitation with a possibility of 250 mm of precipitation,” weather.com reported.
Hurricane Rosa will then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday as a tropical depression, which will then travel through Arizona and south Utah until late Tuesday night.
“The greatest danger we expect from Hurricane Rosa or its remnants is abundant rainfall on the Baja California peninsula in northwestern Sonora and in the American southwest desert,” the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
These precipitations can cause life-threatening sudden floods and floods in deserts and landslides in mountainous areas.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and 20-year-old men were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after they found a 16-year-old man with stab wounds in Somerset.
The injured teenager was found in the Excelsion Terrace area of Midsomer Norton on Saturday at around 4 a.m. British Summer Time.
He was taken to the hospital and his condition remains “stable”.
The 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old were arrested at night in the Radstock area, police in Avon and Somerset reported.
Police are calling anyone who may have picked up an incident with a mobile phone to call.
Trump says Kavanaugh has “suffered hostility and anger” from the Democratic Party
“The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the resentment and unheard-of tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh “suffered the hostility and anger” of the Democratic Party in the process of his appointment.
Kavanaugh testified in front of Congress on Thursday, clearly and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford's accusations of sexually assaulting her decades ago when they were teenagers.
At the hearing, Ford also testified about his accusations.
The president said on Saturday that “Americans saw Kavanaugh’s brilliance, quality and courage.”
“The vote to appoint Judge Kavanaugh is the vote to appoint one of the best legal minds of our time, a lawyer with an outstanding record of public service,” he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president indirectly mentioned Kavanaugh's appointment when he spoke about the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
“Five more weeks to one of the most important elections of our lives.
I’m really trying to run for office,” he said.
“That’s why I’m fighting for great candidates everywhere.”
Trump says the Democrats are on a “resistance and obstruction” mission.
The first key procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's appointment is expected to take place no later than Friday, a Republican party adviser told CNN.
In Indonesia earthquake and tsunami killed hundreds of people, the number of victims increases
Authorities on Saturday reported that at least 384 people were killed in the earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, many of which carried huge waves that swirled along the coast.
Hundreds of people gathered at a festival on the beach in the town of Palu on Friday, when six-metre waves hit the coast at dusk and many were taken to death and destroyed everything on their way.
The quake was followed by a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
“When the tsunami threatened yesterday, people remained on the beach and did not flee immediately, so they became victims,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a representative of the Indonesian disaster mitigation agency in Jakarta.
“Cunami didn’t come alone, he dragged cars, trees, houses with him, he smashed everything to the ground,” Nugroho explained, adding that the tsunami traveled across the open sea at 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
He said a few people were stranded on trees to escape the tsunami, and they survived.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
The aerial photographs, published by the Accident Agency, show destroyed buildings and shops, winding and broken bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
Earthquakes continued to rock the coastal town on Saturday.
In an area of 2.4 million people have experienced a type of earthquake.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Use of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released in Friday’s powerful earthquake was about 200 times greater than the power of the Hiroshima nuclear bomb in World War II.
The geography of the city at the end of the long and narrow bay is expected to increase the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as “extensive” and said thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
He also said that the bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under the ruins of buildings, and added that 540 people were injured and 29 were still missing.
Nugroho explained that the casualties and damage may be greater off the coast 300 km north of Palu, in the Donggal area, which is closer to the epicenter of the quake.
As Nugroho has said, the communications have been completely interrupted and there is no information from the Donggal area.
“More than 300,000 people live in the area,” the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that staff and volunteers were moving to the affected areas.
“It’s already a tragedy, but it can get even worse,” they said.
On Saturday, the agency received a number of criticisms as it did not inform the public that the tsunami had affected Palu, but officials say the waves came just at the time of the warning.
In an amateur video posted on social media, a man on the upper floor screams alerting people on the street to an impending tsunami.
Within minutes, the water wall ran along the coast and took with it buildings and cars.
Reuters couldn't immediately confirm the authenticity of the video.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a power outage that interrupted communications around Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue operations.
Authorities report that the military has begun to send cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuations are still in dire need of food and other basic necessities.
The city’s airport was only open to provide assistance and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll in the Indonesian tsunami has risen to more than 800.
It's very bad.
According to Mr. Dosebe, members of the World Vision organization from Donggale arrived safely in Palo, where employees in the courtyard in front of their premises put a shelter from swarms, but on the way they saw many scenes of devastation.
“They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses,” he said.
It's very bad.
Even when aid groups launched disaster relief initiatives, some complained that foreign humanitarian workers with a lot of experience did not allow them to come to Palo.
In accordance with Indonesian regulations, overseas funding, stocks and staff assistance are only allowed if the accident site is declared a national disaster area.
That hasn't happened yet.
“It is still being treated as a disaster at the provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, a representative of the Indonesian Red Cross.
“When the government says ‘okay, this is a national disaster,’ we can accept international aid, but there is no such status.”
The second night after Friday's earthquake and tsunami in Palu, friends and relatives of the missing hold on to the hope that their near miracles are in the sad stories of natural disasters.
The boy was pulled out of the sewer on Saturday.
On Sunday, rescuers liberated a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days, with her mother's body lying next to her.
Gendon Subandono, head coach of the Indonesian national team of sailing paragliders, trained two missing sailing paragliders for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
The others, captured at the Roa Roa Hotel, were, according to Mr. Mandagi, his students.
“As an elder in the field of sailing paragliding, I carry my emotional burden,” he said.
Gendon recalls that in the hours when news of the cancellation of the Roa Roa hotel circulated around the sailing paragliding community, he was desperate to send messages in the WhatsApp app to competitors in Palu who attended the festival on the beach.
But his messages were marked with only one grey key instead of two blue ones.
“I think that means that the messages have not been delivered,” he said.
Tates stole $26,750 while charging ATMs in downtown Newport on the Levee
According to Newport police, the dads stole $26,750 from a security officer at Brink’s, who was charging an ATM in downtown Newport on the Leeve on Friday morning.
The driver of the car emptied the ATM in the amusement complex and was preparing to deliver the money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a statement.
While he was employed, another man “approached the Brink’s security officer from behind” and stole a bag of money for delivery.
Witnesses were reportedly seen several suspects fleeing the scene, but police did not specify the exact number of those involved in the incident.
Anyone with any information about the suspect's identities should call the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changed his name to Ye
The rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
The change tweeted on Saturday: “Battle with the official name of Kanye West.”
The 41-year-old West has been nicknamed Ye for some time and has also used it for the title of his eighth album, which he released in June.
The change comes just before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, in which he is due to present his new album Yandhi.
He will replace singer Ariano grande, who canceled the show for “personal reasons,” the show’s creator said.
The word is an abbreviation of his current professional name, but West has also said that the word has a religious meaning for him.
“I think ‘ye’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible, where it means ‘you’,” West said earlier this year, when he spoke to radio host Big Boy about the title of the album.
“I am you and I am all of us.
Kanye, which means “the only” I turned into Ye – it reflects our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
The album is a reflection of everything we are.”
Kanye is one of the many famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs named himself Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, and this year he expressed a desire for the names Love and Brother Love.
A former West collaborator, JAY-Z, also used his name differently; with or without thought and in capital letters.
Mexican President Amlo vows not to use the military against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andress Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country nears its 50th anniversary of bloody violence against students.
On Saturday, Lopez Obrador promised to “never use the military to repress the Mexican people.”
At a time when leftist student movements began to operate in Latin America, at peaceful demonstrations in the square on October 2, 1968, soldiers began shooting and killing 300 people.
Lopez Obrador vowed to support young Mexicans and provide monthly grants to students and to open several free public universities.
He said that unemployment and the lack of opportunities for education draw young people into criminal societies.
U.S. Should Double Artificial Intelligence Funding
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the funds it spends on research in the field, says investor and AI expert Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after various parts of the U.S. government have announced the use of artificial intelligence, although the U.S. does not have an official strategy for artificial intelligence.
In the meantime, last year, China presented its plan: their goal is to become the best in innovation in the field of artificial intelligence by 2030.
“Doubling the budget for artificial intelligence research would be a good start, given that all other countries are pretty much for the U.S. and we are looking for the next breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence,” Lee said.
Doubling funding could double the chances of the next big achievement in the field of artificial intelligence happening in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” (Superpowers of Artificial Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order) was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, the publisher of the book, is the president of the company SinoVentures.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he developed a system of artificial intelligence that defeated the highest-ranking American player in the game Othello, and later became the CEO of Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee said he was familiar with previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) robotics competition, and asked when he would be able to find his next visionary.
Researchers in the U.S. must work hard if they want to receive state support, Lee said.
“It’s not China that takes over the best academics, it’s companies,” Lee said.
Facebook, Google, and other tech companies have been hiring the best of the university in recent years to develop artificial intelligence.
Lee also said that changes in immigration policy could help the U.S. strengthen efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
“I think people with a PhD in Artificial Intelligence should automatically be offered a green card,” he said.
In July 2017, the Chinese State Council released a development plan for the next generation of artificial intelligence.
China’s National Foundation for Natural Sciences is funding people in academic institutions, similar to the National Science Foundation and other government organizations are allocating money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work is worse in China, Lee explained.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, which brings together partners from the industrial and academic sectors, and the White House announced the establishment of a narrower AI committee.
This month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in the AI Next initiative.
The National Science Foundation (NSF) is currently investing more than $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
Meanwhile, U.S. law, which wanted to create the National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence, has done nothing for months.
Macedonians will decide on changing the name of the country in a referendum
Macedonian citizens voted on Sunday in a referendum on whether to change the name of their country to “Republic of North Macedonia”, thus resolving a decades-long dispute with Greece, which opposed their request for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia, insists that the name of its northern neighbor represents a right to their territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
The government reached an agreement in June on the basis of a proposed new name, but nationalist opponents say the change will destroy the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority of Macedonians.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign expressed doubts that participation would be at least 50 votes, as necessary for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum list was: “Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with the adoption of an agreement with Greece?”
Supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this is the price to be paid to join bodies such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the breakup of Yugoslavia.
Today I came to vote for the future of the country and for the young people in Macedonia to be able to live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because that means safer lives for all of us,” said 79-year-old Olivera Georgievska in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, enough Members of Parliament have acted to respect the result of a vote that will be decisive.
The change of name requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission said there were no irregularities reported by 1 p.m.
However, participation was only 16 percent compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters cast their vote.
“I came to vote because of my children, our city is in Europe,” said Gjosa Tanevski, 62, a voter from the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Du<0xC5><0xA1>ko gave their ballots in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018 for a referendum in Macedonia on changing the name of the country, which would pave the way for NATO and the European Union.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small oration and placed chairs in front of tents set by those who will boycott the referendum.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads up, not through the back door,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of Eurasian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
“I believe that the vast majority will be in favour because more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after sending his ballot.
He added that the positive result would be “confirmation of our future.”
A poll published by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research on Monday showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would take part in the referendum, which is less than the required turnout.
A second poll conducted by the Macedonian television network Telma showed that 57 percent of respondents would vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent would vote in favour.
In order for the referendum to be successful, the voter turnout must be 50% plus one vote.
An unsuccessful referendum would mean the first serious blow to the pro-Western government's policy that took office last May.
Watch: Manchester City’s Sergio Aguero has defeated Brighton’s entire defense and battling
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling played Brighton's defense at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England on Saturday in a 2-0 win over Manchester City.
Aguere's hit in the 65th minute looked ridiculously easy.
At the start of the action, the Argentine attacker took a shot in the middle of the field.
He ran between three Brighton defenders and found an open space.
Aguera was then surrounded by four green players.
He beat one defensive player and was faster than the others on the edge of Brighton's crime scene.
Then he handed Sterling to his left.
With his first touch in the penalty area, the English striker returned the ball to Aguera, who defeated Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with his right foot and sent the ball to the right side of the net.
“Aguero is struggling with leg problems,” City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We agreed to play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky to have hit the goal in that moment.”
But Sterling was the one who provided the blues' sons with an initial advantage in the first English league doubles.
He scored in the 29th minute.
In this action, Aguero took the ball deep into Brighton's half.
On the left hand side, he gave Leroy Sane a nice hand.
Sane touched the ball several times, then sent the ball to Sterling towards the remote gate.
The assailant of the blue blues threw the ball into the net just before it landed past the naked.
City will meet Hoffenheim at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany in the group stage of the Champions League on Tuesday at 12.55.
Scherzer wants to play against the Rockies and spoil their chances of title
The Nationals team has fallen out of the finals, so there's no special reason for a new attack.
But always competitive Scherzer hopes to be able to climb a metal hill against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday. This will only happen if the Rockies still have a chance to play in the final, as in the Western League they have an advantage over the Los Angeles Dodgers.
The Rockies won 5–2 against the Nationals on Friday, securing the least invitation from the organiser, but are still waiting for their first title in the division.
“Although we can’t get anything, at least we will be able to play in a great atmosphere in front of a big crowd here in Denver and the opposing team will play at probably the highest level this year.
“Why wouldn’t you want to compete?”
The Nationals have yet to release the names of the first metal band for Sunday, but in this case it is likely that the metal will be Scherzer.
Scherzer, who will be the first metal to be the 34th, is a heavy metal player on Thursday and would have had enough days off by Sunday.
Washington's right-hander collected 18 wins and 7 defeats this season with an average of 2.53 runs and 300 eliminations with 220 2/3 changes this season.
Trump at Constituent Assembly in West Virginia
The president indirectly touched on the situation regarding his election to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh, when he spoke about the importance of Republican electoral participation in the midterm elections.
"Everything we've done will be at stake in November.
Five more weeks to one of the most important elections in our lives.
It’s going to be one of the biggest – I’m really trying to run, so I’m fighting everywhere for great candidates,” he said.
Trump said: “We have this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, and that’s what’s happening now.
They're determined to take power again, using all possible means, and you can see awkwardness, evil.
However, they do not care who they are hurting, whom they must tread in order to gain power and control, for that is what they want, power and control, but we will not give it to them.”
According to him, the Democrats are on a mission of “resistance and obstruction.”
“And you’ve seen that in the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “angry, evil, low-key, and false.”
He named the member of the Justice Committee, Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, with a loud disapproval from the audience.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you publish the document?
Hmm, hmm, what.
No, um, no, I'm not, wait, it was a really bad body language, the worst I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer open to different views.
To those who express their opinion, she is impatient.
When a Momentum activist told me in my local party that I had no confidence, it was not a surprise.
After all, I am the last in the line of Members of Parliament from the Labour Party who are not welcome to express their opinion.
My fellow Member Joan Ryan has done the same thing because she has strongly resisted anti-Semitism.
In my case, it was a distrust proposal for my disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
With regard to the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe. Ironically similar issues on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
In the announcement for Friday’s Labour Party meeting, Nottingham East wrote that “we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
In the eight years I was a member of the local Labour Party parliament, the Friday meetings were mostly exactly that.
Unfortunately, this tone is not used in most meetings today, and the promise of a “friendly and gentler” policy has long been forgotten if it ever started.
It is increasingly evident that different views in the Labour Party are not permissible and it is judged at every opinion whether this is acceptable for the leadership of the party.
This started shortly after Jeremy became the leader, and colleagues I previously thought we were sharing similar political views were expecting me to change my mind and take positions that I would never agree with if the EU hadn’t agreed to, should it be one national or one national issue.
When I speak publicly – and it doesn’t really matter what I say – they follow the criticisms on social networks that call for non-choice, condemn the politics of the middle and tell me that I shouldn’t be in a Labour party.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments are intended for me, only political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face a flood of sexist or racist insults on a daily basis, but do not let themselves be frightened.
One of the most regrettable aspects of this period of politics is how rates of abuse have become quite commonplace.
Jeremy Corbyn explained last week that the Labour Party must promote a culture of tolerance.
But the reality is that we are no longer open to differing opinions and with each proposal of distrust or changing the rules for the choice of the party becomes more narrow-minded.
In the last two years, I’ve received a lot of advice to keep my head down and not be so loud, but it’s going to be “all right” with me.
But I didn’t go into politics because of that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student – the reason for this was the negligence of the Tatcher government, which literally caused the classroom in my primary school to collapse – I, as a local saint or minister of government, have tried to take on the best needs for their better public services, for those who do not.
I have never concealed my political convictions, including the last election.
No one in the Nottingham East party could have been confused by my political views and areas on which I disagreed with the current leadership.
To those who supported the proposal on Friday, I just want to say that I do not understand their desire to take the time and energy to discuss my allegiance to the leader of the Labour Party at a time when the state is moving towards a Brexit that will affect households, businesses and our public services.
But my real message is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my voters, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to have served you, and I promise you that no threat of non-election or political suitability will distract me most of all from this.

Ayr 38:17 Melrose: undefeated Ayr on top of the ladder
Two well-known attempts have slightly distorted the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved a win in this wonderfully entertaining first game of the day.
Now they are at the top of the rankings and they are the only team out of ten.
In the end, their top defense and better use of the opportunity transferred the balance to the home side and coach Peter Murchie had good reason to be satisfied.
“We have passed a lot of tests in our games so far and we are still undefeated, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: “Congratulations to Ayra’s team, the opportunities have been taken better than we have.”
Grant Anderson's 14-minute hit by Frazier Climo led Ayr to the lead, but the yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, which he received in a game with the Warriors, meant a numerical overstatement for Melrose and Jason Baggott ran away without attempt.
Climo increased the lead for Ayr at the time of the offense before hitting at halftime and then converting an independent attempt to a score of 17:5 for Ayr at the break.
But Melrose started the second half very well and Patrick Anderson's attempt to convert Baggot reduced the lag to five points.
There followed a long interruption due to Ruaridha Knott's serious injury to the carrier, and Ayr subsequently advanced with Stafford McDowall's attempt to convert Climo.
Temporary captain Ayra Blair MacPherspon then received a yellow card and Melrose re-used the game with the player more with an unstoppable attempt by Bruce Colvine at the end of a period of heavy pressure.
But the hosts returned and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for obstructing the ballless Clima, MacPherson hit the attack.
Climo reached points after Kyle Rowe shot down David Armstrong and sent wingman Gregor Henry in the host's fifth attempt.
Star of the series Still Game begins a new career in hospitality
Still Game star Ford Kieran is apparently turning into a restaurant, at least to become the director of a licensed company with restaurants.
The 56-year-old in a popular BBC series, for which he also wrote the script, plays Jack Jarvis along with longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The two announced that after the upcoming ninth season it was their last, and it seems that Kiernan is already planning a life after Craiglang.
According to the official documentation, the director of the company is Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, but the source told the Scottish Sun that Kiernan wanted to join Glasgow's "flowering hospitality."
“The sea is ours”: Bolivia, which has no access to the sea, hopes that the court will reopen the way to the Pacific
The Marines are patrolling the Navy headquarters in La Paz.
The naval blue flags have been ejected from the public buildings.
The sea bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are covered with the slogan: “We have a right to the sea.
It’s our duty to get it back.”
In mainland Bolivia, the memory of the loss of the coast in a bloody dispute over natural resources with Chile in the 19th century is still alive – as is the longing for re-swimming across the Pacific Ocean.
This hope is perhaps the highest in decades now, as Bolivia is awaiting a decision by the International Court of Justice, which will be received after five years of consultation on October 1.
“Bolivia has a drive, a spirit of unity and impartiality and, of course, expects a positive outcome,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will look at the International Court of Justice’s decision on large screens across the country and hope that the tribunal in The Hague will decide in favour of Bolivia, which claims that, after decades of turbulent talks, Chile must negotiate access to Bolivia.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic native president, who is awaiting a controversial re-election battle next year, also has high expectations about Monday’s ruling.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court will not decide in favor of Bolivia – and even if it did, it would not change much.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no authority to assign Chilean territory to Bolivia, and will not decide on the outcome of any talks.
The fact that the International Court of Justice’s decision comes just six months after the final arguments have been heard means that the case “was not complicated,” said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And for the past four years, they have not spoken in favour of Bolivia, but they may have cost it a lot.
“The current Bolivian government has taken advantage of the issue of access to the sea,” Z<0xC3><0xA1>ratejeva said.
Morales's aggressive rhetoric has ripped off all the goodwill that may have remained from the Chileans, she explained.
The talks between Bolivia and Chile will continue at some point, but after that it will be extremely difficult to participate in the discussions.
The United States has not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltzé, the Bolivian representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court had taken a decision unusually quickly.
On Monday, he said, Bolivia will have an “extraordinary opportunity for a new period of relations with Chile” and an opportunity to “end 139 years of mutually beneficial disagreements.”
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of the most popular Latin American presidents – used the maritime issue as a political backing.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific,” he added.
“Decision is an opportunity to see that we have to overcome the past.”
North Korea Says Nuclear Disarmament Will Not Happen If It Cannot Trust The U.S.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his people would never be the first to destroy their nuclear weapons if they could not trust Washington.
Ri made a speech at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to deliver on its promises made at a meeting between the leaders of rival countries in Singapore.
His statement comes at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is clearly ahead of a relaunch of nuclear diplomacy, which was at a dead end, more than three months after meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Ri says the U.S. is wrong if they think the continuation of sanctions and the deal predicts the end of the Korean War will put North Korea on its knees.
Washington is cautious about fixing the announcement without Pyongyang first taking decisive action to disarm.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second meeting.
But there is a general doubt that Pyongyang is serious about giving up the weapons the country sees as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
At fashion magazines in Paris unveil the latest line of huge covers that come to stores with affordable brands near you
If you want to replenish your collection of covers or completely hide from the sun, you don’t have to look ahead.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled a collection of bizarre oversized covers that dazzled the style of Paris Fashion Week in their spring and summer 2019 collections on the fashion lane.
Very impractical covers flooded Instagram this summer, and the designers posted their spectacular creations on the fashion track.
The most prominent piece of Valentine’s piece was a beige hat with wide stripes decorated with feather-like accessories in which the heads of the models were completely lost.
Other oversized fashion accessories included shavings with gemstones, a magic hat, and even pineapple – but your heads won’t get hot.
Thom Browne also showed the choice of bizarre masks – just the right time for Halloween.
Many colored masks have stitched lips and are more similar to Hannibal Lecter masks than high fashion.
One creation was similar to diving equipment with a breather and glasses, and the other was looking like a cornet with a melted ice cream.
And if you want to follow fashion, you're in luck.
Fashion connoisseurs predict that giant covers will come to shops near you.
Wide hats closely follow “La Bombi”, a straw hat with 60-centimeter laces was observed on Rihanna and Emily Ratajkowski, among others.
The iconic brand of extremely impractical hats, which flooded social networks, sent another great creation along the fashion lane – a straw bag for the beach that was almost as big as the model in the swimsuit she wore.
The raffle bag in a burning orange color, lined with raffle straps and a white leather handle, was the central piece of the La Riviera collection by Jacquemus for spring/summer 2019 at the Paris Fashion Week.
Famous designer Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect big hats and beach bags to arrive in stores next summer – because the designer made such a strong impression, the demand for too big accessories would be hard to ignore.”
John Edward: Knowledge of languages is crucial for global citizens
Scotland’s independent schools enjoy the fame of academic excellence and this continued in 2018 with another set of outstanding exam results, further reinforced by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other community endeavors.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council for Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the highest level of service for their students and their parents.
Independent schools want to prepare their students for further and higher education, the chosen career path and the city they have as global citizens.
As the education sector that can design and implement a tailored school program, we see that modern languages are still a popular and desirable subject of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you talk to a man in a language he understands, the conversation is imprinted in his memory.
But if you speak to a man in his mother’s tongue, words are imprinted in his heart.”
It is a good reminder that we should not rely solely on English when we want to establish relationships and trust with people from other countries.
This year’s results of recent exams show that languages are at the top of the rankings with the highest levels of achievement in independent schools.
68% of the students who learned a foreign language achieved an excellent grade.
Data collected in 74 schools of the Scottish Council for Independent Schools (SCIS) showed that 72% of pupils achieved an excellent score in Mandarin, and an excellent score was also obtained by 72% of pupils of German, and 69% of pupils of French.
This proves that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as a key knowledge that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are treated as an elective subject in the curricula of independent schools and elsewhere in the same way as subjects in the fields of natural sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics.
A 2014 survey by the UK Employment and Training Commission found that 17 per cent of the reasons why employers are being tortured to fill vacancies can be attributed to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly necessary in preparing young people for their future career path.
When it comes to future employment opportunities that require language skills, these skills are essential in the global world.
If someone learns another language, regardless of the career path they choose, with such lifelong knowledge, they have a great advantage in the future.
A multilingual person who can communicate directly with people from foreign countries has an automatic advantage over competition.
A 2013 YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK found that 75 percent of people did not speak a foreign language well enough to speak, with French being the only language spoken by 15 percent, a two-person percentage point.
Therefore, investing in language learning is important for today’s children.
By learning more languages, especially those from developing economies, children have a better chance of finding the right job.
In Scotland, schools differ in the languages they teach.
Many schools focus on more classical modern languages, while others teach languages that are expected to be the most important for the UK in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s interests, it will always be possible to choose a number of languages taught by professionals in this field in independent schools.
Scotland’s independent schools are committed to providing a learning environment that will prepare and equip children with the knowledge they need to succeed, regardless of what the future brings.
In a global business environment, it cannot be denied that languages remain extremely important for the future of the country, so this must also be expressed in education.
In fact, modern languages should be treated as ‘international communication skills’.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence for young people in Scotland.
We have to do it right.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish World of Independent Schools.
LeBron to make his San Diego debut in Lakers' jersey on Sunday
For fans looking forward to LeBron James’ first appearance for the Los Angeles Lakers, the wait will soon be over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday's pre-season opening match against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
He doesn’t know how many minutes he’ll play.
“More than one and less than 48,” Walton explained on the Lakers team’s official website.
Lakers team's official reporter Mike Trudell wrote on Twitter that James is likely to play for a few minutes.
After training at the beginning of this week, James was asked about his plans for six Lakers games ahead of the season.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need a game before the season,” he said.
Trump's Assembly in West Virginia on YouTube
President Donald Trump today in Wheeling, West Virginia, is launching a series of congresses in his campaign.
This is the first of Trump’s five planned assemblies next week, including a stopover in his favorite countries, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
Since his vacancy in the Supreme Court has not yet been confirmed, Trump wants to gain support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans are threatened with losing control of Congress after the November vote.
What time will Trump’s assembly be in West Virginia and where can he be seen online?
Trump’s rally in Wheeling, West Virginia will be held on Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 7 p.m.
You can watch Trump’s reunion in West Virginia live on YouTube.
Trump is likely to talk about hearings of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh this week, which have become strained over allegations of sexual misconduct, causing confirmation in the Senate to be expected to be postponed by one week for the FBI to conduct an investigation.
But the primary goal of this series of elections is to help Republicans, who are awaiting important elections in November, get a fresh start.
That’s why in President Trump’s campaign, these five assemblies were intended “to encourage volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and increase the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives,” Reuters reports.
“Surveillance in Congress is so important to his program that the president will travel to as many countries as possible during the campaign season,” Trump’s campaign spokesman, who does not want to be named, told Reuters.
Today’s rally at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, West Virginia MetroNews radio reported, could also be attended by supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, attracting interest from the Pittsburgh media.
On Saturday, Trump will visit West Virginia for the second time in the last month, in which he received more than 40 percent points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is lagging behind in public opinion polls.
“For Morrisey, it is a bad sign that the president must come and ‘lift him up’ in public opinion research,” Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team still wants to win and keeps hope ahead of Sunday’s individual duels
After three unilateral games, the Saturday afternoon duel of two duels (foursomes) may have been what the Ryder Cup needed this year.
The downhill swing is a completely fictional sporting concept, but players really believe in it, especially in such competitions.
So where did the transfer go now?
“They had six points ahead, but now they have four, so it’s probably a new start for us,” Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
Europe has an advantage, of course, as it leads by four points, and twelve more can be won.
But, according to Spieth, Americans feel that they have wind in their sails, in addition to being encouraged by the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each won three points out of four.
Spieth was fatal from the initial stroke to the greenery and gives a good example.
The screams of luck continued to become louder and led to a decisive blow, when Thomas and they equalized with two points behind in the fourth game.
The striker, who gave them a win on the 15th hole, sent a similar scream, one that you know he believes the American team still has a chance.
“You just have to find your inner strength and focus on your game,” Spieth said.
That’s all that’s left for the players.
18 to the slave.
The only player with more points than Spieth and Thomas have had in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed story of Ryder's Cup.
An unusual but charming pair of Europe has won four points out of four and are infallible.
The two “Molliwoods” were the only ones that didn’t hit the bug on Saturday afternoon, and the bugs were also avoided on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and at the last nine holes on Friday morning.
Such a game and the way in which the energy flows between them and the noisy audience, confirms the fact that those are the players who will have to beat them on Sunday, and no other player would be able to better seal the possible victories of Europe.
Possibly both at the same time.
But talking about the European celebration would be premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly defeated Sergio Garcio, the morning hero in a four-ball game that was paired with Alex Noren.
Due to bugs and two double bugs on the first nine holes, the Spaniard and Sweden fell into a crisis from which they could not find a way out.
Players will not have any help on Saturday.
Games with four balls and a duel of two pairs are exceptionally interesting to watch closely due to the communication between the pairs, the tips they give themselves, the tips they do not give themselves, and the way in which the strategy can change in a moment.
Europe has played better than the team so far and has a big advantage over the last day, but the two-two fights have shown that the U.S. team also has a desire to win, which some, especially on the U.S. side, have doubted.
Europe lead 10:6 before the last day of Ryder Cup
Europe goes on the final day of Ryder's Cup with a nice lead after Saturday's four-ball and two-double-double games lead 10-6 against the United States.
The excellent pair, consisting of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, scored their best and with two wins over Tiger Woods and four points at Le Golf National.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who is trying to win the trophy she lost two years ago at Hazeltin, had in the morning games with four balls overpowered the American team, who made a mistake, and led in a series of 3:1.
The U.S. team fought better in a two-game duel where they won two games, but could not make up for the delay.
Jim Fury's team needs eight points out of Sunday's 12 individual doubles to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European novice to win four consecutive points, while Molinari (a pair dubbed "Molliwood") is the second pair to win four points in their first four games in Ryder Cup history after a sensational weekend.
After winning over Woods and Patrick Reed in a four-ball game, they then turned up again and won even more convincingly the spent Woods and American novelist Bryson Dechambeau with 5 and 4.
Woods, who pulled through two games on Saturday, showed his brilliance for a moment, but lost 19 of the 29 games in a four-ball duel and two-double duel, seven of which in a row.
Justin Rose, who was rested for the morning game with four balls, returned for a two-double duel and, in pairs with Henrik Stenson with 2 and 1, defeated Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koeopko, who were ranked first and third in the world rankings.
But on a pleasant, windy day in the southwestern part of Paris, not everything went according to the plans of the European team.
Three-time winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a new benchmark for Americans on Saturday with two points.
With 2 and 1, they won decisively against the Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in a four-ball game and later returned, defeating Poulter and Rory McIlroy with 4 and 3 in the doubles of two doubles, losing the first two holes.
Only once in the history of Ryder's Cup, the team returned after a four-point retracement ahead of individual duels, although Furyk's team only needs an equaliser to keep the trophy.
But after two days in another place, a Sunday counter-attack may seem too big for her.
North Korea: "Without confidence, we will not disarm unilaterally"
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the continued implementation of sanctions is causing growing distrust of the United States and that under such conditions, North Korea will certainly not unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons.
At an annual meeting of the World Authority’s General Assembly, Ri Jong Ho said that North Korea had taken a number of “important measures in the past year to show the goodwill,” such as stopping nuclear and missile tests from being carried out, and bolstering the cities for nuclear weapons.
"However, we do not see an appropriate response from the United States," he said.
“Without confidence in the United States, we will not be confident in state security and under such conditions, we will not be the first to unilaterally disarm.”
While Ri reiterated North Korea’s well-known complaints about Washington’s resistance to a protracted approach to nuclear disarmament, in which North Korea would be rewarded for adopting protracted measures, his statement was an important step in the process because it did not immediately become a matter of urgency.
Ri made a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump from the first summit between the current U.S. president and the North Korean leader held in Singapore on June 12, at which time Kim pledged to strive for a "nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula."
North Korea wants an official end to the Korean War, which took place between 1950 and 1953, but the United States said Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also refused to allow calls for the release of stringent international sanctions that apply to North Korea.
“The U.S. insists that we must first nuclear disarmament, and escalates the pressure with sanctions in order to achieve its goals by force, and even opposes the declaration of the end of the war,” Ri said.
“The idea that sanctions could put us on our knees is an unrealistic hope for people who don’t know us at all.
The problem, however, is that the continued implementation of the sanctions further deepens our distrust.”
Ri did not mention the plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. president laid out at the U.N. Assembly earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean President Mun Jae-in over the past five months, adding: “If we were to talk to South Korea about the nuclear disarmament problem,” rather than the US, the nuclear non-disarmament facility would not be able to do so.
Still, the tone of Rije’s speech was quite different from last year when the United Nations General Assembly said an attack on the U.S. mainland with North Korean missiles was unavoidable after Trump described Kim as a “self-propelled missile mission.”
Last year, Trump, who threatened to “completely destroy” North Korea, praised Kim and his courage in taking disarmament measures at the U.N. Assembly, but said he had a lot of work to do and that the sanctions must remain unreliable until they come into effect.
On Wednesday, Trump said there was no expected time frame for this, saying: “It can take two years, three years or five months – it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia are of the opinion that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: “The UN Security Council must resolutely continue to impose sanctions without exception until we recognize the complete, definitive and verified state of nuclear disarmament.”
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously adopted additional sanctions on North Korea in order to prevent funding of North Korea's nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Rio on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly and later said Pyongyang would visit again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not end well.
When he left Pyongyang in July, he said progress had been made and North Korea had already criticised him in a matter of hours for his demands to be “gangsterish.”
North Korea, at a meeting with Muna this month, has pledged to submerge the missile test station and nuclear testing infrastructure if the United States takes “appropriate measures”.
Kim is said to have said that “appropriate measures” are meant to provide the security assurances Trump promised in Singapore, as well as measures to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard University students attend a course in which they learn how to take enough time to rest
The goal of this year’s new course at Harvard University is for all undergraduate students to learn how to afford more sleep. With such a course they want to fight against the growing mascous culture of “full-year” learning, in which the powers accumulate with caffeine.
A university professor found that students at the best university in the world often do not know the basics of caring for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham Women's Hospital, designed a course that was his first of its kind in the United States.
To carry out such a course, he decided after his lecture on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
At the end of the lecture, a girl approached him and said, “Why am I only learning this now that I’m in my last year?”
She said that no one had ever told her how important sleep was, and for The Daily Telegraph, the professor said it surprised her.
The course, which is being run for the first time this year, talks about the crucial importance of good sleep habits for study and sports success as well as for improving overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the university’s executive director of health services, says they decided to take such a course when they found that students were significantly sleep deprived during the week.
The one-hour course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section, the picture is the door of a student’s home, where students can click on coffee cups, curtains, sports shoes, and books to get information about the impact of caffeine and light, the impact of lack of sleep on sports success, and the importance of a sleep routine.
In the second section, participants learn that long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of cardiac arrest, stroke, depression, and cancer.
The map of the student settlement with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
“We know that the behavior of the students will not change immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to get acquainted with these facts, just as they have the right to know how their health is affected by cigarette smoking,” adds Professor Czeisler.
The professor says that the culture of pride in “sustainable whole-night learning” is still present. He also adds that modern technology and increasing pressure on students, resulting in lack of sleep, pose growing problems.
Professor Czeisler says that a sufficient amount of quality sleep should be the “secret weapon” of students to fight stress, exhaustion and anxiety. This way, they can also avoid gaining weight – the brains of non-sleep-deprived people like to go into hunger mode.
A 19-year-old California student of chemistry and physical biology, Raymond So, helped Professor Cheisler design the course. He attended one of the professors' lectures during his first year at Harvard last year.
He says that the lecture opened his eyes and encouraged him to conduct the course throughout the student settlement.
He hopes that in the next phase of the postgraduate student will be able to request to complete a similar study program before enrolling in a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students set their alarm clock to sleep as well as wake up. He also wants to warn them of the harmful effects of “blue light” emitted by electronic displays and LED lighting, as they can cause an imbalance of the circadian rhythm.
Livingston : Rangers <0x3D> 1 : 0 Menga scoring that Gerrard's team
Rangers defeated again in the guest appearances: Dolly Menga in Livingston's announced team Steven Gerrard sentenced to a 1–0 defeat.
The Ibrox team hunted their first guest win after a February victory at St. Johnstone Stadium with 4:1, but Gary Holt's team gave her a second defeat in 18 games since he led the Gerrard team, leaving his team for the leading team of the Scottish League that 8th.
Menga attacked seven minutes before the end of the first half, and the selected Rangers did not give the impression that they wanted to equalize.
With this, the Rangers fell to a frequent spot, and Livingston advanced to third, but with a goal difference the team Hibernian lagged behind.
The Rangers' problem with this was not over yet. Calum Spence, a side judge, suffered a head injury when, after reportedly, an object arrived from the city of the fans' visiting team.
Gerrard, who easily defeated Ayr and entered the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup, made eight changes.
On the other hand, Holt held on to the verified eleven Livingstones, who took the Hearts point a week earlier, and was undoubtedly thrilled with how his runaway team effectively neutralized all guest attempts.
The Rangers had a higher possession of the ball, but Livingston made better use of it.
The first opportunity came just two minutes after the start, when Menga found Scott Pittman with his first brief submission, who then set off on Allan McGregor's goal, but the tie was inaccurate in performance and missed the opportunity.
A long free shot by Keaghan Jacobs then reached Captain Craig Halkett, but the balls then his defensive assistant Alan Lithgow failed to score.
In the last third, the Rangers took control, but the game showed more hope than the actual desire to win.
Alfredo Morelos was quite convinced that after a 15-minute race against Steven Lawless, a penalty shootout would have to be allowed, but Judge Steven Thomson stuck the Colombian's request in caliber.
The Rangers managed to score only two shots in the first half, but not a shot with the head sent by Lassana Coulibaly against the goal, nor the blunt ball of Ovie Ejar, nothing posed any danger to goalkeeper Liam Kelly.
Livingston’s 34th minute goal may have surprised everything, but he was already fully deserved for his persistence.
The Rangers failed to capture yet another Jacobs sequel with a long run.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher brought the ball to Scott Robinson, who routinely prepared the menu for an easy end to the attack.
Gerrard took action and, during Coulibaly's break, replaced wingman Ryan Kent, who immediately turned out to be giving Morelos, but Kelly effectively flowed from his line and blocked the attack.
However, Livingstone continued in his style and forced the guests into his game, with Lithgow and Halkett making several appearances in front of the goal.
Holt's team could increase the lead by the end of the match, but McGregor effectively neutralized Jacobs, and then Lithgow was inaccurate from the corner.
At the Rangers, Glenn Middleton was given a penalty shootout at the end of the match after contact with Jacobs, but was not recognized by Judge Thomson.
Almanach: The Inventor of the Geiger Counter
We present a page from the almanac of our Sunday editions: on September 30, 1882, that is to say, on the present day more than 136 years ago, Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany, who later became a world-famous physicist.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, this invention was the basis for the development of a device called a Geiger counter.
This has become a constant in the scientific world, and has also gained its place in pop culture, say in the 1950 film Bells of Coronado, in which Roy Rogers and Dale Evans play a cowboy scientist:
Man: “What the hell is that?”
Rogers: “This is Geiger’s counter. It is used to find radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put on your headphones, you can hear the effect that radioactivity has on atoms in materials.”
Evans: “Madonna, they’re really advertising now!”
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
The invention with his name lives on.
New Cancer Vaccine Could Teach the Immune System to Recognize Attack Cells
New Cancer Vaccine May Teach the Immune System to Identify and Destroy Attacking Cells
Vaccine as part of therapy teaches the immune system to recognize attacking cells
This method involves obtaining the patient's immune cells, which are then transformed in the laboratory
After that, they can "see" the protein, which is characteristic of many forms of cancer, then they are returned to the patient
The results of the test vaccine are very encouraging in patients with very different cancers.
In one of the women who received the vaccine, which the immune system learns to recognize the attacking cells, ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
This method involves obtaining the patient’s immune cells, which they transform in the laboratory so that they can “see” the HER2 protein, which is characteristic of many forms of cancer, and then injecting it again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Institute for Cancer Research in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “promotes the growth of several different types of cancer,” including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancer.
A similar approach to obtaining the immune cells of patients who are “learned” to target cancer cells also worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West performed at SNL and performed a pro-Trump score with the caption MAGA on the drop.
The audience wasn’t thrilled.
Kanye West was swayed in the Saturday Night Live studio by a strange point during which he voiced support for U.S. President Donald Trump, and also said he would run for the presidency in 2020.
After the performance ended with his third song, called “Ghost Town,” in which he wore a hood with the inscription “Make America Great Again,” West began an attack on the Democrats and again expressed his support for Trump.
“It often happens that I talk to a white person and he says, ‘How can you like Trump, because he’s a racist?’”
“Well, if I was worried about racism, I should have moved out of America a long time ago,” he says.
This time the SNL show began with a parody with Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood actor dived from the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh before the Senate Judiciary Commission, which Christine Blasey Ford accused of sexual assault.
The video of West's monologue was not played, but was uploaded to social networks by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not known if Rock was going to go crazy from West.
West also complained to the audience, among other things, that he had some problems in his back due to typing on the drop.
“They’ve come to me behind the scenes.
They said, "Don't go to that or that head."
I've been superseded!
“They say I’m lost,” he said, according to a report by the Washington Examiner.
West continued, “You want to see a lost scene?” and added that he had to say, “Superman’s hug because it means no one can tell me. Do you want the world to move on?
Try it out with love.”
His remarks made the audience at least twice a whistle, and members of the SNL team were clearly embarrassed, and someone told Vanity: “There was a death silence in the studio.”
West was invited to a goat replacement for Ariano Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days before.
West has already caused a lot of surprise with the video for the song "I Love It", where he wore the costume of the Perrier mineral water bottle.
Westa supported Candace Turner, the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, who tweeted: “One of the most courageous souls: THANK YOU FOR UPLOADING paradise.”
Talking show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West is simply “what it is, and that’s all right.
However, I will NOT reward someone (by buying his music, clothing or supporting his “art”) who, in my opinion, welcomes and spreads an ideology that is harmful to our community.
He's free.
Me too,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and will from now on "beat, formally known as Kanye West. Now I'm YE."
He is not the first musician to decide to change his name. Before him did Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His resident colleague Snoop Dogg once called himself Snoop Lion, but we can’t forget another musical legend: Prince changed his name to a symbol, and then he was the Artist, once known as Prince.
Man Accused of Attempting to Kill Person in Belfast Restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed to death in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
Police say the incident happened in Ballyhackamor.
The defendant is due to appear before a court in Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington vehemently opposes toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his smashing sword as Jonah Snow in HBO's exciting medieval-coloured fantasy series Game of Thrones.
A 31-year-old actor, who has sharply condemned the stereotype of a masculine hero, says that due to the appearance of such roles on screens, young boys often feel that they can only earn respect with sustainability.
Kit told The Sunday Times Culture that in his opinion something went wrong, and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity during the <0x23>JazTudi movement.
The actor, who recently married 31-year-old Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, has admitted that he has strong convictions on the subject.
“Personally, I’m seriously asking myself where we made the mistake when it comes to masculinity,” he said.
“What did we teach men as we grew up about the problems we are facing now?”
Kit believes that television is partly responsible for increasing toxic masculinity due to the portrayal of highly male characters.
He continued: “What is born and what is learned?
What do we learn on television and in the streets so that young boys feel they have to choose this particular aspect of masculinity?
I think one of the important issues of our time is how can we change that?
Because obviously something went wrong with the young men.”
In the interview, he also said that after the end of the series next summer, he will not be involved in filming any prequels or continuations of Game of Thrones because he "finished with battlefields and horses".
Kit will play the lead role in the new show show True West by Sam Shepard, which is the story of the film producer and his brother the robber.
The actor recently revealed that the best thing that has happened because of Game of Thrones is that he met his wife Rose at the shooting.
“Because of this series, I met my wife, so somehow she gave me my future family and life from here on out,” he said.
In an Emmy-winning fantasy series, Rose played Ygritte, Kit's love choice character, Jon Snow.
The couple married in June 2018 on the estate of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China Reports 14 Percent Increase in New Cases
China has announced a 14 percent increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
Health officials say more than 820,000 people are affected in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
In the vast majority of new cases, the disease has been transmitted by sexual intercourse, which represents a change compared to the past.
Usually, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China due to transfusions of infected blood.
However, according to Chinese health officials at a conference in Junan province, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has dropped to almost zero.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China is still increasing by 100,000 each year.
Transmission of HIV with sexual intercourse is a very pervasive problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still very prevalent.
Since conservative values still apply in the country, 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry a woman, according to the results of the survey.
The disease is often transmitted due to inadequate protection in sexual relations in such relationships.
Since 2003, as part of efforts to address the problem, the Chinese government has promised universal access to medicines for the treatment of HIV.
Maxine Waters denies that staff have leaked data on Republican senators, condemning "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
U.S. Congresswoman Maxine Waters on Saturday denied allegations that a member of her staff had published data on three U.S. Republican senators on their Wikipedia website.
A Democrat from Los Angeles has claimed that these accusations come from individuals and websites of the far-right.
“Lies, lies, and more inadmissible lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information released includes home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch from the state of Utah.
The data was released online on Thursday by an unidentified Capitol Hill person during a Senate hearing on allegations of sexual harassment of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kanaugha.
The leak came after the three senators concluded with the hearing of Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState state that the IP address can be used to identify the source of the posting that is supposed to be linked to Senator Waters’ office and to conclude that the information was posted by one of the staff, Hill reports.
“These unfounded accusations are completely false and pure lies,” Waters said.
“My employees, whose identities, personal data and security are at risk because of these false accusations, are in no way responsible for leaking this data.
These unfounded accusations are completely untrue and pure lies.”
Senator Waters's statement quickly came across criticism online, including by former White House press representative Ariel Fleischer.
“This denial is a branch of anger,” Fleischer wrote.
“This may mean that it’s not the right test for Congress.
When you accuse someone of something he didn't do, he shouldn't be angry.
You can't resist.
And he must not doubt the motive of the one who accused him.
It has to be calm.”
Fleischer compared Waters' response to the Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of being too obviously angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is running for Watersova's seat in the midterm elections, tweeted.
“If it’s true, it’s serious,” he tweeted.
Waters said in a statement that her cabinet had notified “the relevant institutions and law enforcement agencies in connection with these false accusations.
“We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed,” she continued, “and that they will be held accountable for all acts that are harmful and dangerous to every member of my staff and to all of them.”
Johnny English back in action - Rowan Atkinson as secret agent
The search for clues to Brexit in any new British film has already become traditional, and also applies to the revival of the action comedy Johnny English, which first appeared in 2003 with the title Johnny English and a sequel in 2011 with the title Johnny English 2.
Will the fun satire about how disgusting we are be a new export opportunity for us?
Incompetent Johnny English, with his eyes widened and unusual grimaces, gains permission to remix the strings; his name already indicates that this is a comic character created for cinema audiences in non-English-speaking areas.
He is an awkward secret agent who, despite his bizarre moves, includes Clouseau’s piece, Mr. Bean’s wand, and the pettyness of the one who contributed the final note to the Chariots of Fire at the 2012 London Olympics opening ceremony.
It is also based on a traveller and an international mystery novelist, whom Atkinson once played in a now-forgotten TV commercial for Barclaycard, leaving behind real chaos.
In the most recent film, one or two pleasant moments are presented.
I liked it when Johnny English was approaching in a helicopter, he was wearing a medieval armor, and the rotor blades were touching his helmet for a short time.
Atkinson's gift for comedy is clearly displayed, but humor seems a bit mild and overly unnecessary, especially since "serious" films like 007 or Mission impossible now offer comic elements without a bad conscience.
It seems like humor is meant for children and not so much for adult viewers, which is why for me the repulsive occasions of John English are not as innovative and oriented as Atkinson's not sketches in the role of Mr Bean.
The constant theme is now clear that the UK is in serious trouble.
The online hacker has infiltrated the web network of Britain’s most secretive agents and revealed the identities of all British agents, causing great trouble to the responsible agent, represented in a surprisingly small role by Kevin Eldon.
This is the breakthrough point for the prime minister, a pompous figure who has already experienced a breakthrough due to political unpopularity: Emma Thompson has struggled with the role of alleged Teresa May, but there is nothing tangible in the script that could help her.
The intelligence service informs her that all active spies have been exposed, so she must opt for one of the retired spies.
And that means Johnnya English, now a teacher at a prestigious school who informally teaches how to operate under cover: here the writers are hit, as English carries out some sort of spy “rock academy.”
English is taken to Whitehall for an emergency meeting, where he meets longtime collaborator Bough, played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine commander, a stereotypical sports enthusiast, a role in which Vicki Pepperdine gets a little lost.
So Batman and Robin are prepared to create even more trouble on behalf of her Highness's secret service, meeting the fatal Ophelio Bullet, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously under the influence of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain’s computer problems: it’s the evil Jason Volta played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey: dressed as a waitress, a French restaurant fires, creates chaos when he stumbles onto the roof of Volt's yacht, and when English tries to use virtual reality glasses to get to know the interior of Volt's house.
Although the last part contains all the necessary ingredients, despite the sympathy and energy it resembles a children's film.
Very average.
As with other Johnny English films, I can’t help myself here, and I wonder: is the British film able to give Atkinson a role that actually justifies his talent?
Laborists deny that they plan a four-day working week for the British, with them getting paid for a five-day working week.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a radical plan where the British would work four days a week and receive a five-day paycheck.
The customer from corporate leaders wants the savings that companies create as a result of the artificial intelligence revolution to be poured into the workers and allow them an extra day off.
In this way, employees would enjoy a three-day weekend at the same high salary.
Sources say the idea fits the party’s economic plan and the plan to put the state on the side of workers.
The unions support the transition to a four-day working week, as this is a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A Labour Party source told The Sunday Times: “A review of the policy is expected to be published before the end of the year.
“It will not happen overnight, but the four-week employee is the goal that we will strive to achieve with the client’s approach to balancing the economy for the benefit of the employee and the client’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party supported the four-week working week in its campaign in the 2017 general election.
The Labour Party as a whole does not support this objective at present.
A Labour Party representative said: “The four-week working week is not the party’s policy and the party is not thinking about it.”
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour Conference last week to present his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to eradicate the power of “careless directors” and “profiters” in municipal enterprises.
The shadow chancellor’s plans also mean that the current shareholders in the pipelines may not regain their full share, as the Labour Party could introduce “rebates” on the basis of alleged wrongdoing.
He also approved plans to include employees in the boards of directors and the introduction of the Ownership Inclusion Funds, which would transfer 10% of the share in private companies to employees who would receive annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy discussed whether their opinion could be altered by the FBI’s Kavanaugh investigation.
The FBI’s investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least a week and raises the question of whether the findings of any Republican senator’s office could convince a deputy judge to resign.
In an interview that aired on Sunday, the correspondent asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find out anything that would change their mind.
Kennedy seemed more open to this than a fellow South Carolina.
“I mean, of course,” Kennedy said.
“Before the hearing began, I spoke with Judge Kavanaugh.
When I called him, when this accusation arose, I asked him, ‘Did you do this?’”
He was determined, unwavering, unquestioning.”
Graham's voice seems to be stuck in the stone.
“I created my opinion on Brett Kavanaugh and I would need a very compelling reason for his change,” he said.
“I don’t know what happened to Dr. Ford, but I know the following: Brett strongly denied it,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“None of the men whom he had appointed could confirm this.
It's 36 years old.
I don’t see any new changes.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival (Global Citizen Festival) and has it contributed to poverty reduction in any way?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizens’ Festival, an annual music event attended by a truly extraordinary variety of stars and with the same extraordinary mission: to eradicate poverty in the world.
The festival, which will be held for the seventh time, will be attended by dozens of people. They will occupy the Great Strait of Central Park not only to enjoy the performances of musicians such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to arouse interest in the real purpose of the event.
The Global Citizens Festival, which began in 2012, is an expansion of the Global Citizens Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free event ticket (unless you were willing to pay for a VIP subscription), concert participants had to perform a variety of tasks or “actions” such as volunteering, a letter to the world leader, a phone call, or any other meaningful way to raise money.
How successful is the Global Citizen movement, which has 12 years left to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert the right way to convince them to demand action, or is this just another example of so-called “clickivism” – creating the belief that people actually have a significant impact on the situation by signing a online petition or mediating?
According to the Global Citizen movement, more than 19 million “actions” of its supporters have been recorded in the pursuit of a variety of goals since 2011.
He says these actions have helped world leaders to make commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, which are expected to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group stated that the result of its actions would be 390 commitments and communications, based on which at least US$10 billion was already paid or collected.
The group estimates that the funds raised so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and decision-makers committed to “helping children realize their full potential,” which Rwanda has pledged $35 million in aid to help countries eliminate malnutrition after they’ve grown.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can put the social culprit of malnutrition in the historical archives,” Tracey Ullman, the ambassador of the Power Food Partnership, told the crowd at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that the government, following more than 5,000 actions calling on the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, has announced that it will co-finance the Power of Nutrition project, which will reach 5 million women and children through nutrition measures.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the website, “Why do you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?”,
“This is going to be a long and hard road – sometimes we’ll fall and we’ll fail.
But like the great civil rights movement and the struggle against apartheid before us, we will succeed, because we are stronger together.
Some of the performers who will perform at this year’s event in New York include Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e. The event will be led by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. could use the Navy to “block” Russian energy exports – U.S. Department of the Interior
U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said Washington could use the navy “as needed” to prevent Russian energy markets, including in the Middle East.
Zinke said that Russian intervention in Syria (it should be noted that at the invitation of legitimate governments) is an excuse for exploring new energy markets.
“I think the reason for their presence in the Middle East is the desire to market energy, just as it is marketed in Eastern Europe, in the southern part of Europe,” he said.
In the opinion of the official, however, there are ways and means to deal with this.
“The United States can do this, and the Navy will make sure that our sea routes are open and blocked if necessary, thus preventing Russian energizers from entering the market,” he said.
Zinke addressed participants in an event hosted by the Federation of Energy Consumers, a nonprofit group that hails as the “voice of energy consumers” in the United States.
He compared Washington’s approach to Russia and Iran, noting that it is actually the same.
“As far as Iran and Russia are concerned, the economic potential is more or less to influence fuels and replace them,” he said, calling Russia a “one-trick pony” with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statements were made at a time when the Trump administration is trying to boost exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, where it is said to underscore Russia, which is a much cheaper choice for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to give up the “unfit” Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which is said to be the “dancer” of Moscow after Trump.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North Stream 2 pipeline is an economic project of $11 billion, which is expected to double the existing capacity of the pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters.
The Kremlin argues that Washington is strongly opposed to the project only for economic reasons and that it is an unfair competition.
“In my opinion, we have the same view that energy should not be a tool for exerting pressure and that consumers should have the right to choose suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Nosandr Perry said after a September meeting with U.S. Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow.
Germany has rejected the U.S. position and confirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading German industrial organisation, the German Federation of Industries (BDI), has called on the United States not to interfere in EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“The interference of a third country in our energy supply is a big problem for me,” said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will “examine” her candidacy for the 2020 U.S. presidential election, says Massachusetts Senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would “examine” her candidacy for U.S. president after the midterm elections.
In the town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren has confirmed that she will consider her candidacy.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and fix our corrupt government, which requires a female leader,” she said, according to a report by The Hill.
“After November 6th, I will look closely at my candidacy for president.”
Warren played President Donald Trump at a meeting in the city hall, as he was supposed to “lead this country in the wrong direction.”
“What Donald Trump is doing to our democracy is terrifying to me,” she said.
Warren has already openly criticized Trump and Supreme Court President Brett Kavanaugh on several occasions.
In a tweet released on Friday, Warren said: “Of course, before the election, we need an FBI investigation.”
However, a poll published on Thursday showed that most of her own voters believe that Warren shouldn’t run for president in 2020.
According to a poll by the University of Suffolk’s Political Research Center/Boston Globe magazine, the senator should not run for president, eighty-five percent of Massachusetts’ “probable” voters.
Thirty-two percent would support her candidacy.
The poll showed that former governor Deval Patrick had greater support for the candidacy, with 38 percent of respondents expected to support it and 48 percent expected to oppose it.
Other high-ranking Democrats to qualify for the 2020 election are former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden, according to the Associated Press, said he would make a formal decision by January.
Sarah Palin at a meeting in support of Donald Trump mentioned Track Palin's post-traumatic stress disorder
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in the military.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
“What my own son is going through, what he’s going through after his return, connects me with other families dealing with post-traumatic stress disorder and a certain degree of injury that our soldiers are returning from,” he told the audience at a rally in support of Donald Trump.
Palin's arrest was described as a "saloon in the salon" and said her son and other military veterans were returning somewhat altered, hardened, wondering where the respect for what the allies and planes and all other members of the army had given to the state.
Track Palina was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence with assault on a woman, obstruction of reporting domestic violence and possession of weapons in a convict state, said Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla police station.
18 states and the District of Columbia support the promulgation of a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support legal denunciation of a new U.S. policy that denies asylum rights to victims fleeing bullying or domestic violence.
NBC News reported on Friday that representatives from 18 countries and the district were filling in the courtroom to support the legal stance of the policy.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Federation against federal policy has not been disclosed.
She said her partner and "his violent sons, members of the gang" had abused her, but on July 20, U.S. authorities rejected her asylum application.
She was arrested in Texas.
State prosecutors in the federal states that support Grace have described Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which numerous asylum applications are coming to the United States, as countries that are constantly struggling with bullying and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy in 2014 annulled the decision of the Immigrant Appeals Committee, which allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The District of Columbia Attorney General, General Karl Racine, said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "disregards decades of state, federal and international law."
“Federal law requires that all asylum applications be assessed on the basis of the individual facts and circumstances of the application, and such a prohibition violates this principle,” the court said.
The prosecutors further stated in the petition that policies that deny immigrants the right to entry are detrimental to the U.S. economy, as they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and “provide the necessary workforce.”
U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions has ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum in June to victims fleeing domestic violence and bullying.
“Asyl is available to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear associated with race, religion, nationality or membership in an individual social group or political opinion,” Sessions said in a June 11 policy statement.
Asylum has never been designed to address all the problems, even the serious problems that people face every day around the world.
The number of victims in Palu has doubled, but desperate rescue attempts are underway to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was getting worse.
“The feeling is very tense,” said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, as she comforted her hot boyfriend at an evacuation center in the shattered town of Palu.
“Rescuers are constantly importing corpses.
There is a lack of clean water.”
It looked like the citizens were returning to their destroyed homes, breaking through the overpowered things and trying to find anything useful.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals destroyed by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake were overloaded.
Some of the injured, including Two Haris, who suffered a back and shoulder injury, rested outside the military hospital in Palu, where patients were treated outdoors due to unceasing aftershocks.
When he remembered a violent earthquake that shook the hotel room on the fifth floor in which he was housed with his wife and daughter, his eyes filled with tears.
“There was no time to get rid of it.
I think I was squeezed against the rubble,” Harris told the Associated Press, adding that he was in town with his family for the wedding.
“I heard a woman calling for help, and then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they are safe.”
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of ‘Propaganda’
A week after the publication of a four-page ad in the official Chinese newspaper, which praised the mutual benefits of trade between the US and China, the U.S. ambassador to China Beijing accused the abuse of the U.S. press for spreading propaganda.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Sunday mentioned a paid China Daily supplement in the Des Moines Register — the best-selling newspaper in the state of Iowa, after accusing China of meddling in the U.S. congressional elections on November 6, which China denies.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. officials have described Trump's accusation of Beijing trying to interfere in U.S. federal elections as a new phase in Washington's increasingly intense effort to pressure China.
Although it is common for foreign governments to publish trade promotional ads, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in an increasingly intense trade war, exchanging blows by imposing tariffs on imported products.
China's reimbursement tariffs at the start of the trade war are said to have affected exporters in federal states such as Iowa, which support Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and US experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowe, the main exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in a column in the Sunday edition of the Des Moines Register, “now this harassment doubles by publishing propaganda ads in our own free press.”
“In spreading the propaganda, the Chinese government took advantage of the valued American tradition of free speech and the free press to publish a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“On the other hand, you will see very few other opinions on the stand in Beijing, and no real reflection of the diversity of views that Chinese citizens have on China’s worrying economic path, as the Chinese Communist Party is tightly controlled by the communities,” he wrote.
He added that “one of the most important Chinese newspapers has rejected the offer to publish” his article, although he did not specify which.
Republicans Lose Voters Before Interim Elections With Kavanaugh Breakup, Analysts Warn
Analysts point out that the support of many of the most important Republicans supporting and advocating for the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh despite multiple allegations of sexual assault will be seen in the upcoming midterm elections with the loss of voters.
Emotions are extremely high here, and most Republicans have already said they want to continue voting.
This cannot be returned,” Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Maxwell’s University of Syracuse, said in an article published Saturday in The Hill.
Reeher said he doubted Senator Jeff Flake's pressure to investigate the FBI at the last minute would be enough to calm the angry voters.
“Women won’t forget what happened yesterday, and they won’t forget it tomorrow or November,” Karine Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and national representative of MoveOn’s Progressive Group, said on Friday, according to a report from a Washington, D.C., official.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted “November is coming!” when they demonstrated in the Senate hallway when Republicans overseeing the Judiciary Committee decided to continue supporting Kavanaugh’s appointment despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford’s testimony.
“The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will go beyond all boundaries,” Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst, told reporters.
“People say they’re already strong, and that’s it.
But it could be even stronger, especially among the undisclosed voters in the suburbs and younger voters, aged 18 to 29, who don’t like the president, but don’t vote often.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony, in which she detailed her accusations of sexual assault by the candidate for the Supreme Court, analysts said further Republican support could have negative consequences.
“This has become a big mess for the GOP,” Michael Steele, the former president of the Republican National Council, told NBC News earlier this week.
“It’s not just a world vote or a final vote or Kavanaugh’s oath; it’s also a way Republicans deal with it and how they treated Ford,” Guy Cecil, director of the Democratic-backed Priorities USA, told the television channel.
The Americans, however, seem somewhat divided between whether they believe Ford's or Kavanaugh's testimony, with slightly more supporting the latter.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents certainly believe Ford's testimony most, and 35 percent of respondents said they certainly believe Kavanaugh most.
In addition, 38 percent said they believed that Kavanaugh was probably or definitely lying while testifying, and only 30 percent said that about Ford.
Under pressure from Flake, the FBA is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford and at least one other indictee, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Ford testified last week before the Senate Judiciary that Kavanaugh, at the age of 17, had attacked her in a state of indictment.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate showed her sex when they were at a party together during their studies at Yale University in the 1980s.
World Web Inventor Plans to Launch a New Internet to Fight Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the world’s web, opens a startup that will compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this tech legend, Inrupt, is a company that builds on Berner's open-source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who has access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt's purpose was to "take over the world".
“We’ve decided to do it now,” he said of the new company.
“It’s a historic moment.”
The application uses Solid platform technology, which allows the user to create a “personal data storage store” or POD
This may include contact information, to-do lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are all available in one browser at a time.
The peculiarity of the personal storage of data is that the user can fully determine who can access which information.
This is what the company calls “personal data empowerment”.
Executive Director John Bruce says the company’s idea is to bring together resources, processes, and relevant skills that will give everyone access to the Solid platform.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, a few hired developers to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Already this week, technology developers around the world could create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and the group "are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether they could introduce a complete change that could overnight abolish all of their business models."
“We don’t ask for permission.”
In a press release on Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt’s purpose was to “provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on the Solid platform.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet with the founding of the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate over internet neutrality.
Berners-Lee will also remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the World Wide Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m extremely optimistic about the next era of the internet,” added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: The Feast of the Carrier of the Victorian Cross of World War I
For 100 years, the city has been celebrating the awarding of the Victorian Cross to the only priest of the Church of England who won it as a fighter in World War I.
The congratulatory Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann earned his recognition on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But four days later, he was shot by a gunman, so he never learned that he was awarded the highest British military honor.
On Saturday, at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, two colonel grandsons discovered a memorial stone.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was “extremely symbolic” that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather’s act, which earned him an honor.
According to the London Gazette, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Canal of St. Quentin on 29 September 1918 "through a very dense fog and under the heavy fire of battlefields and mechanics."
Later, he was planning against the line of fire, and with the "greatest crew" he led the line forward, and then I attacked the machine-gun and hit three members of the squadron.
On October 4, 2018, just a month before the end of the war, Lieutenant-Colonel Vanna was shot by a German gunman.
Michael Vann, 72, said that the actions of an old father were “something I know and could never achieve, so it teaches me humility.”
With his brother, Dr. James Vann, they also laid a wreath after the parade led by Mrs. Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he felt “very honored to be able to participate in this parade” and “that the courage of a true hero is reflected in the support that many people will give.”
Fans of mixed martial arts spent the night staring at the Bellator 206. Instead, they took part in Pujsa Pepe.
Imagine: All night long you’ve been saddened to watch the completely sold-out Bellator 206, and then you can’t see the main event.
The event in San Jose featured 13 duels, including six on the main parquet, and was broadcast live in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to confront each other, spectators in the United Kingdom were surprised to find that the transmission had been replaced by the play of Puis Pepa.
Many were not very enthusiastic, as he stayed awake until the morning just because of the duel.
One of the fans described the switch to a children's cartoon on Twitter as "a kind of painful joke".
“According to government regulation, this content is not appropriate at 6 a.m., so they had to switch to the children’s program,” said Dave Schwartz, vice president of Bellator Marketing and Communications, when asked about the transfer.
"Pujsa Pepa. Yes."
Bellator's president, Scott Coker, said they were trying to adjust the schedule so that viewers in the UK would be involved in the future.
“When I think about replaying, I think we could fix it,” Coker said.
“But then it’s six o’clock in the morning on Sunday and we won’t be able to do that until a week after our own time or a Monday after theirs.
We're all working on it.
Believe me, many messages were exchanged during the switch and not all were friendly.
We tried to fix it; we thought it was just a technical mistake.
However, the real reason was the government regulation.
I can promise you this won't happen again next time.
Instead of six, we will tolerate five duels – as usual. We tried to offer fans more than we expected, and we counted on that.
This is a very ungrateful situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "disrespectful" about sexuality.
Olympic diver Tom Daley said he felt inferior to everyone because of his sexual orientation – but that gave him a motivation for success.
The 24-year-old said he was aware that “not everyone” was like himself when he entered high school.
In a talk on the first show Desert Island Discs, led by Lauren Laverne for Radio 4, he said he spoke about gay rights in order to give "hope" to others.
He also said that as he became a parent, his desire to win the Olympics diminished.
Kirsty Young, the regular host of the long-running show, was absent due to a multi-month illness.
Daley, who appeared as an outcast on Laverne's first show, said he felt "less valuable" than everyone else because "it wasn't socially acceptable to love boys and girls."
He said: “To this day, these feelings of inferiority and diversity are a real thing that gives me the strength and perseverance to achieve success.”
He wanted to prove that there was “something,” he said, not to disappoint anyone who would finally find out about his direction.
A two-time bronze Olympian has become an influential advocate of LGBT rights and has appeared twice at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year to call on states to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke because he felt happy to be able to speak openly without consequences, and that he wanted to give “hope” to others.
The three-time world champion said he was "surprised" by a love affair with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married an Oscar winner who is 20 years older than him last year, but says the difference in years never meant a problem.
“When you’re so young,” he said, “at the age of 14 he took part in the first Olympic Games, and three years later his father died,” he said, “it’s hard to find someone of the same age who would experience similar ups and downs.
In June, the couple adopted a child, Robert Ray Black-Daley's son, and Daley says this changed his "full view".
“If you asked me last year, all I had to say was, ‘I have to win a gold medal,’” he said.
“But, you know, there are bigger things in the world than the Olympic gold medal.
“My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.
The son bears the same name as Daley's father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he would have to die, and one of the last things he asked about was whether he already had tickets for London 2012 as he wanted to sit in the front row.
“I couldn’t say to him, ‘You won’t be in the first place, Dad,’” he said.
“I held him by the hand when he stopped breathing, and only when he actually stopped breathing and he was dead, I finally had to admit that he wasn’t invulnerable,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
“I knew that’s what I’ve been dreaming about all my life – diving at the Olympics in front of the domestic audience. There was no better feeling,” he said.
It was also inspired by his first choice of song – The Flow of Musician Heather Small, who accompanied him in preparation for the Olympic Games and at which his skin is still peeled.
The Desert Island Discs broadcast on BBC Radio 4 every Sunday at 11.15 (BST).
Unprepared Mickelson wins Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but will have to get back in shape so it doesn’t become an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who will participate in the biennial event for a record 12-inch, has let Captain Furyk sit on Saturdays.
Instead of being at the center of the event, as was so often for the United States, the five-time winner spent the day partly as a fan and partly in improving his game to fix what weighed him down.
Given that even at the peak of his career he did not measure the most directly, the 48-year-old does not fit the best narrow Le Golf National, where the long ice inevitably punishes missed hits.
And if the pitch alone wasn’t scary enough, Mickelson would have a deal with the exact winner of the British Open Francescom Molinari in Sunday’s ninth game, who in a jump to victory in all four games this week connected with rookie Tommy Fleetwood.
If the Americans, who have 12 games of four individual games at the start, had a good start, Mickelson’s game could prove decisive.
Furyk expressed confidence in his man, but he didn't say much.
“He fully understands the role he played today, pushed me on my back and hugged me with his hand and said he would be ready for tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence in you.
It is one of the most famous and has contributed to the teams in the past and also this week.
I had no idea he was going to play two games.
I imagined more, but that's how it turned out, and we thought it was the right thing to do.
He wants to play, just like everyone else.”
Mickelson will break Nick Fald's record for the largest number of Ryder Cup games played on Sunday.
This could mark the end of Ryder's career, which never really matched the height of his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven draws, but Furyk said his presence in the team also brings some unacceptable benefits.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, spiritual, he likes to work crazy with people and it’s great to have him in team space,” he explained.
“I think the younger players were having fun when they moved in with him this week, which was fun to see.”
It’s more than just a game.”
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the big advantage may soon fall
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that an important advantage at the start of the last day of the individual games in Ryder Cup can easily be turned into an uncomfortable ride.
The young Dane made his debut in 1997 at a match in Valderra, where the side, whose captain was Seve Ballesteros, had five points ahead of the Americans, and through the goal broke with a hair-only lead, with a result of 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“Don’t forget, we had a big lead in Valderra; we had a big lead in Brookline where we lost, and in Valderra where we won but barely,” Bjorn (pictured) said after watching the Class of 2018 team win by a 5–3 win over National on Friday and yesterday.
So history tells me and everyone on the team that the drink is not over yet.
Play the full game tomorrow.
Go and do everything you need to do.
The contest is not over until it's written on the board.
We have a goal to win this cup, and we need to stay focused on that.
He has always said that I focus on the 12 players who are on our side, but we are also well aware of who is on the opposite side – the best players in the world.”
Excited by his players on the challenging pitch, Bjorn added: “I would never get over here.
Tomorrow will be a different day.
Tomorrow will be a game of individuals, so it will have to be dealt with differently.
It’s nice to have a partner when things go well, but when you’re there alone, your golfer skills are tested to the end.
This is the message you need to convey to the players: tomorrow you have to get the best out of yourself.
Now leave your partner behind, and he too has to get the best out of himself.”
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk will encourage his players to play better than they played as a partner, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk himself had been on both sides of the turnovers for the last day as he was part of the winning team in Brooklyn before finishing as a loser when Europe performed Miracle in Medina.
“I remember every word that went wrong,” he said when asked how Ben Crenshaw, captain of the 1999, told his players on the final day of the game.
“Tomorrow we have 12 important games, but we would like to start as fast as we saw in Brooklyn as we saw in Medina.
When this start gets persistence, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle games.
We created the right layout and put the boys in a way until we felt we were going to do something magical tomorrow.”
Thomas was assigned the task to try to lead the battle and fight Rory McIlroy in the best game, Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter will be the other Europeans in the top half of the order.
“At this group of guys, I chose this order because I think it covers the entire schedule,” Bjorn said of the selection of individuals.
New German Warship Delayed Again
The latest frigate of the German Navy should be put into service in 2014 to replace the aging warships from the Cold War, but due to the failure of the systems and rapidly increasing costs will not be available until at least the following year, local municipalities reported.
The delivery of the Rhineland-Palatinate, the flagship of the new class of frigate Baden-Wuerttemberg, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit, a military official.
The vessel should join the Navy in 2014, but the ambitious project is plagued by worrying post-delivery issues.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships, commissioned in 2007, will be replaced by the aging Bremen-class frigates.
They are expected to have a powerful gun, a variety of anti-aircraft and anti-aircraft missiles, and some cover-up technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signature.
Other important features include longer maintenance distances – the latest frigates are expected to remain outside their home port for up to two years.
Continuous delays mean, however, that top-class warships, which are supposed to enable Germany to exert its influence overseas, will become obsolete by the time the use begins, says Die Ziet.
The unfortunate F125 frigate appeared on the headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to take over the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time that the Navy had returned the ship to the shipyard after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, and the German municipalities have listed a number of key “programming and technical deficiencies” that would render the warship useless if it were sent on a combat mission.
The shortcomings of the software were particularly important, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ship would manage a crew of about 120 sailors – only half of the workforce on the older Bremen-class frigates.
It has also been shown to be a very heavy ship, which reduces its capacity and limits the Navy's ability to upgrade it in the future.
The 7,000-ton Rhineland-Palatinate was said to be twice as heavy as the Germans used in World War II.
In addition to the lack of equipment, the cost of the entire project – including the training of the crew – also became a problem.
This is expected to reach a peak of EUR 3.1 billion (USD 3.6 billion) – up from the initial EUR 2.2 billion.
Problems with the latest frigates are becoming especially important in the light of recent warnings that Germany’s naval power is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defence committee of the German parliament, acknowledged that the navy was actually "lacking ships suitable for dispatch."
The official said the issue got worse over time, as the old ships were dismantled and replacement ships were not provided.
He regretted that no ship of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could join the Navy.
The National Fund Listens to the Secret Life of the Netopyrs
On the property in the Scottish Highlands, a new research is underway, in which they seek to discover how non-natives use the diet in the hunt for food.
They hope that the results will re-examine the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
Scientists from the National Fund for Scotland (NTS) will be monitoring small spots and small spots, as well as brown spots and perimeter spots on the property of Inverewe Gardens in the Wester Ross area.
At the key sites of the estate, special recorders will be placed to monitor the activity of the netpires throughout the entire season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile research using handheld detectors.
A professional audio analysis of all the recordings will confirm the frequency of calls of the netpires and what types of what they do.
They will then prepare a habitat map and report to create a detailed picture of their behavior across the landscape.
Rob Dewar, NTS Nature Conservation Advisor, hopes that the results will show which habitat areas are best suited for wetlands and how they are used by each individual species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management, such as the creation of grasslands and the conservation of forests for wetlands and other related species.
The number of netopyr populations in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom has declined sharply in the last century.
They are endangered by construction and development work that affects shelters and habitat loss.
There is also a risk of wind turbines and lighting, as well as wind turbines and some types of chemical processing of building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
Nepotisms aren't really blind.
Because of the nightly habits of hunting, they help themselves more with the ears than with the eyes.
For the precise identification of faults and obstacles on the flight path, a sophisticated technique of echolocation is used.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, takes the netpire very seriously.
It employs ten specialists who regularly conduct research, shelter inspections and occasional rescues.
The organization has set up the first and only Scottish reserve, specifically dedicated to nectar, in the Dumfries and Galloway area.
The estate manager David Thompson says that the estate is the ideal territory for them.
“We have a great spot for the bats on Threa,” he said.
“We have old buildings, lots of ancient trees and all the quality habitat.
However, there is still a lot to know about the unfortunate, so the work we do here and on other properties will help us better understand what they need to succeed.”
He underlined the importance of checking the presence of predators before carrying out maintenance work on the estates, as the possible accidental destruction of a single maternal predator could result in the death of up to 400 females and pups, which could mean the collapse of the entire local population.
Netopirs are protected, so it is forbidden to kill, harass or disturb them, and it is also forbidden to destroy their maternity wards.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish head of the Fund for the Conservation of Nets, encouraged the public to participate.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about our nepotisms, and for many species we simply don’t know how well their populations hold.”
Ronaldo rejects rape charges, lawyers prepare for German magazine’s lawsuit <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Cristiano Ronaldo called the accusations of rape that he was alleged to have committed, "fake news" and said people wanted to "promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German magazine with the news Der Spiegel, which published the accusations.
The Portuguese and Juventus attackers were accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Der Spiegel reported on Friday that he would then pay her $375,000 for the silence on the event.
With 142 million followers on Instagram Live, Ronaldo, 33, described the reports as “fake news”
“No, no, no, no, no.
What they said was fake news,” the five-time Golden Ball winner said in the camera.
“By using my name, they want to promote themselves.
That's normal.
By mentioning my name, they want to become famous, which belongs to the work I do.
I’m a happy man and I wish everyone well,” the actor added smilingly.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel magazine for charges they have called “unacceptable reporting of suspicions of privacy.”
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for "property damages in an amount corresponding to the seriousness of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
In the documentation filed at Clark County District Court in Nevada, she was reportedly returned to the player's room after meeting at Mayorga's nightclub with Ronald, who was supposed to rape her anal there.
Mayorga claims that after the event, Ronaldo fell to his knees and told her that he is a “99 percent good man” who only disappoints in “one percent.”
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed the sexual relationship, but described it as agreeable.
Mayorga also claims that she referred to the police and that photographs of her injuries were taken in the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was "fearful of revenge" and worried about "public humiliation."
The 34-year-old claims that she wants to cancel the settlement, as she continues to have a serious trauma due to the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was at the time of the alleged attack just before moving from Real Madrid to Manchester United, but this summer, after a deal worth $100 million, he moved to the Italian giant Juventus.
Brexit: UK 'would forever regret' the loss of car makers
The UK would “forever regret” if it lost its status as the world’s leading carmaker after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was “concerning” that Toyota UK had told the BBC that the UK’s exit from the EU without a deal would temporarily stop production at a factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
“We need an agreement,” said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of a delay at the border in the event of a no-deal Brexit could lead to job losses.
The Burnaston factory, which produces the Toyota Auris and Avensis, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“I think that in the event that the UK leaves the European Union without a deal at the end of March, production at our factory would be halted,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s managing director at the Burnaston plant.
Concerns about how exiting the European Union without a deal will affect cross-border trade have also been expressed by other car manufacturers in the UK, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, said it would close its Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns relate to what car manufacturers call the risks associated with the supply chain, in the event of a Brexit.
Toyota’s production line operates on the “at the right time” principle, with parts from UK and EU car suppliers coming on order every 37 minutes.
If the UK left the EU without a deal on 29 March, it could lead to border disruptions that industry representatives say could lead to stagnation and shortage of parts.
Toyota could not stock more than one day of parts at its Derbyshire plant, the company's representatives said, so production would stop.
Mr Clark said Theresa May's plan for future relations with the EU was "precisely moderated to avoid such border checks".
“We need to reach an agreement. We want to reach the best agreement that will allow us, as I say, not only to enjoy the current success, but to seize this opportunity,” he told BBC Today Radio 4.
“The data not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers is that we must absolutely be able to continue the highly successful supply chain set.”
Toyota could not comment on how long production would have been halted, but warned in the long run that additional costs would reduce the factory’s competitiveness and ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at the Burnaston factory for 24 years and is the founder of the Unite trade union in the factory, said his members are increasingly concerned: “In my experience, a lost job will never come back.”
The Prime Minister said: "We need to present an accurate and credible plan for our future relationship with the European Union."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, says White House
An important meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “presented for another week” as a result of the ongoing fight over Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special adviser Robert Mueller, who studies Russian pre-election interference, links between Trump’s collaborators and Russia, and the potential for the president’s overthrow of the judiciary.
The question of whether Trump will resign and endanger Mueller’s independence has been fuelling Washington’s rumors for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing the use of a hearing aid to record talks with Trump and the possibility of the removal of the president under the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
Last Monday, he visited the White House, amid reports that he was planning to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations conference in New York, was declared Thursday.
Trump said he “would rather not forgive” Rosenstein, and the meeting was then postponed to avoid conflict with a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women accused of sexual misconduct, Dr. Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh, further delaying the Senate vote.
Trump’s spokeswoman, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about her meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “The date for him is not yet fixed; it could happen this week, given everything else that is going on in the Supreme Court, and we could postpone him for another week.
We’ll see. I always like to make sure you’re informed.”
Some reporters would argue that Sanders hasn't called a meeting of the White House with journalists since September 10.
The head of the show, Chris Wallace, asked her why.
Sanders said that the rarities of meetings are not attributable to resistance to “setting” TV reporters, but she said: “I couldn’t deny that they were setting up.”
Then she said that the direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
“The president holds more press conferences than any president before him,” she said, adding without mentioning the source: “We looked at the numbers.”
The meetings will still be held,” Sanders said. “But if journalists can address the President of the United States directly with their question, it is infinitely better than debating with me.
We are trying to do this as much as possible and you have seen that we have done it often in the last few weeks and that you will have a conference at which you can speak with the President of the United States.”
Trump regularly accepts questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or press conferences with visiting statesmen.
Independent press conferences are rare.
In New York, the president may have shown this week why, when he appeared voluntarily and partially bizarrely in front of assembled journalists.
Letter from the Minister of Health to EU workers in NHS Scotland on Brexit-related fears
The Minister of Health wrote to EU staff working for the Scottish NHS to express gratitude to the country and a desire to continue work even after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, SME, sent a letter less than six months before the UK left the European Union.
The Scottish Government has already committed to paying the costs of applications for regulating the status of EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: “This summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on withdrawal continued, as the decision drew closer to this autumn.
But the UK government has also accelerated preparations for a possible exit scenario without a deal.
I know this must be a time of great concern for all of you.
I would therefore like to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of each member of staff regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the European Union and non-member countries bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the healthcare sector and benefit the patients and communities we provide.
In Scotland, you can feel completely at home. We really want you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie Urgently Operated After Head Injury
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie has stopped an emergency operation after a head injury in Saturday's 31:27 defeat to Vanderbilt Commodores, reports Mike Organ of The Tennesseean.
The head coach of the Tennessee State University told reporters that the injury occurred just before half an hour ago.
“He came up to the edge of the playground and sort of crumbled there,” Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff supplied Abercrombie with oxygen on the edge of the playground before putting him on the racks and taking him from the playground for further inspection.
An official from Tennessee State University told Chris Harris of the WSMV channel in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie is recovering after surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “details of the type/size of the injury are not yet known” and that the Tennessee State University is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, who is currently a senior at the university, plays for Tennessee State University for the first time since graduating from the University of Illinois.
On Saturday, he suffered a total of five strokes before coming out of the game, raising his total number of strokes in the season to 18.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher tax on the purchase of real estate in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher fee when buying real estate in the UK, and additional money will be used to help the homeless according to the new roadmaps.
The move will neutralize the success of Corbyn’s efforts to attract young voters
Increased charcoal will be charged to those who do not pay tax in the UK
The trust expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher rate of coke when buying real estate in the UK, and the money collected will be allocated to the homeless, Theresa May said.
The move should be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s efforts to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing and a greater taxation of high-income people.
The increased charcoal will be charged to individuals and businesses that do not pay taxes in the UK, and additional money will encourage the government’s efforts to eliminate homelessness.
The dividend – which will be charged in addition to the current hectic, including elevated levels introduced two years ago for other homes and real estate for broadcasting – could amount to no less than 3%.
The Treasury expects to raise up to GBP 120 million per year with the introduction of the measure.
It is estimated that UK non-citizens are expected to buy 13 percent of London's newly built real estate, resulting in price hikes and a tougher purchase of the first real estate.
Many of the country’s rich areas – especially in the capital – have become “spirit cities” as the number of buyers who spend most of their time outside the country increases.
The new policy was adopted just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in carbon emissions to make it easier for young people to buy their first home.
A large construction company has accused price hikes by looting land that it does not actually use, Mr. Mayevo, and he has called on Mayevo to abandon quotas for affordable housing in order to correct Britain's "residential shame."
Mr Corbyn announced an attractive series of proposed housing reforms, including monitoring rents and ending forced evictions without errors.
In addition, it wants to give the city council more powers to build new homes.
May said: “Last year I said that I would devote my premiere leadership to the renewal of British dreams – that life should be better for every new generation.
This also means rectifying our non-working housing market.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live here, work here, and create life for themselves.
However, it cannot be right that for people who do not live in the UK, and for foreign companies, buying a home is as easy as it is for British citizens.
For too many people, the dream of their own home is all too far away, and the humiliation of homelessness remains all too real.”
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to manage the club of Scotland"
Sunderland’s boss, Jack Ross, says his “final goal” is once to become a manager for Scotland.
The 42-year-old enjoys the challenge of reviving the North-East club, which currently holds third place in the Premier League, with three points less than the first.
He moved to the Light Stadium this summer after taking St Mirren back to the Scottish Championships in the final season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B cap and that's it," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
“But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden as a child, so it was always something that drew me back.
This opportunity would only be offered to me if I were successful in running the club.”
Ross' predecessors led by Sunderland were Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former team leader Alloa Athletic, who has previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town, says he was not afraid of being the successor to such big names.
“Success is measured for me by the question, ‘Can I take this club back to the Premier League?’”
In terms of structure and capacity, this club is undoubtedly part of the Premier League,” he said.
“It’s not easy to get there, but it would probably only be a success if the club could go there again.”
Ross has only been a manager for three years, after being an assistant manager at Dumbarton and a 15-month coaching staff member of the Hearts.
Alloy then helped prevent a break into the third league, and St Mirren led from the edge of the break to the championship title the following season.
Ross says he now feels more comfortable than ever while playing for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
“It was probably a real breakthrough,” recalled Alloe’s takeover.
“I was really convinced that management was the right thing for me, much more than just playing.
It’s funny to hear, because it worked out well for me as a player, so I managed relatively well and also achieved some greater successes.
But the game can become challenging.
You have to face a lot of things every week.
I’m still struggling with this in terms of stress and pressure at work, but I just feel like management is the right thing for me.
I’ve always wanted to run a club, and I’m doing it now, and I feel the most comfortable in my whole adult life.”

The ideal time for a beer is on Saturday at 5:30 p.m.
The summer heat has boosted revenues from hard-to-reach British pubs, but the pressure on restaurant chains has also increased.
Groups of pubs and bars increased sales by 2.7 percent in July, but restaurant revenues fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, CGA’s business advisor, who prepared the data, said: “England’s continued sunny weather and participation in the World Cup, which lasted longer than expected, meant that July followed a similar pattern to June’s, which was a remake of the remake 2, when the arrival of the pub began.
The 1.8% drop in restaurant traffic in June was even higher in July.
Traffic in pubs and bars with drinks has increased more in comparison with the decrease in traffic in restaurants.
Due to the sunny weather, sales in pubs offering mainly food have also been reduced, but not as dramatically as in restaurant operators.
It seems that people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In various pubs and bars, sales of beverages increased by 6.6 percent in one month, and food sales decreased by three percent.”
Paul Newman, RSM’s Leisure and Hospitality Analyst Group, said: “These results continue the trend we have been seeing since the end of April.
When selling in the hospitality market, the biggest factors remain the weather and the impact of major social or sporting events.
It is not surprising that the restaurant groups continue to struggle, although the 4.8 percent decline at the annual level will be particularly painful due to the constant cost pressures.
For the owners of the premises with food for a long hot summer could not come at a more incorrect time and only time will tell if the necessary recovery will bring more moderate temperatures that we experienced in August.”
Total sales in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, were 2.7% in July, suggesting a slower roll-out of brands.

One in five children has a secret account on social media that they hide from their parents.
Research has shown that one in five children – some of whom are only 11 years old – have a secret account on social media that they hide from parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 students showed the growth of fake Instagram pages
The news has heightened fears about the publication of sex-related content
Twenty percent of the students did have a “main” account for their parents.
One in five children – some of whom are only 11 years old – create an account on social networks that they hide from their parents.
A survey of 20,000 students showed a rapid growth in fake Instagram accounts.
The news has heightened fears about the publication of sex-related content.
Twenty percent of the students did manage the censored “main” account shown to their parents, but they also had private accounts.
The mother, who accidentally stumbled upon the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter, noticed that her daughter was inviting visitors to rape her.
A survey conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Directors and Directors of Independent Schools (HMC) found that 40 percent of 11-18 year olds have two profiles, with half of them admitting to having a private account.
HMC President Mike Buchanan said: “It’s worrying that so many teenagers are tempted to create an online space where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Doyle will be the voice of the Scottish Athletics Committee
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Board of Athletics as non-executive director of the Annual General Meeting of the Board of Directors.
Doyle is the most distinguished Scottish athlete on the field and outdoors, and President Ian Beattie has described this move as an excellent opportunity for those who focus on the sport to take advantage of her extensive international experience over the past decade.
“Eilidh enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British and world athletic community. We are confident that athletics in Scotland would gain a lot by integrating it into the board,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I’m excited to be able to act as a voice for athletes, and I hope I can really contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won a total of four Olympic medals in the 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta and is now a regular commentator for the BBC, has been left without speech after a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago, I was hit by a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors said it was only time to tell if I could recover and to what extent.
The work was hard, but I recovered completely, learned to walk again, and today I practice agility exercises!
Thank you for all the encouraging messages!”
An ad for a breast pump that compares mothers to cows has divided online reviews
The company that manufactures breast pumps shared opinions with an ad that compares mothers to cows in the mosquito.
To launch the “first silent portable breast pump,” consumer technology company Elvie has released a provocative music video ad that is supposed to show mothers all the freedom the device allows.
Four real mothers dance in the company of cows in a coffin filled with stone, on a song that includes the following text: “Yes, I pump myself, but I don’t see any tail,” and “If you haven’t noticed, these aren’t my socks, these are my tits.”
The collection continues: "Finish, exhaust, feed the babies, exhaust, exhaust, squeeze the breasts."
But the ad, which was posted on the company’s Facebook website, caused considerable discontent on the internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, many of whom said it was joking at the expense of the “horror” of the dairy industry.
“The use of cows to advertise this product is a very bad decision.
“Like me, they are pregnant and breastfeeding to produce milk, but the babies are stealing from them in the first days after they’ve been harvested,” she wrote.

The other commented: “Of course, it is traumatic for both the mother and the puppy.
But why not use them to advertise breast pumps for mothers who are keeping their children?”
Someone else added: “Advertisement completely without feeling.”
Others praised the ad, with one of the women admitting that she found the song "for worship funny".
“I think that’s a brilliant idea.
I would buy it too if I were still breastfeeding.
When I was pumping, I felt exactly like a cow.
The ad was a little crazy, but I understood it as it was meant to be.
“It’s a great product,” another wrote.
Someone commented, “It’s a funny ad that targets mothers who run out of milk (often at work or in the toilet) and feel like cows.”
It is not an advertisement that praises or condemns the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, a group of women reveals that they were dancing with hidden pumps in the blue.
The concept of action is that many women who pump their breasts say they feel like cows.
The Elvie Pump is completely quiet, has no wires or tubes and discreetly fits into the breastfeeding bra, which allows women to move, hold the baby and even do outdoor activities while pumping milk.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Maternity Care, said: “The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative presentation.”
By drawing the parallel between the women who pump milk, and the cow dairy farmers, we wanted to put the milk pumping and all its challenges in the spotlight, while at the same time in a fun way with which women can connect, show an incredible feeling of freedom.
This isn't the first time Elvie's pump has come to the headlines.
During London Fashion Week, the mother of two children walked on a modeling trail for designer Marto Jakubowski when she used the product.
Hundreds of children of migrants quietly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of detained children of migrants has risen sharply, even though the number of monthly border crossings remains relatively unchanged, partly because the crude rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to hand over children to sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors are undocumented migrants, so they are afraid to endanger their chances of staying in the country by applying for a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other family members of households would have to make fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at the Immigration and Customs Agency, testified before the congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had requested to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of the arrested did not have a previous criminal record.
“Nearly 80 percent of people who are either sponsors or household members of sponsors are illegal in the country, and a large proportion of these are punished foreigners.
That’s why we continue to search for these individuals,” said Mr. Albence.
With a view to speeding up the treatment of children, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within one month of their detention, and not after 60 days, which was the previous standard, workers at the hospital said.
Many will show up on a videoconferencing call and not in person to plead before an immigration judge.
Those who are deemed not to be eligible for aid will be quickly expelled.
The longer children are in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent eruptions or escape attempts, according to statements by shelter workers and reports that have occurred in the system in recent months.
Advocates said these concerns are greater in larger institutions, such as the Tornillo, where signs of child distress due to their size are likely to remain unnoticed.
They added that moving children to the city of tents without emotionally preparing them or giving them the opportunity to speak from friends can complicate the trauma many of them are struggling with.
Syria urges U.S., French and Turkish “occupation forces” to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid Al Moualem called on Syrian refugees to return home, even if war has been going on in the country for the eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces on Syrian soil are illegal, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that they will “act accordingly”.
“They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally,” he told the assembly.
Moualem said the “war on terrorism” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions have had to leave their homes, “almost finished.”
He said Damascus would continue to “fight this sacred battle until we clear the Syrian territory” of both terrorist groups and “any illegal foreign presence.”
The United Nations has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the territory of this war-torn country.
Regarding the refugees, Moualem said conditions were appropriate for them to return, and accused “some Western countries” of “spreading unreasonable fears” that convinced refugees to stay abroad.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to contribute to their easier return,” he said.
“They are changing into a political issue, which should be an exclusive humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have warned Syria that it will not receive the funds until Assad and the opposition reach an agreement on the end of the war.
U.N. diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a buffer zone in the last important rebel base, Idlib, has created an opportunity to continue political talks.
The Russo-Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the three-million-strong province.
Moualem, however, stressed that the deal had a “clear deadline” and expressed hope that military intervention would be directed against jihadists, including Nusra Front fighters linked to Al Qaeda, who “will be eradicated.”
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene the first meeting of a new committee, made up of members of the government and opposition, to prepare a post-war constitution for Syria and push the way for elections.
Moualem defined the conditions for the Syrian government to participate in the committee, saying that the committee's work should be limited to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution", and warned against interference.
Why Trump Will Reach a Second Mandate
Following this conclusion, Mr Trump will win the 2020 re-election unless, as many liberal viewers hope, his presidency ends prematurely with an interpellation and scandal.
Which would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic final of the presidency ever!”
There are no signs of fatigue in the audience.
As of 2014, CNN’s viewership at its peak has more than doubled to 1.05 million, and MSNBC’s viewership has nearly tripled to 1.6 million.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers, more than four years ago, when Nielsen had 1.7 million viewers, and The Rachel Maddow Show on MSNBC has reached the highest number of new cable subscribers with 3.5 milliseconds.
“It’s a fire that attracts people because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Baer, head of Designated Survivor, about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after the attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, acclaimed comedy writer and author of “Just Funny Parts: And Some Hard Truths About Cheating at the Hollywood Boys Club,” offers a different explanation.
Remember the cab ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
Why, she asked.
“He said, ‘Because it makes me laugh,’” she told me.
There's a fun value in chaos.
Contrary to what is seen on television, Washington’s story could, of course, decide the future of the Roe vs. Wad case depending on whether immigrant families can reunite and the health of the global economy.
Turn off is a luxury that can only be afforded by the most privileged spectators.
Nevertheless, a six-way look at the round table of experts discussing the use of a source “from a deep background” for the book “Fear” by Bob Woodward, $15,000 worth of leather jackets (“clothes, thickly suffocated,” according to Trump’s descriptions.
For example, I will never look at Super Maria the same again.
“Part of his acting, which evokes the reality of the show, is that he offers something every night,” said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the show Unawn Stars, about the cast of Trump’s show and the daytime drama.
You can’t afford to miss an episode, otherwise you’re in the back.
When I was talking to Mr. Fleiss this week, he was outside his home on the north coast of Kauaia sunny 80 degrees (26.7 <0xC2><0xB0>C), but he was stunned inside watching MSNBC when he was filming CNN.
He couldn't tear himself apart in any way, even when Brett Kavanaugh faced the Senate committee and hung in the air the future of the Supreme Court.
“I remember when we created all these crazy shows and people were like, ‘This is the end of Western civilization,’” Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turned out they were right.”

Foreign money is being raised in preparation for the tightest parliamentary elections
It is not surprising that there is a flood of money in Pennsylvania’s 17th district, as two candidates were in the race for the same seat due to the reorganization of congressional districts.
This recently re-divided suburban district of Pittsburgh is home to Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in the special election this spring in the second district.
Lamb is competing with fellow Republican Keith Rothfuss, who is currently representing the old Pennsylvania 12th district, which is heavily overlapping with the new 17th district.
The maps were reprinted when the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were illegally painted in favor of the Republicans.
The contest in the new 17th arrondissement touched on the fight to fund the campaign between the main party financial bodies, the Congressional Committee for Democratic Campaigns (DCCC) and the National Republican Committees (NRCC).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a close victory in the widely monitored March special election for the 18th District of Pennsylvania.
This seat has been occupied by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump has won 20 points in the district.
Political commentators attribute a slight advantage to the Democrats.
In the U.S., they were considering sanctions against El Salvador for China’s support, then they withdrew.
Diplomats have found that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Trump had a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varelo in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the leadership of Trump’s organization.
U.S. State Department officials have decided to withdraw U.S. heads of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama from the “recent decision to stop Taiwan recognition,” the ministry’s spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But they were thinking about sanctions on El Salvador, which is estimated to receive $140 million in US aid in 2017, including aid to combat drug trafficking, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included a restriction on financial aid and a targeted restriction on the issuance of visas, would severely affect the Central American country with high unemployment and the number of murders.
During internal meetings, North American and Central American officials deferred a high-level conference on security and economic development to continue a similar meeting last year, which was assessed as a step forward in the prevention of migration towards the United States.
By mid-September, top government officials have made it clear that they want the conference to continue, concluding their thoughts on the sanctions for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now in charge of addressing attendees of the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, a sign of the importance the U.S. government attaches to the meeting, diplomats added.
The three U.S. envoys returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic silently without new hard messages or sanctions from Washington.
The White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by three US officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss them on condition of anonymity.
Their testimony was confirmed by an outside analyst who was close to the government and also spoke about it on condition of anonymity.
Historical Comparatives
The next unpleasant news could be the report by Special Adviser Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of the judiciary, of which there is now very much evidence in the public records.
Mueller is also expected to investigate whether Mr. Trump’s campaign was collaborating with Russia in an attack on the US election.
If Congress changes hands, Mr. Trump will have to answer to these authorities and perhaps even his colleagues’ jury just as he prepares to address his constituents again.
There are many questions in this regard, and I do not want to say that Mr Trump's fall is inevitable, nor do his colleagues in Europe.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we will have to make decisions that will affect how long the fight could last.
In 1938, German officials were ready to carry out a coup against Hitler if the West would rebel against him and support Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We were unsuccessful, so we missed the opportunity to avoid the year of sacrifice that followed.
At such breakthroughs, the flow of history is changing and the impenetrable march of democracy is accelerating or inhibiting.
The U.S. is facing a number of such breakthroughs right now.
What are we going to do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who has the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been on the brink since this official reported that last year he had proposed a covert recording of the president and speculated that he was unsuitable for the position.
Mr. Rosenstein said the report by The Times was inaccurate.
“How will we respond if the FBI investigation requested by Brett Kavanaugh is not exhaustive or fair, or if he is appointed Supreme Court Justice despite credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And most importantly, are we going to vote in the midterm elections for Congress that will demand Mr. Trump’s responsibility?
If we fail in these tests, democracy is waiting for a long winter.
But I am sure that we will not fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy house.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later, she ordered me to light a Sabbath candle on a swastika table.

Ranger Graham Dorrans optimistic about Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, with it being clear that their victory over Austria after an impressive draw against Villarreal in Spain earlier this month will put them in a compelling position to qualify for Group G of the European League.
Knee injury prevented fellow player Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance in the season ahead of a 2–2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use it as a springboard for greater achievements.
“It was a point for us because Villarreal is a strong team,” said the 31-year-old.
“We came into the game in the belief that we can achieve something and take the point.
You might end up winning, but in general, it’s probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half, but we showed up and we were better side in the second half.
There will be another big European night on Thursday.
We hope we can get three points, but it will be a tough game because they have achieved a good result in the last game, but I am sure with the crowd behind us that we can try and achieve a positive result.
“The last year was undoubtedly difficult, given everything that happened, including injuries and changes at the club itself, but I have a good feeling about this place now.
The team is good and the guys really enjoy it; the training is good.
I hope that we can continue now, let the last season be left behind and achieve success.”
Poor sleep of women due to fear of savings
Despite the fact that the respondents had a clear idea of how to take care of them, few people spoke to their family members about it.
Half of the survey respondents from the nationwide insurance company were actually talking to spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent of the respondents said they were talking about it with their children.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t try to talk about it,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
You can start in the following way.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare a family to take care of you if you don’t talk to her about it in time.
Talk to your counselor and family about where and how you want to receive care, as this can be an important factor in estimating costs.
Include a financial advisor: Your financial advisor can help you find a way to pay for these costs.
Your choice of financing long-term care can include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a combination of cash value and life insurance policy to cover these costs, or self-insurance with your own funds, if you can afford it.
Prepare the necessary legal documents: Prepare for legal battles during the transition.
Choose a health representative by identifying a trusted person who will oversee your health care and ensure that the specialists will take into account your health wishes if you are unable to communicate.
Also consider empowering a person for his or her finances.
Choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions for you and ensure that your bills will be paid if you are not able to do it yourself.
Don’t forget the little details: Imagine that your elderly parent urgently needs medical attention and is on his way to the hospital.
Will you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
Write this information down in the action plan so that you are ready.
“It’s not just about your finances. Do you know the doctors?” Martin asked.
“What medications are you taking?
Who will take care of the dog?

In Ilfracombe, a man was shot several times with an air rifle.
A man who returned home at night was shot several times with an air rifle.
The shooter, in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot several times in the chest, stomach and arm.
Police described the shooting, which took place around 2:30 p.m. British time, as an “accidental act.”
She didn't see her attacker's victim.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police have called on potential witnesses to report.
Earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, and the number of victims is expected to increase.
With the intercepted communications, rescuers from the Donggal Regency, an area north of Palu, closer to the epicenter of the magnitude 7.5 quake, were unable to obtain any information.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated in Palu after the earthquake.
Some key information about Palu and Donggali on Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi, a province located at the end of the narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi and is estimated to have a population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when it was hit by an earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala is a landscape that stretches along more than 300 km (180 miles) of coastline in the northwestern part of the island of Sulavezi.
The Regency, the administrative unit under the province, had an estimated population of 299,000 in 2017.
The main economic activities of the Central Sulawesi province are fishing and farming, especially in the central Donggala region.
An important activity in the province is also nickel mining, which is mostly carried out in Morovali, on the opposite side of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggaro have been hit several times by a tsunami over the past 100 years, according to an Indonesian agency to mitigate the effects of natural disasters.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
In 1996, a tsunami struck northern Donggao and killed nine people.
Indonesia sits on the quake-active Pacific Ring of Fire, which is why earthquakes occur here on a regular basis.
In recent years, some major earthquakes and tsunamis have been the following:
2004: A major quake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on December 26 caused a tsunami that affected 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the Indian coast, of which more than half in Aceh.
2005: Severe quakes hit western Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake hit the southern part of Java, Indonesia’s most populated island, and triggered a tsunami that flooded its southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake occurred near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of Western Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 quake struck one of the Mentawai Islands and triggered a tsunami up to 10 meters high that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: The quake struck the Pidie Jaya Regency in Aceh and caused death and panic when people remembered the deadly earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
This time the tsunami did not explode, but the collapse of the buildings resulted in the deaths of more than 100 people.
2018: Major earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok and killed more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily detained thousands of tourists.
The arrest of Sarah Palin’s eldest son for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
A 29-year-old man from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, obstruction of reporting domestic violence and resisting arrest, the Alaska State Troopers police agency said on Saturday.
According to a police report, Palin's friends, when she tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, picked up the phone.
Palina was detained at the Mat-Su Precautionary Institution and is in detention under a $500 unsecured guarantee, the KTUU television network reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he said he was “definitely innocent” when asked about the defence, the network reported.
Palina has been charged with three Class A offences, meaning he could be jailed for up to one year and fined $250,000.
He was also charged with one Class B offence, which is punishable by one day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
The burning of the crime is not the first time.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
My mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, meddling in reports of domestic violence and possession of weapons in an alcoholic state in connection with the event.
Palin's girlfriend said he hit her in the face.
In 2016, veteran groups criticised Sarah Palin for linking her son’s violent behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder after returning from military service in Iraq.
Tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds of dead
At least 384 people were killed in the quake that hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The magnitude 7.5 earthquake triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electrical and communication networks have been discontinued, and the number of deaths is expected to increase in the coming days.
The quake occurred just off central Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
There are videos circulating on social media that show the moment of the earthquake.
When a tsunami struck on the coast, hundreds of people stayed at the beach festival in Palu.
Federal prosecutors call for rare death penalty for suspected terrorist attack in New York City
Federal prosecutors in New York are demanding the death penalty for Sayfull Saipov, a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people. This is a rare punishment for a federal crime in the country they have not carried out since 1953.
Saipov, 30, was supposed to use a rented delivery truck to carry out the attack on a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, when he drove more pedestrians and cyclists in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov “intentionally” killed eight victims and “intentionally” caused serious bodily harm, it is written in a statement on the request for the death penalty filed in the Southern District of New York.
According to the court document, the reason for the death penalty may be any of the charges.
Several weeks after the attack, Saipova’s grand federal jury briefed the 22-point indictment, which included eight counts of extortion-assisted murder, typically used by federal prosecutors in cases of organized crime, and a count of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack called for “significant planning and intention,” prosecutors said, describing Saipo’s approach as “cowardly, cruel, and resentful.”
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injury, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlie, Hernano Ferruchi, Hernano Diego Mendoza, and Alejandra Daccomin.”
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The District Court for the Southern District ruled the last death penalty ten years ago.
The indictee, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers and eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The death penalty was last pronounced in New York City in a federal case in 1953 to Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who killed him because of an espionage conspiracy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years before.
Both Rosenbergs were killed on the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a citizen of Uzbekistan, did not show regret in the days and months following the attack, according to the court documents.
According to police, he told investigators he felt good about what he had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack by ISIS videos he watched on his phone.
Police also said they had asked for the ISIS flag to be waived in their hospital room.
On 22 counts, he said he was innocent.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were “clearly disappointed” by the prosecutor’s decision.
“We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty instead of admitting guilt in exchange for life in prison without the possibility of exoneration for all involved will only prolong the suffering associated with these events,” Patton said.
Saipo's defense team has previously asked prosecutors not to demand the death penalty.
Nigel Farage should be indebted to the Brexit negotiations, says MEP
Nigel Farage promised to “mobilize the people’s army” during a protest at the Tories conference.
The former Ukip leader said politicians should “feel the heat” of Eurosceptics when one of his own MEPs suggested Theresa May should be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said on a trip to Birmingham that the United Kingdom would "be out now" if he was Brexit secretary to Mr Farage.
But the challenge facing Mr Mayeva in coordinating his deep-seated species was also highlighted by the Tories, who favored Brexit resignations, who joined a separate protest against the city’s Brexit.
The prime minister is trying to keep her plan in line between the attacks of Brexit advocates, Brexit opponents and the EU.
The Allies insisted that Mayeva would try to reach an agreement in Brussels despite the opposition and force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and “chaos.”
Mr. Bone is at a Leave Means Leave meeting in Solihulu to "want to get rid of the Chequers".
He said that we should appoint Mr Farage as our interlocutor and assign him responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he was in charge, we’d be out by now,” he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: "I will support Brexit, but we must get rid of Chequers."
He described his opposition to the EU in the following words: “We did not fight in the world wars to be servants now.
In our own country, we want to adopt our own laws.”
Mr. Bone rejected the proposals that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay in the EU is completely unrealistic.”
The meeting was also attended by Andrea Jenkyns, a Tory Brexitetter, who told the rapporteurs: “I simply say, ‘Premier Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is not popular with the general public, and the opposition will not vote for it, and it is unpopular with our party and our activists, who are active on the streets and even lead us to elections.
Please leave the Chequers and start listening.’”
In a message addressed to Ms Maye, she added: “Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises.”
Farage said at a meeting that politicians should be given a “feeling of heat” if they intend to issue a decision taken in a referendum in 2016.
“Now it’s a matter of trust between us – the people – and our political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to issue Brexit, and today we’re meeting to tell them, ‘We won’t let you do that.’”
In a statement, he said: “I want our political class, which is on the brink of Brexit betrayal, to feel the heat.”
“We are mobilizing the people’s army of this country, which has guaranteed us a Brexit victory, and we will not rest until we become an independent, autonomous, proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, the Remainers walked through Birmingham, where they then had a two-door concert in the city centre.
A handful of activists waved the Tories flags against Brexit this weekend after the group was founded.
The Labour nobility, Lord Adonis, ridiculed the Conservatives over security issues in using the party's app after the conference opened.
“These are the people who tell us that they can set up IT systems and all the technology for a Canada plus plus deal, for a free border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“This is a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren's possible pull for president's position will be "examined carefully"
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says that “participation in the presidential race will be carefully studied” after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that a Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future at a meeting with citizens in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who is often critical of President Donald Trump, will face re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was the co-president of Trump’s 2016 Massachusetts election campaign.
It is at the heart of speculation that it will be able to deal with Trump in 2020.
The event in Holyoke on Saturday afternoon was her 36th meeting with voters in the form of a “town hall” since Trump became president.
One of the participants asked her if she was going to run for president.
Warren responded, “It’s time to bring women down to Washington and fix our corrupt government, which is what the woman at the top demands.”
Arrest after the death of LSU player Sims in the shooting
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, on Saturday said they had arrested a suspect in the shooting of LSU basketball player Wayd Sims on Friday.
A police station in Baton Rouge reported the arrest of 20-year-old Simpson at a press conference at 11 a.m.
They released a video of Friday's shooting and asked for help in identifying the person on the video.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot and killed early Friday near the Southern University campus.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head and died as a result," Murphy J. Paul, the police chief, said in a statement.
Wayde intervened to protect a friend, and Simpson shot him.
Simpson admitted at the hearing that he was at the end of the event, that he had a gun and that he shot Wayd Sims.
Simpson was arrested unrestrained and taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
The Sims, a 198-centimeter young man who grew up in Baton Rouge, last season played 32 games with 10 starts, an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 jumps per game.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is approaching the title of World Champion, and the team has ordered him to pass the win to Sebastian Vettl
On Saturday, the moment Valtteri Boltas qualified against Lewis Hamilton, it became clear that "the Mercedes team will have a strong impact on the race".
Bottas started well at the start and almost left Hamilton on the dry when he defended his position in the first two laps and invited Vettla to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to get into boxing and let Hamilton drive on a traffic tail, which should be decisive.
Mercedes later drove into the box and left him behind Vettlom, but Hamilton noticed after some driving action that the Ferrari driver's reluctance leaves the inside open and risks lagging behind after two defensive moves in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started with the last kind of network and was in seventh place until the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
Then, most of the race vehicles were without a change of tires, as he intended to perform a quick finish, beat Kim Raikkonen and take fourth place.
He eventually led the boxing team in the 44th round, but was unable to increase speed in the remaining eight rounds, so he took fourth place in Raikkonen.
It’s a tough day because Valtteri drove fantastically all weekend and was a real knight when he let me through.
“The team did a really great job of getting to the first and second place,” Hamilton said.
It was a really bad body language.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Saturday mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein for her insistence that she did not disclose a letter from Christine Blasey Ford that accused Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
At a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly touch Ford’s testimony before the Senate Investigative Commission, but instead said that what is happening in the Senate says people are “evil, corrupt, and false.”
“The only beautiful thing that can happen and that has happened in the Senate in recent days is that we can see the anger when you can see that people are evil, corrupt and false,” he said.
“When you look at revelations and revelations, people say, ‘No, I didn’t do that.’”
I didn’t do that.”
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you reveal this?
Remember her answer... you revealed the document – ‘Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn’t reveal it.”
All right, wait a minute.
We revealed it to us ... No, we didn’t,” he added regarding the impression of the senator.
Ford sent a letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh in July, and it was revealed to the media in early September — but Feinstein denies it came from her office.
“I did not hide Dr. Ford’s complaint, I did not disclose her letter,” a Hill Feinstein official told the commission.
“She asked me for confidentiality and I kept it confidential as she asked.”
But her denial apparently did not suit the president, who said at a meeting on Saturday night: “I tell you, that was a really bad body language.
“Maybe not, but it was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
In defense of a candidate for the Supreme Court, who was accused by three women of inappropriate sexual behavior, the president suggested that Democrats abuse the accusations for their own purposes.
“They are determined that they will regain their power with all possible means.
You have seen evil, disgust, they don’t care who they’re hurting and who they have to drive to break into power and control,” the president said in a press release.
Elite League: Dundee Stars vs Belfast Giants: 5:3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Grand Prix against Dundee.
The Dundee Stars retaliated for Friday's Elite League loss against the Belfast Giants with a 5:3 victory in Saturday's Dundee match.
The Giants scored early on with two goals from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie equalized for the home side, and then Dwyer regained the lead for Giants.
Francois Bouchard equalised for the Dundees before two goals from Lundvald Nielsen secured them a win.
This was the third defeat of the season in the Elite League for Adam Keefe, who defeated Dundee 2–1 on Friday night.
It was the fourth match of the season between the teams, with Giants winning in the previous three games.
Dwyer scored his first goal in the game in the fourth minute with 3:35 assisted by Kendall McFaull, who hit Beauvilliers four minutes later, but gave up David Rutherford.
In the intensive introductory part, Sullivan told the game home again at 13:10, and Matt Marquardt gave Cownie an equation at 15:16.
Dwyer took care of the Giants' leadership on vacation when he scored his second goal at the end of the first third.
The home side regrouped, and Bouchard compensated for the delay with a strong goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran helped bring Nielsen to Dundee's advantage at the end of the second third, scoring his team's fifth goal of the half-time and scoring his team's fifth goal in the last half.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will play the next match on Friday at home in Milton Keynes.
Air traffic controller has allowed hundreds of people on the plane to escape the earthquake with his death
Indonesian air traffic controllers celebrate as heroes after sacrificing life so that a plane with hundreds of people could safely take off.
More than 800 people were killed in Friday's quake on the island of Sulawesi, followed by a tsunami.
The area continues to be plagued by strong aftershocks, and many people are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Even though the collaborators fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung did not leave his job in the heavily swaying control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu.
It remained in it that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could safely take off.
Then he jumped out of the control tower because he thought he was breaking.
He later died in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia's Yohannes Sirait said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, Australian news agency ABC News reported.
We have prepared a helicopter to transport him from Balikpapan, Kalimantan, to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“Our heart is beating when we hear it,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the number of deaths could reach thousands, as the State Disaster Relief Agency said access to cities in Donggala, Sighi and Boutonga was limited.
“The death toll is expected to increase, as many bodies were under the rubble and many were not reached,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
The pilgrimage, where the mass funeral will take place on Sunday, has been devastated by waves up to six meters high.
Military and commercial aircraft are provided with assistance and care.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute a rescue vehicle brings bodies.
There is a lack of clean water.
Mini-markets are everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to help the survivors, but we don’t know what they will find.
It’s a tragedy, but it can get even worse.”
On Sunday, Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palo, addressing the National Army: “I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?” according to CNN.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok, in which more than 550 people died.
Micronesian plane crash: Air Niugini says one man is missing after crashing the plane in the lagoon
The airline, which operated a flight that crashed into the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, now says one person is missing after it was initially reported that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement on Saturday afternoon that it was missing a male passenger.
The airline said it was cooperating with local authorities, hospitals and investigators in the search for the missing person.
The call for more information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality, did not immediately respond.
Local ships helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water as it attempted to land at an airport on the island of Chuuk.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said there were eight passengers left at the hospital on Saturday, all of whom were in stable condition.
The cause of the crash and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane had landed in a lagoon just in front of the track.
There were reports that the plane had missed the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane landed at a very low altitude.
“That’s very good,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he, along with other passengers, managed to break through the water reaching the belt to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He said the stewardesses panicked and yelled, but he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors who repaired the pier had also stepped in to help, helping each other with the rescue by using an inflatable boat that transported people to land before the plane sank to about 30 meters (100 feet) deep.
Air Safety Network data shows that 111 people have died in plane crashes in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, but this is the first crash that happened to Air Niugini.
Analyst has determined the time of night when a woman was burned alive
The prosecutor's office on Saturday presented its evidence in a retrial to a man who was accused of burning a woman alive from Mississippi in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett has spent several hours as an expert in intelligence analysis.
The jury described how he used phone records to determine the movement of 29-year-old indictee Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of her death.
Rowlett said he received location data from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers on the eve of her death, contradicting his previous claims, according to The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was at Chambers's at the time when he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police contacted Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, he said he " lied because [my] truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said that Chambers had known for about two weeks at the time of her death.
Video footage on her cell phone shows that she only met for a week.
Rowlett said that in the time after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' texts, calls and contact details from his phone.
“He wiped her out of his life,” Hale said.
The defense is expected to present the final arguments on Saturday.
The judge said that the trial would be judged by the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is Conscious Hip Hop?
The Hiphop trio wants to evoke a negative image of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The Bristol-based group The High Breed claims that hip hop has distanced itself from its original political and social commitment.
They want to go back to its roots and make conscious hip hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently experienced a resurgence in the UK with artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black man?!
New York babysitter sues couple for firing her for 'racist' message
A New York babysitter is suing the couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a wrongly sent message from her mother, who complained that she was "another black woman."
The couple denies racist behavior and compares the lawsuit to "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two, expressed disappointment in 2016 when the arrival of a new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, found that she was black.
“NEEEEEEEEE IS NOT A BLACK,” Plasco-Flaxmanov wrote in a message to her husband.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Maurice twice.
After discovering her shortness of breath, Plasco-Flaxmanov, who felt “unpleasant,” pardoned Maurice, saying that her departing babysitter, who was an African-American, was doing her job poorly, so New York wants to hire Filipinos.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for a day's work, and then sent home with Uber.
Maurice is now seeking compensation from the couple in court for $350 a day for a six-month period to perform the work for which she was initially hired, albeit without a contract.
“I want to show them, you know, things like that don’t get done,” she told Post on Friday, adding: “I know it’s discrimination.”
The pair responded to allegations of racism by claiming that Maurice's dismissal was reasonable, fearing that she would no longer be trusted after regret.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t want to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists,” husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
“Would you be willing to entrust your children to someone you were rude to, even if it happened by mistake?
Your newborn baby?
“Come on.”
Comparing the lawsuit with “emigration,” Plasco said that his wife gave birth to the baby just two months ago and was in a “very difficult situation”.
“Are you going to get over someone like that?
That’s not very good,” added the investment banker.
Although the trial is still underway, the court of public opinion of the couple on social networks has quickly condemned his behavior and way of thinking.
The publishers of the stories about the bear Paddington feared that readers would not connect with the talking bear, reveals a new letter
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: “It is difficult to put yourself in the skin of someone who reads the book for the first time before it was published.
It’s really fun to find out now that Paddington has become a huge hit.”
She said her father, who initially worked as a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired to write a children's book about a little bear toy, would be outraged at refusing his work, adding that after his death last year it was the 60th anniversary of the book "gray-sweet".
As for the Paddington bear, whom she described as “a very important member of our family,” she said her father was very proud of his ultimate success.
“There was a man who didn’t like to brag,” she said.
“But since the Paddington bear was so real to him, it was almost as if your child had achieved something: you are proud of him, even if you don’t really do it yourself.
I think he looked at the success of Paddington in a similar way.
Although it was his idea and his imagination, success has always been attributed to the bear Paddington himself.”
My daughter died and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
Upon landing, her daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors worked tirelessly to preserve her life.
“She called over regularly to tell her she really felt bad that she didn’t expect it to happen,” said Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I got a call from Nad. He told me that she would die within the next two minutes, and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I am.
I said, “Tashi, I love you so much, baby.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications given to her by doctors to keep her heart pumping were slowly absorbed and left her system.
She had been dead for a while, and that was the end of her life.
All I had to do was sit and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I couldn’t scream or cry because I was in a position to be surrounded by family and people.
I really had to hold on.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan Laperouse, who had already lamented the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane along with other passengers, unaware of the test she is undergoing.
“Nobody knew,” she said.
“I had my head down and tears were pouring on my face all the time.
It’s hard to explain, but I felt that strong feeling of compassion for Hope on the plane.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Tormenting female beauty posters to prevent suicides on bridge
Two women who have lost a loved one to suicide are trying to repel others in order to take their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys on the Valais Bridge stick posters with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can turn to for support.
Ms. Tyler's son was 13 years old when he was depressed, and he killed himself at the age of 18.
“For no parent, I don’t want them to feel the way I do every day,” she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising chef with an infectious smile.
“Everybody knew him by his smile.
They always said that his smile brightened every room.
Before his death, however, he stopped working because he was “in a really dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler’s 11-year-old brother was the one who found his cousin when he took his own life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I'm constantly worried that the domino effect will be triggered."
Mrs. Davis made posters “to let other people know that there are people you can talk to and talk to, even if it’s a friend.
Don’t sit in silence, you need to talk.”
Mrs. Humphreys, who had been Davies' friend for several years, lost Marka, who had been her partner for 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
“He didn’t say he felt depressed or depressed or anything else,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
On Christmas Day, he was completely on the floor, and when the kids opened the gifts, he didn’t make eye contact with them or anything.”
She said his death was a serious trauma to them, but they had to process it: “She hit a hole in the whole family.
She ripped us apart.
But we have to continue and fight.”

The future of Brett Kavanaugh hangs in the air at the start of an FBI investigation
“I thought that if we could actually carry out what he was asking for — a limited investigation of duration and scope — that might make us a point,” Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the world would “deteriorate” due to tightening party stances.
Why don't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their resistance is due to the time the investigation would take place.
There are only five weeks left until the midterm elections on November 6 – if Republicans are expected to cut back badly, this will greatly weaken them in an attempt to elect the desired person to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush has repeatedly phoned the senators to lobby in support of Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and was introduced by his current wife Ashley, who is now Bush’s personal secretary.
What will happen when the FBI prepares a report?
The Senate, which currently consists of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats, will vote.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can collect at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would bring Mike Pence, Vice President, a breakthrough from the pat position and election to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean refugees has been declining under Kim.
The number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong Un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Byeong-seug Park, based on data from the South Korean Ministry of Consolidation, said 1,127 people had fled last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said the key factors were tighter border controls between North Korea and China and the price increase demanded by human traffickers.
Pyongyang has not publicly commented on this yet.
The vast majority of refugees from North Korea are finally offering South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them pass through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone between the two Koreas.
China considers migrants to be illegal migrants rather than refugees and is often forcibly repatriated.
Relations between the North and the South – which are technically still at war – have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang at talks focused on stalled denuclearization negotiations.
This happened after a historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un in Singapore, where they generally agreed on an effort for the Korean peninsula without nuclear weapons.
On Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Jong-ho imposed a ban on U.S. sanctions.
“Without confidence from the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances we will not unilaterally disarm,” Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was not fit for a Supreme Court job
Minority House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was "significantly unsuitable for a job at the Supreme Court."
Pelosi said in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I can’t think of anything other than that a woman would be labeled ‘hysterical’ if she did so,” Pelosi said in a statement to the Senate Investigative Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh vehemently denied accusations of sexually assaulting Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
In the introductory statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, he almost occasionally sneezed and sneezed when discussing his family and high school years.
He also explicitly denounced the Democrats in the commission and labeled the charges against him as a “gross and coordinated sweep” organized by the Liberals, angry that Hillary Clinton lost in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she felt that Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he should not be appointed a supreme judge, as it showed that he was biased towards the Democrats.
“I think he discredited himself with such statements and the way he dealt with the Clintons and Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi's question is whether she will try to impose a constitutional charge against Kavanaugh if it is confirmed and Democrats get a majority in the House of Representatives, for a moment.
“I’ll say this – if Congress or the FBI doesn’t tell the truth, it’s inappropriate not only for the Supreme Court, but also for the court where it is now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Federal Court of Appeals in Washington.
Pelosi said she was concerned as a Democrat about Kavanaugh's possible decision against the Accessible Health Care Act or the Roe v. Wadu case as a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh evaded the question of whether he would overturn some of the Supreme Court’s decisions.
“Now is not the time for a hysterical, unbiased person to go to court and expect us to say, ‘Isn’t that wonderful?’” Pelosi said.
And a woman must be raped.
It is a just outcome, after months and years of pouring out anger, and can not express it without crying.
“We play when we’re angry,” she told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think that’s rare, do you think?”
She continued: “I was greatly helped by a woman who was a director who was also crying when she was angry, but she developed the technique, and when she got angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to, ‘Maybe I feel sad, sorry.
I am angry.”
And then she just went on.
It seemed to me to be superb.”
Tears are allowed as an outlet for anger in part because people misunderstand them.
One of my most powerful memories of my early career, when I was working in an office dominated by men, where I once felt like crying in inexpressible anger, was an event when an older woman grabbed me by the neck – a cold boss who never stood by me.
“Never let them see you cry,” she said.
“They won’t know you’re angry.
They’ll think you’re sad, and they’ll be glad you’ve been hurt.”
Patricia Schroeder, a former Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential nomination.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught jumping across a fence in a boat called Monkey Business and had to step out of the competition, Mr. Schroeder was deeply depressed to find that there was no reason she could not run for president alone.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” she said, smiling 30 years later.
“There were seven other candidates in the competition and one more was the last thing needed at the time.
At the time, the game was called “Snowflake and Seven Sticks.”
Since the latter joined the campaign, she was behind in fundraising, so she decided not to enter the game unless she raised $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters, who gave the men $1,000, gave her only $250.
“Do they think I’ll get a discount?” she asked.
When she announced in a conversation that she would not start an official campaign, her emotions – gratitude to the people who supported her, dissatisfaction with the system, which made it so hard for her to raise money and focus on voters instead of delegates, and anger over sexism – were so overwhelming.
“You would think I had a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder recalled the media reactions.
“They would think my official sponsor was Kleenex.
I remember thinking about what they would write on my graveyard.
“Did she cry?”
How the U.S.-China War Could Benefit Beijing
The initial salves of the U.S.-China trade war were deafening, and although the battle has not yet ended, experts say the split between the two countries could benefit Beijing in the long run.
Donald Trump, the US president, triggered the first warning earlier this year by taxing key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel, and aluminum.
The most significant escalation occurred this week with new tariffs on goods worth USD 200 billion (GBP 150 billion), effectively taxing half of all goods coming to the United States from China.
Beijing has repeatedly avenged itself with equivalent retaliatory measures, most recently with tariffs ranging from 5 to 10 percent on US goods worth $60 billion.
China, the world’s second-largest economy, has pledged to move an eye-to-eye with the United States and will probably not be in the middle anytime soon.
In order to let Washington go, China would have to agree to his demands, but the U.S. public removal of President Xi Jinping would be too shameful.
Experts say, however, that if Beijing can pull the right moves, U.S. pressures into a trade war could have a long-term positive impact on China by reducing the mutual dependence of both economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that would trigger an economic shake-up in any of the countries is actually far more dangerous than observers have thought so far,” said Abigail Grace, a senior fellow at the Center, who is currently working for the Center.
Syria 'ready' to return refugees, says foreign minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees, and is asking for help in rebuilding a country that has been devastated by the more than seven-year war.
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid Al Moualem said that the situation in the country is improving.
“Today, the conditions on the ground are more stable and safe because of the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to sanitize areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normal status.
All the conditions for the voluntary return to the country of refugees who had to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and livelihoods are now met.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
The other six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian aid.
Al Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome aid in the reconstruction of the devastated country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from the countries that sponsored the rebels.
Europe has won the Ryder Cup in Paris.
The Europa team won the 2018 Ryder Cup with a final score of 16.5 against 10.5 at Le Golf National in Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup since 1993.
Europe has won the crown once again as the team of Danish captain Thomas Björn scored 14.5 points to win over the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who had trouble through most of the championship, locked the ball in the water at the 16th hole in a par-3 game in his initial hit, which forced him to hand the game over to Francesca Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari shined through all rounds and became one of the four players who have achieved a 5-0-0 score at any time since the start of the championship in its current form in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth defeated the lowest-ranked player of the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark with 5 and 4.
The world's top-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2-1 to England's Ian Poulter, who may have played in the Ryder Cup for the last time.
The veteran of Ryder's eight cups, Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the most successful European player of all time with 25.5 points.
“I don’t usually cry, but I can’t help myself today.
This year has been difficult.
I am very grateful to Thomas for bringing me up and believing in you.
I'm so happy, I'm so happy we won the cup again.
It’s a team and I’m really glad I was able to help,” Garcia said emotionally after the European victory.
The relay is given to John Ram, who on Sunday defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods at the 2nd and 1st individual games.
“I feel incredibly proud to have managed to beat Tiger Woods. When I grew up, I watched his games,” said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four games in France, and now has a career record in the Ryder Cup 13-21-3.
This is an unusual statistic for one of the greatest players of all time who won 14 major titles right behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team worked tirelessly all week to find the right path, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level golf throughout the championship.
After a poor performance for his team, the American captain said, "I'm so proud of these guys, they fought."
In the morning, we put some pressure on Europe for a moment.
We've missed it.

He's a great captain.
All of his 12 players played very well.
We're gonna have to get back together, I'm gonna work with the PGA and our Ryder Cup committee, and we're gonna move on.
I really love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
Head down.
They were playing us.”
