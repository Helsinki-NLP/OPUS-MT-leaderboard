From my point of view, the literature program was formed by ladies of the Balzac age on the basis of their interests.
From the Russian literature of the 19th century we preferred Danilevsky and Wolkonsky.
They wrote belletristics, of course, from the point of view of the very ladies of Balzac age.
And the psychology and torture of the heroines of Tolstoy and Turgenev for teenagers are not so interesting.
Adolescents are rarely interested in the psychology of heroes.
Thank you very much, very interesting.
Maybe the roses were plush to depict a certain variety of them?
There are roses of such color and with such a structure of the foliage, reminiscent of the bark, usually dark red, bordeaux tones.

Mattress Promtex Micropacket Prestige 105<0xD1><0x85>195.
Model "Micropack Prestige": comfort and natural composition.
The mattress has different hardness sides: the medium-hard surface is formed by latexed coconut fiber and natural latex, moderately soft - a plate of natural latex.
A spring block with 1000 springs per square meter quickly adapts to the body of the sleeping person, warning of the appearance of the "wave" or "hammer" effect.
Among the advantages of the model it is necessary to distinguish breathable materials.
The latex, perforated for air permeability, is perfectly ventilated naturally, as is the coconut coir.
Thanks to this, a healthy microclimate of the sleeping space is maintained.
The mattress also has an extended warranty period.
The official warranty period from the manufacturer is 5 years, in fact the service life of the mattress is longer.
Dust and pollution protection is applied to a removable jacquard case, supplied as a kit.
Buy an orthopedic pillow in pairs to the mattress – it is recommended to maintain the optimal position of the spine during sleep.
The filler determines the purpose of the sides - coconut serves as an anatomical support for the back, latex relaxes the muscles.

It’s better not to have anything like this...
Either look for a third-party driver or someone who is willing to invest and work with you in a stake.

Andrey, you've been well-explained that pensioners work in schools, they won't work in the command line.
The computer science teacher will not be able to help, he has not been taught, the school is playing games in the windows.
So there is no support.
I remember with horror these tables and guests in the house of my parents.
Guests on the threshold, and on the plate, the stoves are still roasting, the mother glazed houses the floor.
Oh, my God, I've been sitting at the table with no power.
And then you win the dishes, clean the house.
A week before the holiday, drag the food, two days of scratching, the day of cleaning after.
What about the guests?
They're fine, and the cake is definitely with them.
Since then, I don't like holidays, guests.
Even for my family, I cover the table at a minimum.
And I cook them snacks, baking very often just like that.
Germany: Fourth Coronavirus Vaccination Unavoidable
The fourth vaccination will be required in the summer or autumn of 2022.
According to the expert, the current vaccination in Germany will not be final, but will continue with new strength.
Despite an active vaccination campaign in Germany, neither two nor three doses of the coronavirus vaccine will likely not be enough for full protection.
The head of the Association of General Practitioners Ulrich Weigeldt is convinced of this.
This was reported on Saturday, December 11, by Die Welt.
“We expect the fourth vaccination to be required in the summer, at the latest in the autumn,” he said.
In addition, Weigeldt hopes that the fourth coronavirus vaccination could be carried out "in combination with the flu vaccine."
This will help to achieve the best results.
In addition, enhanced vaccination can help in the fight against the spread of the new strain of the coronavirus "Omicron".
And the new option is particularly dangerous.
Thus, the probability of re-infection with Omicron is three times higher than that of Delta or Beta strains.
This is evidenced by the results of a preliminary study conducted in South Africa.
Based on this, BioNTech/Pfizer manufacturers plan to provide a vaccine adapted for Omikron by March 2022.
The companies emphasize that two doses of the vaccine do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the new variant of the coronavirus "Omicron".
A study by BioNTech and Pfizer showed that with two doses of the vaccine, the effectiveness is significantly lower: “the neutralizing potential is reduced by more than 25 times.”
“This indicates that two doses of BNT162b2 do not provide sufficient protection against omicron strain infection,” BioNTech and Pfizer said.
Therefore, a third dose is needed.
Experts are insisting on accelerating the pace of vaccination in the country.
For example, the chairman of the German Society of Infectious Diseases, Bernd Salzberger, is in favour of shortening the interval between the second and third vaccinations.
What’s more, according to Salzberger, accelerated vaccination will affect the spread of both the delta virus and the omicron variant of the coronavirus.
“Israel’s experience shows this very convincingly,” the expert said.
Wobbler Pontoon21, Bet-A Vib, 54 Silent, 54 mm, 8.5 g.
The Bet-A-Vib series is a special branch of the Bet-A family of Pontoon21<0xC2><0xAE>.
It (as well as the Kalikana Vib series) differs from many other vibes in that it was originally created for use for underwater fishing, not just for fishing in return.
These vibes have more than close to the dimensions of analogues, a special weight, which undoubtedly positively affects the nuances of the application of these interesting attractions.
Another recognizable feature is the top float made of durable and elastic plastic, creating additional vibration shades with vertical and horizontal wiring.
As a "winter whistle" when catching in the cage, Bet-A-Vib demonstrates a rather aggressive game.
Often the most catchy is a simple monotonous animation, that is, the movement of the slider up and down almost without pauses.
When planning the deviation from the vertical axis is not very large, which is convenient when catching in a limited space, flooded by underwater vegetation, corals and other obstacles, for which it is possible to catch.
In addition, a small deviation is relevant in winter catches of snails and large snails, and especially in the middle of winter, when a pointy and aggressive supply of snails is required.
Upon reaching the end point of the trajectory, the Bet-A-Vib immediately unfolds and returns to the original vertical.
At the same time, Bet-A-Vib is also used for the winter fishing of forelles.
To satisfy its whims, you can choose from two modifications: with a noise capsule (NS – NanoSound) or without it (SL – Silent).
It is also noted that the Bet-A-Vib game in the hanger is able to irritate a passive stick, not reacting even to the livery.
Bet-A-Vib demonstrates range and accuracy when catching in vain.
This wobbler is understandable and not capricious, it is well combined with wood and braided cords even of large diameters.
To catch ham, squirrel, squirrel or bait in addition to uniformly relevant and "step", sometimes with a "kirkana" at the bottom.
If you catch in confined places, you can change the front triangle to a double, which will reduce the likelihood of catching.
Among the drawbacks of its Bet-A-Vib class are among the most stable at work and, as a result, one of the most caught.
With the same success, it can be used both in relatively small and rather deep areas.
All models are equipped with Owner ST-36 hooks.

In Libya declared about 7,000 Russian mercenaries
There are more than 7,000 mercenaries of the private military company Wagner in Libya.
This was stated on Sunday, December 12, by the Chairman of the Supreme State Council of the Republic Khaled al-Misri.
“There are currently more than 7,000 Wagner mercenaries in Libya.
They also have planes.
They also dig trenches in Sirte and Kufre.
They have 30 jet planes at the Gardabiya airbase (also used as a civilian airport in Sirte),” Anadolu said.
Khaled al-Mishri also pointed out that Russian mercenaries are “trying to capture” the central part of Libya stretching from Chad to the Mediterranean Sea after “bringing their man to power” in the Central African Republic.
Preserving Presence
According to an interviewer, Moscow was looking for a country to maintain its presence in North Africa and “displaced in Libya.”
Wagner has been in Libya since 2019, using the airbase and port in Sirte, as well as the airbase in Jufra, the agency said in a statement.
The Russian authorities have officially denied that Wagner’s CWC has the Kremlin’s support.
Where else there might be mercenaries
According to the agency, Wagner is believed to be operating in nine African countries - CAR, Libya, Sudan, Mozambique, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar, Zimbabwe and Angola.
The company provides military training of local forces, personal protection of leaders and the protection of energy facilities.
In exchange for these services, Wagner’s subsidiaries receive certain privileges and licenses for the use of useful minerals and natural resources, as well as for the supply of weapons, technology and military services to these countries.
According to the media, the “wagoners” allegedly fought in the Donbass, Syria, Mozambique, Sudan and CAR.
This group is not listed in the force departments, nor in the register of jurists, and its fighters are absent in the formal lists of personnel.
This company is under U.S. sanctions.
Earlier, the 27 EU countries approved restrictions against Wagner.
The decision is expected to be approved by the Council of the European Union on 13 December.
The situation in Libya
The Supreme State Council of Libya de facto is the second chamber of parliament with advisory functions with Islamists dominating it, writes TASS.
This body has repeatedly called for the postponement of a single day of voting on the elections of MPs and heads of state from 24 December to at least February 2022.
"There are less than two weeks left until the election, and the chances that they will be held in due course are rapidly diminishing," the statement said.
Against this background, the Libyan High Electoral Commission has postponed the announcement of the final list of candidates for an indefinite period, according to Sky News Arabia.
Foreign policy in the eyes of the Russians
38% of Russians see more success than failure in the country’s foreign policy, 29% believe that failure prevails.
"Examples of successes - "in Syria defended, restored peace there", "the North Stream 2 decision", "the whole world feared that cool weapons", "Crimea we regretted".
The main failures - "conflict with Ukraine", "confrontation with Western countries", "isolation from the world", - says in the study of the Foundation "Public Opinion".
The Government of Dubai has completely renounced paper-making - all public services have also become only digital
The Government of Dubai has announced a complete abandonment of paperwork and the transition to digital technologies.
All public services to the population will also be provided exclusively in electronic form.
This is reported by the emirate news agency WAM.
"Today marks the beginning of a new phase of digitization of all aspects of Dubai's life - we have completed the transition to a completely paperless government," said the Crown Prince of the emirate, Chairman of the Executive Council of Mahmoud Abbas, Sheikh Hamdan bin Muhammed.
Now, the internal and external document circulation in all state offices of Dubai will be carried out only in digital form through special information platforms.
Innovation has affected all sectors without exception: health care, hospitals, police, municipal authorities, courts, etc. Many commercial structures have also joined the initiative of the government.
The transition to e-government and digitalization of document traffic has begun in Dubai since 2018.
During this time, the authorities estimated that 336 million sheets of paper were saved, which is 14 million hours of human labor and $353.8 million in cash equivalent.
Earlier, the mayor of Moscow Sergei Sobyanin said that electronic services save citizens 2 days a year.

Production and exports of Turkish cars fell below the level of 2020
Production and exports of Turkish cars fell sharply in November amid the devaluation of the lira.
As a result, the industry’s performance over the 11 months was worse than last year, Bloomberg reports, citing data from the Association of Turkish Automobile Manufacturers.
According to the association, in November, 115,000 cars were released from factories in Turkey, which is 20% less than a year earlier.
Approximately 75,9 thousand cars were shipped for export, which is more than 25% lower than last year.
And if by the results of the first 10 months of this year the automotive sector of Turkey showed a positive dynamic to last year, by the results of 11 months of 2021, the production of cars was already 0.3% worse than last year.
The reason for this fall was a sharp weakening of the Turkish lira, which in November fell by 29% against the dollar.
This has led to a decline in economic activity in all industries.
More than 500 SME entities have been deferred on loan payments in 2021
First Deputy Prime Minister Alikhan Smayilov spoke about the situation of granting benefits for small and medium-sized businesses, reports MIA correspondent "Kasinform".
"According to the information of the Agency of the Republic of Kazakhstan on the regulation and development of the financial market, this year in fulfillment of the order of the Head of State from April 1, 2021, the order of the President of the Agency of April 9, 2021 has been accepted by the Office of the President of the Agency of the Republic of Kazakhstan and the Office of the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan.
He recalled that the procedure for the granting of deferral of payments on loans provided for the granting of deferrals of payments on loans issued to SME entities until 1 April 2021, including 1 April 2021, to banks and organizations carrying out microfinance activities.
The delay period ranged from 30 to 90 days at the discretion of the SME entity.
The borrower’s statement could have specified a different period of delay of payments.
During the period of delay in relation to the borrower, the claim-seeking work was suspended, the notification of the need to repay the late debt, as well as the creditor's collection of commissions and other payments," - said the Deputy Prime Minister.
For 2021, second-level banks received applications for deferral of payments on loans of 603 borrowers-SME entities, of which 553 SME entities received deferral of the amount of 9.7 billion tenge.
In the IFO, 131 SMEs submitted applications for deferral, of which the deferral was granted to 95 entities in the amount of 105.8 million tenge", - concluded A. Smayilov.
Pulmonologist Puryasev suggested that people with weak immunity are able to easily tolerate the strain "Ommiron"
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immunity can tolerate it more easily than those who have a strong protective response of the body.
Pulmonologist Sergei Puryasev explained why the strain of the coronavirus "ommiron" can be dangerous.
The reason is worth looking for in the conditions of the emergence of the virus.
Scientists believe that "ommiron" was born in the body of an HIV-infected or immunodeficient.
That is, during the mutation, he did not encounter any resistance to immunity.
Because of this, he is more aggressive.
Because there was no response from the immune system, it became very fast.
Apparently, there he has these spike proteins, spikes, maybe more than expected, their antibodies were not cut during mutations, - comments pulmonologist Sergey Puryasev.
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immunity can tolerate "ommirone" more easily than those who have a strong protective response of the body.
Turns out, a strong response of the body to anything, to any infection, is not always good.
In such cases, the body can kill itself.
This is the case with pneumococcal infections, when 30-year-olds die, and 60-year-olds in the form of chicka tolerate it.
The immune response is angry with the young man, he is completely inadequate: where it could only be threatened with a finger, he beats as if from a gun to a robber, - concluded Sergey Puryasev.
The doctor also reminded that the coronavirus has dangerous side effects and the most unpleasant of them is pneumonia.
Inflammation of the lungs is bacterial and viral.
If the first is treated very successfully and quickly, in the second case, you can often stop only the symptoms - all hope for the body.
The first sign of developing pneumonia will be the onset of intoxication of the body - it is fever, weakness, malaise.
Then there are respiratory symptoms: difficulty breathing, sore throat, coughing.
Pain on the right or left, abdominal pain can also indicate a developing problem.
Meanwhile, in Russia, by the end of the year, a growing generation from 12 to 18 years of age can begin to be vaccinated.
Virologist, head of the MFTI Genomic Engineering Laboratory Pavel Volkchkov noted that this category suffers very actively from covid.
For teenagers who go to school, the number of contacts is as high as possible.
This is the most socially active layer, as well as kindergarten pupils, - said "Moscow 24" Pavel Volkchkov, a virologist, the head of the laboratory of genomic engineering of the MFTI.

Immunologists have hypothesized why people with obesity are becoming victims of covid
The authors of the study studied the remaining fat tissue from bariatric operations, and found that fat cells known as adipocytes can become infected with the coronavirus.
Immune cells located in the fatty tissue, macrophages, were also infected, showing a strong inflammatory response.
The researchers also examined the fatty tissue of patients who died of covid, and found particles of the coronavirus in fat surrounding various organs.
It is known that HIV and influenza viruses can hide in fat tissue, using it as a reservoir, in an attempt to avoid the immune system’s response.
It is also known as SARS-CoV-2.
Biologist has told about the causes of dementia
Candidate of biological sciences Semen Golosheykin named the causes of dementia and told about ways to prevent it in an interview with radio Sputnik.
According to the WHO, more than 55 million people are affected by this disease.
The syndrome manifests a gradual loss of cognitive functions - over time, a person is difficult to navigate even in a familiar environment.
Golosheykin noted that dementia is most often caused by neurodegenerative disorders, head injuries, some infections, metabolic disorders, and a lack of certain vitamins.
Some factors increase the risk of developing the disease.
These include hypertension, diabetes, elevated cholesterol, obesity, depression, and alcoholism.
At the behavioral level, the role of such factors as social isolation and the lack of active cognitive activity is possible," he said.
The development of dementia is also affected by harmful habits - smoking, alcohol abuse, sleep disorders and a low-mobility lifestyle.
Among the first signs, the expert noted forgetfulness, inability to concentrate and a decrease in the level of abstract thinking.
"There is debate that hearing loss can be both an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease and one of the risk factors for its occurrence," the biologist added.
To prevent the onset of the disease, WHO recommends maintaining the necessary level of physical exertion, training the cognitive skills and abilities that require the involvement of memory and logic.

Egypt has returned some 30,000 illegally exported artifacts
Over the past 10 years, the Cairo government has managed to return to its homeland some 30,000 artifacts that were illegally smuggled out of the country.
This was reported on Saturday, December 11, on the Al-Hayat TV channel, the chief inspector of the Department of Returned Antiquities of the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities of Egypt Shaaban Abdel Gaud.
Since 2011, the Egyptian state has managed to return 29,300 artifacts.
“Only this year, 5,300 monuments of ancient Egyptian civilization have been discovered at the Museum of the Bible in Washington,” he said.
Abdel Gaud clarified that all the artifacts exported by smuggling were registered in the archives.
The staff of the department are now working on their return to Egypt.
In particular, specialists “track auctions around the world and online sales” through foreign and Egyptian websites, as well as social networks.
The Chief Inspector said that once the cultural values are returned, they are restored and then exhibited in museums.
According to him, one of the returned artifacts was an ancient human skeleton discovered in Belgium, which is now part of the exhibition of the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization in Cairo.
In 2020, the Egyptian authorities asked Interpol to help find the bust of Pharaoh Tutankhamun sold at auction in London.
Christie's auction house held auctions on July 4, at which the bust over 3,000 years old was sold for $5.97 million (about 680 million rubles).
This caused dissatisfaction on the part of Egypt.
The Egyptian side also claims that the art was illegally removed in the 1970s from the Karnak Temple in Luxor.
The head of Tutankhamun, depicted in the image of the sun god Amon, has been stored in a private collection and has not been on sale since 1985.
How the relics came to Europe is unknown.
In recent years, Egypt has been actively seeking the repatriation of illegally removed monuments of antiquity.
According to the authorities, 95% of smuggled antiquities are the result of archaeological searches of "black excavators".
"Crimean Tatars are not taken into account" - and this is correct, since the Crimean Tatars (232,000) are an independent people (near the Turks).
If you want to add, only 42,000 people - so many Tatars (Kazan) live in Crimea (see census).
The Crimean Tatars are a separate people, and the name of this people consists of two words!
They are united only by the Turkic language group.
FT: Credit Suisse Wants Access to Employees’ Personal Mobile Devices
Credit Suisse requires its employees to give the bank access to their personal mobile devices, writes the Financial Times.
The fact is that in Europe and the United States, the Swiss bank does not issue its employees corporate communications devices, instead offering a discount on the purchase of a mobile phone or smartphone from a partner - the telecommunications operator.
Under current rules, the bank may view information on corporate devices issued to its employees, as they are used to address business issues with colleagues or customers.
The bank has the right to check mobile devices in extreme cases - for example, if an employee used it to hold a meeting with a client who was not approved by Credit Suisse.
Now that many employees have switched to remote mode, the bank wants to extend this rule to all the devices that have been used to solve work issues.
According to the newspaper, the management of the bank has set an deadline by which employees can familiarize themselves with the new rule.
Officially, the Credit Suisse does not comment on the new requirement.

Part 4
The last year of Sergei Esenin's life - 1925 - was fruitful in terms of creativity, but heavier for the earthly being of the poet and his "ego".
He is already out of any literary associations, intertwined with imaginism, he is himself, but known, in demand, at times strongly criticized by critics, even maliciously, but the reading public is ready to carry it on his hands.
In a year there were more than 60 poems written, many of them - real masterpieces, completed cycle "Persian motifs", written poem "Anna Snegin", published 8 books, collection "Russian Soviet".
And the main success - at the end of June 25 of the year Gosizdat concluded a contract with Esenin for the publication of his compositions in 3 volumes.
None of the modern poets Sergey Aleksandrovich was so honored, he was the first!
In addition, it generated very good money - the fee was 1000 rubles per month for 20 months (the plant director, for example, received 300 rubles per month, the engineer - 200).
The money was needed that year as never before.
Esenin married the granddaughter of Leo Tolstoy Sofie Tolstoy, it was necessary to arrange a family life, contain the sisters Katya and Sasha, as well as the mother.
Life seems to have set, there is something to be enjoyed, but for him everything is painted mostly in dark tones, as if a nightmare materialized from the poem "Black Man" (written in November 1925 and published after the death of Esenin):
My friend, my friend,
I'm very, very sick.
I don’t know where this pain came from.
Is the wind blowing?
On the empty and uninhabited field,
Like I said in September,
The brain sleeps with alcohol.
Many acquaintances noted that Esenin gave up heavily, bad looks, clearly sick.
More and more repetitive walks, nervous breakdowns.
And the reason, probably, is not only in alcoholism...
However, if such a diagnosis - alcoholism - Sergey Aleksandrovich has been made, there are no reliable documents left.
For example, relating to May 1923, when Esenin insisted on his fourth wife, the American Isedora Duncan improved his health in a clinic near Paris by Professor Peter Hannushkin (Esenin will come to him again two years later, already in Moscow).
But the evidence of the poet's poaching, scandals on this ground, reasons for the militia is enough - scattered on dozens of memoirs.
Since the early 20s, the poet's terrible novel with the green snake has developed rapidly.
At the end of the summer of 1923, Esenin briefly settled with a friend, imaginary Ivan Startsev.
Surprisingly, with his very good income, Esenin never had a home in Moscow or in Peter, he found himself in detached apartments, in hotels or with acquaintances.
The old man recalls:
“I only came at night, and in most cases in an inexperienced, drunken state.
One day, returning at four in the morning, Esenin fell on a staircase...
Falling down, he scratched his face and grinned.
Having come a little in himself, he began to cough continuously, smearing the whole sheet with blood..."
Yes, and Esenin himself after the war in Europe and the United States (there was a dry law in the United States at the time, but Duncan accepted a decent supply of alcohol) admitted:
"I didn't see anything there except the Cabaks and the streets.
I'm at the end and I've stopped remembering people.
Well, and drinking, of course...
And I drank because the thirst was gone.”

Mattress Promtex-Orient Duet Latex Econom 100x195
Promtex-Orient Duet Latex Economy is a modern implementation of the budget model in the premium-class line.
The basis of the mattress is a block of independent double springs Duet.
The inside of the large spring is inserted a softer spring of small size.
This allows the load to be evenly distributed on the mattress.
On both sides, the mattress is complemented by a filler - artificial latex.
It is an analogue of natural latex, but it is denser and less expensive.
The flexibility and elasticity of this material enhances the comfortable effect of the mattress.
Artificial latex is hypoallergenic, it does not absorb moisture and dust.
The mattress will fit perfectly for a couple with a large difference in weight (from 30 kilograms).
Due to the "smart" springs, there is no wave effect here when the light partner rolls on the side of the heavy one.
A pleasant, soft to the touch case made of a practical Sense jacquard with a layer of synthesizer.
The natural fabric does not accumulate static electricity, however.
It is possible to manufacture this model of mattress in a twisted version (vacuum roll-packing).

He’s much more responsible than I was in his years or my husband, who had a problem with the law periodically before the wedding.
The father takes care of his young daughter.
And he loves, as Lermontov wrote, "a strange love."
Why did the girl cry on the exam when she hadn't failed him yet?
Why didn't he tell his daughter it wasn't a school?
Well, she'll have a tail.
Well, what?

Poland’s Foreign Ministry says Belarus is using migrants as “weapon” against the EU
Poland's Foreign Ministry Says Belarus Uses Migrants as 'Weapon'
Poland’s Deputy Foreign Minister Pavel Yablo<0xC5><0x84>ski said that Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko used refugees as a “weapon” against the European Union and intends to return to such an “operation” next year.
The statement was made by the Deputy Foreign Minister in an interview with the Australian Financial Review newspaper.
According to Yablonsky, the sanctions against Belarus "temporarily stopped Lukashenko", but he is "actively looking for new ways".
Also, the Polish official is confident that illegal migrants will now be used as weapons "in many parts of the world".
According to the website kp.ru, the European Union has previously implemented a fifth package of sanctions against Belarus.
It has touched 17 individuals and 11 organizations.
In Europe, they said they were ready to further expand restrictive measures against the republic, "if the situation in the country does not improve."
In response, Minsk imposed a food embargo on a broad list of goods from countries that had previously decided to impose sanctions on Belarus.

"Not for the Blue Hat": When a fluffy jacket makes a man laugh
The world events of 2021 were dominated by velvet jackets.
Perhaps the first person to declare his new fashion solution was Daniel Craig.
Back in September at the premiere of the film "No Time to Die" he appeared in a velvet raspberry jacket and a traditional "bond" butterfly.
His example was followed twice by Prince William, who first wore a green velvet jacket that did not fit the royal dress code for the eco-premium award ceremony, and then chose a more classic version of Royalty for the event in support of the charity.
A few weeks ago, the trend set itself and Lionel Messi.
The footballer came to pick up the seventh "Golden Ball" in the velvet jacket Dolce & Gabbana.
By the way, his sons were dressed in the same.
AliExpress already notices a growing demand for velvet men’s jackets in Russia.
According to analysts of the service, which came to Gazeta.Ru, they began to buy 1.4 times more often.
The most popular warm fluffy jackets with lining and silhouette, the main colors - dark-gray, bordeaux, dark-blue and, of course, black.
The average price of such models - from 3 to 6 thousand rubles. At the same time, men prefer to buy exclusively jackets - sets of velvet suits they choose less.
You can buy them not only from online retailers.
Budget options are available in H&M, Mango, Next and Zara.
In the luxury segment, this season's velvet jackets are featured in almost all brands - both Brioni, Paul Smith, and Etro, and Saint Laurent.
The most desirable is the model Gucci, in which came out on one of the premieres of the film "Dom Gucci" brand ambassador Jared Leto.
Choosing expensive brand jackets, you can be sure that the velvet is made of silk.
Thanks to the special technology of interwoven threads, a dense fabric with a viscous outer texture and a smooth inner side is obtained.
More budget options are made of cotton or polyamide, but and, accordingly, serve less.
Fashion expert Lamoda Ilya Vakhoshkin warns that in the case of a fluffy jacket the main thing is not its model or fashion, but its relevance.
"The barhate requires evening light, so such a jacket is ideal if you're going to a party or a festive event," explains Vakhoshkin. - It is also suitable for those occasions where the dress code "Black Tie" or "Creative Ti" is indicated in the invitation.
Another important criterion, the compliance of which allows to make a choice in favor of a fluffy jacket, is the status of its buyer.
"The man in a velvet jacket, first of all, should acquire the right advanced tusk with plenty, - the authors of the Telegram-channel about the men's fashion "Beautiful Brammell". - The owners of velvet jackets are coats that usually belong to the caste of those people.
They are simply invited to scheduled secular events, where the dress code is always indicated.
Ilya Vakhoshkin offers to combine a jacket made of bark with the same outfits: classic pants with arrows, monotonous shirts, silk ties, loffers with bristles, cuffs.
Too simple and everyday things will look unsuitable.
Fashion experts from "Beautiful Brahmell" are convinced: it will be inappropriate to appear in the velvety jacket of a regular employee at the corporation, but if we are talking about "the leader among those who refuel this event, then "yes", he is in such a thing.
If the employee ranks lower, and its goal is the desire to advance higher in the complex hierarchy of the company or to knock out financial bonuses, then it is better not to wear a fluffy jacket.
The guide will certainly evaluate this with the phrase "not on a blue hat", - consider the editors of the Telegram-channel about men's fashion.
Very ambiguous feelings from the voice.
It's an unnatural timbrel, it's so exhausting.
And it is absolutely not associated with the cute face of a young girl.
To be honest, I don't understand the admiration of others.

It’s all about money – alternative energy is well-lobbed, that is, paid off.
billions of investments.
Are they sad?
No, the price of electricity has risen.
Traditional energy is also not in the overlay - both gas, oil, and coal were bought cheaper than they are now selling.
There is a wild demand for fuel.
The bitch's dripping.
Who's on the fly then?
As usual, a regular buyer.

Therefore, Western politicians should not be considered idiots who have “sleeped” the energy crisis.
They did their job.
For a good deal of shit.
I didn't see any beautiful people in the photos in the article.
It's just mediocrity within the average passengers.
Perhaps, if such characters are so confident in their beauty that they decide to show it to the whole car, then they will not be able to do so, most likely.
But only because of the mental disorder and ignorance of such "beautiful (-its)", but certainly not because of their appearance.

Immunologist said that revaccination in 4-5 months will help protect against the strain of the coronavirus "omicron"
Revaccination in four to five months can protect against a new strain of coronavirus infection "omicron".
Such a statement was made by immunologist Nikolai Kryuchkov, who called the vaccination after six months, given the appearance of a new strain, "a very large period"
"For the former strains, this period was normal, but now it is best to carry out the procedure after five months, and for people with chronic diseases - after four," the expert said, calling for a parallel vaccination campaign to engage in re-vaccination.
Kryuchkov also noted that early revaccination provides a good titre of neutralizing antibodies.
"If a person was given two vaccinations and a booster, or he got sick and was vaccinated, or was vaccinated and got sick, then he got "hybrid immunity", that is, many antibodies and neutralizing enough," - said the expert.
The “Big Seven” warned Russia of the “scaled consequences” in the event of an invasion of Ukraine
The "Big Seven" countries (UK, Germany, Italy, Canada, USA, France and Japan) published a statement following the results of the meeting of foreign ministers in Liverpool.
It emphasizes that Russia’s “military aggression” against Ukraine “will have huge consequences and will cost Moscow a lot of money, but the concrete measures are not described in the document.
"We, the Foreign Ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States of America and the High Representative of the European Union, are united in our condemnation of Russia's growing military power and aggressive rhetoric.
The ministers also called on Russia to “de-escalate the escalation, use diplomatic channels and comply with its international obligations regarding the transparency of military activities,” which US President Biden spoke about during a video call to Russian President Putin on December 7.
“We reaffirm our support for France and Germany’s efforts in the Normandy format to achieve full implementation of the Minsk agreements with the aim of resolving the conflict in eastern Ukraine,” the Foreign Ministers of the Grand Seven said.
Any use of force to change borders is strictly prohibited by international law.
“Russia should not doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine will have huge consequences and a serious price in response,” they said in a statement.
We reaffirm our unwavering commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, as well as the right of any sovereign state to determine its future.
We welcome the restrained position of Ukraine.
We will intensify our cooperation on our overall and comprehensive response,” the statement said.
Earlier in the day, the head of British diplomacy Elizabeth Trass said that Russia would be subjected to "serious consequences" in the event of an invasion of Ukraine.
According to her, the meeting showed “a single voice of the G7 countries, which account for 50% of the world’s GDP, and which made it very clear that the invasion of Ukraine will have huge consequences for Russia.”
The Pfizer vaccine was found to be 32 times less effective than the omicron strain
The effectiveness of the vaccine from Pfizer-BioNTech against the omicron strain of the coronavirus is 32 times lower compared to other types of the disease.
Scientists from the University of Hong Kong and the Chinese University of Hong Kong came to this conclusion, according to the South China Morning Post (SCMP).
The vaccine was considered less effective based on a study of antiviral activity in citizens who received two doses of the drug from COVID-19.
“We see that most people had a high level of antiviral activity against the original variant of Sars-CoV-2, but this ability was significantly reduced against the omicron variety,” said Professor Malik Pairis.
At the same time, the scientists emphasized that the vaccination remains the most reliable way to protect against the severe course of the disease in case of infection with the coronavirus.
Previously, scientists at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted the development of the coronavirus pandemic, taking into account the influence of the omicron strain on it.
The authors of the study concluded that the omicron strain could cause a new wave of viral circulation and an increase in mortality if no additional measures are taken.
The head of the defense ministry of Ukraine accused the German authorities of blocking the supply of NATO weapons to Kiev
The head of the defense ministry of Ukraine Alexei Reznikov accused the government of the former German Chancellor Angela Merkel of blocking Kiev's acquisition of deadly weapons within NATO.
In an interview with the Financial Times on December 12, Reznikov recalled that last month Germany vetoed the purchase by Ukraine of anti-sniper systems and rifles for the defeat of drones.
At the same time, it is noted that later Berlin softened its position regarding the rifles, recognizing them as non-lethal weapons.
According to the Minister of Defense, Kiev intends to seek the acquisition of the above-mentioned weapons within the framework of bilateral agreements with allies.
In particular, we are talking about the United States, the United Kingdom, Lithuania and France.
Meanwhile, the FT notes that the position of the new German government under the leadership of Chancellor Olaf Scholts on permitting arms deliveries to Ukraine remains unclear.
Earlier on Sunday, Ukraine's ambassador to Germany Andrei Melnik expressed the opinion that Kiev should not expect from Berlin supplies of weapons under Chancellor Schulz.
According to him, the previous leadership of Germany explained its refusal to provide weapons at risk of the development of military escalation of the conflict in the Donbass, despite the “occupation by Russia” part of Ukrainian territory.
The same “illogical” position, a confident diplomat, Germany will maintain with a new chancellor.
In August, Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky said that Kiev expects help from Berlin in equipping the navy.
In Ukraine, it is expected that Germany “will be a partner of Ukraine in the technical sense,” the president added.
It was also noted that in the spring of this year, co-chairman of the party of the "greens" of Germany Robert Habek visited the republic, where he advocated the sale of defensive weapons to Kiev.

On the screen there is a table which country produces what percentage of these semiconductors (apparently microcontroller chips).
Russia was not on this list.

G7 warns Russia of responsibility for invasion of Ukraine
Foreign ministers of the G7 countries have warned of "serious consequences" for Russia if it continues military aggression against Ukraine, the final statement of the parties.
Participants of the meeting also noted that they condemn the intensification of Russian armed forces still at the borders of the country.
“Russia should have no doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine will have serious consequences and serious costs,” the statement, published on the UK government’s website, said in a statement.
The G7 ministers and the EU’s top representative noted that “they are united in their condemnation of Russia’s armed reinforcement and aggressive rhetoric towards Ukraine.”
Britain’s Foreign Minister Elizabeth Trass warned at a press conference in Liverpool of “great consequences” for Russia in the event of an invasion of Ukraine.
We have made it clear that any invasion will have significant consequences.
The G7 wants Russia to give up aggression against Ukraine,” she said, quoting TASS.
Earlier at the summit in Liverpool, the G7 foreign ministers agreed that in order to resolve the crisis due to the build-up of Russian troops on the border with Ukraine, the parties must return to the negotiating table.
We were talking about negotiations in the Normandy format.
The North Atlantic Alliance also spoke for the dialogue on Ukraine in the Normandy format.
Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said that, calling on Russia and Ukraine to return to the negotiating table, the G7 countries "were incapacitated to take responsibility for their own mistakes".

Ways to Retire Stolen Through Online Shops
There are several ways to get back the money stolen through online stores, and not to become a victim of fraud in the future.
They were revealed by information security experts in a conversation with the RBC.
Thus, to reduce the risk of major losses when entering the data of the bank card into the hands of the attackers, it is recommended to store the main funds on the card or bank account, which are not used during online shopping.
Some of the savings can be deferred to the savings account and withdrawn as needed.
Experts also recommend setting up a separate card for online purchases.
If the money was stolen when shopping in stores that do not use 3D Secure protection technology, you can start the money back procedure.
“Within the framework of the rules established by payment systems, for unauthorized transactions carried out without the use of 3D Secure, responsibility rests with that participant in the chain of calculations who does not use this service,” the representative of Promsvyazbank said.
Expert from international payment provider Ecommpay Arthur Zaremba stressed that the buyer has the right to file an application with the bank to contest the fraudulent transaction no later than 120 days after the purchase.
In addition, if the offender has used the card on online resources that do not require two-factor authorization, the transaction can be protested and refunded.
It is noted that in some cases, the online stores themselves return the funds to the customer, if the order has not yet been shipped.
On November 19, a member of the Public Chamber, the director of the League of Safe Internet Ekaterina Mizulina reported that only in 2021, 11,000 applications were received for various cases of fraud: from the sale of fake documents to the theft of personal data.
According to her, an effective solution under the current circumstances could be the creation of a single window for complaints against online fraudsters.
Schulz arrives in Poland to discuss "Northern Stream 2" and EU legislation
The newly elected Chancellor of Germany Olaf Scholz arrived in Warsaw for talks on the crisis with migrants on the border with Belarus, the independence of the judiciary in Poland, the increase of Russian troops on the border with Ukraine and the situation with Russia.
Although Scholz stated his desire to maintain good relations between Germany and Poland for many years, the leaders of the two countries expressed unequivocal expectations of each other.
Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said he would call on Sholts to speak out against the "Northern Stream 2", which is supposed to deliver Russian gas to Germany to bypass Ukraine.
According to Morawiecki, Russia can use the gas pipeline against Europe as a means of political pressure.
Germany, in turn, supported Poland’s efforts to stop the flow of migrants trying to enter the country from Belarus.
Berlin has said it will help Warsaw and Brussels in resolving the crisis.
Poland’s judicial system, however, remains one of the reasons for the disagreement.
The European Court of Justice has fined Poland by finding that judicial reforms carried out by the right-wing law and justice party violate EU law.
Poland has refused to pay the fine, and its Supreme Court has ruled that national legislation has priority over EU rules.
The new German government, sworn in on Wednesday, despite the demands of Poland and the United States, has not made public commitments to stop the work of North Stream 2 in the event of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
U.S. officials told members of Congress that they had reached an understanding with Germany that the pipeline would be halted if Russia invaded Ukraine, a senior U.S. congressional official said on Tuesday.
German officials did not confirm these messages, but Scholtz warned on Wednesday of the consequences if Russia violates the border with Ukraine, and the position was confirmed on Sunday by the representatives of the "Global Seven".
Dmitry, take a closer look.
The view outside the window is the same, the size of the window has not changed.
The wall between the kitchen and the room was removed, so the second window is partially visible.
And in general, there are those who are not familiar with the initial planning.
And I know such apartments very well and I can see perfectly how it was replanned.
Let them be all right.
It's always surprising when they write about the means to wash the sink, the toilet, the sinks, the faucets.
You wash them once a year at Easter, you wash what needs to be washed straight away.
Just don't let it get dirty.

The money found in the wall of the church plumbing will pay 20 thousand dollars
The technician, who found the money in the wall of a church in the U.S. state of Texas, will be paid the prize.
This is reported in a press release of the non-profit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston.
The incident took place at the large evangelical church of Lakewood, where Pastor Joel Austin preaches, promising that pious Christians will have wealth and prosperity.
In November 2021, plumber Justin Cowley repaired one of the church toilets and discovered under thermal insulation thousands of packages with money and checks.
He handed over the find to the church and, according to him, received not even a thank you from Austin.
“I wanted to hear him say, ‘You know, Justin, you did the right thing.
We understand what you have done and what you could have done,” KPRC-TV quoted him as saying.
The discovery is believed to be linked to a theft that occurred at Lakewood Church seven years ago.
About $200,000 in cash and $400,000 in checks were lost, which were stored in a church safe.
The money was insured, so the church did not bear any losses.
However, for the information about the criminals announced a reward of $25,000.
Justin Cowley could not claim this amount, as the term of the award has already expired.
Despite this, the non-profit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston, which at one time allocated $5,000 for the award and later received another $20,000 as a gift from the Church of Lakewood, decided to reward the honesty of the plumber.
He'll get $20,000.
Earlier it was reported that the police questioned Pastor Joel Austin about the money found in the wall of Lakewood Church.
Tanya, her expressions, her actions are her characteristic of "as a real person."
That is why the attitude towards her is so negative.
And it’s not that “she’s financially much richer than letters,” as they say here.
There are people who are richer, but not everyone behaves as suddenly, as provocatively as this lady.

A 68-year-old resident of Huizhou City District in the southern province of Guangdong, who kept a poultry in his household, was infected.
His condition is assessed by doctors as critical.

In Brazil, citizens are required to present a vaccination passport when entering the country
In Brazil, a passport code was required to be issued by the judge of the Federal Supreme Court of Brazil (STF) Luis Roberto Barroso.
This is reported by CNN Brasil.
Citizens who have contraindications to the vaccination are exempt from the presentation of the certificate of vaccination.
Also included in the list of exceptions are persons who have arrived from countries where the absence of the vaccine has been proven.
“The situation is even more serious, given that Brazil is a popular tourist destination for New Year’s, pre-carnival and carnival parties, as well as other events, which implies an increase in tourist flow,” Barroso said.
Previously, the Brazilian authorities forced unvaccinated tourists to observe a five-day quarantine.
Full protection scheme for COVID-19 has been revealed
The virologist, doctor of medical sciences, the distinguished scientist of Russia Anatoly Altstein in a conversation with Ura.ru revealed the scheme of full protection against coronavirus infection.
According to him, this can be achieved by injecting and using the oral vaccine.
With international use, a large amount of immunoglobulin A is formed. When injecting the vaccine by injection, this does not occur.
Immunoglobulins A protect the mucous membrane, so the virus cannot penetrate the body.
And inside, after vaccination, we have the most G immunoglobulins (antibodies).
And if you inject both vaccines, you'll get a lot of immunoglobulins A and G. But there's still no solution for double vaccination," he said.
The chief prophylacticologist of UrFO, doctor of medical sciences Sergey Tokarev, in turn, said that the main advantage of the use of oral vaccination in conjunction with the injectable is the ability to stop being a carrier of COVID-19.
He added that it would help that in this case, the protection of the body, presumably, should be the maximum.
Earlier, the Minister of Health of the Nizhny Novgorod region, David Melik-Guseynov, said that a new outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic will lead to the spread of a new coronavirus infection among children.
According to him, it is this picture that is seen in other countries, where the next wave of the pandemic came earlier.
Inna, um...
I talked to the cob (died a long time ago) like this - if you're ready to change the warm home, the feed, the grace, the love and the game to a liquid bitch, then go ahead.
But the song was well-trained and smart at all.
He chose my company and went home.
Video is a way that works in 90% of cases.
Not from the ceiling, believe me.
I restrained many owners from running after the dog, although they admitted that there were 200,000 running away (snakes), took a straight hand and led it the other way.
In the end, "200,000" chose the owner, not a dog that ran somewhere there.
In Europe, mass protests against vaccinations are not stopped
More than 40 thousand protesters took to the streets in the Austrian capital of Vienna.
They expressed dissatisfaction with the restrictive measures and plans of the authorities to make vaccination against measles mandatory.
From February next year, unvaccinated people will have to pay a fine of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3,600.
The Spanish, outraged by the health policy of the authorities, held a peace march in Madrid.
Some of them were holding posters with the words “This is a fake pandemic,” “I won’t get vaccinated.”
A major protest against sanitary passports took place in Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia.
In the autonomous community, a code-certificate is mandatory for access to bars, restaurants, gyms, nursing homes and night entertainment establishments.
The decision on the introduction of sanitary passports has been made by the authorities of a number of regions of the country against the background of an increase in the number of cases of coronavirus infection.
In Luxembourg, more than 1,000 protesters protested against the tightening of restrictive measures and QR codes.
The action began peacefully, but then turned into clashes with the guards of order.
A group of demonstrators threw stones at the police.
In response, law enforcement officials used water meters.

The WHO has discovered the "omicron" already in six dozen countries
The World Health Organization (WHO) said the new strain of the coronavirus “omicron” has already been detected in 63 countries.
A number of experts have already said that the spread of the new strain can have catastrophic consequences.
The rate of proliferation of the strain was reported in the WHO message.
As of December 9, the strain has already been identified in 63 countries, in all six WHO regions.
This is because it has only been actively spreading since the end of November.
The WHO also expresses concern about the high rate of spread of the new variant of the coronavirus.
WHO experts express concern that the new strain, according to preliminary data, could bypass the extent of the spread of the "delta" strains, it is the Indian variant of the coronavirus, which now leads in absolutely all countries without exception.
The Director-General of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhan Ghebreyesus, said that the omicron strain can have a significant impact on the course of the coronavirus pandemic.
Similar conclusions have been drawn in the United Kingdom as well.
Experts at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) believe that “omicron” will push out “delta” in the coming months.
And the number of patients in the UK alone will be about 1 million. This is while the official "omicron" at the moment in the Kingdom is sick several hundred people, and according to estimates up to 10 thousand.
British experts predict tens of thousands of deaths from the "omicron" strain, and at its peak in hospitals will take more than 2,000 people daily.
What the UK health care system will not be able to do.
The situation is complicated by the fact that according to the latest studies, the effectiveness of the vaccine from Pfizer-BioNTech against the strain "omicron" is 32 times lower compared to other types of the disease.
How the Russian satellite V will react to the "omikron" is not yet known - it will become clear in the next few weeks.
The Gamalei Center has just begun testing the Russian vaccine on the strain "Omicron".

Russians warned of new scheme of fraudsters
The attackers began to look for new maneuvers for fraud in video messaging.
This is reported by Izvestia with reference to experts.
According to the director of products of the company Ivideon Zaura Abutalimova, the main danger that is associated with the distribution of video communication media, are diphthongs.
In this case, the scammers create a fake video based on real records involving the victim.
Thanks to this, the neuroses are able to accurately reproduce the characteristics of the behavior of one person or another.
Abutalimov added that using a dipstick, the attackers could call a familiar victim via video or create a video with a copy of a person for the purpose of blackmail.
“Such forgeries can easily provoke bullying, as a rigged attacker can put people in silly, dangerous, or compromising pseudo-scenarios,” the expert said.
Varonis system engineer Alexander Vetkol, in turn, noted that psychologically, people trust others more when they see them.
He stressed that this could create specific risks in the case when it comes to video-using technologies.

Here are five steps to help prevent diabetes mellitus.
Problems with blood sugar levels are some of the most common in the world.
However, some do not attach much importance to this, and it is bad.
Diabetes mellitus can eventually lead to serious complications and even death.
Preventive measures play a major role in preventing the formation of diseases.
Thus, doctors recommend changing the drinking regimen - reducing the number of various drinks and switching to ordinary water positively affect the metabolism.
Sweet foods raise blood sugar levels to a dangerous level when consumed in excess of the amount of sugars.
Therefore, the first step on the way to a healthy lifestyle is to stop buying sweets and store them at home.
The appearance of the disease is affected not only by improper nutrition, but also habits.
To reduce the risk of diabetes, you need to move a lot.
Experts advise you to adhere to a low-carb diet.
Such a diet will not only help to reduce weight, but also protect against sharp fluctuations in sugar levels.
To protect against diabetes, you need to eat a lot of fiber.
The dietary fiber fills the stomach and thus contributes to the appearance of a feeling of satiety, secretion of digestive juices and increased absorption of food.

Dr. Pavlova told about "weekend day migraines" in laborers
Deterioration of well-being on weekends can lead to several factors
The reason for the deterioration of well-being after working weekdays is often "weekday migraine", said a well-known doctor-endocrinologist, a candidate of medical sciences, a senior researcher at the Faculty of Fundamental Medicine of the MSU, a telegram scholar at the Zhu system medicine clinic.
According to her, it is particularly common for workers who experience headaches, fragility and weakness on weekends.
Dr. Pavlova noted that in addition to accumulated fatigue in a week, there are quite a lot of objective reasons for the negative reaction of the body to change conditions.
On the weekends, our lives are radically changing.
"We sleep for a long time, we lie on the couch all day, we most likely eat more, and drink less," the doctor argued. "Because of the lack of coffee, a small rupture begins.
Due to overeating and lack of water - weight and breakdown.”
An additional role is played by the late rise.
So, if you get up three hours later than usual, there will be a reaction called a jetlag.
It occurs in travelers who cross several time zones.
In order to determine which of the factors plays a crucial role in deteriorating well-being, Pavlova recommended tracking what changes most strongly over the weekend.

South African scientists have declared low efficacy of the Pfizer vaccine against "omicron"
In South Africa declared low efficacy of Pfizer vaccine against "omicron"
Scientists in the South African Republic conducted a study and reported the low efficacy of the Pfizer vaccine against the omicron strain of coronavirus infection.
According to estimates, it (the level of neutralization of "omicron") corresponds to (the level) of effectiveness of the vaccine at 22.5% against infection with symptoms, which is why the ability of the vaccine to protect against infection is questioned.
At the same time, experts clarified that the drug can save from a severe course of the disease.
Earlier at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, it was predicted that the omicron strain of the coronavirus could cause a new wave of pandemic in the UK with more frequent hospitalizations than a year ago.
How much sugar is hidden in the usual foods?
Sugar is not the best source of nutrients.
Its excess in diet can lead to type 2 diabetes, as well as cause cardiovascular and oncological diseases.
Consumers should take into account that under an unknown word in the composition of the product can be indicated hidden sugar - an ingredient similar to sugar in calorie, composition and glycemic index.
On the label can be presented several dozen names, in fact, that denote sugar.
One of the most common and common names is glucose and fructose.
There may also be other hidden sugars such as dextrose (sugar derived from corn), levulose (fruit sugar), melasse (black stream), agave syrup, etc.
These are all simple carbohydrates that belong to mono- and disaccharides, and they can be not only in confectionery, but also in ketchup, in a doctor's sausage, bread, etc.
As stated in Roskachev, the most effective way to reduce the consumption of sugar is to consume whole and unprocessed products, as well as pay attention to the label and many different names of sugar.
Different types of sugar differ in taste, but whatever the ingredient in the product is called - syrup or nectar, processed or unprocessed, brown or white - it still remains sugar.
Calculating the exact amount of sugar is not easy, as it is necessary to take into account not only the amount of sugar specified by the manufacturer on the packaging, but also the fact that vegetables, fruits, etc. initially contain a certain amount of sugar.
Thus, the total amount of sugar may be significantly higher than indicated on the label.
German Chancellor Schulz: Gas will lose importance to Germany in 25 years
German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said that gas imports are losing importance to Germany as the country continues to transition to decarbonization of the economy.
According to him, by 2045, Germany plans to completely abandon gas, oil and coal, becoming a climate-neutral country.
“That is, in 25 years, the world will be such that the issue of transporting gas to Germany and Europe will play a different role,” he said.
Scholts noted that Germany continues to maintain its commitment to Ukraine’s transport of Russian natural gas in the future, as this resource is important for the energy transition at the moment.
He recalled that Germany and the U.S. made a statement that recorded support from Berlin for the energy transformation of Ukraine.
Earlier, the head of Germany’s foreign ministry, Annana Berbach, said that the process of certification of the gas pipeline “Northern Stream – 2” is ongoing.
According to the minister, in the framework of coalition negotiations and discussion of the coalition agreement, it was stated that energy projects should be covered by European law in the field of energy.
The diplomat also pointed out that the pipeline is “not yet compliant” with EU regulations.

Hackers hacked Twitter of Prime Minister of India
Hackers hacked the Twitter account of Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India.
The attackers were able to publish a fake message.
It was reported that India allegedly recognized bitcoin as a legal tender, and that the country had already purchased the cryptocurrency.
Modi's office was asked to ignore new messages.
Representatives of the prime minister said that Twitter reacted quickly - access to the account was restored.
India’s premiere page was already hacked in 2020 and called for donations to the fund using cryptocurrencies.
In a referendum in New Caledonia, a majority voted against independence.
In New Caledonia, the third referendum, held on December 12, ended with the same result as the previous two.
According to the first partial results announced on Sunday, December 12, at noon, the majority of New Caledonian residents voted during a referendum against the independence of their territory.
At the same time, the level of participation in this third vote has been significantly lower than in the previous two.
According to preliminary results published by local authorities, New Caledonia's independence from France was 3.51% (2,755 people) of the vote, while 96.49% (75,762) voted "against".
The turnout was 43.90%, in total more than 80,000 New Caledonian residents took part in the elections.
According to the agency France-Presse, "the outcome of these elections left no room for doubt" as supporters of independence called on voters not to participate in the vote.
As the initiators of the referendum, they opposed holding it on December 12, believing that the new outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic in the archipelago is preventing a full and "honest" campaign.
Thus, this non-participation paved the way for the third victory of supporters of French New Caledonia, after the referendums held in November 2018 and October 2020.
In 2018, 56.7% of the population voted against independence, in 2020 - 53.3%.
The separatists said they do not recognize the results of the last vote and will challenge them at the UN.
As reported on Sunday, December 12, at the Elysée Palace, French President Emmanuel Macron is to speak out on the outcome of this referendum.
The theme of New Caledonia’s independence has largely revived the last weeks of the presidential campaign in France.
Several presidential candidates expressed their support for France’s remaining territory, as it is “the last region of the European Union’s presence in the Pacific.”
"New Caledonia must necessarily remain French," said Eric Zemmour, who is a French national.
The same statement was made by Republican candidate Valerie Pecress, who published a column in Le Figaro in late October, urging the Caledonians to remain French.
For his part, Emmanuel Macron announced in May 2018 that he would not take a position "because it is not his responsibility."
However, the president added: “France would be less beautiful without New Caledonia.”
Prime Minister Jean Castex, for his part, expressed "a strong desire that the election of the Caledonians be the choice of France".

The device is able to remotely neutralize explosive objects by means of a laser.
The maximum flight altitude of the novelty reaches 3,000 m.
After passing the relevant tests, the UAV must be armed with the Turkish military, which will use it to destroy the explosive devices without the involvement of the sappers.
The agency emphasizes that Turkey is among the six countries in the world capable of developing and producing its own drones.

WSJ Readers Criticized Article on Russia-U.S. Relations
Readers of The Wall Street Journal criticized Professor Christopher Hartwell’s article in which he described his vision of the relationship between Russia and the United States.
The author of the material expressed concern that the West is allegedly sacrificing Ukraine to Russia.
In his article, he convinces readers of the danger that comes from Moscow, and has allowed a number of insulting remarks to Russian President Vladimir Putin.
In the end, Hartwell called on Western countries “to stand on a united front against Russia.”
WSJ readers expressed their disapproval of the American professor’s position.
"There is quite a lot of false information in this article," RIA Novosti quoted a comment from one of the readers.
“Europe is not ours to “lose” it, and Ukraine is not our land.
“The United States and NATO allies will never enter a nuclear war with Russia for the sake of Ukraine,” he said.

The magnitude 5.2 earthquake occurred in the area of the Kuril Islands
The 5.2-magnitude earthquake occurred near Shikotan, a city on the island of Shikotan.
It is noted that the epicenter of the earthquake was 231.8 km north-east of the city of Severo-Kurilsk.
Ochag landed at a depth of 92.5 km.
Previously, seismologists recorded an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 in Peru, in which ten people were injured.

Ukraine to start production of new generation of reactive drones
At the new Ukrainian-Turkish plant will begin to create ANKA-type reactive unmanned aircraft (UAVs).
This was announced on December 11 by the freelance adviser of the head of the office of the Ukrainian President Alexei Arestovich.
That is, they are able to act against aerial objects, against other drones.
Even against the piloted aeroplane.
They will have Ukrainian engines and the rest of Turkish avionics: the corps and the like," he said.
Commenting on the main features of the ANKA apparatus, Arestovich said that they are reactive, not piston UAVs.
According to him, this is a new generation of drones after Bayraktar, which exceed it "in all its characteristics".
The first batch of UAVs should be produced by the plant at the end of next year, said Arestovich.
The ANKA aircraft was created by the Turkish Aerospace Agency in February 2014.
The development of the drone has been carried out by the Turkish authorities in cooperation with a number of private companies since 2010.
On the eve of the Ukrainian headquarters secreted data on the use of Bayraktar drones and Javelin missile complexes during the military operations of the united forces in the Donbas.
On December 6, the President of Ukraine Vladimir Zelensky reported that the construction of a factory for the manufacture of modern military drones began in the country.
According to him, Ukraine intends to use drones.
On September 29, Bayraktar Savunma company and the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense concluded an agreement on the construction of the center in the Kiev region, in which personnel training will be conducted, as well as testing and service of the Turkish Bayraktar UAVs.
The press service of the Ukrainian leader’s office called this memorandum “a big real step forward.”
Two lions escaped from the container at the airport.
In Singapore’s Changi airport, the lions fled.
This is reported by The Straits Times.
Two predators managed to get out of the container with seven lions arriving on one of the planes.
The publication notes that it remains unknown from which country they were brought to Singapore and where they were headed.
One of the running lions lay on the roof of the container.
The animals could not get from him because of the setup of a protective net.
The confrontation ended after the arrival at the airport of employees of the Mandai Wildlife Group, which knows all of Singapore’s zoos.
They demobilized the lions with a sedative wire and plan to bring them to the quarantine facility.
Earlier it was reported that in Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia, the lion fled from the master and strolled through the streets of the city.
On the same day the animal voluntarily returned home, people were not injured.
Experts warn of the threat of cancer due to vitamin B9
Research shows that excess vitamin B9, also known as folic acid, can lead to cancer.
This was reported by the Daily Express.
According to experts, there is strong evidence that people who do not experience a lack of folic acid are less at risk of developing some types of cancer, in particular colorectal cancer.
However, overdose on the other hand contributes to the growth of cancer cells.
Professor at the University of Alabama in Birmingham, dietitian Beth Kitchin advises to monitor the amount of folic acid consumed during the day.
The optimal dose is 400 micrograms per day.
The risk of cancer increases only if you significantly deviate from this figure in a larger or smaller direction.
Kitchin recommends not to take vitamin B9 in tablets without a doctor's recommendation, be sure to monitor the dosage and avoid flakes with milk and other foods that contain folic acid.
Previously, nutrition consultant Rachel Fein called folic acid a substance that slows down aging.
Because, among other things, it is contained in avocados, Fein recommended men after 50 years more often eat this fruit.
In the UK by April, about 75,000 people could die from the omicron strain.
Forecasts by British scientists show that the spread of the omicron strain of the coronavirus in the next five months in England could kill up to 75,000 people if the restrictive measures are not tightened in winter.
This was reported by The Guardian, citing a study by experts from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), reports TASS.
According to the most optimistic forecast of specialists, who are part of the scientific and advisory group on emergencies at the British Cabinet of Ministers, by April 2022, the country will record at least 25,000 fatal outcomes due to the strain of omikron.
At the peak of disease rates, hospitals will receive more than 2,000 infected daily.
“Serious measures to combat the coronavirus may be required to prevent overload by the National Health Service if the omicron strain is more contagious than the delta variant, and the current vaccines will not be able to rule out infection,” said LSH.
Earlier, the UK Health Safety Agency informed that if the rate of spread of the omicron strain remains at the current level, by the end of the year, around 1 million cases of infection will be detected in the country.
At the same time, by mid-December, the omicron strain could become dominant in the United Kingdom.
There are currently 1,898 cases of omicron strain coronavirus infection in the UK, of which 633 have been detected in recent days.
On December 9, the head of the British Ministry of Health, Sajid Javid, indicated that in reality this figure can already reach 10,000 cases.

The number of superyachts in the world grew by a quarter
The construction of superyachts this year and orders for next year beat all records in the world, despite calls to reduce the carbon footprint and fight climate change.
In the world register of vessels, the number of ordered yachts amounted to 1,200 units - a quarter more than last year.
In an era of combating the effects of climate change on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, it is hard to imagine that the number of people who have the desire and money for a floating fortress for $50 million and above will not decrease, writes the Guardian.
However, they are becoming more and more.
This year, 25% more ships were ordered than in the previous year.
Brokers say there has been no such agitation in the market for 20 years.
The first reason is that many who can afford a yacht, are afraid of contagion on land and prefer to escape the pandemic on board their own ship.
The second reason is also related to the coronavirus.
If in the past all these people went to the office and met with business partners in person, now the absolute majority of them work remotely, and the negotiations are carried out on purpose.
Broker Will Christie told the newspaper that shipyards accept orders for new yachts for 2025 and later.
This means that customers are willing to pay more if only their yacht was ready at least a year or two earlier.
“People just want freedom, and the super-rich could afford it,” he says.
In Western society, many criticise such behavior of the rich and call it decadent.
The rich, say sociologists, do not want to understand that in times of deprivation of space travel, life on yachts or flights on their own planes causes irritation in society, because the elite does not want to share responsibility for climate change with the rest of humanity.
Economists are urging governments to take action and suggest introducing new taxes and rules for the super-rich, although they understand that with such mobility of money, it will be extremely difficult to implement.
In the meantime, only the number of ordered super-yachts, but also their characteristics are impressive.
Of the 1,200 vessels, 27 have a feed length of more than 100 meters.
The Norwegian billionaire Rekke is building a 183-metre-long REV Ocean yacht.
After landing on the water, it will be the largest yacht in the world.
The yacht has a "moon pool", as well as a submarine, designed to explore the depths of the sea.
On the existing super-yachts, Rbo<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k is a trove of ordinary steel platforms for helicopters, cinemas under the open sky, and on some of them, such as on the yacht of the fighter McGregor - a platform for single-fighting.
But it is symbolic, given that there are just over 2,000 billionaires in the world.
This is just another example of overconsumption by a very small group of people.
Scientists have found that the emission footprint of billionaires is thousands of times larger than the average inhabitant of the planet.
If one person produces an average of 5 tons of CO2 per year, the planet’s largest polluter, Roman Abramovich, is responsible for 33.9 tons of greenhouse gases that entered the atmosphere in 2018.
At the same time, two-thirds of the emission footprint was found on his 162.5-metre-long Eclipse yacht.
Even if the owner of the yacht is not on board, the team continues to poison the planet.
The owner can call the captain and give the command to catch a yacht, for example, from the Mediterranean to the Caribbean.
The owners of the superyacht do not provoke other people’s sympathies when they, as Australia’s richest woman, Gina Reinhardt, who owns the mines on the continent, complain through YouTube that there is no room for a dock for their giant ships.
It is also difficult to understand her call to build marinas for ships of 50 meters.
A dangerous weekly dose of alcohol has been determined, leading to the development of intestinal cancer
American scientists have determined what amount of alcoholic beverages per week increases the risk of developing cancer.
This is reported by the Daily Express.
Experts have concluded that the consumption of four or more servings of alcoholic beverages per week is associated with an increased risk of developing oncology.
At the same time, the likelihood of developing the disease increases with an increase in the amount of alcohol consumed.
What’s more, moderately drinking men have a higher risk of developing bowel cancer than women.
The exact cause of the development of this type of oncology can not be determined by scientists, noting only that certain factors lead to a harmful process for the body.

Dogs can understand words and phrases at the level of a two-year-old child
Many, or rather all, dog lovers are convinced that these creatures are very intelligent.
But they don’t even know how developed four-legged pets are.
For many years, biologists have conducted various experiments to be sure to learn how the intelligence of animals is developed.
Although a dog’s vocabulary is not as extensive as a human one, a new study shows that a dog can respond consistently to 89 words or phrases.
The work of scientists was published in the journal Sciencealert.
Dogs can’t play chess or write poems, they don’t make sense in politics, economy, and art, and they often manage to fool their owners.
Representatives of some breeds, experts believe, show the best results in the comprehension of human language words, but statistical data for accurate conclusions is not enough.
Thus, some breeds are traditionally considered dog geniuses - for example, labradors.
Scientists have concluded that dogs are capable of logical thinking, and in terms of their ability to teach, they are not inferior to a two-year-old child.

Ukraine prepares for U.S. and Russia trade
The United States and Russia will “negotiate” about Ukraine’s entry into NATO, analyst Alexander Kochetkov said in his article for Glavred.
In his view, Washington and Moscow are planning to continue negotiations on U.S. guarantees that Ukraine will not join the North Atlantic alliance in the near future, despite U.S. leader Joe Biden’s words about the right of countries to “go anywhere”.
If you are offered something knowingly unacceptable, well, for example, to sell a close relative into sexual slavery, you are not going to negotiate, but just send the offerer.
And with regard to Ukraine, a trade is planned," the analyst wrote.
Kochetkov added that Russia does not plan to attack Ukraine, but is seeking a dialogue with Kiev.
"The training is conducted in secret, quickly and immediately proceed to offensive actions, and do not wait for the group to be discovered and deployed by the forces of the opposition," he said.
China Stimulates the Development of the Rail Transport Industry
Advanced Chinese technologies have attracted the attention of companies from the US, Germany, France and other countries at the China International Rail Transport and Equipment Exhibition 2021, which took place in Zhuzhou, Hunan Province/Central China.
The core technologies developed by CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co. Ltd. allow trains to automatically detect and diagnose technical malfunctions, the company’s representative said.
The high-speed trains running on the China-Laos rail line, which was put into operation earlier this month, are already equipped with these technologies, which will ensure the increased reliability and performance of the movable composition.
In the past six months, China has significantly increased exports of rail vehicles and many countries in Asia and Europe are witnessing “China’s speed.”
In May of this year, the company’s production line of CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co., Ltd went down the first developed in China two-story electric speed trains intended for export to Europe.
With a maximum working speed of 200 km/h, these trains will run on the railways of Austria, Germany, Hungary and other European countries.
In November, the trial operation of the subway train, developed by the aforementioned company for Turkey, began.
The train will be operated by the metro line connecting the center of Istanbul with the city airport.
The subway line will be opened next year.
It will be the fastest metro line in Turkey with a speed of 120 kilometers per hour.
“China’s railroad equipment manufacturing industry is one of the industries with the highest level of innovation and the strongest international innovation competitiveness,” said Feng Yaosian, Head of Trade and Investment Department of China’s Committee on International Development.
“This industry is the main competitive advantage of China’s production of high-end equipment on the world market,” said Feng Yaosian.
After more than 60 years of strenuous work, carrying out a number of independent research and development, China has created an advanced system of production of rail transport equipment, with a full set of auxiliary equipment and with large-scale production activities.
According to Feng Yaosian, the country ranks first in terms of electrification of railways and in terms of operation on high-speed and urban railways.
Biologist lists early signs of dementia
Candidate of biological sciences Semen Golosheykin in a conversation with radio Sputnik listed early signs of dementia.
According to him, signs of future dementia can be forgetfulness, as well as a number of moderate cognitive disorders, such as an inability to concentrate, planning, and lowering the level of abstract thinking.
There is currently a discussion that hearing loss can be both an early manifestation of Alzheimer’s disease and one of the risk factors for its occurrence, the specialist said.
Golosheykin stressed that the causes of dementia can be neurodegenerative disorders, head injuries, some infections, metabolic disorders, a lack of certain vitamins.
He added that Alzheimer’s disease and atherosclerosis of the brain vessels are the most common causes of this syndrome.
The biologist noted that to date, doctors do not know effective ways to treat dementia.
Therefore, it is necessary to start its prevention in time.
According to him, reducing the risk of developing dementia will help learning foreign languages and active communication.
The WHO also recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical exertion, regularly training cognitive skills through games and hobbies that require intensive involvement of memory and logic of thinking.
"There are recommendations for the use of different BADs, but their effectiveness and suitability are still being discussed in the scientific community," Golosheykin said.
"The World Health Organization recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical exertion, regular training of cognitive skills and abilities through games and hobbies that require intensive involvement of memory and logic of thinking," Golosheykin said.
Previously, the UK’s dementia research charity said the disease is more and more common in people aged 40.
Doctors called the early symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease.
The first alarming sign can be considered vision problems, due to which the patient acquires difficulties in the recognition of objects.
Another sign of developing dementia is called aphasia – a condition where a person cannot find the right words to convey what he or she wants to say.
Neurologist demanded to send Saakashvili for treatment abroad
Former Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili needs psychoneural treatment and rehabilitation abroad, neurologist Otar Toidze, who is a member of the medical council created under the Georgian Ombudsman, told reporters.
His [Saakashvili] neurological status is leading in his illness.
Stable problems are problems with movement, coordination, variability of character," the expert said, noting that this does not go beyond the normative framework and now the ex-president needs to be sent to special rehabilitation.
"This is what we call neurorehabilitation and psychonerve rehabilitation, which we have not found in Georgia," Toidze said, demanding that Saakashvili be treated in a special institution that does not exist in Georgia.
On the evening of 7 December, Saakashvili began sabotaging medical care after the prison service staff subjected him to disciplinary punishment.
Georgian politicians were able to quickly abolish the punishment and restore themselves to the former rights.

Protests against COVID-passports in Spain
In the Spanish cities of Barcelona and Valencia, protests against the mandatory COVID-19 vaccination certificate were held, reports the agency Europa Press.
In the Catalan capital, the number of participants of the action amounted to about 3,000 people.
In Barcelona, COVID passports became mandatory for hiking in bars, restaurants, gyms, nursing homes and nightly entertainment establishments.
Many protesters came to the action without masks.
With slogans on their posters, they accused the state of totalitarianism and called for respect for the choice of citizens.
In Valencia, vaccination passports will also be required to enter entertainment establishments and restaurants with a capacity of more than 50 people.
Protesters in this city declared a medical dictatorship, and the vaccination was called an experiment.
In Spain, more than 5.2 million cases of coronavirus infection have been detected since the start of the pandemic, more than 88,000 patients have died.
Russia also plans to impose restrictions on unvaccinated people.
Draft laws on a single QR code system were introduced by the government in the State Duma on November 12.
It is assumed that the Russians will be able to visit the places of mass events, cultural institutions, objects of public nutrition and retail trade with the presentation of either a certificate of vaccination or a transmitted disease, or a hospital from vaccination.
The same rules will be laid down for travel on trains and planes.

The Great Ascent: How the Chinese Become Skiers
The Olympics should attract millions of people to the slopes and help create international-level resorts in the country
In China, it is hoped that the Olympics will not only attract 300 million citizens to winter sports, which will collect the 1 trillion yuan designated by President Xi Jinping, but also contribute to the economic development of the remote provinces.
The Taiwanese ski resort in Zhangjiakou, located near the venue of the Winter Olympics, is becoming increasingly popular with the Chinese.
In addition to the construction of infrastructure in the region, work on greening is also carried out: workers plant trees.
There are more than 700 ski resorts in the country, but only 20 of them are large enough to take on international competitions.
In many regions of China, where resorts are located, including Zhangjiakou, there are problems with snow.
The main task in the long term is to ensure a comfortable and interesting holiday in Chinese resorts, so that all beginners become enthusiasts.
However, it is still a long way off.
Justin Downs, an advisor to Games, says that since his last visit in 2007, the Chinese skiing industry has changed to unrecognizability.
Every year, more and more Chinese are sent to the slopes.
Fiona, a snowboarder from Beijing, one of them.
Despite the major changes, it will take many more years to create a skiing culture here, Downs believes.
Many of the resorts are located in agricultural and mining areas.
These regions are still to be actively developed and the infrastructure needed to relax there.
70-year-old Gao Makong lives in Chunli, not far from the venues of the Winter Olympics.
He notes that in recent years there has been a boom in winter sports tourism.
Two years ago, a high-speed railway from Beijing to Chunli was used, and now none of the locals suffer without work.
In the country, more and more shops are opening, selling clothes and equipment for winter sports.
On the slopes open common areas with dishes of national cuisine.
In Taiwan, there is even a COVID-19 testing station.
China strives to create a thriving winter sports industry, its athletes must become leaders in the largest international competitions, and resorts and equipment must reach the world-class.
More than 500 million people in the world may face extreme poverty due to the pandemic, the WHO said.
More than 500 million people in the world could be plunged into extreme poverty due to the coronavirus pandemic, which has slowed humanity’s progress in universal access to health services, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank (WB) said.
On the occasion of the International Day of Universal Coverage of Health Services on 12 December, the WHO and the World Health Organization have published two complementary reports.
In them, they found that the pandemic led to malfunctions in the provision of medical services, caused excessive strain in the health care systems.
In this regard, for the first time in 10 years, immunization coverage decreased, mortality from tuberculosis and malaria increased.
The World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Health Organization (WHO) said that the pandemic caused “the worst economic crisis since the 1930s, so it became harder for people to pay for treatment.”
This situation puts more than 500 million people “in extreme poverty because they have to pay for these services out of their pocket.”
In October, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said that the coronavirus pandemic has put more than 100 million people into poverty, more than four billion people have virtually no social support.

Reuters: Taiwan's Minister Disabled from Broadcasting on "Democracy Summit" at White House's Request
Taiwan’s digital technology minister Audrey Tan’s speech at a panel discussion during the U.S.-organized “Democracy Summit” was translated into video-free mode, according to a YouTube video.
Reuters, citing sources, said the image was turned off at the request of the White House.
According to them, the reason was a map on which Taiwan was distinguished by a separate color from China, which considered the island its territory.
The map, shown by Ms. Tan, was drawn up by the South African non-governmental organization CIVICUS and ranked the countries of the world in terms of civil rights.
Taiwan was designated as green on it as "free", and China, the DPRK, Laos and Vietnam as "closed".
After the minister showed the map, the picture was replaced with a screenshot noting that the views of the participants of the discussion "do not necessarily express the position of the U.S. government."
China was not invited to the “Democracy Summit”.
According to Reuters, the map shown by the Taiwanese minister could be inconsistent with the “one China” policy that Washington is adhering to.
One of the agency’s sources said that after demonstrating the map, the U.S. National Security Council had furiously contacted the State Department, accusing it of showing Taiwan as a separate country.
The Summit for Democracy, organized by Washington, took place from 9 to 10 December with the participation of representatives of 110 countries and territories, as well as civil associations and charities.
Russia was not invited to the summit.
During the “zero day” summit, Nobel Peace Prize laureate and editor-in-chief of the “New Newspaper” Dmitry Muratov called for the creation of an international fund through which money obtained through corruption would be donated to charity.
Earlier today, Deputy Secretary of the Council of the Russian Federation Yuri Averyanov said that the summit carried "anti-Russian and anti-Chinese charge".

The foreign ministry told about the "special conclusion" in the relations between Russia and the United States
Deputy Foreign Minister of Russia Sergei Ryabkov in an interview with Izvestiam evaluated the prospects of relations between Moscow and Washington.
He noted that the long path of interaction led to sad conclusions, and the problems between the two countries did not begin yesterday.
There is a one-sided negative predictability, but in some part of the prospect of improving relations everything is completely unpredictable.
This is a sad conclusion from the long road that we have come a long way with the current administration, with both Trump and Obama.
The problems didn’t start yesterday,” the diplomat said.
According to Ryabkov, the problems are related to the desire of the United States to impose on Russia approaches on many issues.
The deputy foreign minister added that he would not risk giving optimistic forecasts on the prospects of improving relations and would not expect a change in Washington’s position.
He explained that, with the exception of areas such as strategic stability and cybersecurity, there was no progress.
At the same time, Russia calls on the United States to take a responsible approach to international security issues and hopes that the signals will be heard, and the Americans will listen to the arguments of common sense.
Earlier, the head of the Russian Foreign Ministry Sergei Lavrov at a meeting with the US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken said that Moscow is ready to restore dialogue with the United States.
Virologist warns of the danger of vaccination with nasal drug from COVID outside hospitals
Those who have been vaccinated with the nasal vaccine from COVID-19 may have allergies and need the help of doctors, so the first points for vaccination with this drug should not be organized in airports and shopping malls.
This was reported by virologist Sergey Netesov, correspondent member of the RAN, the department of bionanotechnology, microbiology and virology of the Novosibirsk State University.
It’s easier to organize nasal vaccination points at airports and shopping malls, but I’d do it in the first place only in medical facilities.
The fact is that the likelihood of an allergic reaction to such a vaccine exists, it is small, but it is desirable that the person then sit next to the doctor's office.
Doctors have special sets of anti-allergic drugs that work literally in a minute or two, which is sometimes very necessary," Netesov said.
According to the virologist, it will be possible to think about vaccination in shopping malls when experience in the use of the drug will be accumulated.
He also stressed that when using a nasal vaccine it is important that it hits the mucous membrane in the nasal cavity.
At the same time, there is a possibility that the vaccine will not reach the destination if the vaccinated nose is swollen after injection.

This is reported by Sky News.
In particular, 1,196 new cases of the omicron strain were recorded in England, 38 people were diagnosed with a new type of infection in Scotland and five in Northern Ireland.
The total number of COVID-19 cases from the new strain in the UK has reached 3,137 people.

Peskov warned about the suffering of the Western countries, which are imposing anti-Russian sanctions
The press secretary of the President of the Russian Federation Dmitry Peskov commented on the possible imposition of anti-Russian sanctions in the event of the continuation of "aggressive actions" against Ukraine, including because of the alleged "invasion" of the territory of the country.
“Some restrictions to impose against Russia and not to experience suffering itself are impossible,” the official representative of the Kremlin said on the TV channel “Russia 1”.
Sandsov claims that it is “everything in the world understands.”
Earlier it was reported that the United States considers the possibility of imposing anti-Russian sanctions in the field of energy as an extreme measure.
In addition, Washington and the European Union plan to introduce restrictions that will be aimed at complicating the conversion of rubles into dollars in relation to Russian banks and the Russian Direct Investment Fund.
The head of Sberbank, Herman Gref, is convinced that this is not possible.

The people of New Caledonia rejected the idea of independence from France
According to the final results of the third referendum on the independence of New Caledonia, the vast majority of participants refused to leave France.
This was reported on December 12 by the French television channel BFM.TV.
96.5% of the voters voted against independence.
They supported independence from France by 3.51% of the population of the archipelago in the south of the Pacific Ocean.
The results of 2.99% of the bulletins were cancelled.
The voter turnout on that day was very low: about 55% of the inhabitants of the archipelago came to the areas.
According to experts, the low turnout is due to calls by separatists to refuse to participate in the referendum due to the coronavirus.
Paris has refused to postpone the date of the referendum.
In October 2020, the people of New Caledonia voted against independence from France in a referendum.
In 2018, a referendum on independence was held in the region.
Most of the inhabitants supported the finding of the archipelago in France.
New Caledonia is almost 20,000 kilometers from the mainland of France.
In 1853, France declared New Caledonia its possession.
There are about 270,000 people living in the archipelago, the territory has a special administrative and territorial status.
There is an agreement between Paris and the New Caledonian administration in 1998 that allows the region to hold a two-time vote on its independence, with a difference of two years.

WHO Preliminary Considers ‘Omicron’ Less Dangerous Than ‘Delta’
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the omicron is less dangerous than the delta strain of the coronavirus.
However, there are data on the reduction of the effectiveness of vaccines in the disease with a new variant of COVID-19.
According to information on December 9, "Omicron" is registered in 63 countries.
"Preliminary data and a significantly altered antigen profile of the omicron strain protein suggest a decrease in the effectiveness of the vaccine against infection and variant transmission.
Preliminary findings from South Africa suggest that it ("the severity of the disease" - ed.) may be less severe than with "delta", - said in the WHO technical report.
The organization notes that so far all recorded cases of "omicron" infection in the EU are occurring easily or asymptomatic.
However, the new strain, according to preliminary data, spreads faster "delta".
Two cases of omicron strain infection have been reported in Russia.
They were “previously immunized,” the Gamalei Center reported.
Rospotrebnadzor head Anna Popova said that there is no reliable data yet that the new variant of the coronavirus is less dangerous than the rest.

In Ukraine named four scenarios for Zelensky
The former deputy of the Verkhovna Rada Vadim Denisenko listed four options for development of events for the President of Ukraine Vladimir Zelensky in 2022.
In his opinion, the head of state may remain without the support of the West, and may also go to compromises on the Donbas.
On Sunday, December 12, Denisenko told about this in a publication on the portal "Glavred".
The first option, which Denysenko called an "ideal storm", suggests that Ukraine will cease to support key Western countries, reaching an agreement on the future of the country without its participation.
Such a development of events will contribute to a deep crisis that Kiev may face in 2023.
"In parallel, there is a drop in the prices of key goods that we traditionally export . . . domestic protests and the opposition of the government with the key FPG (financial-industrial groups. - Red.) ", - added the ex-parliamentary.
According to Denisenko, there is another scenario of the development of the situation - "war against all".
This forecast will take place in the event of high turbulence in world politics, in which the Ukrainian authorities will face a number of problems.
Due to such a situation, the leadership of Ukraine can go to compromises on the Donbass, as a result of which there may be a confrontation within the country.
At the end of the summer, Zelensky's position will weaken, the probability of such a situation, according to the former nardep, is up to 50-55%.
The third variant of the development of the situation in Ukrainian politics is the confrontation of dissenting groups of the Green population and the president, which is likely to take control of the power bloc and implement “populist initiatives”.
In the course of such a variant of the crisis, Zelensky will begin "reformatting the power," Denisenko added.
Another scenario is the transformation of Zelensky into the "father of the nation".
This can lead to an event that will be a strong shock to society.
“The event should be large enough to trigger a reaction from external partners and lead to an increase in Ukraine’s support,” Denisenko said.
Such an option of developing the situation is possible as a result of a natural disaster, a technological disaster or aggressive actions of Russia, the ex-deputy said.
At the same time, the Russian side has repeatedly rejected any possibility of an “attack” on Ukraine.
In Moscow, it was noted that it is the Ukrainian authorities, NATO and the United States that are increasing military activity at the Russian borders.
Earlier, on November 11, data from a survey of the sociological group "Rating" showed that the rating of the Ukrainian president fell to record lows, amounting to 19.3%.
This is the lowest figure since his election as head of state.
Analysts predicted a situation in which in the case of the forthcoming elections of the President of Ukraine for Zelensky would give their vote only 21.8%, while for the former president of the country Petro Poroshenko - 14.5%.
Of all the respondents, only 19.3% expressed support for the president.

Arrested for the action in Red Square poet: "For the quotation Yevtushenko 10 days give, here she, the power of poetry!"
At the beginning of the week, 21-year-old poet Alexander Volkenkov was arrested for ten days.
A student of the WSE was detained in Red Square with a poster on which was written the hashtag <0x23>poetvrossiibolshechepoet.
This quote belongs to the writer Yevgeny Yevtushenko.
A protocol on the administrative article on repeated violation of the procedure of holding a public action was drawn up on Alexander.
For the first time, he was arrested on 23 January in Pushkin Square, at a rally in support of Alexei Navalny.
"The goal was to draw attention to poetry in general, now interest in it, unfortunately, lost, to the decline of the common culture in Russia and also little hope to inspire unknown poets to write their poems online under this hashtag," - explains A.
We contacted the young poet to find out the circumstances of the detention and to reveal in more detail the message of his message.
How did you respond to the arrests of police officers this time and before?
What was asked in the department, how did they comment on your action?
This time the staff were more correct, the detention was as polite as possible, no matter how funny it sounded in some context of the word.

And at public and official events, they speak the language of others, so that everyone can understand what happened in the Bundestag on 25 September 2001, or in their native language through an interpreter.
This is a protocol and nothing more, by the way, Angela Merkel speaks Russian perfectly and still resorts to the help of an interpreter.

Researchers Tell How Potatoes Help in Fighting Age Disorders
The study showed that potatoes are rich in vitamins and trace elements that contribute to improving blood circulation and lowering cholesterol levels.
The root fruit contains vitamins B, vitamin C, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, riboflavin, folic and pantothenic acids.
All these elements help to function the body’s systems.
In addition, potatoes help in the fight against age disorders.
Due to the large content of the cell, it is useful for the gastrointestinal tract, and with regular use can also help in the prevention of hypertension and atherosclerosis.
However, for the greatest benefit, the root fruit is better to chop or cook, rather than roast on oil.
Previously, The Daily Express warned that potatoes could be dangerous for diabetics, like other foods with a high glycemic index.
These are carbohydrate-containing foods that are quickly broken down into sugars, such as sugar, sweet soft drinks, white rice, and white bread.
In early December, the newspaper Kommersant warned of a possible shortage of Russian table potatoes, noting a reduction in its production in private subsidiaries and an increase in processing capacities.
According to the market participants, the shortage of products at the moment can only replace imports.
Lostfilm, Lordfilm and other pirates removed from Yandex release
Candidates for the flight
In 2015, the rights holders of the RAEC/Media cluster compiled a list of the 100 largest pirated sites of the runet and most of them ceased to exist, says Karen Kazaryan, director-general of the Internet Research Institute.
But some – Kinogo, Lostfilm, Filmix – still managed to survive thanks to a regular domain name change, he adds.
For example, on Lostfilm, which is available in the search release of both "Yandex" and Google, you can watch pirate copies of the Netflix series "Game of Thrones" and "Inconvenience" of the director Anna Melikan - the original series in the Russian video server.
At Kinogo, which is also available in the release of search engines, you can see the animated novelty "Encanto", but, judging by the quality of the video, it is a so-called screen (pictured in the cinema pirate copy of the film).
On Filmix, which can also be found through search engines, the series "Universe. 10 Years Later" of the TNT television channel (included in "Gasprom-Media") is available.

Mattress Dimax Micro Ultrameat, size 160<0xD1><0x85>190
Orthopedic spring mattress Micro Ultrameet.
The model is comfortable in that it has two different surfaces in softness – high rigidity and slightly more than average.
Only quality and premium fillers are included in the composition of the product, which have proven themselves exclusively on the best side.
Springs: a block of independent springs "micropack" is installed in the center of the model.
This means that there are 2,000 coils in the sleeping place, which operate completely autonomously.
It is their functioning that gives a unique point-of-sight adjustment.
The "Micropack" is the most high-frequency of all the diversity of the "Dimax" spring blocks, therefore it has a brightly expressed orthopedic effect and is considered premium.
Fillers: top and bottom of the springs are installed combinations of layers of cowhide and natural latex.
The only difference is the order of the plates.
If there is a latex on one surface, then the other is a coconut shell.
Such a tandem of fillers has long carried the status of a classic, because it transmits to the mattress not only orthopedic but also anatomical properties.
If the coir provides the correct support of the back, then the latex gives adaptation of the surface to the human body.
Case: the model comes in a simple knitted case Aloe Vera.
At the customer’s request, it can be made both removable and stationary.
The total height of the product – 27 cm, the recommended load on the sleeping place – 170 kg.
Warranty and safety: Warranty period – 3 years.
Matras has received all the necessary certificates and documents that confirm its complete safety and reliability in operation.
The orthopedic foam used in the mattress is CertiPUR certified.
Estonian Scientists Will Seek Life on Venus
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in cooperation with the Tartu Observatory and other research institutions and companies, is preparing three space missions to Venus to look for signs of life in the atmosphere, the Current Camera reported on Sunday.
The aim of the five-year missions is to assess the suitability of the clouds of Venus for life, and then to search for life there.
For the project, Tartu scientists offered tools to measure acidity and oxygen content in the clouds of Venus.
So far, it has been assumed that the Venus cloud, the closest planet to Earth, is too acidic for life to exist there, but it is likely that Venus was originally an Earth-like planet.
During the third mission, a sample from Venus must arrive.
Suppose that if we find life there, the main question will be whether it is similar to earthly or different.
If it is very similar, it will be obvious that earthly life did not begin on Earth.
If it differs, it may be more likely that life was born on Earth,” said Mikhail Pajusal, the head of the Estonian Venus Life Finder project team.

The target aliens will change the Russian business
The topic of meta settlements became popular in the fall of this year, when Mark Zuckerberg announced the transformation of Facebook into Meta.
For the market, this event has become an important signal: the biggest player has confirmed the development of a new format of digital interaction between people.
This means that businesses in Russia, as well as around the world, will invest in the creation of their own meta-populations and their subsequent monetization.
Objectives should be considered as a continuation of objectively existing trends.
On the one hand, the trend to create remote interactions in the context of the pandemic, because people are tired of fragmentation and restrictions.
On the other hand, it is a consequence of the desire of the business to develop ecosystems and adapt operating models under them.
Thirdly, they are a logical continuation of the digitalization trend of assets when any rights, securities, works of art and even money go digital.

You can eat on a spoon, try - and enough.
After all, ahead and indeed ten weekends, you can prepare any tasty and useful dishes.

British economist could not predict 2022 <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
British economist Jim O’Neill failed to make a prediction for 2022, as he believes such attempts will turn out to be a failure.
This is what he wrote in an article for Project Syndicate.
The expert believes that next year will be full of unpredictability and any trend could change turnover.
The most important factor remains the coronavirus pandemic, and in the second place - inflation, he believes.
O'Neill also admitted that he does not know whether the price increase for goods is temporary or not.
As the expert pointed out, even before the pandemic, it was clear that “the world of the infinite generosity of central banks has already outlived itself” and it is time to return to relations where interest rates, given inflation, will correlate with the expected rate of GDP growth.
O’Neill noted that against the backdrop of the pandemic, the continuation of a super-soft economic policy could, in the opinion of some experts, lead to a new surge in inflation.
In addition, attention should be paid to the issue of productivity growth, as well as increasing poverty and climate change, O'Neill summarized.
Earlier, Mikhail Schulgin, head of the global research department “Opening Investment” said that positive expectations for the dollar price for 2022 remain, while the growth potential will be less significant.
Among the risks to the dollar’s exchange rate, Shulgin called the Fed’s monetary policy, the dynamics of oil prices and fears against the backdrop of the coronavirus pandemic.
I have to agree.
But one thing is happy: if you compare yourself to yourself, five years ago there were fewer containers.
It's better now.
There's progress, only sluggish.
There is another problem: there are many environmental initiatives in cities, but people don’t know about them.
Any ecotaxes that take waste out of the house.
And the banal point of acceptance of secondary raw materials - they use margins.

Russians give about 4.5% of the country’s GDP to auto dealers
At the end of 10 months of 2021, Russians spent 2 trillion 784 billion rubles on the purchase of new cars, which is 28% more than in the same period last year, according to the statistics agency Russian Automotive Market Research (NAPI).
To understand the scale - about the same amount (about 3 trillion rubles) was spent by the state to support citizens and the economy during the coronavirus pandemic.
Last September, at a meeting of the heads of state of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, President Vladimir Putin said that such an amount is comparable to more than 4.5% of the country's gross domestic product (GDP) in 2020.
In terms of revenue in the Russian market, the Korean brand Kia is leading.
In 10 months of this year, he managed to sell cars in the amount of 325.7 billion rubles, which is almost 24% more than a year earlier.
Hyundai’s related Kia brand is even more significant – more than 35%, and the revenue from the sale of cars is estimated at 279.3 billion rubles.
In leading positions, this brand and the increase in the average price of the car - for a year Hyundai it grew by almost 21%, to 1.94 million rubles - stronger travel dynamics had only Changan, Chery, Geely and Mercedes-Benz.
At the same time, sales of Korean brands grew not so much: according to the statistics of the committee of car manufacturers of the Association of European Business in Russia, in quantitative terms, Kia sold 9.4% more cars over the same period than a year earlier.
Hyundai - almost 12%.
Closes three leaders in terms of sales in cash Japanese Toyota - for cars of this brand Russians spent in 10 months 275.5 billion rubles, which is 14% more than a year earlier.
The Japanese followed Mercedes-Benz with a figure of 266.1 billion rubles (<0x2B>75%) - the German premium brand also increased sales (by 37%), and the average price of the car (by almost 28%, up to 8.2 million rubles).
“Mercedes-Benz has both good sales growth and a balanced average price – more, for example, than BMW – hence a greater increase in financial capacity,” said NAPI Director-General Tatyana Arabaji.
“In terms of sales growth, fantastic performance is showing Chinese brands, which have also significantly increased their financial capacity this year.”
The Russian Lada on the dynamics of revenue growth shows average market figures (plus 28%), Russians spent 229.4 billion rubles on cars of this brand in 10 months.
At the level of last year in terms of financial capacity, there are companies whose car sales fell in items in 2021: in particular, Volkswagen, Mitsubishi and Nissan.
UAZ and at a disadvantage - in 10 months the Russians spent on SUVs and pick-up trucks of this brand 12 billion rubles versus 12.4 billion rubles a year earlier.
Against the background of problems with the supply of automotive components and disruptions in production, covering the entire world automotive industry, the auto companies continue to continuously adjust prices - the same "AvtoVAZ" increased the cost of Lada models seven times a year, the last trip (by 8-10 thousand runes).
Regularly rewrite the price lists for their products and other car manufacturers.
The volumes of the Russian automotive market in monetary terms will continue to increase - in addition to the shortage of cars, inflation contributes to this, as well as the desire of auto companies to play back past losses, experts say.
Given the shortage of cars, I think many auto companies have even been able to partially transfer to consumers the costs of past periods, which they could not have invested in the price of cars before.
says VTB Capital auto industry analyst Vladimir Bespalov. -
I believe that in financial terms, the car manufacturers feel very good right now, maintaining a high margin of sales.”
An indirect indicator of this is the rate of growth in the value of cars, which is observed during 2021, the prices of new cars are rising faster than inflation, the expert clarifies.
In the long term, the market will grow both in quantitative terms and in monetary terms, but mainly due to inflation and the complexity of the design of the machines themselves, Bespalov predicts.
With the increase in the offer, the possibilities for price increases will be limited.
In monetary terms, the Russian auto market will continue to grow and next year, even if the growth of the car’s value slows down, automakers will be able to earn their income at the expense of volumes, independent automotive consultant Sergey Burgazliev notes.
Given the increased demand and insufficient supply, the car manufacturers are now striving to get the most profit from every car sold, Burgazliev notes.
The increase in the volume of production of machines is not expected at least in the next six months, while in Russia the excitement is warmed even by the uncertainty of citizens in the future.
Against the background of the situation in the market, cars proved to be a good object for investment - a car bought a year ago, even with a run, can now be sold more expensive at the initial cost, says the expert.
Biden said about the transfer of US military to Ukraine in the event of an invasion of Russia
The U.S. leadership never considered sending U.S. troops to Ukraine in the event of an “invasion” of Russia.
That’s what U.S. President Joe Biden said.
“There have never been such plans,” the White House chief said, answering a journalist’s question about whether the United States had given up such an idea.
Biden noted that in the event of an escalation of the situation around Ukraine, Russia will face economic consequences.
At the same time, he stressed that the US and NATO have no obligation to use military force to protect Ukraine in the event of an escalation.
The U.S. leader also stated that the possibility of unilateral use of U.S. troops for the defense of Ukraine is not on the agenda.
Biden explained that if Russia invades the territory of Ukraine, the United States will transfer its forces to the Eastern European countries of NATO (Bulgaria, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Estonia).
"We will have to send more U.S. and NATO troops to the eastern flank, B9 - all those NATO countries for which we have a sacred obligation to protect them from any attack by Russia," Biden said.
Earlier, the press secretary of the President of Russia Dmitry Peskov stressed that Moscow has no intention of invading the territory of Ukraine.
At the same time, he pointed out that Moscow sees the problem in the combat use of the drones supplied by Kiev by Turkey, as well as in the fact that "American weapons are approaching our territory."

If a scammer calls from such a number, such as an "employee of the Ministry of Internal Affairs" or another force structure, then immediately throw it ineffectively, and to put it on the blacklist, most likely will not succeed.
Because to confirm his lie about his involvement in power structures, he quickly repeats the challenge and continues to intimidate and speak out.
More useful recommendations are needed for the people.
That's bullshit.
I can't believe that was the case.
