Nevertheless, the nine "Beautiful Munich" candidates deliver their shots with people photographer Tuan and defy wind, thunder and rain like real professionals.
The romantic shooting is in the video:
DFB chief Grindel sees no basis for <0xC3><0x96>zil comeback
Berlin DFB President Reinhard Grindel currently sees no basis for Mesut <0xC3><0x96>zil's return to the national team.
"This is a question that, of course, depends on you getting into a conversation with him once, talking to him about why he apparently felt that one or another as it is laid down in his statement," Grindel said in the football podcast "Phrasenmäher" of the "Bild-Zei.
Despite months of debate over <0xC3><0x96>zil's photos with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he regrets the resignation of 92-time national player <0xC3><0x96>zil.
"I would have been happy if Mesut <0xC3><0x96>zil had continued to play for Germany.
I also assumed at some point that this would be the case,” Grindel said.
The 29-year-old had declared his resignation from the DFB team in July and also justified it by saying that Grindel did not defend him against racist attacks during the World Cup.
The DFB chief reiterated his criticism of <0xC3><0x96>zil that he is not ready for a conversation with Bundestrainer Joachim Löw and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He didn’t want to build pressure, but he knows it from football so that when you leave a team or change an association, you talk to your coach about it and I’m sorry that this conversation hasn’t happened so far.”
Linz: Garden hut burned in Schrebergarten settlement
At 14.13, the professional fire brigade in Linz was alerted to a fire in the Angererhofweg.
Because a high-voltage line leads directly over the shrine art settlement, danger was delayed.
The professional fire brigade pulled out and found the hut in full fire upon arrival.
The roof had to be practically removed for the whole and fire extinguisher to the necessary extent.
According to the owner of the burning garden hut, he had installed a battery for charging at noon.
This could be the cause of the fire.
In any case, according to the Fire Department, the charger was in the area of the highest fire intensity.
The damage caused by the fire still needs to be determined - as well as the cause of the fire.
However, he was likely to be considerable, because the owner had many collector’s items in his garden hut.
Angry mother defends: Lindsay Lohan attacks refugee family on open road
What has Lindsay Lohan driven only to this extremely strange action?
She apparently wanted to intimidate the children of an alleged refugee family.
Lindsay Lohan (32, "Herbie: Fully Loaded") has even streamed live how she apparently wants to intimidate a family in Moscow.
This is reported by the US portal "TMZ" and publishes a partial cut of the stream.
Here you see "Fortunately Kissed" with Lindsay Lohan
In the clip, Lohan gets out of a car and goes to a possibly homeless family who wants to have her as a refugee family from Syria.
When the family escapes from the actress, Lohan follows her parents and their children.
She's watching the adult child trafficking.
There is no evidence of all this in the clip.
“The whole world is watching this right now,” Lohan says in the video, as she continues to pursue the family along the road.
Apparently, she is trying to separate the children from her parents.
At some point, however, the obviously angry mother seems to be enough.
It looks like she's spinning around and Lohan's missing an earwig.
In tears, the actress complains about how shocked she is - and she keeps her mouth shut.
What led Lohan to this action is currently completely unclear.
Landing on Ryugu: This mission has "mascot" on the asteroid
The probe "Hayabusa2" launched in December 2014 in Japan.
It is said to be so close to the asteroid Ryugu that it can suck in material from its surface and bring it to Earth.
The lander "Mascot" will stay on Ryugu.
Foreign Ticker: Death toll on Sulawesi rises to more than 400
After the severe earthquake of magnitude 7.5 and subsequent tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, at least 420 deaths have been reported.
The number of victims could rise even further.
The rescue teams have not yet advanced to the devastated and cut off areas of the outside world.
Elon Musk Resigns as Tesla's Supervisory Board
In the beginning was a tweet.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk caused stock market unrest in early August when he announced a withdrawal of the electric car maker.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission accused him of fraud, but now the two have agreed.
Tesla and Musk have to pay, and the Tesla CEO is withdrawing from the board of directors, but he is allowed to remain chairman.
Party of the British Conservatives
Strictly guarded - the party day of the Tories
Birmingham becomes the stage of a power struggle.
The meeting is about foreign policy, trade and development policy, but the four-day conference will be overshadowed by the dispute between Prime Minister Theresa May and the Brexit hardliners, at the front ex-Foreign Minister Boris Johnson.
Referendum for a new state name
The Foreign Ministers of Macedonia (right) and Greece have already agreed
Macedonia is a state in the Balkans, but Macedonia is also a province in northern Greece.
Skopje and Athens have been arguing about these name duplications for years.
Now they have agreed.
The state of Macedonia is to be called North Macedonia in the future and on this Sunday the population agrees - is it going well?
Protests in Brazil against right-wing populists Bolsonaro.
"Ele Nao" ("The One Who Doesn't") - means Jair Bolsonaro.
A week before the presidential election in Brazil, the mood in the country is divided.
Thousands took to the streets in several cities to protest against right-wing populist Jair Bolsonaro.
The “Trump of Brazil” stands as an anti-system candidate and is thus at the forefront of the polls.
His strongest competitor is Fernando Haddad from the Left Workers Party.
Audi: 'Dieselgate' redesign takes longer than planned
"The diesel task force still exists," development chief Peter Mertens told the industry magazine "Automobilwoche".
In December 2017, Audi chief Rupert Stadler announced that the task force would soon be disbanded.
"In the first quarter of 2018, all engine/gear combinations are expected to be tested," he said at the time.
Mertens said: “At the beginning of July, we reached an important milestone in resolving the diesel crisis.
We have completed the internal technical analysis of our VTDI engines.
The Taskforce was founded in September 2015 after the discovery of the diesel scandal at the Audi-mother Volkswagen.
Mertens emphasized that the carmaker has made “grave organizational changes” so that such a scandal never happens again.
The VW Supervisory Board delayed a decision on Stadler’s future on Friday and wants to discuss further this Tuesday.
Investigative authorities are proposing to the Audi chief to have approved the sale of diesel cars with false emission values after becoming aware of the exhaust gas fraud.
He knew about the manipulations or consciously ignored them.
Bram Schot, Chief Sales Officer, currently manages the company as Chief Executive Officer of the Commission.
Due to the switch to the new exhaust and consumption test standard WLTP, there are production failures at Audi, Schot said the "Heilbronner voice".
Basically, he sees a drop in demand for limousines such as the Audi models A6, A7 and A8, which are produced in Neckarsulm.
“The segment itself is difficult,” he said.
Schot relies on electromobility.
The e-tron, the first Audi electric car, already has 15,000 reservations.
Grindel seeks re-election - Lahm to be elected to the DFB Presidium
Mainz (dpa) - Reinhard Grindel wants to run again for the post of DFB president despite criticism of his person after the World Cup and the <0xC3><0x96>zil affair next year.
"I'm doing my job and trying to make it as good as it is," Grindel said as a guest in the early Sunday morning at the ZDF's "aktuellen Sportstudio".
You have to try again and again, that’s what I will do.
And then you have to see if the support is there.
In his own words, the head of the association felt it "remarkable" if after the match for the 2024 World Cup he did not "have the desire to participate in the project of the future".
Since April 2016, Grindel has been the head of the association as a successor to Wolfgang Niersbach, who has fallen over the Sommermärchen affair.
In the autumn of 2016, he was elected for a first full three-year term.
The next vote will take place at the DFB Bundestag on September 27, 2019.
According to Grindel, future EM chief organizer Philipp Lahm is expected to work in the DFB Presidium.
"I would be delighted if my colleagues in the Bureau agreed that he will also be advised in this role in the future and then of course cordially invited to provide his experience on sporting issues," Grindel said.
He did not want to participate in speculation about whether Lahm could become his successor as DFB chief.
As a consequence of the affair about the photos of Mesut <0xC3><0x96>zil and Ilkay Gündogan with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Grindel expressed the desire that in the future a national player without migration background should become integration ambassador of the DFB.
Currently, this office is practiced by the native Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic, the latter has familiar roots in Cameroon.
"If someone without a migration background clearly affects society and football and says, 'the issue is important, we have to take care of it', that would also be an initiative to provide a better foundation for our local associations where integration needs to work,' Grindel said.
Properly lose weight with half-clog balance
I have had a new toy for four weeks.
A scale that not only measures my weight, but also the body fat percentage.
It can also show muscle and bone mass.
The body mass index also calculates the thing, but it is more likely for the sausage.
Doesn't he say anything about whether I've replaced fat with muscle?
Basketball-Bundesliga: clear record sequence for Berlin and Oldenburg
Berlin - ALBA Berlin has started with a clear victory in the new season of the Basketball Bundesliga.
Against Science City Jena, the vice-chairman easily won with 112:55 (52:31) and offered a convincing match over 40 minutes.
Rokas Giedraitis was the top scorer of the dominant Berliner with 20 points.
The Ludwigsburg-bound national player Johannes Thiemann (18 counters) also showed an appealing performance in front of 9113 spectators at his mandatory game debut.
Former champion Brose Bamberg won the mandatory game debut of coach Ainars Bagatskis with 84:80 (39:37) at s.Oliver Würzburg.
Augustine Rubit was with 24 points the best pitcher among the guests.
Würzburg-Profi Gabriel Olaseni came on 14 counts.
Last year’s playoff semi-finalist MHP giant Ludwigsburg defeated the Fraport Skyliners from Frankfurt with 83:76 (41:34).
New national player Karim Jallow was with 24 points the safest shooter on the team of coach John Patrick.
The EWE Basketball Oldenburg started the new season with a clear success.
In the Basketball Lions Braunschweig there was a clear 100:64 (48:30) and the first two points.
The new gamemaker Will Cummings overtook the Oldenburgers with 25 counters.
The Braunschweiger, whose NBA star Dennis Schröder has been majority-owner since the start of the season, was disappointed after a good first quarter.
A 26:1 run of the basketballs quickly provided clear conditions.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an opens mosque in Cologne
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an officially opened the Ditib Mosque in Cologne on Saturday.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an had previously met with Chancellor Angela Merkel and Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier during his three-day state visit.
Criticism of Germany
In his opening speech, Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an urged the German government to extradite supporters of the Gülen movement living in Germany and to take action against Kurdish separatists.
We will protect our citizens no matter where they live.
We will not allow sympathizers of the PKK or Gülen movement to shock our citizens and harm the German-Turkish friendship," he said.
For the opening of the Ditib Mosque, the Cologne city centre was partially closed.
Several thousand police officers were in operation - including snipers.
The Islamic Association Ditib is in criticism because it is considered an extended arm of the Turkish government.
"Global Citizen Festival": Music Against Poverty: Stars, Crying and Horror
Musicians such as Janet Jackson, John Legend, Shawn Mendes and Cardi B have joined forces at a concert in New York’s Central Park for more engagement in the fight against poverty and disease.
"Employ wherever you can," Mendes said at the festival on the night of Sunday in front of about 60.0000 spectators.
Thank you for coming here, this is a dream.
Cardi B appeared in a red outfit with fringes and gold microphone.
I'm nervous, I'm sweating, but it's okay, because I'm here and ready to change the world.
Actors such as Hugh Jackman and Forest Whitaker, as well as representatives of governments, the United Nations and aid organizations, also showed up at the multi-hour show on stage.
In the meantime, however, there was a moment of horror when many spectators thought the sound of an all-encompassing metal shutdown for shots, got scared and tried to escape.
Shortly there was panic, people ran into each other.
Seven spectators were lightly injured, organizer Hugh Evans said.
The New York police and musician Chris Martin then calmed the people off the stage.
“Nobody is trying to hurt anyone,” Martin said.
You're all safe.
Tickets for the "Global Citizen Festival" concert were available free of charge on the Internet, as every year.
Anyone who wanted to catch one had to read and disseminate texts, photos and videos on the Internet about the global fight against poverty and disease.
For the numerous musicians and actors, there were cheers and applause from the audience for Republican Senator Jeff Flake.
He, along with his Democratic colleague Chris Coons, spoke on the stage for more equality between men and women.
On Friday, however, Flake had spoken out on the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee for the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh as a judge at the Supreme Court and thus faced many women.
At least three women have raised allegations of abuse up to the attempted rape of Kavanaugh, which he rejects.
Flake called for an FBI investigation into the allegations after two women who, according to their own information, had confronted him on the way to the committee meeting in an elevator.
"You can also come with me in an elevator at any time," Flake told the crowd at the concert in New York.
Press Freedom: Federal Government Defends Execution of Journalist
Government spokesperson Steffen Seibert defended the drafting of a journalist from the press conference of Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an.
In the Chancellery, the Turkish journalist living in Hamburg had transferred a T-shirt with the Turkish and German inscription "Freedom for Journalists" and had gone into the first row.
The T-shirt, was not the problem, said Seibert of the picture on Sunday.
It was a disruption of the press conference.
The action of the journalist has created a strong unrest, which is unacceptable.
This is why he ordered the bodyguards to take the man out.
Seibert said it was not allowed to demonstrate political concerns at press conferences at the Federal Chancellery.
This is true regardless of whether it is a legitimate concern or not.
The rules are the rules.
In Turkey, many journalists are in prison.
Many of them are accused of alleged espionage or support or membership in prohibited parties or the Fethullah Gülen movement.
The Turkish leadership is responsible for the failed coup attempt on July 15, 2016.
Some of the accused journalists are facing decades of imprisonment.
Foreign journalists are also not safe from the Turkish authorities: it was not until the beginning of September that Austrian journalist Max Zirngast was arrested.
Recently, the cases of the imprisoned journalists Me<0xC5><0x9F>ale Tolu and Deniz Yücel had been brought to the attention.
They came free and were able to return to Germany, but there are still trials in Turkey against the two.
Munich: Florian David Fitz drunk with Ina Müller
So fresh and good-looking, his fans usually know him: Florian David Fitz.
You have to look at it twice: Yes, this is really Florian David Fitz.
The popular actor was in Hamburg - and experienced a wild night!
Hamburg - The talk show "Inas Nacht", produced by the NDR, is known for damp-hearted conversations at the Hamburger Hafenkneipe "Schelfischposten".
Moderator Ina Müller meets with her guests on some beer, some wine or even higher-percent drinks to relax the mood and tongue.
Not many celebrities also drink courage for the obligatory vocal inserts.
On Friday, another episode of the popular talk show was recorded.
This time around, actor Florian David Fitz is known for films such as "Men's Hearts", "Terror - Your Judgment" or "The Wishful Day".
The Münchner got the trip to the high north but not at all good.
On Saturday he posted a selfie - his face is completely scratched on it, his eyes only two small slits.
The bed selfie features a fully embodied Florian David Fitz.
But he's not sick, he only has a powerful cat.
To his fans, he posted some - perhaps not very serious - insights that he has now gained: "Rule one: NEVER go to Ina's Night.
Rule two: Never drink the black sauce.
And spray.
And the round egg yolk, which throws Ina at half three, also let go.
The alcohol consumption is actually written in the face of the 43-year-old.
His fans immediately posted a few tips to combat the aftermath.
They ranged from instant broilers, fish rolls or - probably the most targeted - headache pills.
Others simply had fun with the look of the normally attractive movie star.
It is not known how Ina Müller survived the nocturnal suction system.
However, since she has been moderating the TV fun at the Theke since 2007, the 53-year-old seems to be significantly more...
On a beer with Ina Müller.
Treysa has to deal with vandalism and mischief
The entrance to the 36-kilometre-long railway track in the Red Cap Country in Treysa is difficult to find and suffocate.
Recipes against grazing vandalism are sought, but solutions are hardly distinguishable.
Scissors, cigarette chips, rubbish and dirt, demolished garbage bins and now dismantled signposts - this is how the entrance to the bicycle path with seating group has been presented for a long time on the Haasse hill in Treysa.
A more than infamous sight for the foreground object Railway Bicycle Route in Rotkappchenland.
Members of the ADFC-Ortsgruppe Schwalmstadt and others have been working on the topic for a long time, according to the cycling commissioner of the city Ulrich Wüstenhagen.
The problem has already been addressed in the Bicycle Transport Council.
There is no solution so far.
The proposals ranged from the placement of the seating group to regular emptying of the waste containers and cleaning of the areas at the entry point.
"I think the latter would be the commandment of the hour - regardless of possible further activities," says Wüstenhagen.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reports that the issue has also been brought to the local council.
It’s not just the garbage that drives cyclists and residents around - the seating group is a regular meeting point to celebrate on weekends.
Not only does it often get louder, the joints are also destroyed: poles are ripped from the ground, garbage bins are demolished, signs are turned around, seating furniture is dirty.
Volunteers would have cleaned up more often already, says ADFC member Susanne Klippert.
But the actions were only the literal drop on the hot stone.
They are upset that the resting place on the bike path in Treysa is a meeting point for storage.
"Throughout the entire cycle path, the focus here is clearly on Haasse-Hügel", confirms the cycling commissioner, who is now also taking care of the new bicycle site in Ziegenhain, which is opening today.
"If she suffers the same fate, it will be really expensive."
Another idea is a video surveillance on the hill: "Perhaps that sets the threshold for engaging in community goods significantly higher.
This would, however, presuppose that a police strike will soon pass.
In principle, desert hagen wishes for a development of the Haße hill.
It needs to be more attractive.
With the frequency of the cycle path so far, you can be very satisfied.
The tourism market is still expandable.
Our bike path is of very high quality compared to others in Germany", according to the ADFC members.
As an extremely critical danger point, ADFC member Susanne Klippert appreciates the situation on Asheröder Straße in Treysa.
There is no deflection on the Hate Hill.
With heavy traffic, it can happen that cyclists have to wait in the middle of the road between traffic flows on both sides," she explains.
This is not a problem for sporty drivers, but probably for the elderly and especially for children.
Music contest at Kulturbahnhof: the "Kö von Hiltrup" and the lake
The first call to the music contest was a success, creative and mutual.
"D a song for Hiltrup" is the appeal of the Hiltrup district offensive, in the "Music contest for big and small, young and experienced musicians".
A contest "with eyelashes in the sympathetic Hiltruper family", as Karl Franke formulated.
In fact, it was soon a familiar encounter with coffee and cake from the volunteers of the Kulturbahnhof.
Seven formations took place, from the one-man band to the large ensemble: Alvin Jasic with pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with guitar, Rolf Ihmig, a long-lived Albachener living in Hiltrup, the nine of the "Hiltruper Sternfarben und Zlielichgärten", three members and three children from Enwarling, and three generations of the Clan.
This contest, district mayor Joachim Schmidt said, was a novelty.
We have not seen this in other districts.
What did the texts relate to?
At the places, the Hiltruper Lake and the Market Street were particularly frequently mentioned.
Rolf Ihmig shorted the alley in his hit song "Kö von Hiltrup".
The culture station was also appreciated.
Over and over again, it was about seeing each other in these places, especially at Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke revived the short conversion breaks with short interviews with the interpreters or references to their creation.
So Humberg learned that he actually studied chemistry, but now he also teaches guitar.
From sound engineer Stefan Schemmelmann, Franke was able to report that he recently performed in Ludwigshafen - at a large BASF event with Barclay James Harvest on the program.
Alvin Jasic has posted it on YouTube.
"It's not about winning," Franke said.
In fact, all participants received a gift from the Hiltruper gastronomy.
There was something special for the jury's favorites - so that others could hear their songs as well.
A whole CD can be played by Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied with sound engineer Schemmelmann.
Other musicians can record a song: Imhig with his Hiltrup drummer, who particularly impressed Franke with his musicality, and the "Lummerland-Rudel": "a very nice performance" with ten children and two educators on guitar and cajon, Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle.
Like everyone else, the children performed at the finale once again – and sounded “very good” without even electronic support, as Franke said.
The jury regretted the aspects of originality, reference to Hiltrup, accessibility of the melody and recognizability.
The jury consisted of Gisbert Keller from the Westfälische Schule für Musik, Andreas Klomfaß from the KvG High School and Oliver Ahlers from the Wirtschaftsverbund as well as Jan Kaven, Chairman of the City Hall Offensive.
The City Offensive had launched the event on the occasion of its ten-year existence.
She considered the event a complete success.
Everyone was "very satisfied", and "the atmosphere was good" in the soon very full culture station.
The word game: "Decrypto" in the game test
The players form two teams that face each other.
For each page there is a screen, in which four cards with keywords can be deciphered - the old trick with the red foil - only when you have inserted them.
Thus, it is ensured that the opposite side can also read nothing by accident.
On the cards, for example, read from left to right: "1st Renaissance.
2. Window.
3. Cube.
4. Fest".
These are the terms that need to be encrypted from now on.
It is not the words that are supposed to be guessed here, but the codes.
Alternately one player per team is the encryptor.
He's getting a code card that might say "3.4.2".
In "Decrypto" it should be guessed not the terms behind the secret film, but their encryption codes.
His task in this case: he should describe - in this order and in this example - the terms "würfel", "fest" and "window" - in such a way that his own team recognizes the correct order and the opposing team does not as much as possible; because that wins the game k.de, if it goes to him twice.
So the encryptor notes and reads aloud: "throw" for the cubes, "lose" as opposed to party; here, of course, something like "party" and "Prag" would also be possible because he has been careful in school and knows the window crash there.
This is how it goes round for round, team for team.
While the concepts of the opposite side are not known, it can better resonate with any reference given by the encryptor there.
So the rewrites should be as mysterious as possible, but not too overdrafted, otherwise you make it unnecessarily difficult for your team.
The most cryptical thing about "Decrypto" is unfortunately the rule booklet.
Participants will probably have to study it for quite a long time and in detail until they can finally play.
The explanation video at decrypto.info on the web makes it easier.
But anyone who has released it once will be fascinated by how much feeling is in this seemingly inconceivable game.
Overall, however, “Decrypto” is not quite as decisive as its predecessor and genre-primus “Codenames”, which also pushes an agent theme to a game of fewer words, but for this it is much better to play in small groups.
And if it’s just about betting and not winning points, he can also easily find a version for two.
Kulmbach: Man shows Hitler salute to police and harass guests at the pub
A 48-year-old man employed the Kulmbach Police Inspectorate twice as much on Saturday night as on Sunday.
He first showed Hitler's greeting in the Upper City of a passing police raid, and later he also noticed in the Upper City of a pub when he harassed other guests.
After he was clearly alcoholic and failed to comply with the police’s warrant, he had to spend the night at the Kulmbach police station in the detention centre.
In a neutral state, he must then also be liable for the use of trademarks of unconstitutional organizations.
Pressig was the home of the Schubloks
The railway operation in Pressig was the turning point in the Frankenwald for decades.
In 1991, a piece of railway history ended.
"When buffers and buffers blinked, it was heard in a very haste," recalls Georg Dinkel, who archives the history of the place and the station.
That didn't bother anyone.
Then the brakes also stopped and the wagons smashed.
It was a pure railroad.
Statements that stand symbolically for Dinkel’s homeland Pressig.
Nowhere in the Frankenwald was a place so marked by the railway.
Here was the starting point of the steep ramps route to the north, which after an ascent of about 220 meters has its breakpoint in Steinbach am Wald.
To cope with this, train and push-buttons were previously needed, which had their home in Pressig.
In 1901, the Bavarian Landtag approved the construction of a railway workshop with 21 locomotives, apprenticeship workshop, driving line and railway mastery.
"The heartpiece was the rotary disk, which had a diameter of 18 meters after a conversion in 1899," says Norbert Heidrich from Hirschaid, a railway historian and professional railroad worker for 47 years.
Loks were also operated by the Bahnbetriebswerk (BW) Pressig, which was subordinated to Bamberg in 1968, for the secondary lines Pressig - Tettau, Ludwigsstadt - Lehesten, Stockheim - Sonneberg and Kronach - Nordhalben.
On July 15, 1950, the "Volksblatt" reported a staff of 160 men; 13 steam and eight Elloks were stationed in Pressig at the time.
The electrification of the route in 1939 already minimized the need for train and push-buttons.
Since 1977, they have only been used in freight trains.
By 1991, at least 10,000 weighings were still ranked per month.
In 1982, parts of the plant were dismantled, in 1991 the rest.
Heidrich: "It is unfortunate that one has not considered a better use of the site, even in terms of freight traffic".
At Pentecost 1989, the Nuremberg Railway Directorate celebrated the 50th Anniversary of Electrification Nuremberg - Saalfeld at a pompous Bahnhofsfest in Pressig.
“There were 10,000 enthusiastic spectators here,” recalls Georg Dinkel.
A little later, that's off.
On June 1, 1991, the last 30 men were withdrawn, the Rangierbahnhof Pressig was history.
"The Rangers and Hemmungsschuhlers did the most difficult work in train traffic," Dinkel recalls.
Every mistake would have had fatal consequences.
Why the Pressig-Rothenkirchen railway station has led to the reversal of the hierarchy of the two places and many other historical and current images can be found here in the infrankenPlus article.
Kerber with record success at China Open
Beijing (dpa) - Wimbledon winner Angelique Kerber and Laura Siegemund have reached the second round at the tennis tournament in Beijing as previously Julia Görges.
Kerber won the China Open 6:2, 6:2 against France's Kristina Mladenovic.
The next opponent of the World Rankings third is either Julia Putinzewa from Kazakhstan or the Spanish Carla Su<0xC3><0xA1>rez Navarro.
Victory led 6:3, 4:2 against Darja Kassatkina, when the number 13 Russian gave up.
The swab now has to do with Anett Kontaveit from Estonia.
Within the framework of the series "Kunst und Genuss" a special exhibition was opened at the weekend in Mittelehrenbach.
With great relief, registered organizers and visitors looked at the ideal weather when the special Vernissage "Windspiel-Performance" was opened in the open air of the Dahlmann-Schmidt estate, Mittelehrenbach.
It takes place under the roof of the tourism association "Round around Walberla" as part of the series "Art and Enjoyment".
It opened its doors in the 15th year.
A big visitor’s statement showed the fascination of the exhibition.
21 copies of 20 artists are now to be visited in Mittelehrenbach.
Ernst Jürgen Dahlmann welcomed the artists to the opening of the Vernissage.
He has been there since the first hour.
Like Volker Hahn, who made a name for himself as the main organizer and artist alike.
Surprisingly, however, Hahn announced his resignation a few days ago.
With Tania Engelke and Kurt Neubauer, he put his task in proven, young hands with good prospects.
Both have already been actively involved in the selection of artists in the past and contributed to the design of flyers.
On the occasion of Kunst & Genuss again this year, there is a 70-cent special postage stamp designed by them, available at every art station.
The poster "Betzn austanzen", designed by Volker Hahn, can also be purchased there for eight euros.
Hahn was pleased with the high approval of the special exhibition.
For the musical framing Max Marcus Stadler was able to be won from Nuremberg.
As you walk through the generous garden, it quickly becomes clear to the visitor that the title "Windgame Performance" formally challenges the artistic imagination and ultimately expresses it playfully.
They are works of art made of metal or ceramics, often provided with colorful accents.
Already at the entrance of the property, the visitor awaits on the right side of the "Glücksbaum" by the artist Werner Baur, Eschenau.
It is a tree trunk, brightened in colour, playful with 20 windmills, 24 hoofs and 24 aluminum tubes provided as a sound piece.
With the sun shining through the bushwork in the background, the object seems fairytale and invites you to stay.
Barbara Waschneck comes from Ecketal, who prefers to dedicate herself in three-dimensional letters to the event 15 years K&G.
There are many parts in the wind moving.
Halfway through, Siegrid Frey from Ecketal exhibited her work "The Wind the Heavenly Child".
And at the end of the area Volker Hahn shows his colorful fantasy images of clay, cement and stainless steel.
The theme "Windspiel-Performance" for strolling through the versatile art exhibition.
The special exhibition can be visited until 31 December 2018.
50 years MGV 68 Albachten: Singers celebrate 50th birthday festively
1968 - this was the time of the protest and the student movement.
And the Albateners also aired their disgust at that time.
At least five of them.
They did not want to find themselves everywhere that after the dissolution of the church choir "Cäcilia" there should be no more singing life in the district.
It has now become a legend: on a bench in the Tinnenbush they raised the MGV 68 Albachten from the baptism.
That was 50 years ago.
Now the jubilee was celebrated great in the "House of Meeting".
"It's going to be full today," Chairman Jürgen Holsteige thought, and he should be right.
There were 150 guests, a real success for the Albachten singers.
On the occasion of their anniversary, they had revived the foundation festival.
For years it was a tradition, and then there was a break.
On the occasion of its 50th anniversary, the tradition festival was back.
An elegant ball it had been asked about festive clothing before.
The guests did not sit as usual in the "House of Meeting" in rows of seats, but cozy at tables.
In the meantime, movement was fashionable: DJ Matthias Drees from Nottuln drew on the regulators and asked for the dance floor.
It is an honor that the singers of the MGV 68 Albachten made the voice sound themselves.
For the occasion, happy songs were heard.
He said, “A day as beautiful as it is today.”
Passing to the exquisite grape juice many had before them, there was the "Rüdesheimer Wein".
In reference to another cool drink, "Humulus lupulus" sounded, which is the Latin term for "hope".
Again sovereign was the choir of Richard Homann, who is one of the five who were in the tin bush at the time.
"It's just fun to sing under his direction," said Holstiege: "He has such an easy way, it's a masterpiece that he performs." By the way, this time not only men presented themselves singing.
The women's choir "Hohes C" was also a guest, whose repertoire includes mainly Evergreens from the 20s to the 60s.
After all, there was still poetry.
Singer Theo Weber had sat at the desk until 3 a.m. to create his own rhymes.
And also Andreas Winterhoff presented well-sounding poetry.
There was also a large tombola.
The proceeds are intended to finance the children of the Albatros Youth Centre for a visit to the all-weather zoo.

Volleyball: Women's 3rd League: USC II wins high-class derby against BW Aasee
The climber is marching.
Three games, three victories - the reserve of USC Münster under the patronage of Axel Büring is really good in Liga three.
No trace of shyness or frack sauces, the independents do their thing.
And that's really good at 3:0 (25:15, 25:23, 26:24) against city competitor BW Aasee.
“It wasn’t clear, but we’ve already left an impression,” says the somewhat satisfied coach.
BWA coach Kai Annacker immediately added: “This is a defeat that we can live with very well.
We are not dissatisfied." On the contrary.
In the evening at a subsequent birthday party of Ronja de Boer, the mood was good, the game was cut off.
The result is, in fact, an optical illusion.
In the third set, the guests had a set ball.
"If they bring the goal, a game like this can already kick," says Büring from years of experience.
Finally, the USC with its routine forces made everything clear and brought the full yield to the target.
“We all know who is on the other side of a derby.
That doesn't break our genius.
I have seen really good volleyball phased out," Annacker did not have the 0:3 - and immediately went to the agenda.
Where the trip goes for the independents seems unpredictable after just three days of play.
“It’s just too early for that,” says Axel Büring.
Only in one, he feels confirmed: "The 3rd League has an incredibly good level.
With regional league volleyball, that's not nearly comparable." In the fourth league, they don't want to look down any longer.
If the vest does not get dirty in the next few weeks, they need to look up.
However, a first balance can only be drawn after ten or eleven games.
On Saturday we will go to Emlichheim.
Aasee will arrive in Essen on 14 October.

About her marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband
On the "dream ship" Heide Keller became the star.
Now she speaks openly about the fact that the series may have had a co-incidence on her marriage to Hans von Borsody.
Her role as the hostess Beatrice von Ledebur on the "dream ship" made Heide Keller (76) famous, but on January 1, 2018 she went on board forever.
The series that made her a star could be co-responsible for her failed marriage to Hans von Borsody (1929 – 2013), with whom she was married for ten years.
“That could have been a reason.
Because I grew up with this work, traveled around the world alone with a suitcase, and many of my admired colleagues took me to heart,” Keller told The Picture on Sunday.
At first, she had always been "the wife of Hans von Borsody", but that changed with the "dream ship".
For now, the journalists only called at Heide Keller.
"If he liked it so well, I don't know."
She believes it is possible that her husband at the time might have been quite jealous, but "how many men also feared Hans' conversations about problems and feelings".
Keller always tried for Hans von Borsody "to be the only right one and he didn't want to know my fears, my weaknesses.
That means in good German: I’ve changed,” as she continues.
She always had the feeling that she wasn’t good enough for him.
He saw in me an emancipated woman who I never really was, even though I sometimes appeared on stage freckled and courageous.
I wanted our love to be forever.”
After a previously unsuccessful marriage to Thomas Härtner, Keller said yes again, "although I was afraid that it might go wrong a second time."
The day before the official wedding, I sat in the wardrobe and wanted to cancel everything.
Borsody's marriage also failed.
Why has it never worked with the men?
Because I wanted too much.
Keller had the love of that time "as imagined in the film.
Unfortunately, this vision is not suitable for everyday use.
I’m too naive about love.”
The night folder, who regularly explores the city’s nightlife in the NZZ-Resort Zurich, has dared to attend the ZFF Opening Party.
Our fold is not a mott, but a little light grey.
And the shiny shine in which a green carpet is dipped on the hexagonal square blinds it over a fee.
But it’s a stop film festival, as more or less celebrities want to sunbathe in the spotlight.
So, on this late Thursday night, he torpedoes over the square to lighten up briefly in the "Aquaclean-WC-Oase".
This is the name of the public toilet facility, sponsored by a large sanitary company, which is celebrating its premiere at the festival: the needs facility on the ground floor of a new pavilion is making a lot of effort to streamline a luxurious ambience.
This evening, however, it stinks up in the men's oasis for whatever reason.
So get out here, over the other side of the street: Invited guests who have just been entertaining in the cinema next to the opening film "Green Book" at the best level, celebrate the beginning of the festival, as every year, with a party in the three-storey department store.
Its name fits perfectly to this film festival: The works shown are known to come from all over the globe.
What does an article about this festival have to do to avoid falling into the trap of advertising for its 190 partner companies?
The folder binds a bundle around the feeler, which has given him a good fairy, and two bully doormen actually wink him in generously.
Inside, the guests push themselves, dance far after midnight to live music or let DJ rhythms play, to which they yell at each other, and rinse down with Cüpli exquisite hippies.
In the delicatessen shop in the basement, oysters are waiting for slurring mouths, next to the incomparable raw ham Culatello di Zibello is freshly cut, a chocolate fountain is sprayed.
And the hammer is: all the sales shelves of fully exclusive products have not been cleared for the occasion.
This has been the case for years, so it seems to work without major losses.
You have to love this country for it!
The folder studies the sign at the escalator: "Wear a long dress, please be careful on the escalator".
If these are two separate instructions, he has gone into dress code.
But it's more of a conditional construction, and it's certainly saved lives.
In the upper-floor household goods department, the poultry kicks a cocktail prepared with espresso called "Golden Eye", matching the festival award.
The price for the best drink is not mandatory for this mix, with which a capsule manufacturer presents itself.
And George Clooney, who has been advocating for that brand for years, is not here that evening.
But then, between local prominence, box office and kitchen items, there is a face that is familiar to the observer: Peter Farrelly, the director of the opening film.
His main character should not be far away.
And really: Viggo Mortensen, with almost sixty almost acting like a chorknabe, is walking through the crowd.
He is not acquaint, not acquitted, you are not acquitted, you are not acquitted.
Especially for this restraint, often misunderstood as clinginess, international stars love this film festival.
Maradona celebrates victory in Mexico with Cumbia dancers
Coach and former football star Diego Maradona is delighted with his team’s victory.
Argentine football legend Diego Maradona seems to have lived well in his new home Mexico.
After a 2-0 win by his club Dorados de Sinaloa, the 57-year-old coach danced with a player in the cabin to Cumbia rhythms, as seen in a video released on Saturday.
In the 15-second clip of a team member, Maradona dances in a yellow jersey, fired by the players.
The Mexican second-placed player defeated the Leones Negros with 2-0 on Saturday.
After the game, Maradona called into a TV camera "Always with my guys, always".
The 57-year-old has been coaching the Mexican club since the beginning of September.
Handball: League 1: ASV send after last-minute platoon "at the ground destroyed"
Swen Bieletzki, coach of the handball league ASV, could hardly catch it: "So a bitter defeat". His defenders were "destroyed on the ground" after the unfortunate 29:30 (12:14) - Pleite - the fourth in the fourth game - on Saturday night at LIT Germania 2.
They had, as in Steinhagen, as against Hüllhorst, not played poorly over long phases, the senders.
Only the initial phase "we were totally asleep," the ASV coach was upset.
Quickly, the hosts led with 8:1, even the early break that Bieletzki had taken, did not fruit at first.
"But then suddenly a ruckus went through the team," Bieletzki summed up the second quarter-hour.
For the break, the residual was only two more goals.
Especially Senden’s best, Marius Hintze, met in the phase again and again.
After the change it became even better from a visitor's point of view.
After 33 minutes, David Ernst finished at 15:15, after which the changeover was almost continuous.
Four minutes before the siren, the lead was still apparently calming three hits (29:26).
And then?
Involve the unbiased in the event.
Bieletzki usually avoids trying to find fault with others.
But: The 120-second time sentence that Steffen Mühlhoff cashed out was "a joke".
LIT had a good laugh and hit four more times until the end - while the decimated ASV also failed in the last attack.
The boys had a great fight, also stood up against seven men in the back and threw again and again on the empty goal.
You can buy very little for the compliments.
"Now a damn victory must come," said the restlessly serving Bieletzki.
ASV goals: Hintze (9), Ernst (6), Schlögl (4), Kretschmer (3), Kümper (2), Mühlhoff (2), van de Pol (2).

Bavaria: Woman missing for 30 years - police dig for body parts
More than 30 years after the disappearance of a then 18-year-old girl from Naila (County Court), the police are searching for the woman’s deadly remains.
On Saturday, troops dug up a road near Marxgrün.
For this purpose, the road covering and several layers including were removed, as the police and the public prosecutor's office shared.
According to new findings, the missing person may not have been buried far from their then residence.
The woman has disappeared since November 4, 1986.
Investigators did not rule out a crime at the time.
Since last year, the Criminal Police Court has been working closely with the Public Prosecutor’s Office on the case.
Together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the Bavarian Monumental Protection Authority, the investigators encountered a smog under the street at Marxgrün by means of a ground radar.
With the help of a dog trained on the smell of human bones, the officials bounded the place to a few meters.
The results of the excavations should be announced in the afternoon.

Elon Musk, founder of electric car maker Tesla, has escaped his imminent dismissal as head of the billion-dollar company.
He and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed an extrajudicial lawsuit over misleading Twitter messages in which Musk could have lost permission to run publicly traded companies.
As part of the comparison, Musk and Tesla each pay $20 million, plus Musk resigns for three years from the office of chairman, a position comparable to the German supervisory board head.
He may remain the chairman of the board.
In the comparison, which still has to be confirmed by a court, neither Musk nor Tesla admitted any misconduct.
The SEC had sued the world-famous manager before the U.S. federal court in Manhattan for fraud.
Musk, who also heads the space company SpaceX, is the public face of the loss-writing electric car pioneer, who is now valued on the stock market at more than $50 billion.
Musk is not aware of any guilt.
Musk said he had done nothing wrong and was sad and disappointed with the lawsuit.
He has always acted in the sense of truth, transparency and investors.
On August 7, Musk had written to his more than 22 million Twitter followers, he may be taking the company from the stock market, paying $420 per share, the funding being secured.
Tesla would have been valued at $72 billion in total.
Musk later retorted: Tesla will stay on the stock market.
Following the deal, Tesla must now find a chairman from outside, hire two independent board members, and also set up a committee that oversees Musk’s communications.

Polls: 46% do not want Merkel to be Chancellor until 2021
After the crossovers of the past few weeks, GroKo cashes several poll-deep blows.
The SPD falls behind the AfD in a poll - Angela Merkel is seen critically.
Berlin - The AfD has overhauled the SPD in the Emnid Sunday trend for the image on Sunday nationwide for the first time.
In the weekly poll of the opinion research institute, the AfD increases by a counter to 17 percent, the SPD drops one point compared to the previous week and lands at 16 percent.
CDU and CSU are also losing a counter and only come to 27 percent.
This is the lowest value for the Union in the Sunday trend so far.
The Greens reach 15 percent, the Left 11 percent and the FDP 10 percent.
If there were a federal election on Sunday, the government parties SPD, CDU and CSU would get only 43 percent of the vote, according to Emnid.
With this, the big coalition has currently lost the majority on the Sunday issue at all major research institutes – with the exception of Allensbach.
Government parties consistently come to 43 to 45 percent of the vote (Allensbach: 51 percent).
In the 2017 Bundestag election, they together received 53.4 percent.
For the other parties, the bandwidth is also large: the AfD, in several polls the second-largest party, comes to 15 to 18 percent.
The Greens have a vote share of 12.5 to 17 percent.
The left stands at an average of 10 percent, and the FDP stands at 9 percent.
For statistical reasons, such surveys have an uncertainty of 2 to 3 percent up and down depending on the percentage of votes.
But also the support for Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in the population has decreased significantly since the 2017 federal election.
At present, only 48 percent of citizens find that Merkel is the right one in the Chancellor’s Office, as the Emnid poll on behalf of the BamS showed.
Only one in two (50 percent) wants the big coalition to hold the next regular Bundestag election in three years, while 41 percent are for a new election.
In a further survey published on Saturday, there were also significant downsides to Merkel’s popularity.
Germans are also assessing whether Merkel should run again for the CDU presidency in December.
47 percent are for it, according to Emnid, 44 percent are against it.
According to the European Union, 64 percent want a candidate, 35 percent do not.
Hanger at Aldi: Price reduced to love happiness
Is Aldi going to be Tinder 2.0?
Who says that in times of Tinder there are no more romantic dating stories - who should talk about putty meat at Aldi.
Munich - In times of digital "fast food dating" by Tinder and Co., the supermarket as a place of acquaintance for great love almost exudes an anachronistic romance.
Yes, right, a conversation about reduced turkey meat, boxer shorts at the whistle table or the favorite pudding is in doubt still a better story for the later grandchildren than a mere swipe to the right.
The app Tinder has a reputation for being less a contact, but rather a sloppy stock exchange.
We have dared the test: How do women react, when they do not talk about the hot breeze in the first message?
Here is the amazing result.
Regular Hollywood love story potential has it when love happiness precedes an out-of-the-eye-lost-and-recovery plot.
If the guy also reports to his fans at the e-mail address bio-putenfleisch<0x40>gmx.de, then that sounds a lot like Meg Ryan, Hugh Grant and consorts - Romantic Comedy at it's best.
For example, the author of this announcement in an Aldi branch unknown to us is quite wishing that she will also find her dream man, with whom she has been chatting briefly over the "30 percent reduced organic potato meat".
For her belief in the magic of analogue dating, she definitely deserved her Happy End <0xC3><0xA0> la Hollywood.
500 caps for a life without paralysis
Since the beginning of the new school year, the Ludger school is participating in the action "Deck against polio - 500 covers for a life without paralysis".
Polio is the abbreviation for polio, an infectious disease caused by poliovirus.
The disease, which is referred to in German as infantile paralysis, leads from paralysis to death.
In Germany, polio is considered extinct, but there are still three countries in the world where the disease occurs.
The cause of poliomyelitis, the polioviruses, can so far only be inhibited by vaccinations, as it says in a press release.
Football: Reus and Zorc demand rest for gods
Leverkusen (dpa) - BVB Sports Director Michael Zorc and Captain Marco Reus have called for an end to Mario Götze’s public discussion of form and fitness.
“We need to stop thinking about Mario.
That's not good for the boy.
And that doesn't do us any good," the idol-friendly giant said after the 4:2 victory in Leverkusen on the TV station Sky.
Zorc had already emphasized before the game.
For him personally, this is not an easy situation.
Football: Eberl: Don't be in a hurry to negotiate with Hecking

Football: District League: VfL Wolbeck’s research performance against SC Altenrheine makes courage
There were moments in this still young season, when Alois Fetsch went to court with his hard.
Wordkarg gave himself up, the coach of the football district league VfL Wolbeck, first retreated (innerly) to feel about the lack of readiness to perform on the green.
All history.
In the meantime, it is running again around the Brandhoveweg.
The 1:1 record on Sunday against SC Altenrheine, in the previous season only hauchdünn passed on the ascent.
Yes, I am very pleased with the performance.
"We narrowed the spaces and put pressure on the ball.
That could be seen," Fetsch praised his boys and searched each individual for the match to simply say "thank you" for so much resistance against the ambitious guests.
The coach had to change the system after 26 minutes.
After an injury to Nico Frerichs (muscle problems) - for him came Luca Rehberg - it went almost seamlessly from 4-4-2 to a 4-2-3-1, in which Niklas Thewes was waiting for balls in front.
Wolbeck had significantly more stakes in the first half.
And chances.
But Frerichs before his departure (17th), the substitute Luca Rehberg (26th) and Jan Schroer (38th) missed the lead.
Almost that would have happened when the SCA in the 41st minute hit Kevin Vollrath and Chris Naberbaumer twice in person dangerously in front of the Wolbecker box - Torman Damian Hallas proved to be the master of his trade.
After the break, the VfL took full control.
Thewes from 18 meters barely failed.
Schroer also came late after 58 minutes in a Thewes re-entry.
With the change of Miles Geske, Fetsch on the left side missed a fresh cell cure again.
When Old Rhine’s Chris Naberbaumer fell in the 70th minute Robin Westhues, there was an indirect free kick for the platzers 18 meters in front of the guesthouse.
The victim himself came in and demonstrated his danger at standards.
Westhues" thing with the right sling hit bottom left from the point of view of the shooter - 1:0 (71.).
20 more minutes, which should be damned long.
And then that: VfL captain Florian Quabeck flew the leather in the penalty room unfortunately at hand in the 80th minute.
Referee Hüseyin Sahin (Hamm) immediately pointed to the point.
Jannis Schneider did not miss the gift (79.).
Wolbeck had to endure terrible minutes in the final phase before Geske had the victory on the push in the 87th minute out of twelve meters.
It might have been too much of a good thing.
VfL: Hallas - N. Rehberg, Quabeck, Bodin, J. Schroer - Klemke (75th Seidel), Bensmann - Frerichs (26th L. Rehberg), Westhues, Vielmeyer (66th Event) - Thewes

Starting position: Four points after five days of play - that could not reach coach Adi Hütte.

Helicopter crashed in Kottingbrunn
On landing, there was an accident at the airport.
The four inmates were slightly injured.
Around 2 p.m. on Sunday, a drama took place at the airport in Kottingbrunn.
The landing of a helicopter caused turbulence, as the police confirmed to the oe24.
The heli was caught by a gust of wind, pushed to the ground and came to the side of the ground.
Police, rescue and firefighters were immediately consulted.
With a large order, the forces arrived at the scene of the accident.
The <0xC3><0x96>AMTC notary helicopter was also called for caution.

Allbright Foundation report: Women remain a rarity in corporate boards
As a result, only 8 percent of the boards were female as of September 1, according to the report "The Power of Monoculture", which is officially presented by the Allbright Foundation on Monday and presented to the German Press Agency in advance.
“Companies will have to stand up differently, otherwise the international competitors will pass by them,” said Wiebke Ankersen, CEO of the foundation.
In the U.S., UK or Sweden, purely male-occupied leadership teams – with few exceptions – are no longer conceivable.
The residue makes the German competitors less diverse, innovation-friendly and future-oriented in comparison.
It is a different corporate culture.
The slight increase in the share of women among the German stock exchange companies was also due to positive impulses in the companies of the Medium Values Index (MDax).
According to Allbright, only 6.8 percent of executives are female.
However, in the previous year, the value was still at 3.8 percent.
Among the 30 Dax companies – pioneers in recent years – the proportion of women has stagnated.
Lastly, 26 women worked in the boards.
“I’m sure that the Dax companies will recruit more consistent women again next year – in their own interest,” Ankersen said.
Only RWE and Heidelberg Cement would have signaled that they would not continue to commit themselves to increasing the share of “zero percent” so far.
As of September 1st, the proportion of women was 30.5% – 45 more women and 68 fewer men than a year ago.
“If as many women were recruited annually for the boards, by 2023 a share of 40 percent would have been reached,” the report said.
Some even make Miese: Luxury Cars: Which manufacturer earns the most per car?
Ferrari deserves the best.
The Italians take <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>280,000 with each Ferrari sold and make <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>69,000 in operating profit.
Big cars, big profits: This slogan still applies today - in most cases.
Who among the nobility providers makes the most profit per car.
Munich - Ferrari, Maserati, Bentley: How much do the luxury manufacturers charge per car they sell?
This question has been dealt with by "Autopapst" and economics professor Ferdinand Dudenhöffer.
His study shows that the differences are massive.
Ferrari made an operating profit of 69,000 euros with each car sold in the first half of the year - Jaguar Land Rover, on the other hand, only comes to about 800 euros, Tesla and Bentley even put heavily on each car.
Mercedes, BMW and Audi are well in the race with prices ranging from an average of 33,000 to 38,000 euros per car and around 3,000 euros before interest and taxes EBIT.

For the 60th time, the club is organising the wine festivals, which continue to rise every Saturday in October in the large festive tent on Rehweiler Straße.
At the start of the jubilee, the players moved from Wiesenbronn to the main square under the sound of the player train.
The chairman of the tourist association, Wolfgang Starz, mayor Jürgen Schulz and wine princess Lisa Kursawe welcomed the guests in the already crowded party tent. "60 years to organize something like this - this is a crazy performance for a small place with 800 inhabitants.
You can be proud of that," Starz thanked all the helpers.
The wine princess Lisa II later met with the guests from the stage symbolically.
"It's nice that so many people have found their way back to us after the abtswind." Later, "The Troglauer" provided mood.
On Sunday, when the abtswinder Kirchweih was also celebrated, the club had set the drinks prices on the afternoon as 60 years ago on the occasion of the anniversary.
A festive evening for the 60th wine festival takes place on Friday, October 5th, in the guest house, before going to the second round one day later in the festive tent.
In Bonn: notary car power in taxi
An emergency room car is heavily damaged next to a road.
A 27-year-old passenger was fatally injured in a vehicle collision with a taxi.
If emergency doctors are called, they should help - at best save human lives.
Such a rescue trip in Bonn took a deadly end for a 26-year-old.
Bonn - A 26-year-old pedestrian has been fatally injured in the collision of an ambulance with a taxi in Bonn.
The taxi driver, the emergency doctor and their driver were seriously injured, police said.
The 46-year-old driver of the notary doctor's tous had crossed a red light on Saturday afternoon with blue light and Martinshorn.
He then stumbled upon a crossroads with the taxi that was driving at Green.
After the collision, the medical car slid against a lighthouse and a tree.
He captured the passenger, who died at the scene of the accident.
Driver of emergency car and taxi driver seriously injured
The 62-year-old taxi driver and the driver of the emergency medical vehicle were seriously injured in their vehicles and had to be released from duty.
The also severely injured 29-year-old emergency doctor was able to free herself, but the pedestrian was no longer able to help her.
Another reassigned notary tried this - but without success.
The three seriously injured were taken to hospitals.
The police, in close consultation with the Bonn Public Prosecutor’s Office, determine who is responsible for the accident.
Manchester United lose again, for Mourinho we are uncomfortable
Manchester United lost in the 7th round of the Premier League after a foul in the league cup.
West Ham United will face ManU 1:3. The way of the defeat is likely to speak.
Symbolically, the scene was in the 74th minute in which reborn Marko Arnautovic shot the 3:1 for West Ham; only three minutes after Marcus Rashford allegedly led the Red Devils back into the game.
As they suspected an offside at Mark Nobel's pass, all Manchester defenders remained standing, and Arnautovic let all the time in the world pass the ball to the helpless David de Gea.
This was the negative climax of a previously long-distance insufficiency.
The situation at United’s Manchester City rivals is quite different.
The citizens trained by Mourinho's big competitor Pep Guardiola came against Brighton & Hove Albion to an undisclosed 2–0 victory.
After half an hour, Raheem Sterling for the home team, for the first time, broke through the defensive barrier of the outsider.
After a good hour and a double pass with the former goalkeeper, Sergio Agüero ensured the sixth victory in the seventh game, and thus also the jump to the top of the table.
Liverpool is no longer a table leader
Three days after the 1–2 defeat in the League Cup, Xherdan Shaqiri fought Liverpool in the Premier League 1–1 against Chelsea.
As with the Cup-Out, the Belgian Eden Hazard was the best man in London.
The 27-year-old's hit in the 25th minute remained until the final phase of the game's only hit.
Shaqiri, who came to the field in the 66th minute for Mohamed Salah, barely missed the balance after 70 minutes.
Daniel Sturridge did better in the 89th minute with his slender.
After the Reds had started the week with an impeccable balance sheet, Chelsea were not to beat for the second time.
First, the Londoners eliminated the team of Jürgen Klopp in the Cup, through the remis in the league, the Blues Liverpool now also fell from the top of the table.
Like City, the two London city clubs Tottenham (in Huddersfield) and Arsenal (against Watford) also celebrated 2–0 wins.
However, the Gunners' fans, with Granit Xhaka playing through, had to wait until the 81st minute for a success message against the surprise team from Hertfordshire.
Nine minutes before the end, Watford defender Craig Cathcart happily boxed Alex Iwobi into his own goal, only two minutes later, Mesut <0xC3><0x96>zil secured the decision with his third season hit.
Arsenal moved past Watford for the fifth time in a row and is again directly behind big rival Tottenham in 5th place, leaving a strong impression on rising Wolverhampton under his Portuguese coach Espirito Santo.
The Wolves remained unbeaten in the league 2-0 against Southampton for the fifth time in a row and finished 8th.
VW brand missing: Paris Motor Show in the sign of the diesel debate
The Paris Motor Show takes place every two years in exchange with the IAA in Frankfurt.
Paris - Officially not a topic but ubiquitous: The diesel scandal and the ringing for driving bans and retrofits should not let the German car companies go even at the industry meeting in Paris.
At the 2018 Motor Show, they will be showing their innovations from next week together with the competition from around the world in the French capital.
The diesel doesn’t really matter anymore.
The possible exchange and retrofit offers for diesel owners in Germany, which are yet to be negotiated with the government in Berlin, are nevertheless likely to be an important issue at least behind the shiny backdrop of the exhibition stands.
A big name is missing in Paris: although the Volkswagen Group is involved with Audi, Porsche and other daughters, but not with the core brand VW itself.
Audi and Mercedes-Benz are present and have among other things their first pure electric models: the e-tron of the Ingolstadters is to come to market at the end of the year, the EQC of Stuttgart 2019.
Both have already been officially announced.
The BMW iNext will not start until 2021.
At the heart of Paris is the new 3rd.
In total, more than 250 exhibitors are represented this year from 4 to 14 October.
In addition to car groups, motorcycle manufacturers as well as numerous mobility service and software providers are present in their own halls.
The trade fair, which this year celebrates its 120th birthday, takes place every two years in exchange with the IAA in Frankfurt.
In 2016, there were a million visitors.
At least 380 people have died in the severe earthquake and subsequent tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Dozens are still missing.
In addition, there are more than 500 injured.
The island was shaken by two earthquakes on Friday.
The first earthquake had a magnitude of 5.9, the second earthquake had a magnitude of 7.4.
Communications and traffic connections are damaged, there has been huge damage to property.
After the earthquake, the tsunami broke into the west coast of Sulawesi.
In the coastal town of Palu, hundreds of people gathered on the beach for a party.
It is feared that the death toll will continue to rise significantly.
So far, the numbers have only come from Palu.
However, many other communities are also affected - along Sulawesi's west coast.
About 150 Bikers Celebrate Worship in Werdohl
Motorcycle Pastor Frank Schröder (right) from Herne celebrated the final service for motorcyclists at the Peace Church in Eveking on Sunday with an aid team.
Werdohl - The square in front of the Peace Church in Eveking belonged to the motorcyclists on Sunday.
After all, the final service for the bikers was on the program.
Frank Schröder is the motor-pastor within the Evangelical Church of Westphalia and thus responsible for the soul-care concerns of the PS-strong two-wheeler.
Between April and September, the traditional motorcycle service (MoGo) at Haus Nordhelle will always take place on the last Sunday of a month.
The end of the season is traditionally celebrated in the Peace Church in Eveking.
On Sunday, about 150 bikers gathered there to do a service other than ordinary.
As early as 10 a.m., the Bolids were set up in front of the entrance portal of the church.
At first, the biker breakfasts were on the program and it could be fortified with coffee and cake or even with a delicious curry sausage.
In addition to the MoGo team, the Holy Riders, a Christian motorcycle group from Gummersbach, were also present.
The sermon was held during the biker service of pastor Dirk Grzegorek.
Singer-songwriter Valerie Lill took care of the musical underpainting.
"Although the bikers prefer the blues rock, Valerie Lill suggests rather poetic-quiet tones," says parish priest Frank Schröder.
This too was certainly a novelty in the history of motorcycle service yesterday.
Füchtorfer Heimatverein celebrates big feast: after the apple comes the milk
And even on the actual day of action, Borisch was active.
She provided her hungry guests with freshly prepared apple pancakes.
Georg Hartmann-Niemerg was also of great interest.
He had his apple press in his luggage and showed his astonishing viewers step by step the process from ripe apple to apple juice.
Then and when Hartmann-Niemerg left the children the field and let them fill the apples in the large pot.
With a little muscle strength, the apples became a finely crushed mass.
Not many of the children could have imagined how a tasty drink would turn out to be.
But they were also able to look at this important work step on this late Friday afternoon.
Packed in shapes and wrapped in meshes, Georg Hartmann-Niemerg stacked the slightly chopped apple pieces layer by layer.
Thanks to a certain amount of technical support, the last step of the work was no longer so difficult.
The freshly squeezed juice gradually flowed into a large vessel.
But the Füchtorfer farmer also had already completed specialties in it.
In this way, he opened his “treasure box” and presented the older visitors with the latest spring whites.
The demand for the good drop "Made in Füchtorf" was accordingly high.
In a cozy atmosphere, the parents came into the conversation, while the children could not only follow the process of apple press, but also discovered the built hupfburg for themselves.
Also active members of the Fügtorfer Comradeship of former soldiers engaged in the celebration and invited at some stations to short-lived games.
Also next year, the home club will offer an action day.
Then, however, Gregor Krützkamp emphasized, the home in the heart of the village of Spargel will not be the place of the event.
Instead, a farm will be visited.
This is also due to the theme: After all, it will go around the milk.
1:4 against Frankfurt: Hanover with fourth-season draw: "Bessissene Situation"
Frankfurt/Main After the fourth consecutive Bundesliga defeat, coach André Breitenreiter gathered his disappointed Hannover 96 pros around him and spoke to them courage.
However, there was a lot of positives to see in the 1:4 (0:2) of the last table at Eintracht Frankfurt.
"It's a shitty situation, but you have to get out there as a team," 96-football pro Pirmin Schwegger said, pushing forward: "Of course, it's disappointing because you always make a lot of progress."
The further unsuccessful Lower Saxony, for which only Florent Muslija (86.) came forward, stands at the bottom with two counters and is a candidate for descent in their current constitution.
Led by the outstanding Ante Rebic, however, Frankfurt celebrated the first home win of the season.
Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36th minute, Rebic (45th<0x2B>1), Jonathan de Guzm<0xC3><0xA1>n (59th) and Luka Jovic (89th) scored in front of 46,300 spectators the goals for the DFB Cup winner, who, after the successful general rehearsal for the Europa League match, will face Tabelle against Lakzio in Pun Roma with seven.
Croatia’s Vice World Champion Rebic was involved in almost every dangerous offensive in Hesse at his debut and was never able to get a grip on Hanover’s defense.
The stormer, who was beaten long after the World Cup, showed with his pace and ability to enforce why he is so valuable for entry.
In addition to Rebic, the Brazilian Allan, who was loaned out by FC Liverpool, was the first time in the initial formation of the Frankfurters, who began swinging.
Lucas Torr<0xC3><0xB3>’s 17th-placed headball was the first time he was in danger.
Six minutes later, Sébastien Haller was halted in a promising position at the last moment from the 96th defence around Brazilian Felipe, who replaced the short-lived Kevin Wimmer (back).
The leadership for the landlords fell almost inevitably and fully deserved.
Filip Kostic lifted the ball to the penalty area after a defensive corner, Haller extended by head in front of the gate, where Ndicka only needed to hold the foot.
It was the first Bundesliga strike for the defending champion AJ Auxerre, who came in the summer.
Frankfurt was still waiting for the break.
This time Haller matched his storm partner Rebic, who skilfully refueled and left no chance at the 96-yard goalkeeper Michael Esser.
In the halftime, Hannover-Coach Breiten Reiter reacted to the weak idea of his eleven and brought in Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt two new offensive forces.
The Lower Saxony now played a little more courageously forward, but sparkling ideas remained until the end, when after all the connection hit.
The Hessians were much more efficient.
After a short hour, Rebic started a solo and then crossed over to De Guzm<0xC3><0xA1>n, who only had to push the ball into the empty goal.
The rest was only for the Frankfurters against overburdened guests, Jovic also met a minute before the end.
The Morlaix square becomes a party mile
Despite cooler temperatures, good mood prevailed at the Oktoberfest in the city centre.
The mayor of Munich, Dieter Reiter, made it in front of millions of people at the opening of the 185.
Munich's Wies'n last week with two hits.
Singers Christians Celebrate the Feast of the Holy Cross
The Gesinger Catholics celebrate the Feast of the Holy Cross on September 14 or the Sunday after.
The festive service takes place in the city church, then a procession to the Holy Cross Church with the final blessing.
The Holy Cross Church is home to the shot Christ, who is from the Thirty Years' War and is believed to have been shot by a Swedish soldier.
Then blood flowed from the gunshot wound.
From this a great pilgrimage to the shot Christ developed, which then also led to the construction of the Holy Cross Church.
This is not finished to this day, only the altar room stands, the missing longhouse is indicated by the trees.
In his sermon, Adolf Buhl recalls that the cross is a sign of hope, comfort and life.
The service was poorly attended, despite the importance for the Gesinger parish.
After the service, the procession to the Holy Cross Church took place and with the final victory the ecclesiastical part of the crucifixion ended.
For many years the Catholic church choir has been inviting you to the Catholic parish for the secular part of the feast.
The choir members provided visitors with hearty meals as well as a large selection of cakes and adapted to the weather, farm ice cream.
In the afternoon, the parish community also offered guided tours around the town church, Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmid-Seger informed the visitors on behalf of the parish community about the damage to the facade, roof, sandstone works and windows as well as the upcoming construction measures that will take place until next year.
After the scaffolding has been in place for some time, the damage could be more accurately identified and the individual tenders could be prepared more concretely.
It is certain that the renovation will come more expensive than planned, because the damage that already existed a few years ago has become greater, but more has also been detected, which was only made possible by the initial appearance by means of a scaffolding.
The socket lining work has been completed, the natural stone work is to be started before winter and one hopes to finish well half of these works this year.
Inauguration: New residence in the Neu-Ulmer Münsterblickstraße
The Danube-Iller Life Aid opens a new home for people with disabilities in Münsterblickstraße.
That in the Münsterblickstraße now "a very special house" will be handed over to his destination - that was agreed by all those present at the inauguration date.
Finally, the twelve wheelchair drivers who have been living in the Danube-Iller shelter for some time now depend on the special architecture of the new building.
Broader corridors, corridors and doors, larger rooms and barrier-free access for all areas, architect Rudolf Bader has taken into account in his concept.
The first plans began about eight years ago, when the former U.S. Army officer building was put to the test for residents with a cellphone: "The house had come into the years and no longer in the equipment," Bader explained retrospectively.
In 2016, the excavators attacked to tear down the house.
The new building should be as friendly and bright as possible, so that the residents can feel comfortable in it, according to the architect.
Donau-Iller opens a new home
Around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>4.6 million was invested in life support for the new construction.
The free state allocated 2.4 million euros to the district of Schwaben 450000 euros.
According to architect Bader, the construction work has remained within the planned framework - both temporally and financially.
He was also thanked by the Managing Director of Life Aid, Jürgen Heinz.
The spaghetti gap between a barrier-free and at the same time fireproof construction has not always been easy.
Nevertheless, the planners and craftsmen had built a home with the many specifications that allowed the inhabitants to experience the freedom to move even without the help of strangers.
The head of the social administration of the district of Schwaben, Gertrud Kreutmayer, also said: "The house is oriented to the special needs of its residents, who need help in order to be mobile".
The apartment and functionality were well combined, Kreutmayer said.
And further: "The plot in this situation is a real lucky case, because it is no longer to be acquired in the present situation".
In total, the new residence in the Münsterblickstraße on almost 1,500 square meters offers space for 30 people with disabilities, which are divided into three living groups.
Heinz is proud to be the Life Aid Manager for the eleven full-time employees, all of whom are employed according to tariff.
Germany: Schweig complains about differences between East and West
Berlin - Before the day of unity, the deputy SPD Federal President Manuela Schwesig has appealed to all countrymen not to deal with the disadvantage of East Germans.
There are differences that hurt after almost 30 years of unity.
We must not be satisfied with these differences," the Prime Minister of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern told the "day mirror on Sunday".
The goal must remain to create the same living conditions throughout the country.
It is unacceptable that, on average, East Germans worked longer than people in West Germany, but got 15% less wages.
"I can't explain that to anyone almost 30 years after German unity," Schwesig said.
North Korea: Is this dog going to end the Korean conflict?
The one-year-old Pungsan hunting dog is supposed to smooth the wogs between the two Koreas.
In an effort to relax relations with Seoul, Pyongyang has made a gift to South Korean President Moon Jae In two North Korean Pungsan hunting dogs.
As Moon’s office reported on Sunday, the two dogs, about a year old, reached their recipient already on Thursday.
They then passed the border resort of Panmunjom along with three kilograms of dog food to facilitate the animals' "ingestion".
Dogs with thick white fur, pointed ears and brown eyes are considered loyal and intelligent.
They belong to the national cultural heritage of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
The gift of friendship had been announced by the North at the third summit this year between Moon and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in mid-September in Pyongyang.
At the same time, the two countries also agreed to participate together in international sports competitions such as the 2020 Olympics and to apply together for the 2032 Olympic Games.
In the course of the mutual approximation, Kim also agreed to close the Tongchang Ri test plant for rocket propulsion.
Austria's moving history in the mirror of 99 documents
What is Austria?
On the occasion of the Republic’s 100th anniversary, which has been celebrated for almost ten months in this commemorative year, numerous new books have been published that answer this question mostly in view of the past hundred years.
Wolfgang Maderthaner, historian and general director of the Austrian State Archives, explains it quite differently in the magnificent "Bilderbuch" Austria, which will be published on October 1.
New week, new chance for the government
This is the unofficial motto for the Great Coalition’s week of work that begins today.
Hardly an interview, hardly a speech, in which the Chancellor and her ministers from CDU, SPD and also from the CSU lastly did not mantrafully swear the "return to work".
This may have led so many craftsmen, doctors, cashiers and otherwise active citizens in this country to the legitimate question of what is the difference between work and professional work, but be a big deal.
If the federal government is now to devote itself again to its task - to govern - it should not be stopped by conceptual debates.
Whether the Union and the SPD can actually bring something together after the provocations and blamings of the last few weeks will probably show already on Monday.
In the evening, the leaders of the governing parties will meet for the Coalition Committee.
Chancellor Angela Merkel now wants to call this round on a regular basis in order to defuse conflicts early; a lesson from all the controversy.
But firstly, with the diesel retrofits and the Professional Immigration Act, conflicting issues are once again on the agenda.
CSU Transport Minister Scheuer wants to make the car companies shimmer with exchange premiums, SPD and CDU see the manufacturers in the obligation to technically retrofit older diesels.
While there has been an approximation over the weekend in the diesel crisis, the Union and the SPD are still far apart under the planned Professional Immigration Act.
The SPD calls for a stay perspective for rejected asylum seekers who work or do a training.
The Union is strongly opposed to the "track change" from the asylum system to the labour market.
So there will be a dispute among the coalition partners – and how should it be different?
Not Equal and Equal has joined the GroKo, but three partners with very different social images and priorities.
Dispute is good.
Without a dispute, a society of so many, sometimes conflicting interests does not come forward.
In order to be constructive, however, disputes must not be re-established for party tactical reasons on the question of being or not being.
It’s still about politics, not theater.
Union and SPD should fight - but always keep an eye on the realities of people.
What is feasible and useful to many?
With this guide question, both the diesel and the change of track question can be pragmatically clarified - and thus regain confidence.
This is what the People’s Party is fighting for now.
Pilz checks working hours of Hartinger
Minister at Target
Does the Minister of Labour infringe the applicable employment law?
Daniela Holzinger wants to take a closer look at this.
“Really Day and Night” would have been working on social security reform, a minister of social affairs reported at the presentation of the same two weeks ago.
The statement by Beate Hartinger-Klein (FP<0xC3><0x96>) comes as a surprise to liste-pilz-mandatarist Daniela Holzinger - she is now bringing the matter to parliament via a request.
She assumes that "the minister only expressed her enthusiasm about the use of her team and did not want to announce any violations of applicable civil law in front of current cameras".
Still, she now has questions to be able to "speak free of any suspicion".
Police raid a road in search of women's bodies
Marx Green - Long time the police did not want to say anything about it.
Now there is a confirmation.
Since early Saturday morning, the state road between Naila and Bad Steben has been excavated.
The route is closed in the Marxgrün area until Monday.
It was assumed that the investigators had previously employed an archaeology dog.
The dog, specially trained for the smell of old human bones, was able, together with its guide, to limit the relevant position to a few meters in multiple uses.
In addition, a soil anomaly was discovered in the area of the said street piece, together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the top Bavarian Memorial Protection Authority.
For more than a year, the prosecutor’s office and the criminal police have been processing the disappearance.
Over and over again, a bicycle path was blocked at Marxgrün and investigated with sonar equipment because investigators suspect that Heike’s body could have been narrowed here in the course of the new construction of the state road 30 years ago.
Color powder and eggs: tie in Barcelona before Catalonia's anniversary
On Monday, the controversial independence referendum in Catalonia will be held for the first time.
But before that, it comes to ties.
The separatists have not forgotten the police operation of autumn 2017.
Barcelona - Shortly before the anniversary of the Catalan independence referendum of 1 October 2017, clashes between separatists and the police have occurred in the centre of Barcelona.
Catalan security forces were attacked by independence advocates with powdered paint, among others, as they wanted to prevent them from approaching a demonstration by the National Police and the Civil Guard.
Around 3,000 officials from the police units Polic<0xC3><0xAD>a Nacional and Guardia Civil wanted to honor their colleagues who were employed in last year’s illegal referendum in the polling stations.
In an attempt to prevent citizens from voting, there was also violence at the time.
The Catalan police had formed a chain to keep the demonstrations of the separatists and the central government security forces separate, Spanish media reported.
Some of the roughly 6,000 separatists, however, had then attempted to forcefully break through the police label, and the officials, among other things, threw colored bags and eggs.
Six people have been arrested, 24 others have been lightly injured, it said, citing the authorities.
The independence referendum will be held for the first time on Monday.
After the vote and a subsequent decision to segregate the prosperous region of Spain, the central government in Madrid had put Catalonia under forced administration in the autumn of 2017.
The then regional president Carles Puigdemont fled to exile in Belgium.
Other politicians have also settled abroad.
Several ministers of the then regional government and other activists of the separatist movement, however, remain in U-Haft.
In December, new elections were held in the region.
Following the entry of the new Catalan government in May, the forced administration was terminated.
But also the new regional president Quim Torra insists on the Catalans' "right to self-determination".
Football: Oberliga Westfalen: FC Gütersloh and RW Ahlen split torlos
Red-and-white ahlen is still in place.
Even at FC Gütersloh, it was only a 0-0 draw.
The final light and the third one were revealed in front of 438 spectators at Heidewaldstadion as a gathering of confusion.
The first half was arguable by the entertainment factor.
Anyone who would rather have a beer or a bratwurst could do this without worry.
There was no risk of missing a flashlight, as there were practically none.
First shot after half an hour
For the first (harmless) goal shot of the entire game, Warenslohs drew Nick Flock in the 28th minute.
The best - and in principle the only real - option was the Ahleners, when Cihan Yilmaz FCG goalkeeper Frederic Westergerling was forced to a parade after 32 minutes with a shot from the penalty area limit.
The hosts were even more harmless.
Their most effective action consisted in an early change.
Stürmer Lars Schröder had to be replaced due to injury, for him Sinan Aygün came.
After the change, both teams decided to do something about the ever-increasing boredom.
In the 48th minute Sebastian Mützel scored from 18 meters just above the casing and after an hour also the goods logs appeared offensively for the first time.
After a ballerina overture by Matthew Wieckowicz, it went well.
Nick Flock (62nd) "crowned" the quickly presented counter over Sinan Aygün with a shot in the arms of RWA-Torwart Bernd Schipmann.
They also scored with a head ball from Wieckowicz (66th) after a corner ball from ex-Ahlener Tim Manstein.
RWA interim coach Angelo Daut reacted, first bringing Marko Onucka for Martin Fuhsy (60th) and a little later Enes Güney for Sebastian Mützel (70th).
It caused - nothing.
More than optical superiority, thanks to their own initiative, the Ahleners did not achieve.
It was only in the 91st minute that Cihan Yilmaz had the last chance, but it also brought nothing in.
Angelo Daut tried to highlight the positive: "I like that we played to zero." But unfortunately, the zero also stood ahead.
"This time we were not as dangerous as against Holzwickede and even though our opponent had no desire to play here," said RW Ahlens interim coach.
Offensive "placed everything a little bit" against a team that "just wanted to defend.
At least I didn’t feel like we could get a counter-gate,” Daut said.
As a spectator, however, he didn’t feel as if his team could shoot a goal.
The idea was too poor for that.
Rackenfelder Harvest Market: Luckily there are enough Kreimers
Brigitte Ransmann, Petra Gronemann and Elke Fritzler from the Reckenfelder Tafelausgabestelle, for which these donations are intended, are delighted.
The volunteers assure: "These donations also remain in Reckenfeld".
At the opening, the sky was shining blue, while the place was still a little empty, but that should change over the course of the day.
Because, “It’s so nice here, that’s why we’re here today,” said a visitor.
The organiser of the festival Franz Josef Holthaus welcomed the guests in the Kiepenkerl outfit as always with a decent touch of humor.
For the Brockmann couple, which was supposed to be weighed against food, Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer jumped in in the short term.
The Verena (daughter of Ferdi Kreimer) has become ill.
There are plenty of Kremlins.
And the “replacement” did not allow itself to entertain the ever-growing visitors musically.
It happened so well that a few folk songs were chanted later on.
"It's just great," said Marcel Kreimer.
Mayor Peter Vennemeyer was able to accommodate the opening date this time in his schedule.
He is pleased with the many active people with their stands, including mostly associations.
"In fact, there shouldn't be anything like a board," he thanked himself for the action of the men's choir.
Andreas Hajek praised the use of all those who were in use at the stands and also included the other festivals held in September and the “clean up” action.
Our garden town gives itself a colorful paintwork - here's what's going on.
Then the Maikranz by Georg Knorr and Gerd Klück was removed with the help of the fire department and brought to the winter quarter.
Many stands have been worked for the physical well-being.
From sweet to sweet it was all to have.
Stefan Hagemeyer, who has only lived in Reckenfeld for a year, became creative on his decoupage saw.
Veneer work, beer lid with racks and more he had on offer.
A specialty offered three rowing fields of imker: "Reckenfelder Honig", brought by Maria-Theresia Smolka, Christian Wedershoven and Helen Roth-Buschlüter.
The latter also has a specialty.
Honey cake in glass, of course with honey from my own production.
There the little Elsa had to access again and again, so the cake tasted so good.
It is the sociability that allowed the visitors to stay long until the evening hours, even without a stage program that does not exist at the autumn festival.
Skateboarding with Local Political Message: No Successful Advertising for Skateboarding
In Lengerich, unknown people have been recruiting in hardly any favourable way for the construction of a skateboarding facility.
At several places there are corresponding lubricants, says Jürgen Kohne from the city administration at the request of the WN.
In at least one case, a penalty notice has been issued to the police for damages.
The three words "Skatepark für Lengerich" are displayed in large letters on signs at the Gempt Hall and at the Old Town Hall, among others.
Michael Rottmann, manager of the hall, reports that after the trade fair on September 19, a corresponding inscription on the advertising sign at the staircase to the Gempt-Bistro was discovered.
Since the short message was apparently left "only" with an edding at the time, they could easily be removed.
"A few days later, it was there again, this time sprayed up," said Rottmann.
It assumes that the corresponding advertising sign needs to be replaced.
A special note is given by the fact that several large companies from Lengerich are also mentioned on the board.
If the skating facility is built, its realization should also be made possible by sponsors.
There are already promises, explains Jörg Hesselmann from the urban department of school, sport and culture, without naming names.
However, it is possible that one or more of the sponsors are identical to those companies that are on the smeared board.
For years, local politics and administration have been dealing with the theme of skateboarding.
After the old one had been dismantled at the LWL clinic, after some time the search for an alternative location began.
Finally, the Council voted by a majority in favour of the firefighter's parking lot.
However, this notion was not implemented - too many factors apparently spoke out against a construction at this point.
At the end of June there was a turning point.
The members of the Main and Finance Committee voted unanimously for the area of the Gutenberg School.
Jürgen Kohne says about the state of things that the administration is currently in the middle of the concrete planning.
The last word is from the City Council.
It is based on a decision this year, so that it could be built on a positive vote in 2019.
Engage in flight safety is getting worse
Frankfurt/Hamburg Following the European air traffic chaos in the summer, German air traffic controllers see no signs of improvement in the coming year.
“This year we had wind, 2019 we will have strong wind and then the storm comes,” said the head of the trade union of aviation security, Matthias Maas, the German press agency at the aviation summit in Hamburg on October 5.
An important reason for the numerous delays and flight outages is the long-known staff shortage in European aviation security, for which there is no quick solution.
"Airlines and airports can make rapid improvements for the coming year, but training new lots will take four to five years," the union said.
Europe-wide, the market for ready-made lots is vacant.
Around a hundred people were missing in the centre of Karlsruhe to monitor the upper German airspace.
Maas again criticized the fact that various air traffic unions were not invited to the summit.
In the Hanseatic City, representatives of the federal government, the countries, the aviation security, the airlines and the airports will meet on Friday to address the causes of the delays.
"If you want to talk about additional work compression and overtime, it will not go without us," said the head of the German Federal Aviation Administration, which has many members.
Maas again made the EU Commission's regulations responsible for the Lotsen Miseries.
The traffic forecasts for the current regulatory period up to 2019 were far too low.
The resulting cost estimates and personnel savings in the national aviation security are now fully in line with the operational business.
Maas appealed to Federal Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer (CSU) to work in Brussels for rules that “do not further curtail the air.”
At present, EU regulations would be harmonised by 2024 and there are fears of further exacerbations.
The EU is under constant lobby pressure from the airlines.
"Ryanair chief Michael O'Leary and his colleagues are now harvesting exactly what they have sown themselves in recent years," Maas said.
He hopes that the high delay costs in the airlines will trigger a rethink.
The GdF will only contribute to the improvement of the situation if the German Air Safety Agency (DFS) offers a "simplified training and future pact", Maas said.
The so far announced admission of 120 Lotsen pupils annually over the next five years is just enough to compensate for the age-related departures.
The necessary staffing is not yet connected to this.
Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board Votes for Group Building
The members of the Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board unanimously voted in favour of the plans to restructure the Group.
According to the will of Thyssenkrupp Interim Chairman Guido Kerkhoff, who was appointed Chairman of the Board of Directors at the meeting on Sunday, the crippling group is to be split into two independent companies.
Both companies are expected to have their headquarters in Essen and be listed on the stock exchange.
There should be no additional staff reduction beyond the already known reductions in the administration.
After two resignations, the control body counts only eight heads on the capital side.
There are ten representatives of the employees in this regard.
However, the final decision is expected to be made by a general meeting in 2020.
The new Thyssenkrupp Materials AG is to include, among other things, the 50 percent share of the merged steel business with the Indian partner Tata.
In the second company Thyssenkrupp Industrials AG, the business with elevators and supplies is to be bundled.
Barcelona: Violence at demos by policemen and Catalan independence advocates.
At two simultaneous demonstrations by Spanish police and Catalan independence advocates in Barcelona, there have been violent clashes with numerous injured people.
According to the city administration, some 3,000 police officers from all over Spain gathered on Saturday, as well as some 6,000 independence advocates demonstrated.
The Catalan police have tried to keep the two protest moves away from each other with a grand order.
According to the forces, however, independence advocates repeatedly tried to break the security lockdown.
They would have attacked the officials with paint and gunshots.
According to the reports, there were also ranges between the participants of the various protest moves.
According to rescuers, 24 people were injured.
Police said there have been six arrests made.
Better Salaries and Appreciation of Colleagues
The policemen wanted to honour the colleagues who almost exactly a year ago had gone against the independence referendum in Catalonia, which was banned by the Spanish central government.
At the same time, they demanded better wages.
Members of the Spanish police and Guardia Civil feel it is unfair that Catalan and Basque police officers earn significantly more than they do.
The demonstrators felt it was a provocation that the Spanish police were demonstrating in Barcelona.
“Why did they come here to protest?” asked the 55-year-old Catalan protester Manel Perez of the AFP news agency.
Just to provoke and celebrate the fact that they shattered us a year ago.
A 31-year-old Balearic police officer, who wanted to give his name only with Daniel, rejected the accusation.
"Of course, we want to support our comrades who did only their duty last year: to defend the law," he said.
But the demonstration is there to enforce our rights and we are doing it in Barcelona because it is a big European city and there is more echo here.
He and his colleagues, however, “did not come to provoke,” the policeman assured.
Panne Allows Access to Personal Data of British Ministers
A security flaw in a mobile app has caused the personal data of ministers and MPs of the Conservative British Tory Party to be temporarily accessible to everyone on Saturday.
According to British media reports, several ministers received calls from unknowns after the Panne became known a day before the Tory party meeting in Birmingham.
Two people trapped on B217

Two people were killed when they drove their car against a tree.
The car is currently in flames.

Football: Juve coach praises for top game: Ronaldo's best game
The Portuguese star stormer "played the best game this evening along with the half hour of Valencia," Juve coach Massimiliano Allegri praised after the record champion's 3:1 (1:1) victory against SSC Naples.
For the coach, the expensive purchased star was the decisive man in the important match against the pursuer even without his own goal.
"Ronaldo had a lot of fun and he's doing well," Allegri said.
Even though we started with tactical mistakes, Ronaldo was very good at our first goal – and from that moment on we have grown.
Thanks to Ronaldo's three goals, Juve turned the game after the early lag by the hit of Dries Mertens (10th minute) and hung the worst chaser first.
The goalkeeper picked up by Real Madrid first put on former Bundesliga professional Mario Mandzukic, who took the lead with a double pack (26./49.).
And Ronaldo also did the preparatory work for the hit of defence manager Leonardo Bonucci (76th), who had only to push in just before the goal line.
“There are a lot of suggestions,” the coach said.
But Allegri also wants to see goals from the striker, who is the record goalkeeper in both the Champions League and the Portuguese national team.
"We need to be even better at serving him," the coach demanded.
Best Juve goalkeeper is currently Mandzukic with four hits - Ronaldo has three on the account.
With the purchase of Ronaldo for more than 100 million euros, the supremacy of Juventus seems to be even more terrifying.
Seven victories in seven games is the impeccable series in Serie A. With 21 points, the champion of the last seven years already has six counters ahead of Naples.
Former Bayer coach Carlo Ancelotti had no chance against Turin.
But at the latest, after the relegation of the already alerted Mario Rui (58th), the top party was decided.
The Portuguese had to get off the pitch after a hard start against Paulo Dybala with yellow-red.
"We played well against a good Naples," the Turin coach said.
Emre Can was also able to feel it.
The German national player has made his debut with Juve.
The professional from FC Liverpool was employed in all seven league matches.
The midfielder also played in the Champions League match against Valencia, which Allegri said with the "half hour": Ronaldo had fled the pitch in the 2-0 victory of the Turiners and is closed for the home game on Tuesday against Young Boys Bern.
Kanye West Changes His Name
With a particularly bizarre performance, rapper Kanye West has garnered attention on the US TV show "Saturday Night Live" over the weekend.
Among other things, his joint performance with Lil Pump in a mineral water costume provided head lice and question marks to the spectators.
In addition, the 41-year-old announced a name change on time for the release of his new album.
You can just call it “yes,” the musician said.
"The creature that was formerly known as Kanye West," he tweeted in response to the late singer Prince as he dropped his artist name.
However, the pseudonym is not new.
The 10th album has already been released under this name.
In an interview with the KRRL radio station, the artist explained that "Ye" has a religious meaning for him.
"I think 'Ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible and there it means 'you'," the rapper said.
Football: Rundliga A1 Münster: Finally!
It's done!
Hoetmars coach Averhage did not make his disappointment a hoax.
That was a weak game for us today.
The opponent was just more handsome, we have put him in more trouble than ever." Accordingly, the list of Hoetmarer shots reads thinly.
Grade two goal chances in 90 minutes, so that only rarely games can be positively shaped.
Football-Kreisliga A1: SC Hoetmar is subject to SG Sendenhorst with 0:2 (0:1) Photo: Heinz Schwackenberg
Also the SG had only two options in the first pass, the first but used Maik Krause from a sharp angle for early lead (7.).
In the 43rd minute, Steffen could have raised Uphus, but after great work by Krause, he switched on freely standing.
The hosts had only a double option as Moritz Höne initially failed to Torsteher Jos Schuhmacher and in the successor Jan Blome also found his master in the Sendenhorster Keeper.
After the break the guests became even more dominant and had a number of good chances.
But Uphus (49th), Julian Turl (61st) and Heinz Linnemann (69th) all conceded.
A trade meter - Louis Kortenjann had saved by hand on the doorline and saw red for it - Niklas Eilmann also could not use for the guests (75.).
It was not until Nils Berheide scored the ball over the line that the match was decided (81st).
"We had criticised ourselves hard before, which was different today than in the last few weeks," Kraus said in a statement.
Sendenhorst: J. Schomacher - Linnemann, Scholz, Eilmann, Mey, Kraus, Krause (77th Berheide), L. Hartleif, Uphus, Abu Dalal (90th Leibig), Turl.
Tore: 0:1 Krause (7.), 0:2 Berheide (81.).

Football: Kreisliga A2 Münster: Spectacular football in Albachten: GW Albersloh is subject to Concordia with 3:4
“I don’t know what to think about it,” he said.
"We don't have access to them at all," he said, referring to the wings with Colby McGill and Janis Kröger, but also to all the other Green-Whites who came up with a collective offensive force.
He could still laugh: "A dirty victory," he said, sniffing freckly and pulling from them His players, on the other hand, was the relief to note that they had withdrawn with three points from the affair.
Well noted, after a duel of two teams, one of them, Albachten, plays for the championship and the other, Albersloh, fights for the class heritage.
With understandably mixed feelings, GWA coach Sven Lewandowski looked back on the 90 minutes behind him.
“It was by far our best season,” he said.
"As we come back after the 0:2, as we stand against one of the top teams in the league all the time, that was already really phenomenal."
All the more bitter it seems that you now have to drive home with empty hands.
Top goalkeeper Lars Zymner led the hosts with his 12th season hit (24th).
He needed exactly two ball contacts in this game for this goal.
He placed the 2-0 on the left-hand side by model for Fabian Fröhning (39th).
We knew that, but you can’t take out a player like that completely.
"It was already crazy what he did," Lewandowski relentlessly acknowledged the quality of the opponent.
Shortly before the change of sides, his own elf made the balance: McGill's free kick from left sailed between Hövelmann and Concordia goalkeeper Hinkerohe through to the long goal (45.).
After the change of sides it was again McGill who achieved the compensation (59.).
Then it went back and forth.
It was a tough, action-packed game.
Nübel shocked Albachten again (64th), just five minutes later Patrick Horstmann equalled (69th).
Despite the overcrowding, Albersloh was no longer able to counter the last Concordia hit (80th) again.
We must now focus our full attention on Wednesday.
"The game against Schapadten, that's what we have to win now," Lewandowski said.
Albersloh: Spangenberg - Hecker, Strohbücker, Adolph, Zur Mühlen - Kröger (87th Diallo), P. Horstmann, Thale, McGill - Hövelmann, Bonse (87th Bareksai).
Goals: 1:0 Zymner (24.), 2:0 Morning (39.), 2:1 McGill (45.), 2:2 McGill (59.), 3:2 Nübel (64.), 3:3 P. Horstmann (69.), 4:3 Jülkenbeck (80.).
Yellow-Red: Atalan (74/Albachten).
Football: TSV Strasbourg fights point against Primus
There was no winner in the Landesliga duel between TSV Strasbourg and FV Biberach.
The table leader had actually arrived for three points, but the team of coach Oliver Pfaff was very good and in the end the game ended 0:0.
Media: Dynamo Dresden's entire presidency resigned
The entire presidium of second-league footballer Dynamo Dresden has resigned, according to media reports.
Several media outlets in the evening agreed on a joint letter from the Gremium of Saxony.
At first, there was no confirmation of the association.
The reason for the withdrawal is due to internal power struggles in the former Bundesliga.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an in Germany: Politics instead of Pomp
I'm glad he's gone again.
There are only a few state guests whose departure in Germany provides as much relief as that of Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
For three days, the Turkish president was present in Berlin and Cologne, and many had thought that he should not have been invited at all.
Evangelische Akademie Tutzing: Prominent guests and new offers
The Evangelische Akademie Tutzing will hold about 80 meetings until the middle of next year.
Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron has signaled that he wants to personally pick up the tolerance prize in Tutzing.
For Christian Wulff, the term of office was too short: as Federal President, he was not in Tutzing's Evangelical Academy.
But before and after Wulff was there as a guest.
This is how Academy Director Udo Hahn recruited him when he proudly said: "All the Federal Presidents and Federal Chancellors were already with us." That at the Academy in the Tutzing Castle there are always celebrities, but at the presentation of the annual program there was also a theme.
At the end of October, singer-songwriter Konstantin Wecker takes part in a conference on spiritual experience in a philosophical perspective, on September 29th, writer Frido Mann will attend a conference on his grandfather Thomas Mann.
Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron has also pledged: he will personally receive the "tolerance award" awarded to him by the Academy in Tutzing, which also receives TV moderator Dunja Hayali in another category (we reported).
The approximately 80 meetings until mid-2019 have it in them.
"Retirement is not safe!" reads a headline.
"SOS at Europe's borders" - this is how the Academy describes the "riskful and deadly route across the Mediterranean".
"And to a conference on Syria: "Barbarism without Borders".
Weapons deals, destruction, torture, death – war degrades any humane idea".
From structural racism in society to the shear between arm and empire to the radical transformation of labour through digitization, the spectrum extends.
Academy Director Hahn was convinced: "A free democracy needs places where a civil society can come together to look for solutions or at least partial solutions."
At a meeting of 200.
Karl Marx’s birthday soon awaits one more visitor to the direction of capitalism-criticism, the other more a tendency “from left-wing to center”.
What does neutrality look like?
“We are 100 percent a daughter of the Evangelical National Church,” said study leader Dr. Ulrike Haaredel, “so we are not 100 percent neutral.”
Music cabaret: Gender with heart - Wolbeck - Westfälische Nachrichten
"Suitable for both adults and men" was the musical cabaret with Tina Teubner on Friday night in the hall of the Christ Church in Wolbeck.
As a cabaret performer, the robbers came up with the gender understanding, not only with humor and warmth for the (feeling) woman and the (feeling) man and whatever else there is, but also with music.
The mini-guitar inserted her and also mastered her violin.
Ben Süverkrüp was sitting on the wing.
He is, on the one hand, the male sparring partner, who sometimes comes to the end of the sentence, and on the other hand a true pianist: so congenially harmoniously accompanied by Süverkrüp Räuber that some may have wished for a solo.
There was also, with Beethoven and Chopin, but different, namely, as it fits the red thread of the evening.
Then Teubner had brought a paradox into play: a man’s satisfaction comes when he has a partner, but he doesn’t open the door.
A closed door without a partner is of no use.
The piano solo now demonstrates the same: what would have emerged from Mozart's composition, if "the dwarf" had opened the door unexpectedly?
Thus, Süverkrüp improvised, from Bach's "O Head Full of Blood and Wounds" to the "Song of Death", and from Mozart's g-Moll symphony to a playful dance.
There was great applause and "Bravo" from the full hall.
Flowers presented Karlheinz Kleintje, treasurer of the club, the chansonette.
However, President Heidemarie Markenbeck did not accept an additional thank you.
She had the idea to give the duo a duo in Wolbeck in addition to performances in Stuttgart and Frankfurt.

The SEC accused Musk of making false and misleading statements in its complaint.
Bruchsal.
After a bus accident on the A5 in Baden-Württemberg, the police slightly corrected the casualties downwards.
There were 10 rather than 15 passengers who were slightly injured.
All of them have now been discharged from the hospital.
The French bus driver had been in the hospital for one night for observation.
He will be fired over the course of the day, a police spokesman said.
The cause of the bus accident at Bruchsal is still unclear.
On Saturday morning, the long-distance bus was unbremsed frontally against a steering wheel.
Handball: Women's Landsliga: Ahlener SG holds the white vest against TV Wattenscheid
The Ahleninnen had problems mainly with the third-league player Carolin Stallmann, who scored only ten hits.
"Actually, I was very happy with the defense, only one player made too many goals.
We didn’t get them,” said ASG coach Dogan Aydogdu.
But he was more upset about the many missed opportunities.
Concentration in the final was missed by his team this time.
The ASG therefore ran almost to the end of a draw, lagging behind for the break with 11:12 and later with 15:18 (45).
Only towards the end the wider bank of the hostesses became decisively noticeable.
In addition, Aydogdu set back room Merle Klement on the left side, which then "extremely cleverly made the decisive gates" (Aydogdu).
ASG: Buschkötter, Bolte - Bruland (2), Pumpe, Exner, Klement (5), Colbatzky (5/3), Drewes (1), Schlautmann (1), Deventer (6), Baer (1), C. Fitzek, Ruschhaupt (4), S. Fitzek.
Volleyball: 3rd Women's League: top performance of the BSV Ostbevernen in the top game at VC Allbau Essen
Thanks to a top performance in the top game, the volleyball women of the BSV Ostbevern have once again established themselves in the top group of the 3rd Liga West.
At the VC Allbau Essen, the Blau-Weißen won by 3:1.
“It was a huge step for a cool season.
It makes Lenz play in the top third of the league.
That’s what we’ve done,” said coach Dominik Münch after his team’s almost impeccable performance with the downed table leader.
The first pass was dominated by the guests almost at will.
Over 4:1, 16:10 and 22:12 he went with 25:15 to the vice-chairman of the previous year.
Food has accepted in the double-barrel, but has not come into play.
We've been very busy with them.
Our opponent has hit with high risk, but also produced several tickets.
In the second set, the BSV already led with 12:8. "Eating has changed the assumption to three-bar.
We couldn't hold the pressure.
Food has taken a turn, and we’ve had a little bit of a slump,” Münch continued.
At 18:17, for the first time, the volleyball girls from the Ruhr area had their noses in front of them.
At 19:24, Ostbevern defended four more sets of balls, but the fifth attempt found its target.
"The game was now a better class," the practice manager said at the rising level.
Maike Rüdingloh and finally Wiebke Silge contributed significantly to the fact that the BSV turned the sheet in the third section from 14:16 to 25:21.
Münch: “We played consistently and calmly.”
Over 7:3 and 15:13, the Blue-Whites brought four with 25:22 on their side.
Vera Horstmann was chosen as the most valuable player, but Maren Flachmeier also had a great day.
BSV women: Eggenhaus, Rüdingloh, Lea and Anna Dreckmann, Auen, Flachmeier, Mersch-Schneider, Silge, Horstmann, Roer.
International: Turkish Community: Opening a Mosque as a Missing Chance
The Turkish Community in Germany (TGD) has criticized the way in which the great Ditib mosque in Cologne was inaugurated by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
"The opening of the mosque in Cologne has left a shear pile in the German-Turkish relationship, which can only be reconverted effortlessly," said the chairman of the TGD, Gökay Sofuoglu, to the editorial network Germany.
Both the Turkish and the German side would have missed the chance for a common, conciliatory appearance.
"Instead of emphasizing the Muslim affiliation to Germany side by side with German top politicians, Erdogan has used the date for his purposes," Sofuoglu said.
The widespread exclusion of the German public has "strengthened many reservations".
Home Club Nottuln: Offer has already been established
After the long summer break, it’s finally time to meet people again.
On 18 October (Thursday) at 7.30 p.m., the home club Nottuln is already organizing its fifth Nottulner folk meeting in the fireplace room of the Alten Amtsmannei.
Almost exactly on that day, it was a year ago that we had a folk meeting for the first time.
In the meantime, this event has become an integral part of the musical event calendar in Nottuln," says Hanns Moormann, Chairman of the Nottulner Heimatverein.
I wouldn't have thought that our people's meeting was going so fast in Nottuln.
Whether the storm depth of peace in January or the heat wave in July, the fireplace room of the official was always fully occupied.
"The programme at the next folk meeting is, as always, a colorful mix of German folk songs, hiking and seamen's songs, folk songs, evergreens and old drummers," says Karl-Heinz Stevermüer, who always invites friends to Nottuln.
Klaus Spellmeyer has pledged his accordion to the first people’s “birthday”.
He was a member of "Gaitling", a group from the neighbouring district of Steinfurt that played music with German lyrics for many years.
Now he is on his way with an Irish folk band.
The makers of the folk reunion are happy to remember the last event in the summer, when Christoph Schulz from the folk reunion Emsdetten with his international version of the song "Frösche in der Nacht" delighted the listeners and sent them home with an earworm.
"We expect many happy guests to once again spend a sociable and humorous evening," the club's invitation reads.
Anyone who plays an instrument and wants to actively participate is invited to join.
Since the desired seats are always occupied quickly, it is recommended to be there timely enough.
The people's meeting starts at 7.30 p.m., but admission is already at 7.00 p.m.
China approves planned merger of Linde and Praxair
For legal reasons, all open questions must be resolved by 24 October.
FrankfurtLinde and Praxair are on their way to becoming the world’s largest industrial gas group.
The Chinese competition authority has approved the planned merger, Linde said on Sunday.
As a result, the billion-dollar merger still holds the approvals in South Korea and - as the biggest hurdle - in the United States.
Lastly, the chances of approval had improved, according to an insider, because Linde promised to sell additional company parts.
For legal reasons, all open questions must be resolved by 24 October in order for the merger to succeed.
From pure fruit farming to ecology
With a gala in the Dr.-Stammberger-Halle, the 125th anniversary of the association for horticulture and country care was celebrated.
On September 29, 1893, with a fruit show in the Kulmbacher Vereinshaus, the final founding impulses were set for the Kreisverband für Gartenbau und Landespflege Kulmbach, and exactly 125 years later he celebrated a great anniversary on Saturday evening in the Kulmbacher Stadthalle.
Freilich was at the time even more different: as the "District Obstbauverein Kulmbach Stadt und Land" he was raised from the baptism by Mayor Wilhelm Flessa in 1893.
The purpose of the fruit-growing association was also different from today's work - it was actually purely about fruit-growing, no one had thought about flowers and gardening at the time.
"At that time, in the era of Enlightenment, the fruit tree was a favorite child of the elites," district caregiver Günter Dippold explained in his festivities.
Fruit trees should be fenced off by highways, so-called industrial gardens were built in schools.
Fruit farming is still the task of the 55 gardening associations in the district of Kulmbach, which comprise almost 7000 members.
However, the spectrum is by no means exhausted.
A natural horticulture, biological plant protection, village beautification and nutrition play an equally important role as the transmission of knowledge, a healthy diet and youth work.
How diverse the tasks of a horticultural association are, the members of the Hutschdorfer youth group "Maulwürfe" exhibited entertainingly on stage.
"Youth work is urgently needed, especially in the digital age," said district chairman Günter Reif, and OB Henry Schramm also stressed how important experiences in nature are for life.
Collecting chestnuts was a huge thing for us children, I doubt that you can collect a similar amount of joy with Smartphone & Co..
Schramm promised to plant two trees together with Landrat Klaus Peter Söllner for the anniversary.
“Where they should stand, decides the district association”, added the Landrat Söllner and highlighted the special importance of horticultural associations for the villages.
The circle association stands for ecology, beauty of the garden and green areas in the village.
That this is a real concern of the many horticultural associations in the county, even the district manager and specialist consultant Friedhelm Haun left no doubt about it.
He led the many visitors with an image lecture through the long history of the circle association and reported, among other things, on the need for self-sufficiency after the war.
Everything came from the garden earlier, for the winter it was housed.
At the end of the 1950s, however, the utility garden turned into an ornamental and residential garden.
"Nature has existed, it has already been there before us and we have to orient ourselves to it," the expert for fruit and nut trees argued.
Therefore, there is an incentive for the horticultural associations not to leave behind, so that our home remains beautiful and worth living.
This also includes welcoming new citizens to our associations, added the president of the Bavarian National Association, Wolfram Vaitl.
"We have to stop the eclipsing decline in insects, which we owe to our children and grandchildren," concluded Günter Reif of the successful festival, which was ceremonially framed by the turrets of the music club Thurnau.

Priority to Nafta talks: Canada’s Foreign Minister shifts UN speech
Mexico’s government wants clarity on Nafta: they’re setting up an ultimatum for an agreement between the two trading partners.
Canada’s Secretary of State now recognizes the trade agreement as an absolute priority – and postpones her speech to the United Nations.
Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland has postponed her speech at the UN General Debate in New York due to the time pressure on a reopening of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with the United States and Mexico.
Instead of this Saturday, the minister will not speak until Monday before the United Nations plenary session, her spokesperson Adam Austen said.
In the meantime, they are focusing on the renegotiation of Nafta.
Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo said on Friday that Canada and the United States would have 48 hours to agree if Canada actually wants to join the trade agreement already signed between its country and the United States.
The U.S. and Mexico agreed in August on a recast of the regional free trade agreement Nafta.
U.S. President Donald Trump hinted that Canada could be excluded from Nafta in the future.
Discussions about a new edition have been underway for over a year.
By Sunday night (local time) they are now to be finalized, the Trump administration wants to present the deal to the U.S. Senate before October 1.
Mexico’s president-designate Andres Manuel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador announced Friday that he would seek a bilateral agreement with Canada in the event of a failure.

Protests against Presidential candidate Bolsonaro
Brazilian presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro, who was injured in a knife attack, has left the hospital.
The right-wing ex-military wanted to fly to Rio de Janeiro, where he lives, according to a report by the newspaper "O Globo".
After his dismissal, it is still unclear whether the 63-year-old will make public appearances in the South American country last week before the presidential election.
The politician had been attacked on the open road in early September during an election campaign event in southern Brazil.
Meanwhile, thousands of people took to the streets in several Brazilian cities to protest against Bolsonaro.
Under the title "Ele n<0xC3><0xA3>o" (in German: "The One"), women's associations had called for protests against the ex-military.
On social media, too, the associations made racist and women disparaging statements against Bolsonaro.
Several thousand protesters were expected in the economic metropolis of S<0xC3><0xA3>o Paulo.
In the capital Brasilia, the protests mixed with an announcement by the presidential candidate of the Brazilian Workers' Party (PT), Fernando Haddad.
He succeeded former President In<0xC3><0xA1>cio Lula da Silva, who had been sentenced to 12 years in prison for corruption and was therefore not allowed to run for office.
The presidential election in Brazil will take place on October 7.
As former mayor of the city of S<0xC3><0xA3>o Paulo, Haddad was far behind the far-right candidate Bolsonaro in polls so far.
Although the “Trump of Brazil” has been involved in politics for a long time, he recently presents himself as an anti-system candidate.
If none of the candidates achieve an absolute majority in the first round of elections, there will be a by-election on October 28.
Observers assume that Bolsonaro will not emerge from this, no matter who he is against.
Bolsonaro is known for his hatred against homosexuals and blacks and for glorifying the military dictatorship (1964-1985).
Over and over again, he is shocked by verbal detachments.
Another time he said supporters of Lula’s left-wing workers’ party should be shot.
Europe wins back Ryder Cup title
Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines - Just an hour away from Disneyland, European golfers have written another Ryder Cup badge at the gates of Paris.
Captain Thomas Björn’s side team thrived more than 150,000 spectators on the three days at Le Golf National with great beats and outstanding team spirit to the USA’s favorite title defender for a toothless Tiger Woods.
After a long illness: Danish rock legend dies
Danish rock icon Kim Larsen has died.
The singer died on Sunday at the age of 72 after a long illness, his producer Jörn Jeppesen said on Larsen’s website.
On the deathbed, Larsen was surrounded by his wife and six children.
The musician had been in treatment since the beginning of the year for prostate cancer.
Larsen had become known with the band Gasolin', which was hugely successful in Scandinavia in the 1970s.
Their songs were influenced by international music majors such as Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan and the Beatles.
After the disbanding of the band in 1978, Larsen was successful as a solo artist.
He sold about three million records in Denmark.
His 1983 album "Midt om natten" is the best-selling album in Denmark to date.
Danish Prime Minister Lars Lökke Rasmussen said in a statement on Sunday that Larsen was "against everything, but in all his heart".
The head of government also recalled that the monarchy opponent Larsen had performed in 2010 on the 70th birthday of the Danish Queen Margrethe II.
Rock night in the shoe factory: volume at the press air hammer level
"Here we stand, take the bone saw and ignite a concert evening with the power of a tiger." Only the band names of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" put such a description of the rocky live music experience on Saturday evening from three bands in the hall of the Harburger Zentrum.
After the sound check and shortly before the concert, the musicians even take time for a group photo.
There is no trace of lamp fever.
After that, the rock protagonists from Ahlen and the surrounding area - all in association with the booking agency "Mosquito" from Oelde - with their bands make the around 120 visitors of the "Mint Mosquito" rock night visible.
Already the quartet "Tiger Bonesaw" with frontman and guitarist Dennis Hadrika knows to convince the opening of the concert evening with the latest, unknown pieces from his own spring and the soon to appear CD.
In front of the stage, the band is dancing to the harmonious and stressful interaction during the performance.
Although "Tiger Bonesaw" calls are not over, "Tiger Bonesaw" then leaves the stage to the trio "Here We Stand".
The fact that hardrock is not the same as hardrock demonstrates guitarist Sascha Bregenhorn, Golo Meierhenrich am Bass and drummer Kai Hölscher with their alternative, sometimes classic rock sounds reminiscent of the 1970s.
After the "High Energy Rock" of the "Tigers" in "Here We Stand" in addition to the guitar rock, a synthesizer is also used.
Not only the coveted, even balladish "Take Me Home" impresses with the shifting of melodic passages to the guitar-intensive rock riffs of the multi-layered songs.
The quartet "The Ignition" from Tönnishäuschen has, however, played a special level of prominence since its founding in 2005.
Full agility, the band presents their hard rock on Saturday.
The fact that "The Ignition" has special stage experience with its performances in front of a very large audience - recently documented in a film by Max Meis about the 2017 tour of China - is obvious and unmistakable.
Singer and guitarist Tim Jungmann, in collaboration with the band, also puts his own accents on the only covered song of the evening, "Word Up" by Cameo from the 80s.
The guitarist Norbert Brinkmann, meanwhile, delivers a jubilant solo for the sound that feels even more out of control than before, while he runs through the audience.
A certain amount of volume is inherent in a hard rock concert of course: at the "Mint Mosquito" rock night, according to the information of the Mixpult team at the three-concert of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition De.98".
This is, for example, at the level of press air hammers, but it is still clearly under the control of the "wacken party", pointing to the "The Ignition" on their website.
Ear-stubbing 120 decibels in nozzle drive volume as is common with the annual metal stallion in the north of the Republic, however, the Ahlen audience does not need on this rock night.
After almost four hours, the three bands of the harder, rocky Gangart have long convinced with their sovereign, virtuoso play and their own compositions.
"Here we stand, have taken the bone saw and lit a concert night with the power of a tiger," all three groups, freely in the transmitted sense, can say at the end.
And above all, enjoy the great applause of the visitors.

A dead in a sailplane crash at Essen/Mülheim airport
There was a fatal accident at Mülheim/Essen airport.
A sailplane crashed on Sunday at a parking lot at Mülheim/Essen Airport.
The pilot died in the accident.
A fatal accident occurred near the Mülheim/Essen airport on Sunday.
As the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" reports, a sailplane crashed at the exhibition parking lot at the airport.
The pilot was killed in the incident.
As the "WAZ" further reports, the flight student was alone on board - the plane is supposed to be a single-seater.
The plane was already on the landing at the time of the accident.
The crash site is located just not far from a permanent tent on the airport grounds.
There has been a Oktoberfest since this weekend.
The airport Mülheim/Essen is located at the city border of the two Ruhr cities and directly at the exit to the highway 52.
From the parking lot there is a Park&Ride offer at large events at the Essen Fair or the Gruga Hall in Essen.
Trump praises Kim: "And then we fell in love"
That U.S. President Kim, despite the nuclear crisis, is well-off is no secret.
Now Trump has made a true declaration of love to his colleague.
It also has to do with Kim's "wonderful letters".
At the tender age of 72, the married U.S. president has announced a new flame.
The Tragic: It is a long-distance relationship.
In public, Donald Trump made an unusual declaration of love to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on Saturday.
In front of supporters in the U.S. state of West Virginia, Trump found almost tender words for the half-old Pjöngjang dynasty blast, although it turns out to be quite tough fragments in the ring around North Korea’s nuclear disarmament.
“I was tough, he was tough, too, and between us it was going on and on,” Trump said.
And then we fell in love.
- Okay?
No, really.
And not only the conversations with Kim would have melted his heart.
He wrote me beautiful letters, they were great letters.
Their personal connection has also borne political fruition: Trump referred to Kim’s announcement of a halt to all nuclear and missile tests, even though critics so far see little more than lip-confessions.
That the affection for whether his martial drones are notorious for “Rocket Man” – Trump’s nickname for Kim – should not be a treasure trove, seemed to the U.S. president to be quite aware.
In any case, he took the expected criticism of it at his appearance in a large sports hall in the city of Wheeling immediately in advance: "Donald Trump says they have fallen in love."
How terrible, how terrible is that?
This is so unpredictable.
But he didn’t care much, Trump explained, pointing his finger at the crowd: “I’ve always told you it’s so easy to be president.”
But then there wouldn't be 10,000 people out there pushing into this crowded arena, but we would have only 200 people out there.
Oktoberfest attracts many guests to Baesweiler
Baesweiler is well-visited, invigorating and also pampered by the sun: very varied and with a good shot Oktoberfestflair, Baesweiler’s downtown area has washed out on Sunday.
For the first time, the Oktoberfest was not only held in the festive tent at the fire tower, but was extended to the city by the trade union on Sunday.
Refugees rescued from Libyan prison thanks to video
Nigerian refugees have pointed to their disastrous conditions of detention in Libya with the help of a mobile video and thus enabled their rescue.
The group had filmed the shooting in its cell in the coastal town of Sawija in July and distributed it online.
"They refuse to send us back," a man said in the video message.
We suffer here, we die here.
The recording was sent to the website "France 24 Observers", whose editors alerted the International Organization for Migration (IOM).
The refugees were eventually flown to Nigeria at the end of August.
“Without the video, we probably wouldn’t have been able to return to Nigeria,” Efe Onyeka, who recorded the video, told AFP.
The 25-year-old was arrested in Libya in an attempt to cross the Mediterranean to Europe.
With the video, he put himself in danger, according to his own statement.
One of his co-conspirators was nearly beaten to death by the guards, Onyeka said.
In general, the conditions of detention were disastrous: "They beat us all with pipes and sticks."
They gave us nothing to eat, we had to drink from the latrine.
The IOM is organising the voluntary return of refugees stranded in Libya.
About 2,700 migrants from Nigeria were sent back to their homeland this year, said IOM spokesman in the West African country, Jorge Galindo.
The case of the now rescued Nigerians is not exceptional in view of the poor conditions of detention in Libya.
He hadn’t heard of a phone call for help yet.
International organizations have long criticized the conditions in Libyan refugee camps as being unworthy of human rights.
The North African state, which is dominated by too many militias, is the main gateway country for migrants on the way from Africa to Europe.
When a teacher went to the public school on Sunday afternoon to prepare her class for Monday, she surprised a burglar.
Around 16:50 the teacher entered the building above the main entrance.
In the lobby of the first floor, she saw a man fleeing immediately.
First through a door, then over the roof terrace and from there over a staircase to the ground floor or the foreground.
The teacher informed the police that the investigations had been initiated.
Whether things or money were stolen cannot be said yet.
Description: about 16 years old, black, very short hair, slightly darker appearance, dark pants, dark t-shirt.
Please contact the Obernberg am Inn Police Department at 059 133 4244.
The German was trapped in his own car for days.
A 75-year-old man had to stay in his car in a wooded area in central Franken for several days and nights after he had stuck the car off all forest roads and a tree blocked the car door.
Rescuers accidentally discovered the car on Saturday afternoon near a meadow and liberated the missing person since Tuesday night, police said on Sunday.
The 75-year-old from Pleinfeld was reportedly in good health despite the cold nights and the long time without care.
He said he was looking forward to his home.
The pensioner had been reported missing by his family after he had not returned from a drive by his SUV over the local meadows and fields on Tuesday.
Despite intense search efforts, the man’s stay was unclear for days.
Laschet calls for rule of law in Turkey
Cologne NRW Minister-President Armin Laschet (CDU) has in conversation with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, according to his own information, urged the rule of law in Turkey.
Relations between the two countries are currently “overshaded,” Laschet said Saturday after a meeting with Erdogan at Cologne airport.
This is especially true of the waves of arrest, press freedom and religious freedom.
He therefore made it clear to Erdogan that if relations are to normalize in the future, if economic relations are to be deepened, that the rule of law is a very important prerequisite for this.
Laschet also spoke of the cases of Germans who are in prison in Turkey, according to his own information.
He has formulated the expectation that freedom of expression will be respected.
Erdogan has reiterated the independence of the Turkish judiciary.
The talks between Laschet and Erdogan had been moved to a flight-ready building of the Federal Ministry of Defence at Cologne Airport in the near future.
Originally, it was supposed to take place at Castle Wahn - but the owners of the castle had refused to do so out of political conviction against Erdogan.
After the talks, Erdogan went on to open the Ditib mosque in Cologne.
Laschet had cancelled a joint appearance in the building.
But he said, “The Muslims who go to this mosque are also citizens of our country.”
And we are also their contacts - and not the Turkish president.
Lack of confidence in the US: North Korea Demands Disarmament
While U.S. President Trump will not tire of emphasizing the successes in the denuclearization negotiations of North Korea, the East Asian regime represents the conditions more sober.
Foreign Minister Ri calls for Washington’s response.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has accused the U.S. government of blocking negotiations for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula with its ongoing sanctions.
“The latest halt comes because the United States is building on coercive measures that are deadly for confidence-building,” Ri said in New York.
Disarmament is unthinkable for North Korea in these circumstances.
“Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances, there is no way for us to disarm ourselves first,” he said.
That sanctions could force North Korea on its “knees” is “a wishful thinking of people who don’t know us.”
To build confidence, however, his country stopped its nuclear and missile tests and destroyed a nuclear test plant, Ri said.
However, there have been no “corresponding reactions” from the U.S. side, the minister criticized.
Because of North Korea’s nuclear and missile program, the UN Security Council alone had decided on sanctions against the internationally isolated country three times last year.
U.S. President Donald Trump and his Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have called for strict compliance with the sanctions at the United Nations in recent days.
At the same time, the U.S. government is working towards an approximation.
In June, Trump met North Korean leader Kim Jong Un for the first time.
After the first summit in Singapore, the US president is seeking a second summit with Kim.
In October, Pompeo is scheduled to travel again to Pyongyang to talk about ending North Korea’s nuclear weapons program.
The HoT serves: New kitchen with donations from the community
That they were actually in a youth meeting, the many visitors of the HoT open door house got nothing from it: white blankets and flower jewellery on the tables and a large buffet were waiting for the guests after the Thanksgiving service.
The young people of the HoT had the buffet with delicacies from different countries in the new kitchen.
The institution was financed by donations from the community, for which the young people wanted to thank themselves with the food.
The start of the new facility was not as easy as Henriette Westbuer, the head of the HoT, recalls.
We had filled our fridges before the summer break with food and ingredients and were well prepared for the big day.
But then the first day after the summer break came the nasty surprise: a power outage had shut down the huge, two-piece refrigerator, the food was rotten and had to be disposed of.
“Now we had to start over again: we got a lot of support from friends and neighbors, but the children and young people wanted to do it on their own,” Westbuer said.
And that's how everyone got along.
The result could be seen, the guests were enthusiastic.
"It's not better for chefs either," one visitor praised impressed as Hokkaido pumpkin soup was served or guests were allowed to serve quiche, liver cheese, or cake.
“It’s really great what the children and young people have put on their feet,” said Reverend Frank Beckmann, while wizard Stephan Lammen, with card tricks and other pieces of art, was astonishing.
Jürgen Sator leaves the Board of Directors NRW
Out of frustration with criticism from their own ranks, the head of the Essener Tafel, Jörg Sartor, has resigned his posts in the Landesverband.
Sartor had become famous nationwide because the Essener Tisch had introduced a reception stop for foreigners.
He had already resigned as deputy chief of the NRW boards in July, Sartor told the "World on Sunday".
There are too many people in my back.
Wolfgang Weilerswist, the head of the Tischn-Landesverband NRW, expressed to the dpa his understanding of the decision of his long-time deputy.
The harsh criticism was taken by Sartor.
"I can trace his step - there have been people who didn't even know exactly why the Essener table is doing that."
But Sartor is still active for the Essener Tisch - "six days a week, nothing changes," Weilerswist says.
Sartor again criticised colleagues from other boards in the "World on Sunday".
One must not pursue the approach, "without us, the people in the city are starving."
It is the duty of the state to ensure that people do not starve.
The Essener did not participate in a panel convention on Friday in Berlin.
"I'm being told too much sweet grease," he said.
There are all those social fussies who criticized me that way back then.
SF Lorch play 2-0 lead - Gmünder Tagespost
Football, Bezirksliga Lorch loses against Neuler 2:3 - TV Heuchlingen wins in Kirchheim after a draw - Bettringen beats Lauchheim clear.
With 2-0 Lorch in the home game against the TV Neuler was already in the lead - at the end of the standings was 2-3 and the disappointment with the sports friends was great.
In Kirchheim, the TVH quickly came into the background with 0:1, but after 90 minutes they won with 2:1. At the top of the table, the SGB was able to score 3-0.
Gladbach plays two-time lead - Schalke without embolo with first victory
Borussia Mönchengladbach must continue to wait for an away win in Wolfsburg.
At 2:2, the foals play a lead twice.
Schalke comes against Mainz for the first win of the season (1:0).
(sda) Schalke has maneuvered away four times in the first five league games with early opponents.
Now Domenico Tedesco’s team put that strength back on the day it took the first place behind Bavaria in the last season.
Alessandro Schöpf led the home team in the eleventh minute after strong preliminary work of Yevgeni Konopljanka per head, after which the hosts preserved the mini-pad with a compact defensive performance.
Thanks to an exceptional comeback, Borussia Dortmund is welcoming again from the top of the Bundesliga.
Lucien Favre's team had dealt a 0-2 draw against Bayer Leverkusen until the break, but in the 2nd half they still came to a 4:2 victory.
Jacob-Bruun Larsen (65th) and Marco Reus (69th) compared to a four-minute doublet, Paco Alcacer, who was replaced by Favre in the 63rd minute, with another doublet in the final phase (86th/94th) ensured the crowning completion of the performance boost after the break.
The first victory was won by VfB Stuttgart.
Against the decimated Werder Bremen before the break due to a yellow-red card against Milos Veljkovic, the Stuttgarters in the meantime had to fear.
Borna Sosa and the inattentive goalie Ron-Robert Zieler fabricated a curious knock-out door that gave the guests the 68th minute to make up.
Seven minutes later, Gonzalo Castro led the VfB to the first victory.
In Wolfsburg, Michael Lang did not experience a completely successful but also a failed debut for Borussia Mönchengladbach.
The Swiss quartet Yann Sommer, Nico Elvedi, Denis Zakaria and Lang took the lead twice, eventually playing 2:2 and still waiting for an away win in the VW city since 2003.
Renato Steffen was responsible for Wolfsburg's 1–1 draw with his second Bundesliga.
Yann Sommer was powerless in the 20-metre flat shot of the Aargauer, as well as in the second counter-attack after an hour.
Nevertheless, the trends at Gladbach are quite heated.
Alassane Pléa turns out to be a goalkeeper in the foal storm.
Against Wolfsburg, the French record buyout from OGC Nice hit for the third time in a row and for the seventh time in the seventh obligatory game.
After seven rounds, Gladbach finished fourth.
Within 40 minutes, the previously unbeaten Werder Bremen maneuvered against VfB Stuttgart in an uncomfortable position.
After 19 minutes, the team of Florian Kohlfeldt was surprised by a Stuttgart counter, which ex-Luganesi Anastasios Donis finished with his first hit of the season, after 36 minutes Milos Veljkovic continued to join his team: the 23-year-old Serb cashed against a Daniel Rokotsupfer.
Stuttgart defender Borna Sosa and goalie Ron-Robert Zieler brought the Bremers back into the game by a curious goalkeeper (68th), a quarter-hour before the end Gonzalo Castro shot the Stuttgarters back on the winning road.
Nuremberg decided the duel against Düsseldorf 3:0 for themselves.
After half an hour, Hanno Behrens brought the home team on course with Foulpenalty.
Macedonians vote on new state names
Approximately 1.8 million people in Macedonia today agree on whether their country’s name should be changed in North Macedonia.
With a yes, the nearly three decades-long conflict with neighbouring Greece could be resolved.
Athens had stood on a name change due to its eponymous northern province and blocked any approach of Macedonia to the west.
Voters will therefore also decide on the future Western integration.
The United States had announced that the country could quickly become a member of NATO if the referendum came to a positive end.
Syrians in U-Haft.
Refugees attacked three women.
A Syrian man stabbed three pensioners brutally and injured them, in part, severely.
The 41-year-old asylum seeker randaled in the refugee street in Alsergrund on Friday at around 10 p.m.
When the police arrived, they spoke to the accused, who ran on passers-by with his fists and tried to attack them, about his behavior.
After that, the Syrians tried to beat the officials and step on them.
A little later it turned out that the suspect had beaten three older ladies (65, 67, 75) with his fists to the ground just before in the Währinger Straße at a tram stop.
He also stepped on the trio with his feet.
Retired women were partially injured.
They suffered haematomas, bruising and concussions.
The asylum seeker was also seriously injured "for an unknown cause", as it was called by the police.
He was taken to the hospital and continuously monitored during treatment.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Almost exactly a year after the marriage entered into force for all, SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his long-time friend Christoph Rohde.
The two of them gave their word in Hamburg on Saturday.
A registered life partnership had not come into question for her, Kahrs had previously told the "Image" newspaper.
"If we get married, then right." He's been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is a spokesperson for the fiscal policy of the SPD-Bundestag faction and one of the speakers of the Seeheimer Kreis, the conservative SPD wing.
In the debate in the Bundestag on the opening of marriage for homosexuals, Kahrs had raised an angry eye on June 30, 2017.
He had accused Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of having "stolen" on the issue.
"That was your Schabowski moment," he said in reference to the accidental announcement of the GDR border opening by Günter Schabowski.
As of October 1, 2017, same-sex couples can marry just like heterosexuals.
Previously, they had been able to register their life partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, such as adoption law.
Garden day: 400 meters hedge cut
There was a lot of work ahead of the members of the civic association Kinderhaus and the society for leprosy.
For about 400 meters of hedges around the gardens of the residents of the friend house should be cut.
Supported by the residents, it was put into operation for about twelve supporters.
“We are doing this to reduce costs,” said Walter Schröer, chairman of the civic association.
And so much has been accumulated.
Due to the hot summer we are late this time, but fortunately it is now only a shape cut.
Because already in the spring you have already shaved the hedge.
The breakfast that is always followed by work has also a long tradition.
“Everyone should stay with their strengths,” said Walter Schröer.
World Championships in Rio: Hannes Aigner wins gold at the Kanuslalom World Championships
Augsburger Hannes Aigner has won the gold medal at the end of the canuslalom world championship in Rio de Janeiro.
The 29-year-old made a perfect run on Sunday on the Olympia track.
Two years ago, he had missed out on Olympia-Bronze by three hundredths of a second.
I was well-prepared, I had enough rides here on the track and it fit everything today," said the Olympic third from London 2012.
In the goal, he threw his paddle away for joy and reached both arms victoriously to the height – knowing that it would suffice for at least one medal.
After all, he had start number four.
However, the six remaining starters were unable to top their fabled time of 89.69 seconds.
The second was the Czech Jiri Prskavec before the Russian Pawel Eigel.
The Gauting Police Inspectorate reports the first attempt to break into a single-family house this autumn.
Fortunately, the perpetrators failed.
The days are getting shorter - that's what burglars want to take advantage of again.
The Gauting Police Inspectorate reported yesterday the first attempted burglary this fall.
The fact that it remained during the attempt at the single-family house on Königswieser Straße is due to the alarm system.
It started when the perpetrators laid hands just before 8 p.m. on Friday.
The burglars knew the residents were not at home.
The alarm system, however, apparently surprised them so much that they took the flight without prey.
Notes to the PI Gauting, phone (089) 8 93 13 30.
Pleite at Hertha: Retaliated from reality: Bavaria against Ajax demanded
The predicate is unbeatable: the defeat in Berlin wants FC Bayern “not to be liked”.
The next two classics against Ajax and Gladbach now determine the first interim decision for Niko Kovac's term in office.
The first small performance gap under the new coach Niko Kovac is not intended to increase for the Munichers to a larger autumn low.
“One week ago, we had the impression that we were invincible.
Now we have a little bit of reality,” said Thomas Müller after the deserved 0:2 defeat at Hertha BSC and demanded a response for the Champions League duel with Ajax Amsterdam.
Anyone who knows us knows that it really bothers us and that is why we are gasping in the direction of Tuesday.
For the first time in more than a year, no goal was scored outside, as at the same time of the pre-season two obligatory games in a series without a win, the table lead in the Bundesliga first lost to Borussia Dortmund.
Although the overall situation is not as dramatic as in the final phase of the failed Carlo Ancelotti at the end of September 2017, the record champion must be warned.
The FC Augsburg in the 1:1 race with its intense man-to-man tactics and the Berliners through their playful needle stitches over the outside have delivered two blue breaks within three days, as the last overpowering Bavarians are yet to crack.
"Those who know FC Bayern know that we will not like it and we will do everything to make sure we are successful again," Kovac said.
Otherwise, however, he dealt surprisingly gently with his losers in his hometown and pushed his first defeat as Munich coach only to the once again poor handling of opportunities.
A victory against Amsterdam and against Borussia Mönchengladbach on Saturday would still leave the first interim decision of his tenure positive - otherwise the tone is likely to exacerbate.
Thus, Kovac did not take any extraordinary measures before the second appearance of the Royals this season after the 2-0 at Benfica Lisbon.
After the free day on Sunday, as planned, the short preparation for the second pre-round match against Ajax begins, which AEK Athens also had to start with a sovereign 3:0.
"Now it's caught us in two games, but we're also going to make our goals again," national team captain Manuel Neuer said in a statement.
As after the lost cup final against Eintracht Frankfurt at the same place, Joshua Kimmich spoke clearly.
The lawyer acted in the role as a cheerleader.
"I don't think it's all bad, we have to work it out again because we don't make the many chances and make the mistakes behind us," the 23-year-old said shortly before leaving the Olympic Stadium.
On the seventh day of the previous season, the Bavarians were even five-pointers behind Dortmund, which now took the lead again with a point lead.
And so Kimmich, with a twinkle of an eye, at least rated positive that now the public debate about the supposedly unbeatable Bavaria has come to an end.
"Yes, that's good," said the national player.
It’s good for the league.
DFB boss in line of fire: <0xC3><0x96>zil cause: sharp attack by Erdogan on Grindel
With serious accusations, Turkish President Erdogan is provoking an expulsion of Mesut <0xC3><0x96>zil and Ilkay Gündogan in Germany.
DFB President Grindel sees mistakes, but defends the union line.
A new post is to be created.
Berlin - Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Reinhard Grindel fought for interpretation in the ongoing dispute over Mesut <0xC3><0x96>zil.
After the Turkish president strongly criticized the handling of the former world champion in Germany for the opening of the great Ditib mosque in Cologne, the DFB chief defended the union line.
In the early Sunday morning, the <0xC3><0x96>zil personally attacked Grindel in the Mainz ZDF "Sportstudio" announced consequences from the cause.
"There we have to draw very close conclusions in the future - because we also have a lot of players with a migration background in the U-teams - so that something like this does not happen again," the 57-year-old said and wants to win a national player without a migration background as another integration officer.
At the same time, Grindel reiterated that Erdogan does not stand for the values of football and the DFB.
He had, in sharp words, provoked racism against <0xC3><0x96>zil and Ilkay Gündogan.
Our German-born and raised Mesut <0xC3><0x96>zil and our Ilkay.
They excluded them from this society because they allowed themselves to be photographed with me in England,” Erdogan said Saturday in the city hall.
Honestly, as her president, I could not deny that our two young men, who have advanced to the German national team, were excluded.
Grindel referred to Gündogan's statement that, unlike <0xC3><0x96>zil, he felt "reasonably treated by the DFB" after the World Cup affair, which had started with photos of the two with Erdogan.
At the same time, he announced that he would want to face players in the future.
That someone says: If I win, I’m German, if I lose, I’m a migrant – that’s not possible.
"That he has such an impression, I'm very sorry," Grindel said.
We should have defended Mesut more, I always said.
However, he does not see a basis for <0xC3><0x96>zil’s return to the national team.
As a result, in addition to the native Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic, who has family roots in Cameroon, an additional integration commissioner will be appointed.
"If someone without a migration background clearly affects society and football and says, 'The issue is important, we have to take care of it', that would also be an initiative to provide a better foundation for our clubs on the ground where integration needs to work," Grindel said.
Despite criticism of his person after the World Cup and the <0xC3><0x96>zil affair, he wants to run for the post of DFB president again next year.
"I'm doing my job and trying to make it as good as it is," Grindel said.
New Year's Eve Builds Three Accidents in Three Hours
Coburg/Rödental - According to police, the 75-year-old caused the accidents on Friday between 10 a.m. and 1 p.m.
At first, the 75-year-old driver was approached by a lady at the red light in the Lauterhöhe area.
She informed the pensioner that she was driving against her car.
There was no personnel exchange, however, as the 75-year-old couldn’t find the lady in the parking lot anymore.
A short time later, the police received a telephone message about a driver who had come off the road and drove towards a lead post.
At that point, the man did not want the police on the spot and then drove away.
Then the red-talker drove home.
However, the pensioner has tried himself in his place of residence, where he has lived for decades, and when he turned a construction vehicle.
Eventually, the police were able to find and stop him.
His car was clearly damaged in an accident.
The 75-year-old made a terrible impression and couldn’t remember much more.
The damage is approximately 1300 euros.
Moorbrand in Meppen: Almost 1,000 employees are still in operation.
About four weeks after the outbreak of the Moor fire at a federal defence facility in Emsland, 980 personnel are still employed in the eradication work.
This was reported by the Federal Army on Sunday.
As the situation continued to develop steadily according to a spokesperson, the last time 70 volunteers were withdrawn.
A further reduction in the number of deployed forces is planned, it says.
On the night of Sunday, an earthly fire had been discovered and extinguished.
Last week, the disaster was lifted, which was called off well a week earlier on September 21, because it was feared that the flames would endanger forests and settlements adjoining by wind and lightning.
On Thursday, it was said that an overrun of the fire on neighbouring communities no longer threatens.
Temporarily, more than 1,500 personnel on site tried to get the big fire under control.
The Air Force continues to support the work on the Federal Defence Forces site near Meppen with a transport helicopter.
There are also reconnaissance flights with German Army drones.
On October 2 and 5, according to the Federal Army, intelligence flights with "Tornados" are also planned again.
The fire was triggered by test rockets fired by Airbus technicians.
The smoke flag of the Moorbrand was occasionally pulled up to a hundred kilometers across the northwest of Germany to Bremen.
On Monday, the Bundeswehr wants to set up a contact point that receives reports of damage.
First claims for damages had already been announced by hoteliers and holiday home owners.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Johannes Kahrs (SPD, r) and his husband Christoph Rohde leave the main church of St. Catherine in Hamburg after their wedding.
Almost exactly a year after the entry into force of the marriage for all, the politician married his long-time friend in Hamburg.
The two have been a couple for 25 years.
Hamburg - Almost exactly a year after the marriage came into force for all, SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his long-time friend Christoph Rohde.
The two of them gave their word in Hamburg on Saturday.
A registered life partnership had not come into question for her, Kahrs had previously told the "Image" newspaper.
When we get married, right.
He has been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is a spokesperson for the fiscal policy of the SPD-Bundestag faction and one of the speakers of the Seeheimer Kreis, the conservative SPD wing.
In the debate in the Bundestag on the opening of marriage for homosexuals, Kahrs had raised an angry eye on June 30, 2017.
He had accused Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of having "stolen" on the issue.
"That was your Schabowski moment," he said in reference to the accidental announcement of the GDR border opening by Günter Schabowski.
As of October 1, 2017, same-sex couples can marry just like heterosexuals.
Previously, they had been able to register their life partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, such as adoption law.
Referendum in Macedonia on New State Names Begins
In Macedonia, the eagerly awaited referendum on a new name for this small Balkan state has begun.
About 1.8 million voters are expected to decide whether their state should be called North Macedonia in the future.
This is due to its northern province of the same name, neighbouring Greece.
For nearly three decades, Athens had blocked any approach from Skopje to the EU and NATO.
If the citizens vote yes, they will also give the start for the western integration of their country.
Elie Wiesel - The Author Who Saves the Shoah from Forgetting
The Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel would have turned 90 years old on September 30.
The 1986 Nobel Peace Prize laureate died in 2016 in the United States, leaving behind a work that preserves the horrors of the Shoah for the afterlife.
Switzerland launches electronic register for organ donors
The register is intended to facilitate organ donations and relieve relatives in stressful situations.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs can only continue to be removed with express consent, emphasizes Swisstransplant.
(dpa) Switzerland will launch an electronic register for organ donors on Monday.
This should facilitate organ donation and relieve relatives in stressful situations.
People who want to make their organs available in the event of death can register there.
Your wishes can then be retrieved if Swisstransplant is needed.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs can continue to be removed only with express consent, as in Germany, Swisstransplant emphasizes.
It is estimated that 15 percent of Swiss people have a donor card, says Franz Immer, director of the Swisstransplant Foundation.
But in only five percent of cases, a card is found at the crucial moment with potential donors.
In more than 60 percent of conversations, relatives do not know the desire of the deceased.
"You then have to decide in the sense of the deceased, which is often very burdensome," says Always.
A similar registration system already exists in the United Kingdom.
In Germany, there are considerations to storing information about possible organ donation on the health insurance card, says the spokeswoman of the Federal Center for Health Enlightenment, Marita Völker-Albert.
"There is no register in which people can file their wishes - for or against organ donation," she says.
Federal Health Minister Jens Spahn has advocated a new regulation of organ donation.
According to his proposal, everyone would first be considered an organ donor, unless he or his family objected.
Among other things, the Catholic Church rejects this.
14-year-old student is world champion in head-to-head racing
The 14-year-old student Tomohiro Iseda from Japan is a world champion in head-to-head racing.
At the weekend in Wolfsburg, he fought against 39 opponents.
Martina Flamme-Jasper of the Science Museum of Phaeno, the venue of the competition, said on Sunday.
The 16-year-old Wenzel Gruß from Germany came in third.
The youngest participant in the World Cup was a 12-year-old Japanese student, the oldest being a 74-year-old pensioner from France, as Chief Arbitrator Ralf Laue said.
The computer science professor from Zwickau (Saxony) organizes the competition every two years.
Previous tasks were, for example: 14,130 214 x 17,981,822 or 57,809,355 <0x2B> 28 x 16,448,333.
As spectators were not allowed, there was a show on Saturday afternoon, where participants entered against guests from the audience with a calculator.
Wenzel Gruß from Lastrup demonstrated how he keeps a ball in the air when calculating.
He is one of seven Germans in the competition.
A total of 82 candidates from more than 20 countries tried to qualify for the competition.
Greetings was there two years ago when the 14-year-old was in Bielefeld.
With terms like super brain, genius or wonder child, organizers can start with little.
"Headstroke can be trained," he said.
Many participants practiced several hours a day.
In India or Singapore, there are even stage-oriented competitor competitions.
The disciplines include, for example, the square root drawing of six-digit numbers.
When calculating versatility, candidates are given surprise tasks, for which they have to quickly find a solution strategy.
The Germans also have good chances here, said the main referee.
Otherwise, Asians are often advantageous, because there, already in early childhood, head calculators are learned more intensively and with other, effective methods.
Intrusive Appeal: Video with Naked Serena Williams: It's About Breast Cancer Early Detection
Tennis-Ass Serena Williams stands out from her sentimental and sensitive side.
With this video, the 37-year-old wants to point out breast cancer and be strong for early detection.
It is about life and death, but also about courage and enlightenment.
Serena Williams sings up without the song "I Touch Myself" from the group "The Divinyls" - only her hands hide their most intimate places.
Singer Chrissy Amphlett has died.
The emotional video is part of the “I Touch Myself” project, which deals with breast cancer early detection that can save lives.
Serena Williams would have died almost a year ago.
At the birth of her daughter Alexis Olympia, there were complications.
An emergency operation has been launched to save the baby’s life.
In a subsequent CT, blood clots in Serena’s lungs were then detected.
Just in time...
Government wants to ban more extremist symbols
Vienna - The federal government is planning a clear extension of the ban on the use of extremist symbols.
Next week, the turquoise-blue coalition will send a corresponding bill to the so-called "symbol law" in consideration.
This will significantly increase the number of terrorist or comparable groups that are covered by the ban.
Polar cold air brings snow to the mountains in the west
Mrs. Holle is shaking out her beds in the West for the first time next week: Polare cold air reaches Vorarlberg, North Tyrol and Salzburg on Monday.
According to meteorologists at the Central Meteorology and Geodynamics Institute (ZAMG), the snowfall limit drops to 1,500 to 1,200 meters at the beginning of the week - in narrow valleys it could snow down to about 1,000 meters at a strong intensity, it said.
From the Bregenzerwald to the Hohe Tauern, snowfall of 20 to 40 centimetres above 2,000 metres can be expected.
On higher pass roads (Arlbergpass, Timmelsjoch, Bieler Höhe, Brennerpass, Gerlospass, Felbertauern, Großglockner Hochalpenstraße) the road conditions become wintery.
Farmers are allowed to start the annual knick care on Monday
Farmers in Schleswig-Holstein are allowed to start their annual knick-care on Monday.
The unique "green walls" in Germany have been characterising the landscape of the wooded Bundesland for about 200 years.
The up to five meters wide tree and moss hedges are "forest set" and for many animals and plants the last retreats.
Knicks connect as corridors scattered habitats, through which the exchange of organisms can still function, said the managing director of the Nature Conservation Association of Germany (NABU) in Schleswig-Holstein, Ingo Ludwigowski.
Knicks are living fences
The Knicks were caught by order of King Christian VI of Denmark in 1766, who ruled over Schleswig-Holstein.
The "living fences" were not only field constraints and cattle fences, they also supplied the farmers with firewood and beams for their crafts houses.
From that time also comes his name "Knick": the dense, intertwined boundaries were developed by "knitting" the branches.
Today, between the North Sea and the Baltic Sea, about 45,000 kilometres of hedges extend, giving the image of an oil-rich, diversely structured landscape.
According to the NABU, they are now used by around 7,000 animal species as substitute habitats.
Up to 1,800 different species could live within a kilometer of Knick and breed up to 30 pairs of birds.
However, its ecologically important function can only be fulfilled if it is properly cared for in winter.
Otherwise, it will germinate to a light tree line, which, in addition to the diversity of species, also undermines the wind protection effect, said Ludwigowski.
Knick care, according to the Ministry of Agriculture, may only be carried out outside the breeding period from October to March.
After the tsunami on Sulawesi Indonesian speaks about the situation on the spot
The local Radika Pinto describes the situation on the island of Sulawesi after the earthquakes and tsunami in an interview with the Editorial Network Deutschland (RND):
Were you there during the tsunami?
No, I was just in Jakarta on the island of Java at the time.
When the earthquakes were, my wife called me, she was in Palu.
When I learned of the tsunami, I immediately made my way back to Sulawesi.
I arrived there on Sunday morning because I had to drive more than 20 hours after a flight because the airport on Palu was closed at the time.
What is the situation on the island now?
The national government has reopened the airport so that auxiliary goods can also be flown in.
When I arrived, I saw the houses on the coast, all of which were completely destroyed.
Our "World Vision" office has also been destroyed, but we have temporarily set up something where we have also housed other people.
Where are the people living in Sulawesi now?
Many have run to surrounding hills, where they still endure for fear of another tsunami and earthquake and where they have no access to water and food.
Some are standing in front of their houses, there are still aftershocks.
Because many grocery stores and also the gas stations are completely closed, people in some cases steal food and gasoline.
The public service is completely down, the national government is helping out.
A prison has also been destroyed, the detainees are partly free to run around, and the search for them is difficult.
There are still many bodies around, many people have not yet been found and are missing.
How is the communication and information supply on the island?
At the moment we have mobile reception, but previously this did not work and we have received information only via radio.
Many people are still looking for their children, neighbors and other people from whom they do not know whether they live and where they stay because people were not at home during the earthquakes, but for example on the road to work.
The tsunami warning system did not work properly.
Do you have information about this?
We don’t know the reasons, but when the warning came, many thought, “Okay, no tsunami” – and then he came.
In other regions that were not hit by the tsunami, there was misinformation that a tsunami hit the region and they ran into the surrounding mountains.
Is an island like Sulawesi on the Pacific Ring of Fire not prepared for earthquakes?
There are earthquakes every day, but this was the worst.
We usually know how we react to earthquakes and also train evacuations.
But the entire infrastructure has collapsed, the earthquake has hit a lot of people.
Muscle injuries against Werder: VfB must give up Aogo and Donis for a long time
Anastasios Donis and Dennis Aogo will miss VfB Stuttgart with severe muscle injuries for a long time.
Aogo pulled a muscle fiber tear in the back of his left thigh in the 2-1 against Werder Bremen on Saturday, the Bundesliga footballer said on Sunday.
In Donis, the doctors diagnosed a muscle bundle crack in the thigh.
Both players are definitely not an option against Hanover 96 on Saturday and will probably miss matches even after the next national game break.
The VfB Stuttgart did not give out a forecast for the downtime.
A muscle bundle rupture usually heals within six to eight weeks, a muscle fiber rupture usually heals a little faster.
Triumph of Hyperrealism at the San Sebastian Film Festival
San Sebasti<0xC3><0xA1>n - With the San Sebasti<0xC3><0xA1>n Film Festival, the festivals of the most prestigious European festivals close each year.
All the songs on the cinema can be summed up in spite: 2018 was a remarkable year for the film.

On Sunday morning, the Olching Fire Department tried to capture an injured duck.
The action, however, lasted for some time.
There was even a boat in use.
Olching - Walkers on Lake Olching fell on a white, injured duck on Sunday morning.
She stopped in the area of the water station.
To help the animal, the passers-by called the police and the fire department.
However, the first attempts to catch the duck went wrong.
Despite the injury, she was able to evade the operational forces again and again.
In the end, she fled to the lake.
With a rescue boat, the firefighter was able to circle the animal and push it back to land, where it was then inserted into a transport box after almost an hour by a firefighter with a hearty handle.
The injured duck was then taken to the animal clinic of the LMU in Oberschleißheim.
But according to first estimates, their chances of survival are rather low.
Biathlete Julian Eberhard won a World Cup Medal
In fourth place at Olympia, biathlete Julian Eberhard was in the stomach for a long time.
In the coming winter, the Saalfeldener wants to pick up the missing precious metal at the World Cup in <0xC3><0x96>stersund.
The last shot cost the 31-year-old in Pyeongchang’s Olympic print the medal near to grab.
In the end, seven tenths of a second were missing on bronze.
“I consciously took the time to process this,” says Eberhard at the opening of the MyGym gym in his hometown of Saalfelden.
A medal was the goal, I was in top form, but it just didn’t want to be.
The more motivated Pinzgauer is to pick up the missing precious metal in the new season: "The goal can only be to come back to a major event with the constitution, to win something.
At some point, you will have to strike.
The WM-Loipe in <0xC3><0x96>stersund (SWE) is Eberhard: "I have already closed the track to the heart", he remembers with joy his fourth World Cup place in the single race last year.
Immediately after Olympia, he celebrated the only single victory for Austria in the last World Cup winter in the mass-start competition of Kontiolahti (FIN).
With the season he ran in Oslo (NOR) in second place.
Brett Kavanaugh: FBI investigation in turbo-tempo
The time is extremely short and the number of interviews planned is very limited.
With an FBI investigation at a turbo-tempo, the Republicans in the U.S. Senate want to secure the slender majority for the controversial judge candidate Brett Kavanaugh on grounds of necessity.
President Donald Trump has set a deadline for investigators until Friday to clarify the alleged incidents that are more than 30 years away.
The latest twist in the drama about Kavanaugh’s vocation accompanied by a cultural struggle had been triggered on Friday.
After an eight-hour hearing of Kavanaugh and the first prosecutor, Christine Blasey Ford, in the course of which the lawyer issued angry tirades against the opposition Democrats, the Senate Judiciary Committee should pave the way for the final confirmation of the U.S. Supreme Court Justice.
The majority of Republicans seemed secure when Senator Jeff Flake suddenly declared against his original announcement that he would agree, but demanded an FBI investigation.
After tumultuous scenes, his party friends agreed.
President Trump, who had called Thursday's heavy speeches "beshissement," initially contained further attacks on women and spoke on the contrary of "happiness in misfortune."
In this way, the last doubts could be cleared, he said.
Later, in an election campaign, Trump vehemently attacked the Democrats because they rejected Kavanaugh: “They are trying to block and destroy.”
Trump orders FBI investigation into Kavanaugh case
The White House has also severely limited the powers of the investigators.
One will investigate the known allegations of two women, no more, a government official told the Wall Street Journal: "They don't go on a fishing trip."
According to the New York Times, only four witnesses will be heard.
The mobile radar device installed in a "civil vehicle" of the municipality of Ried to monitor the speed limit is stationed on the garden road, according to the municipality from Monday, October 1.
There is also the Federal School Center.
The municipality also operates several fixedly installed radar boxes.
FC Schalke 04 after victory against Mainz: You have felt the fear
Trainers Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 celebrated their first win of the season against Mainz.
The relief on Schalke is great after the first season victory.
However, the time factor also played a role against Mainz.
Gelsenkirchen - By now it is well known that Christian Heidel is a huge pessimist in football games.
That was no different in the home game against Mainz 05.
“I saw every ball in it.
And there were a lot of corners and a lot of balls in our penalty area," said the sports manager of Schalke 04 - and breathed.
In the end, the Königsblau was still able to bring the narrow 1-0 against the Rhine Hesse over time and thus the first victory of the season under the roof and compartment.
In fact, it could have happened differently.
After the lead by Alessandro Schöpf 11th the team of head coach Domenico Tedesco had given assurance: "In sum, the first half was good, both playful and from the press".
Don't actually create a head-to-head monster
“The last ten minutes have felt like two hours for me,” said Heidel, “if the team was only half as nervous as I was on the bench, I can understand that.”
The boys were afraid to give it out of their hands and therefore continued to retreat.
And defended with man and mouse against Mainz.
To save the first three counts of the season.
"We all have a huge stone from the heart," said Schöpf, who had no insignificant part in it with his headball hit: "I'm actually the worst headball player in the men's team."
In the end, only victory counts.
The relief was felt throughout the arena, of course also at Tedesco.
“We wanted to start with pressure in the initial phase and make a firework out of it,” Schalke’s chief coach said.
The victory was important.
Finally, we can look forward to a few hours.
I am very, very happy for the team and the fans.
We played intelligently, calmly and courageously, so we have to approach games over 90 minutes
Perhaps the biggest shortcoming of the afternoon: Royal Blue missed it, more likely to worry about clearer conditions.
The possibilities for this were, for example, by the strong Yevhen Konpplyanka, who twice hit the latte 59/72 or Amine Harit 62.
"Then it wouldn't have been a sitter victory," Tedesco said: "You've already felt the fear a little bit."
So I'm glad we won.
He was not the only scoundrel.
Fischbachau: Smoke column in the Leitzachtal 2 km visible
The smoke was not to be missed.
From about two kilometers away, a hiker in the Leitzachtal on Sunday observed a fire at about 1.30 p.m.
Now the police are investigating.
Fischbachau - The cause was soon discovered by police and firefighters: an unknown man had burned garbage on a two-square-meter area on Gschwendner Berg.
According to police, it had the appearance that he had been monitoring the fire for a long time, but then left the glut unattended.
And that’s near the forest.
30 Fischbacher firefighters were engaged in dismantling and deletion.
The police are now investigating the cause of the fire.
Prof. Dr. Aladdin El-Mafaalani discusses integration: A discussion at eye level
In front of them is the author, Professor Dr. Aladdin El-Mafaalani.
He has been followed repeatedly by the invitation of Ernst Reiling and Lore Hauschild.
"I have been tasked with bringing interesting people to Greven for many years," explains the founder and chairman of the "Regenfelder Meeting" - that association that cooperates with the "Cultural Policy" Alliance in the orientation of the evening.
El-Mafaalani enters the reading very slowly, describes the writing process of the book, talks about how difficult it was to explain the subject in an understandable way.
With a lot of gestures, solid numbers and some joke, he brings the audience closer to one of the most conflicting topics: migration and integration.
Why, despite successful integration, are there increasing conflicts?
The Syrian author uses the question of a metaphor to answer.
At one table sits the German society, at the cat table the migrants of the first generation.
Their children grow up in Germany and want to sit at the table.
The third generation of migrants was born in Germany, they always sat at the big table and now want to decide.
This leads to conflicts.
Therefore, it is crucial not whether one is politically organized to the right or left, but: “Am I for or against an open society?”
At first rather behave, then the discussion round starts to run more and more.
And there is a need for speech.
An Afghan refugee reports from his perspective, two teachers tell how they see successful or unsuccessful integration among students.
El-Mafaalani presents, not on stage, a symbol for the discussion: she is on eye level.
The sociology professor does not insist on his opinion, stressing that he is talking about the average, not about individual classrooms.
He is pleased that there is interest in the topic, because “only when we understand what the problem is, we can find solutions,” says El-Mafaalani.
Even during the subsequent signing hour, he still has an open ear for the questions of the guests and also in the foyer, with prepared Kurdish specialties, was further discussed intensively.
Basketball: Bonn and Gießen win start-up games
The Gießen 46ers and the Telekom Basketball Bonn have finished the first day of the Basketball Bundesliga (BBL) with a home and away win.
Gießen scored in a hard-fought match in his own hall with 91:84 (43:46) against the Central German BC.
The ambitious Bonners won at BG Göttingen with 86:79 (49:47).
The first table leader of the season is Alba Berlin after the 112:55 Gala on Saturday against Science City Jena.
At the start of the new season, German champions Bayern Munich and former series champion Brose Bamberg had much more effort.
Munich scored 83:77 on Friday at ratiopharm Ulm, Bamberg won the Frankenderby at s.Oliver Würzburg with 84:80 on Saturday.
Building in Landsham: 100 applications for 20 plots
The need is apparently huge: over 100 interested parties have applied for the purchase of one of the land in Landsham-Süd.
The municipality of Pliening has sold the first land in the new-build area of Landsham-Süd on the free market.
Mayor Roland Frick said that.
In addition, the application phase for those 20 plots of land that the municipality offers at more favourable terms and prices - similar to the previous local model - has been completed.
More than 100 applications were received, according to Frick.
"Currently, the documents are being examined" regarding the application criteria, completeness and accuracy.
According to the Mayor of Plieninger, the goal is to have the applicants’ rankings for the 20 plots by the end of the year and to submit them to the municipal council.
After that, the assignment can be done.
A total of 50 plots of land for single and double houses will be created on the land in the south of Landsham, as well as four areas for multi-family houses with an estimated eight residential units each.
The development is now almost complete and the roads and roads should be asphalted as soon as possible.
A single plot as well as two of the multi-family houses belong to a private person, the rest of the municipality of Pliening.
It sells the majority on the free market, 20 plots of land in a socially compatible model.
According to Frick, the two multi-family houses of the municipality are to be built as affordable living space.
With a total of 16 free state-funded, income-oriented apartments.
Space for 200 people
It is estimated that around 200 people will be living in the new area of Landsham-Süd.
Not only that: Now, at the beginning of October, according to Frick, there is the start for the new construction of a children’s day care facility.
It will house three kindergarten and three cradle groups as well as a multipurpose room.
The opening is scheduled for September 2019, the start of the next kindergarten year.
This is how Schalkes Naldo succeeds in "big sport" on the bench
For the third time in a row not in the starting line-up: Naldo thanks Schalke coach Domenico Tedesco.
Gelsenkirchen - After Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues had been sitting on the bench for the third time in a row not in the Schalke starter, but on the exchange bench, the understanding of many people would have been great if the almost two-metre-long Brazilian had spoken the frustration of the soul so correctly.
However, when the Schalke players gathered as usual in the midfield after the 1-0 win over FSV Mainz 05 and thanked head coach Domenico Tedesco for all his pros, the 36-year-old, whom they all called Naldo for the sake of simplicity, turned in and said, "We have to!
"It was very emotional, it was a great sport," Tedesco later said of the reaction of his vice captain, who, despite his renewed reservist presence, did not have any grudges.
Probably, Naldo, who was celebrated as the best chess player last season, knows that he didn’t actually get on the line with his coach – but gets a break for good reasons.
A reason called "load control".
It wasn’t easy to tell him that.
“It wasn’t easy to tell him that, I’m telling you quite honestly,” Tedesco said of the moment when he told Naldo that he was not in the starting lineup.
He is an important player, he is an important person.
But it’s always about the thing, it’s about the club,” Tedesco said.
Naldo has played 90 minutes against Bayern and Porto.
He's 36 years old.
It is important that at the moment everyone can sniff through.
And that we all keep in the boat," Tedesco explained the rotation, which last caught Naldo.
And the Brazilian responded to that with the wisdom of his advanced age: by also proving himself on the bench as an exemplary team player.
The mood in Austria’s industry continued to accelerate its downhill journey compared to the eurozone in August.
The Purchasing Manager Index (PMI) stood at a 37-month low with 46.7 points.
Across Europe, Austria still has the third-best mood behind Ireland and the Netherlands, the Markit Institute said on Monday on its survey of 3,000 companies.
Unlike in Austria, the PMI of the euro zone rose by 1.1 points to 45.1 points, the index is still the 13th consecutive month under the 50-digit mark, which indicates growth.
Ireland’s only industry broke this threshold by 50.9 points in August.
The final score was the Greeks (42.1 points).
In Germany, France and Spain, the mood barometer declined, but it was slower than in the previous months.
In Spain, the index reached its highest level since March with 44.0 points.
“The slightly weakened valley ride could mean that the worst has survived,” said Markit economist Rob Dobson.
However, the industry remains, at least in the third quarter, the number one growth brake.
A rapid return to the growth zone is not in sight: export orders in the euro area have fallen as strongly as since November 2011.
The companies therefore closed down posts for the seventh month in a row.
In China, industrial production declined more than initially assumed in August.
The mood barometer dropped from 49.3 points in the previous month to 47.6 points.
Experts had initially expected 47.8 points.
The Purchasing Manager Index is based on representative surveys of 3,000 European industrial companies.
Among other things, developments in sales, employment, stocks and prices are collected.
Tuchel's PSG team wins eighth league game
29. September 2018 at 19:45
With Paris Saint-Germain in the French football championship, Nice coach Thomas Tuchel continues from victory to victory.
At the OGC Nice, the defending champion won thanks to two hits by Superstar Neymar with 3:0 (1:0) and was thus successful in the eighth league game.
Olympique Lyon in France 82 years ago had put such a good start into the playing time.
The Brazilian Neymar brought PSG to the lead after 22 minutes and made the finals in the aftermatch.
Christopher Nkunku (46.) took the 2-0 lead.
With this, Paris also managed the general rehearsal for the groundbreaking second Champions League group game against Red Star Belgrade on Wednesday.
To kick off the royal class, Tuchel's team had to take the only obligatory game defeat so far this season at 2:3 in Liverpool.
